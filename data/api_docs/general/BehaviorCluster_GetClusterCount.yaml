  class: BehaviorCluster
  method: GetClusterCount
  signature: uint32_t BehaviorCluster::GetClusterCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of behavior clusters associated with the current
    object.
  description: The GetClusterCount method retrieves the count of behavior clusters
    that are currently active or registered within the context of the BehaviorCluster
    class instance. This method is typically used in AI-driven systems where multiple
    behavioral states or groups need to be tracked and managed. The returned value
    represents a numeric identifier for how many distinct clusters exist, which can
    be useful for decision-making processes, resource allocation, or debugging purposes.
    There are no specific preconditions required for calling this method; it should
    safely return the cluster count regardless of internal state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32_t value representing the total number of behavior clusters. If
    no clusters exist, the method returns zero.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32_t clusterCount = behaviorCluster->GetClusterCount();\nif (clusterCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with logic that depends on having clusters\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Active clusters: %u\", clusterCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented as a simple accessor function and should
    have minimal performance impact. It is thread-safe if the underlying data structure
    is properly synchronized, but developers should verify that concurrent access
    to the cluster list does not introduce race conditions in their specific use case.
