documentation:
  brief: Destroys an LfgGroupData instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the LfgGroupData class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the instance. In the
    context of TrinityCore's LFG (Looking for Group) system, this method ensures that
    group data structures are properly deallocated when a group is disbanded or removed
    from the system. It performs necessary cleanup operations such as releasing references
    to players, clearing internal data structures, and ensuring no memory leaks occur
    during the destruction of LFG group information. This destructor is automatically
    invoked when an LfgGroupData object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.

  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of LfgGroupData instance
    code: "void CleanupLfgGroup()\n{\n    LfgGroupData* groupData = new LfgGroupData();\n\
      \    // ... use groupData ...\n    delete groupData; // Destructor is automatically\
      \ called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called when an object goes out of scope or is
    explicitly deleted. Developers should not manually invoke destructors unless performing
    low-level memory management. The LfgGroupData class likely manages internal references
    to player data and group state, so proper destruction ensures no dangling pointers
    or resource leaks occur in the LFG subsystem.
