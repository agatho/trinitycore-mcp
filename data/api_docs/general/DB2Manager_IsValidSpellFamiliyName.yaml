  class: DB2Manager
  method: IsValidSpellFamiliyName
  signature: bool DB2Manager::IsValidSpellFamiliyName(int family)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether the provided spell family ID corresponds to a valid spell
    family name in the database.
  description: The IsValidSpellFamiliyName method checks if the given spell family
    identifier is recognized within the TrinityCore database system. This validation
    ensures that the spell family ID maps to an actual defined spell family, which
    is crucial for proper spell handling and categorization in World of Warcraft mechanics.
    The method typically performs a lookup against internal DB2 data structures containing
    spell family definitions. It's commonly used during spell loading or validation
    phases to prevent invalid spell family references from being processed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the provided spell family ID corresponds to a valid spell
    family name defined in the database; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "if (sDB2Manager->IsValidSpellFamiliyName(15)) {\n    // Spell family ID\
      \ 15 is valid\n    printf(\"Valid spell family\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Spell\
      \ family ID 15 is not recognized\n    printf(\"Invalid spell family\\n\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal DB2 table lookups and may involve cached
    data structures for performance. It's important to note that spell family IDs
    are used extensively in spell definitions, aura effects, and talent trees within
    TrinityCore.
