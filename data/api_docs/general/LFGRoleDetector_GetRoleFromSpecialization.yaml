  class: LFGRoleDetector
  method: GetRoleFromSpecialization
  signature: uint8 LFGRoleDetector::GetRoleFromSpecialization(Player * player, uint32
    specId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the role associated with a player's specialization for LFG purposes.
  description: The GetRoleFromSpecialization method maps a player's active specialization
    ID to a corresponding role identifier used in the Looking For Group (LFG) system.
    This mapping is essential for grouping players with complementary roles, such
    as tanks, healers, and damage dealers, based on their class specializations. The
    method takes into account the current spec of the player and returns an appropriate
    role code that aligns with World of Warcraft's LFG role definitions. It is typically
    used during LFG queue processing to ensure proper group composition.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose specialization role needs to be
      determined. Must not be null.
  - name: specId
    description: The unique identifier of the player's active specialization. This
      value corresponds to the ID used in the game's specialization database.
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the LFG role associated with the given
    specialization. Possible values are typically 1 (Tank), 2 (Healer), or 3 (Damage
    Dealer). Returns 0 if no valid mapping is found for the provided specId.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in LFG Context
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized\nuint32 specId =\
      \ player->GetUInt32Value(PLAYER_FIELD_CURRENT_SPEC_ID);\nuint8 role = LFGRoleDetector::GetRoleFromSpecialization(player,\
      \ specId);\nif (role == 1) {\n    // Player is a tank\n} else if (role == 2)\
      \ {\n    // Player is a healer\n} else if (role == 3) {\n    // Player is a\
      \ damage dealer\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Role Assignment for Group Matching
    code: "void AssignPlayerToLFGGroup(Player* player, uint32 specId) {\n    uint8\
      \ role = LFGRoleDetector::GetRoleFromSpecialization(player, specId);\n    switch\
      \ (role) {\n        case 1:\n            // Assign to tank slot\n          \
      \  break;\n        case 2:\n            // Assign to healer slot\n         \
      \   break;\n        case 3:\n            // Assign to DPS slot\n           \
      \ break;\n        default:\n            // Handle unknown role\n           \
      \ break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal mappings between specialization IDs and LFG
    roles. The implementation may vary depending on the expansion level and class-specific
    role definitions. It is recommended to validate the returned role value before
    using it in group assignment logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Also, be aware that specId should correspond to a valid specialization;
    otherwise, the method may return an unexpected or invalid role code.
