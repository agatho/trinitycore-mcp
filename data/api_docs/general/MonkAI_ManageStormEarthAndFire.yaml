documentation:
  brief: Manages the Storm, Earth, and Fire ability for the Monk AI, handling its
    casting logic and cooldowns.
  description: The ManageStormEarthAndFire method is responsible for controlling the
    core ability of the Monk class in the TrinityCore AI system. This method evaluates
    whether the Storm, Earth, and Fire ability should be cast based on various conditions
    such as player state, mana availability, target status, and cooldown timers. It
    ensures that the ability is used efficiently within the game's mechanics, adhering
    to the rules of the Monk's combat rotation. The method integrates with the broader
    AI decision-making framework to optimize spell usage for maximum damage or utility
    depending on the situation.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    // Other AI logic...\n    if (me->GetVictim())\n\
      \        MonkAI* monkAI = dynamic_cast<MonkAI*>(me->GetAI());\n        if (monkAI)\n\
      \            monkAI->ManageStormEarthAndFire();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI's update loop and should be
    invoked only when the AI has an active target. It assumes that the AI object has
    been properly initialized with a valid Monk class instance. The method does not
    directly handle spell casting but rather determines if it's appropriate to do
    so.
  warnings: Do not call this method without verifying that the AI unit is a valid
    Monk; improper usage may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the
    AI is in a combat state before invoking this method, as it relies on target and
    player status checks.
