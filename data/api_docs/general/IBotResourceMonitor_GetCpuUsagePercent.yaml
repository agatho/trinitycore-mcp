  class: IBotResourceMonitor
  method: GetCpuUsagePercent
  signature: float IBotResourceMonitor::GetCpuUsagePercent() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current CPU usage percentage of the bot resource monitor.
  description: The GetCpuUsagePercent method returns a floating-point value representing
    the current CPU utilization percentage of the bot's resource monitoring system.
    This value is typically used to track performance metrics and ensure that the
    bot's operations do not exceed predefined CPU thresholds. The method provides
    real-time data about how much processing power the bot is consuming at any given
    moment, which can be crucial for maintaining optimal server performance and preventing
    resource exhaustion. The returned value is usually between 0.0 and 100.0, where
    0.0 indicates no CPU usage and 100.0 represents full CPU utilization.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current CPU usage percentage. Values typically
    range from 0.0 (no usage) to 100.0 (full utilization). The method may return negative
    values in error conditions or when the monitoring system is not initialized properly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic CPU Usage Monitoring
    code: "float cpuUsage = botResourceMonitor->GetCpuUsagePercent();\nif (cpuUsage\
      \ > 80.0f)\n{\n    // Alert or take action if CPU usage exceeds threshold\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"High CPU usage detected: %.2f%%\", cpuUsage);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Continuous Monitoring with Logging
    code: "void MonitorBotPerformance()\n{\n    while (true)\n    {\n        float\
      \ cpu = botResourceMonitor->GetCpuUsagePercent();\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Bot CPU Usage: %.1f%%\", cpu);\n        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(5));\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented using system-level APIs to query current
    process CPU usage. The implementation may vary depending on the operating system
    and platform-specific capabilities. For accurate readings, it's recommended to
    call this method periodically rather than in high-frequency loops to avoid performance
    overhead.
  warnings: The returned value represents instantaneous CPU usage which can fluctuate
    rapidly. For trend analysis or decision-making, consider averaging multiple readings
    over time rather than relying on single measurements. In some environments, especially
    virtualized or containerized setups, CPU usage reporting may be less accurate
    due to resource sharing and virtualization overhead.
