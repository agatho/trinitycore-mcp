  class: MonkAI
  method: RecordResourceConsumption
  signature: void MonkAI::RecordResourceConsumption(int chi, int energy)
documentation:
  brief: Records the consumption of chi and energy resources for a Monk AI.
  description: The RecordResourceConsumption method is used to track and log the amount
    of chi and energy consumed by a Monk AI during gameplay. This method is typically
    invoked when the AI performs actions that require resource expenditure, such as
    casting spells or using abilities. It updates internal tracking mechanisms within
    the MonkAI class to maintain accurate resource state information for decision-making
    processes and performance analysis. The method does not return any value but modifies
    the internal state of the AI instance.
  parameters:
  - name: chi
    description: The amount of chi consumed during the action. Must be a non-negative
      integer representing the chi cost of the ability or spell used.
  - name: energy
    description: The amount of energy consumed during the action. Must be a non-negative
      integer representing the energy cost of the ability or spell used.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Consumption Recording
    code: 'MonkAI* ai = ...;

      ai->RecordResourceConsumption(2, 5); // Consumed 2 chi and 5 energy'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Resource Consumption After Spell Cast
    code: "if (spell->GetSpellInfo()->ManaCost > 0)\n{\n    ai->RecordResourceConsumption(0,\
      \ spell->GetSpellInfo()->ManaCost);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called immediately after an AI action that consumes
    resources to ensure accurate tracking. The implementation likely updates internal
    counters or logs for resource usage statistics.
  warnings: Ensure that the chi and energy values passed are non-negative integers;
    negative values may cause unexpected behavior in resource tracking logic.
