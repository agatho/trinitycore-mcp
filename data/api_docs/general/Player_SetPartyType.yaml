  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore during group creation
    or when changing group types. It affects how players are positioned within the
    game world and impacts group mechanics such as loot distribution and raid instance
    management.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect group positioning, potentially
    causing issues with group mechanics like loot distribution or instance management.
    Care should be taken when setting group types to avoid conflicts with existing
    group structures.
