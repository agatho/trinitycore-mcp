  method: GetId
  signature: int Guild::GetId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the guild.
  description: The GetId method retrieves the unique integer identifier assigned to
    a guild within the TrinityCore database. This ID is used internally by the game
    engine to reference specific guilds and is typically used in database queries,
    guild-related operations, and when communicating with the client. The returned
    value corresponds to the GuildId field in the `guild` table of the World of Warcraft
    database schema. This method is read-only and does not modify any internal state
    of the guild object.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique identifier (ID) of the guild. This ID
    is a positive integer that uniquely identifies this guild in the game world and
    is typically used for database lookups and internal references.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Guild* myGuild = sGuildMgr->GetGuildById(guildId);\nif (myGuild)\n{\n \
      \   int guildIdentifier = myGuild->GetId();\n    printf(\"Guild ID: %d\\n\"\
      , guildIdentifier);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Database Query
    code: "uint32 guildId = player->GetGuild()->GetId();\nQueryResult result = CharacterDatabase.Query(\"\
      SELECT name FROM guild_member WHERE guildid = {}\", guildId);\nif (result)\n\
      {\n    do\n    {\n        Field* fields = result->Fetch();\n        std::string\
      \ memberName = fields[0].GetString();\n        // Process member data\n    }\
      \ while (result->NextRow());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The guild ID returned by this method is assigned upon guild creation and
    remains constant throughout the guild's existence. It is recommended to cache
    this value if it will be used multiple times within a single operation to avoid
    repeated calls to the method.
