  method: GetQuestMenu
  signature: QuestMenu & PlayerMenu::GetQuestMenu()
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the player's quest menu instance for managing available
    quests.
  description: The GetQuestMenu method provides access to the PlayerMenu's internal
    QuestMenu object, which holds all active quests available to the player in the
    current interaction context. This method is typically used when a player interacts
    with an NPC or quest-giver object to retrieve and display the list of available
    quests. The returned reference allows direct manipulation of the quest menu items,
    including adding, removing, or modifying quest entries. The QuestMenu instance
    is managed internally by the PlayerMenu class and should not be deleted or replaced
    directly by external code.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the internal QuestMenu object associated with this PlayerMenu
    instance. This reference can be used to access and modify the list of quests displayed
    to the player during NPC interactions.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing quest menu for NPC interaction
    code: "void HandleQuestGiverHello(Player* player, Creature* creature)\n{\n   \
      \ PlayerMenu* playerMenu = player->PlayerTalkClass;\n    QuestMenu& questMenu\
      \ = playerMenu->GetQuestMenu();\n    \n    // Iterate through available quests\n\
      \    for (uint32 i = 0; i < questMenu.GetMenuItemCount(); ++i)\n    {\n    \
      \    QuestMenuItem const& item = questMenu.GetItem(i);\n        // Process quest\
      \ item\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned QuestMenu reference is valid only while the PlayerMenu instance
    remains active. Modifications to the quest menu should be done carefully as they
    affect the player's interaction with NPCs. This method does not perform any validation
    or initialization of the quest menu - it simply returns a reference to the existing
    internal object.
  warnings: Direct modification of the returned QuestMenu reference can affect gameplay
    behavior and may cause unexpected results if not handled properly. Ensure that
    any changes made to the quest menu are consistent with game logic and player expectations.
    Avoid storing references to the QuestMenu beyond the scope where the PlayerMenu
    is valid.
