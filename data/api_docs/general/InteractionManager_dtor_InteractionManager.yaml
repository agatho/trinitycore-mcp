documentation:
  brief: Destroys an InteractionManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the InteractionManager class is responsible for
    releasing all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This
    includes cleaning up any active interactions, removing registered callbacks, and
    ensuring proper shutdown of internal data structures. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, this method ensures that when an InteractionManager
    is no longer needed (such as when a player logs out or a game object is destroyed),
    all associated interaction state is properly cleared to prevent memory leaks and
    maintain system stability. The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++
    runtime when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of InteractionManager
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    InteractionManager manager;\n    // ... use\
      \ manager ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when manager goes out\
      \ of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of InteractionManager
    code: 'InteractionManager* manager = new InteractionManager();

      // ... use manager ...

      delete manager; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing object
    lifetime. It is typically invoked automatically by the C++ runtime when objects
    go out of scope or are deleted. Developers should ensure that no external references
    to the manager exist before it is destroyed, as dangling pointers may cause undefined
    behavior.
