  signature: bool Condition::isLoaded() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the condition has been successfully loaded from database.
  description: The isLoaded method returns a boolean value indicating if the Condition
    object has been properly initialized with data from the database. This method
    is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework to verify that condition
    data has been correctly retrieved and parsed before the condition can be evaluated
    during game events or triggers. The method does not perform any database operations
    itself but simply checks an internal flag or state that indicates successful loading.
    It's commonly called before evaluating conditions to ensure data integrity and
    prevent accessing uninitialized memory.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the condition has been successfully loaded from the database and
    is ready for evaluation; false otherwise. This typically means the object was
    constructed with valid data or properly initialized through a load operation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check condition state
    code: "Condition* cond = new Condition();\nif (cond->isLoaded()) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with condition evaluation\n    bool result = cond->Evaluate();\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle unloaded condition\n    sLog->outError(\"Condition failed to\
      \ load properly\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using isLoaded in a condition manager context
    code: "class ConditionManager {\npublic:\n    bool ValidateConditions(std::vector<Condition*>&\
      \ conditions) {\n        for (auto& cond : conditions) {\n            if (!cond->isLoaded())\
      \ {\n                sLog->outError(\"Skipping unloaded condition at index %d\"\
      , &cond - &conditions[0]);\n                continue;\n            }\n     \
      \       // Process loaded conditions\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with Condition::LoadFromDB()
    or similar initialization methods. The internal state tracking for loading may
    be implemented using a private boolean member variable that gets set to true after
    successful database retrieval and parsing. It's important to note that even if
    isLoaded() returns true, the condition might still fail evaluation due to runtime
    conditions not matching the loaded criteria.
  warnings: Do not assume that a condition being loaded means it will always evaluate
    successfully. The isLoaded() method only verifies data presence, not logical validity
    or current game state relevance. Also, calling this method on an uninitialized
    Condition object may lead to undefined behavior if the internal loading flag isn't
    properly initialized.
