  class: PathfindingManager
  method: GetMaxNodes
  signature: uint32 PathfindingManager::GetMaxNodes() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum number of nodes that can be used in pathfinding calculations.
  description: The GetMaxNodes method retrieves the upper limit on the number of nodes
    that the PathfindingManager is configured to process during pathfinding operations.
    This value typically represents a safety threshold or configuration parameter
    that prevents excessive memory usage or performance degradation when calculating
    paths for NPCs or players. The returned value is often used internally by the
    pathfinding system to allocate memory and manage computational resources efficiently.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of nodes allowed in a single
    pathfinding operation. This value is typically a fixed configuration parameter
    that defines resource limits for pathfinding calculations.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Maximum Nodes for Pathfinding
    code: 'uint32 maxNodes = sPathfinder->GetMaxNodes();

      TC_LOG_INFO("misc", "Maximum nodes allowed in pathfinding: %u", maxNodes);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for debugging and performance monitoring purposes.
    The value returned may be influenced by server configuration settings or memory
    constraints defined in the TrinityCore environment.
