  signature: void ProfessionAuctionBridge::BuyMaterialsForLeveling(int * player, ProfessionType
    profession)
documentation:
  brief: Buys required materials for player to level up their profession.
  description: The BuyMaterialsForLeveling method handles the purchase of necessary
    crafting materials required for a player to advance their skill level in a specified
    profession. This function is typically invoked when a player attempts to increase
    their proficiency in a trade skill, ensuring they have the appropriate resources
    to complete the next tier of crafting recipes or abilities. The method interacts
    with the auction house system to procure these materials, potentially deducting
    gold from the player's inventory and updating their profession data accordingly.
    It may also trigger related events such as skill gain notifications or quest progress
    updates.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) in the game world.
  - name: profession
    description: Enumeration value indicating the specific profession type for which
      materials should be purchased.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      ProfessionType prof = PROFESSION_ENGINERING;

      bridge->BuyMaterialsForLeveling(&playerId, prof);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has sufficient gold and that the required
    materials are available in the auction house. It does not validate whether the
    player actually possesses the necessary skill level to purchase these items.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this function,
    as passing an invalid or null pointer may lead to undefined behavior. Also, note
    that this method might cause performance overhead if called frequently during
    rapid leveling sequences.
