documentation:
  brief: Generates a performance report for machine learning operations within the
    TrinityCore server.
  description: The GenerateMLPerformanceReport method compiles detailed metrics and
    statistics related to machine learning activities performed by the server. This
    includes tracking execution times, resource usage, model inference results, and
    other relevant performance indicators. The generated report is stored in the provided
    string parameter, which can then be used for debugging, optimization, or monitoring
    purposes. The method does not require any input parameters beyond the output buffer
    and operates on internal tracking data collected during runtime.
