documentation:
  brief: Sorts the abilities in the rotation priority list based on their assigned
    priorities.
  description: The SortAbilities method reorders the abilities within a RotationPriority
    object according to their defined priority levels. This method is typically used
    in AI-driven combat systems where the sequence of ability usage needs to be dynamically
    adjusted based on game state, cooldowns, or strategic considerations. The sorting
    ensures that higher-priority abilities are evaluated or executed before lower-priority
    ones during the rotation process. This method modifies the internal ordering of
    abilities and does not return any value.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: 'RotationPriority rotation;

      // Assume abilities have been added with different priorities

      rotation.SortAbilities();

      // Abilities are now sorted by priority for execution'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after all abilities have been added to the rotation
    priority list and their priorities set. It performs an in-place sort, modifying
    the original order of abilities within the object.
