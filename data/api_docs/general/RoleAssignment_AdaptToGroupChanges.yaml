  class: RoleAssignment
  method: AdaptToGroupChanges
  signature: void RoleAssignment::AdaptToGroupChanges(Group * group, Player * newMember,
    Player * leavingMember)
documentation:
  brief: Updates role assignments when group members change, handling addition or
    removal of players.
  description: The AdaptToGroupChanges method is responsible for dynamically adjusting
    role assignments within a group when membership changes occur. It manages the
    redistribution of roles such as tank, healer, and damage dealer (DPS) based on
    player availability and group composition. This method ensures that all group
    members maintain appropriate roles according to current needs, particularly during
    dynamic events like player joins or leaves. The implementation typically involves
    recalculating role distribution logic and updating internal state to reflect new
    group dynamics.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose membership has changed. Must not
      be null and must represent a valid group in the game world.
  - name: newMember
    description: Pointer to the Player object who has joined the group. Can be null
      if only a leaving member is present.
  - name: leavingMember
    description: Pointer to the Player object who has left the group. Can be null
      if only a new member is present.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage when a player joins a group
    code: 'Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();

      Player* newPlayer = GetNewPlayer();

      myGroup->AdaptToGroupChanges(myGroup, newPlayer, nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling a player leaving the group
    code: 'Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();

      Player* leftPlayer = GetLeavingPlayer();

      myGroup->AdaptToGroupChanges(myGroup, nullptr, leftPlayer);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called whenever a group's composition changes to ensure
    optimal role distribution. It is typically invoked internally by the Group class
    when AddMember or RemoveMember operations occur. The implementation may involve
    recalculating role priorities, updating player assignments, and notifying clients
    of role changes.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null group can lead to undefined behavior. This method modifies internal
    group state and should not be called during critical sections where group integrity
    must be preserved.
