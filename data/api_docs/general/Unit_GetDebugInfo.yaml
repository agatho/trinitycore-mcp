  class: Unit
  method: GetDebugInfo
  signature: std::string Unit::GetDebugInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns debug information about the unit including its current health, mana,
    and other relevant statistics.
  description: The GetDebugInfo method provides detailed debugging information about
    a Unit object, including its current health, mana, power values, and various status
    effects. This method is primarily used for debugging purposes during development
    and testing phases of World of Warcraft server implementation. The returned string
    contains formatted data that can be useful for developers to understand the state
    of a unit at any given moment. It typically includes information about the unit's
    current values, status effects, and other relevant metrics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a formatted string containing debug information about the unit,
    including health, mana, power values, and status effects. The string format varies
    based on the specific unit type and may include additional details such as combat
    state, buffs, debuffs, or other relevant statistics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Info Usage
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetSelectedUnit();

      std::string debugInfo = unit->GetDebugInfo();

      std::cout << "Debug Info: " << debugInfo << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for debugging purposes and may impact performance
    if used excessively in production code. The returned string format is designed
    to be human-readable but can be parsed by developers for detailed analysis of
    unit states.
  warnings: Using this method in high-frequency scenarios can cause performance issues
    due to string formatting overhead. It should not be used in critical path code
    unless specifically required for debugging purposes.
