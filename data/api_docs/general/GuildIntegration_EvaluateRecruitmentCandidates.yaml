  class: GuildIntegration
  method: EvaluateRecruitmentCandidates
  signature: void GuildIntegration::EvaluateRecruitmentCandidates(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates potential recruitment candidates for guild membership based on
    player data and guild requirements.
  description: The EvaluateRecruitmentCandidates method assesses a list of players
    to determine their suitability for guild recruitment. It analyzes various player
    attributes such as level, role, activity status, and alignment with guild standards.
    This method is typically invoked during guild recruitment processes or when reviewing
    applications from prospective members. The evaluation considers factors like character
    progression, PvP performance, raid participation history, and adherence to guild
    rules. The results of this evaluation may influence whether a candidate is accepted
    into the guild or requires additional review.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer array representing player identifiers or data
      used for recruitment evaluation. Each element corresponds to a specific player's
      unique identifier or attribute values.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int candidateIds[] = {1001, 1002, 1003};

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.EvaluateRecruitmentCandidates(candidateIds);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Player Data Processing
    code: 'std::vector<int> playerList = {1001, 1002, 1003, 1004};

      int* players = playerList.data();

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.EvaluateRecruitmentCandidates(players);

      // Process evaluation results here'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database queries or internal lookups to retrieve
    detailed player information for evaluation. It may involve multiple subsystems
    such as character stats, achievement tracking, and guild membership history. The
    method is expected to be thread-safe but should not be called concurrently with
    other guild management operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the player array contains valid identifiers; invalid entries
    may cause undefined behavior or database errors. This method modifies internal
    guild state based on evaluation results, so it should only be called during appropriate
    recruitment phases.
