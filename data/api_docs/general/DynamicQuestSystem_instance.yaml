documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the DynamicQuestSystem
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the DynamicQuestSystem
    class, providing global access to a single, shared instance of the system. This
    method ensures that only one DynamicQuestSystem object exists throughout the application
    lifecycle, allowing consistent management of dynamic quest data and operations.
    The returned pointer should be used carefully as it represents the central point
    for all dynamic quest functionality within the TrinityCore server environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of DynamicQuestSystem. Returns nullptr
    if the instance has not been initialized or if there was an error during initialization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "DynamicQuestSystem* questSystem = DynamicQuestSystem::instance();\nif (questSystem)\n\
      {\n    // Use the dynamic quest system\n    questSystem->UpdateQuests();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Quest Data
    code: "DynamicQuestSystem* system = DynamicQuestSystem::instance();\nif (system)\n\
      {\n    // Retrieve active quests for a player\n    std::vector<uint32> activeQuests\
      \ = system->GetActiveQuestsForPlayer(playerGuid);\n    for (uint32 questId :\
      \ activeQuests)\n    {\n        // Process each active quest\n        system->HandleQuestUpdate(questId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the singleton pattern, meaning multiple calls will return
    the same instance pointer. The implementation should be thread-safe in a multi-threaded
    environment as TrinityCore typically handles concurrent access to core systems.
    Developers should not attempt to manually delete or destroy the returned instance.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned pointer is always valid; check for nullptr
    before using it. Avoid creating multiple instances of DynamicQuestSystem as this
    would violate the singleton contract and could lead to inconsistent quest state
    management.
