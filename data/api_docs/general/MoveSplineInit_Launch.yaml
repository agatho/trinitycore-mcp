documentation:
  brief: Initiates and starts a spline-based movement animation for an object
  description: The Launch method begins execution of a pre-configured spline movement
    path for an object, typically used in World of Warcraft's character or creature
    movement systems. It finalizes the movement setup and triggers the actual spline
    animation to begin. This method is usually called after all movement parameters
    have been set via other initialization methods such as SetDestination, SetVelocity,
    or AddPoint. The return value indicates success or failure of the launch operation,
    with positive values typically representing successful initiation and negative
    values indicating errors in the movement configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a 32-bit signed integer where positive values indicate successful
    launch of the spline movement, zero typically means no movement was initiated
    (possibly due to invalid parameters or already completed movement), and negative
    values represent various error conditions such as invalid path data, missing destination
    points, or internal configuration errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement Launch
    code: "MoveSplineInit splineInit;\nsplineInit.SetDestination(Position(100.0f,\
      \ 200.0f, 300.0f));\nsplineInit.SetVelocity(5.0f);\nint32 result = splineInit.Launch();\n\
      if (result > 0)\n{\n    // Movement successfully initiated\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling for Launch
    code: "MoveSplineInit splineInit;\n// Configure movement with invalid parameters\n\
      int32 result = splineInit.Launch();\nif (result < 0)\n{\n    // Handle error\
      \ condition\n    switch(result)\n    {\n        case -1: // Invalid path data\n\
      \            // Log error\n            break;\n        case -2: // Missing destination\n\
      \            // Handle missing destination\n            break;\n        default:\n\
      \            // Other error handling\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spline movement system used internally by TrinityCore
    for smooth character and creature animations. The actual movement execution occurs
    asynchronously, so calling Launch() does not immediately move the object to its
    destination. The method assumes all necessary path data has been previously configured
    through other MoveSplineInit methods.
  warnings: Calling Launch without proper pre-configuration may result in undefined
    behavior or immediate failure. This method should only be called after at least
    one destination point has been set, otherwise it will likely return an error code.
    Additionally, calling Launch multiple times on the same spline configuration without
    resetting it may cause unexpected movement artifacts.
