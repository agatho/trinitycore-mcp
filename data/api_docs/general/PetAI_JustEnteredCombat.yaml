documentation:
  brief: Handles pet AI behavior when the pet enters combat state
  description: The JustEnteredCombat method is invoked by the PetAI system when a
    pet transitions into combat mode. This method typically initializes combat-related
    behaviors such as targeting, spell casting, or movement patterns specific to the
    pet's AI. It may also update internal state variables to reflect that the pet
    is now engaged in combat. The method is part of the core AI framework for summoned
    creatures and pets within TrinityCore's game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: who
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the entity (player or creature)
      that triggered the pet to enter combat. This value may be null if the combat
      was initiated by environmental factors or self-defense.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in custom pet AI override
    code: "class MyPetAI : public PetAI {\npublic:\n    void JustEnteredCombat(int*\
      \ who) override {\n        // Custom combat initialization logic\n        if\
      \ (who != nullptr) {\n            // Log or react to the entity that caused\
      \ combat\n            sLog->outString(\"Pet engaged with target: %d\", *who);\n\
      \        }\n        PetAI::JustEnteredCombat(who);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the core AI update loop and should
    not be invoked directly unless implementing a custom AI behavior. The 'who' parameter
    may contain invalid data if combat was triggered by non-entity sources like area
    triggers or environmental effects.
  warnings: Ensure that any override of this method properly calls the base class
    implementation to maintain expected AI functionality. Incorrect handling of the
    'who' pointer can lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
