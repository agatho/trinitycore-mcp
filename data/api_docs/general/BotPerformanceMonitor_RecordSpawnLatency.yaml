  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: RecordSpawnLatency
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::RecordSpawnLatency(uint64 microseconds)
documentation:
  brief: Records the latency of a bot spawn event in microseconds for performance
    monitoring.
  description: The RecordSpawnLatency method logs the time taken to spawn a bot, measured
    in microseconds. This method is typically used by the BotPerformanceMonitor class
    to track and analyze the efficiency of bot creation processes within the TrinityCore
    framework. The recorded latency data can be used for debugging performance issues,
    optimizing bot spawning logic, or generating reports on system responsiveness.
    The method does not return any value and directly stores the timing information
    internally for later retrieval or analysis.
  parameters:
  - name: microseconds
    description: The time duration in microseconds that it took to complete the bot
      spawn operation. This value should be a positive integer representing the elapsed
      time from start to finish of the spawning process.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      uint64 spawnTime = 1500; // 1.5 milliseconds

      monitor.RecordSpawnLatency(spawnTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spawn Logic
    code: "void BotManager::SpawnBot()\n{\n    auto startTime = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \    // ... actual bot spawning logic ...\n    auto endTime = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \    auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(endTime\
      \ - startTime).count();\n    sBotPerformanceMonitor->RecordSpawnLatency(duration.count());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from within the bot spawning context
    and should ideally be invoked after all initialization steps are complete. The
    internal storage mechanism may use a circular buffer or similar structure to maintain
    historical latency data for performance analysis.
  warnings: Ensure that the microseconds parameter represents actual elapsed time
    and not a precomputed value, as inaccurate timing data will skew performance metrics.
    Avoid calling this method from high-frequency loops without considering performance
    impact.
