  class: FleeingMovementGenerator
  method: Deactivate
  signature: void FleeingMovementGenerator::Deactivate(int * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Deactivates the fleeing movement generator for a given unit.
  description: The Deactivate method stops the fleeing movement behavior for the unit
    associated with this movement generator. It is typically called when the unit
    should cease its fleeing action, such as when the threat level drops below the
    flee threshold or when the flee is interrupted by external factors. This method
    ensures proper cleanup of any resources or state related to the fleeing behavior
    and prepares the unit for potential reactivation or transition to another movement
    generator.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the integer representing the unit that owns this movement
      generator. The value is used to identify which unit's fleeing behavior should
      be deactivated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Deactivation Example
    code: 'FleeingMovementGenerator fleeGen;

      int ownerUnit = 12345;

      fleeGen.Deactivate(&ownerUnit);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the movement generator system in TrinityCore and should
    only be called on active fleeing movement generators. It does not directly modify
    the unit's position or orientation but rather signals that the fleeing behavior
    should end.
