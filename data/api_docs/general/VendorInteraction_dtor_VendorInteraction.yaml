  signature: void VendorInteraction::~VendorInteraction()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a VendorInteraction object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the VendorInteraction class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the interaction
    with a vendor. This includes releasing references to player data, item lists,
    and any temporary structures created during the vendor transaction process. The
    destructor ensures proper resource management and prevents memory leaks when the
    vendor interaction object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It is automatically
    called by the system when the object's lifetime ends, typically after a player
    completes a vendor interaction or when the interaction is cancelled.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of VendorInteraction
    code: "void HandleVendorTransaction(Player* player, uint32 vendorId) {\n    VendorInteraction\
      \ interaction(player, vendorId);\n    // ... perform vendor operations ...\n\
      \    // Destructor called automatically when 'interaction' goes out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called manually unless the object was dynamically
    allocated using new. It is important to ensure that all references to the VendorInteraction
    object are properly managed to avoid dangling pointers or premature destruction.
    The destructor does not perform any specific cleanup related to database transactions
    as those are handled separately by the core system.
  warnings: Do not explicitly call this destructor unless you have manually allocated
    the object using new. Calling it manually on stack-allocated objects will result
    in undefined behavior. Also, be aware that the destructor may access player data
    and other game state, so ensure the object is valid before destruction.
