  method: IsLeader
  signature: bool Group::IsLeader(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the specified player GUID is the leader of the group.
  description: The IsLeader method determines whether a given player, identified by
    their GUID, holds the leadership position within the group. In World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework, groups (also known as raids or parties) have a designated
    leader who has special privileges such as managing loot distribution, kicking
    members, and assigning roles. This method performs a lookup to verify if the provided
    GUID corresponds to the current group leader. The method is const, meaning it
    does not modify any internal state of the Group object. It returns true if the
    specified GUID matches the group's leader, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to check for leadership
      status. This should be a valid player GUID within the context of the current
      world session.
  returns: Returns true if the specified player GUID is the leader of the group; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a player is the group leader
    code: "if (group->IsLeader(playerGuid)) {\n    // Player is the group leader\n\
      \    SendGroupLeaderMessage(\"You are the leader of this group.\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Player is not the group leader\n    SendGroupLeaderMessage(\"You\
      \ are not the group leader.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsLeader in a command handler to validate permissions
    code: "void HandleGroupLeaderCommand(ChatHandler* handler) {\n    Player* player\
      \ = handler->GetSession()->GetPlayer();\n    Group* group = player->GetGroup();\n\
      \    if (!group) {\n        handler->SendSysMessage(\"You are not in a group.\"\
      );\n        return;\n    }\n    if (group->IsLeader(player->GetGUID().GetCounter()))\
      \ {\n        handler->SendSysMessage(\"You are the group leader.\");\n    }\
      \ else {\n        handler->SendSysMessage(\"You are not the group leader.\"\
      );\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of the group leader's GUID. It assumes
    that the Group object has been properly initialized and that the provided GUID
    is valid within the current game context. The method does not perform any network
    synchronization or database lookups, making it efficient for frequent checks.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method is a valid player GUID, as
    passing an invalid or non-player GUID may lead to incorrect results. Also note
    that group leadership can change dynamically during gameplay (e.g., when the leader
    leaves the group or is kicked), so cached results from this method should not
    be relied upon across multiple game ticks without re-evaluation.
