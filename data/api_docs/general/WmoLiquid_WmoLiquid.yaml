documentation:
  brief: Copies the state and data of another WmoLiquid object into this instance.
  description: The WmoLiquid constructor is used to initialize a new WmoLiquid object
    by copying the contents of an existing WmoLiquid object. This is a copy constructor
    that ensures deep copying of internal data structures related to liquid properties
    within World Map Objects (WMOs). It's typically invoked when creating a new WmoLiquid
    instance based on an existing one, preserving all relevant liquid information
    such as height, flags, and type. The method is essential for managing dynamic
    liquid changes in the game world, particularly when handling terrain modifications
    or water level updates in WMO-based environments.

  - title: Basic Copy Construction
    code: 'WmoLiquid originalLiquid;

      // ... initialize originalLiquid with data ...

      WmoLiquid copiedLiquid(originalLiquid); // Uses copy constructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the WmoLiquid class which handles liquid data
    for World Map Objects in TrinityCore. It's important to understand that this is
    a copy constructor, not a regular function, and it will be automatically called
    when creating new objects from existing ones.
