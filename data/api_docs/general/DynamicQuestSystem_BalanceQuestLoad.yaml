documentation:
  brief: Distributes quest loading across multiple threads to optimize performance
    during dynamic quest system initialization.
  description: The BalanceQuestLoad method is responsible for distributing the workload
    of loading dynamic quests across multiple threads in order to improve performance
    and reduce server startup time. This method ensures that quest data is efficiently
    processed without blocking the main game thread, allowing the server to maintain
    responsiveness while initializing quest-related systems. It typically handles
    the distribution of quest definitions, dependencies, and related data structures
    to worker threads for parallel processing. The method assumes that all necessary
    quest data has already been loaded into memory and focuses solely on the balancing
    and scheduling aspects of the loading process.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeDynamicQuests()\n{\n    sDynamicQuestSystem->BalanceQuestLoad();\n\
      \    // Continue with other initialization tasks\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after all quest data has been loaded into
    memory. It is designed to be thread-safe and can be invoked from any thread context.
    The actual performance gains depend on the number of available CPU cores and the
    complexity of the quest data being processed.
  warnings: Calling this method before loading quest data may result in undefined
    behavior or empty quest processing. Avoid calling BalanceQuestLoad during high-traffic
    periods as it might temporarily increase system resource usage.
