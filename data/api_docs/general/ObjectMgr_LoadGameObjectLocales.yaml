  brief: Loads localized names and descriptions for game objects from the database
    into memory.
  description: The LoadGameObjectLocales method retrieves localization data for game
    objects from the database and stores it in memory for use during runtime. This
    method is typically called during server startup or database reload operations
    to ensure that all localized strings for game objects are available. It populates
    internal lookup tables with translated names, descriptions, and other locale-specific
    information. The method does not return any value but modifies internal state
    of the ObjectMgr class. This functionality supports the World of Warcraft localization
    system by ensuring that players see appropriate text based on their selected language.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeServer()\n{\n    // ... other initialization code ...\n\
      \    ObjectMgr::instance()->LoadGameObjectLocales();\n    // ... continue with\
      \ server startup ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically during server startup as part
    of the database loading process. It's thread-safe and typically runs in the main
    thread. The localization data is cached in memory for fast access during gameplay,
    so repeated calls have no effect. Performance impact is minimal since it only
    loads data once during initialization.
