  class: BotTalentManager
  method: ApplySpecialization
  signature: bool BotTalentManager::ApplySpecialization(Player * bot, uint8 specId)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a specified specialization to a bot player character.
  description: The ApplySpecialization method assigns a given talent specialization
    to a bot player character. This function is typically used in automated bot systems
    to configure bot characters with specific class specializations, ensuring they
    utilize appropriate talents and abilities for their role. The method validates
    the provided specialization ID against valid class specializations and updates
    the bot's talent data accordingly. It returns true if the specialization was successfully
    applied, or false if the operation failed due to invalid parameters or system
    constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character to apply
      the specialization to. Must not be null.
  - name: specId
    description: The ID of the specialization to apply (0-2 for most classes). Valid
      values depend on the bot's class and must correspond to a valid talent tree
      specialization.
  returns: True if the specialization was successfully applied to the bot character,
    false otherwise. Returns false if the bot pointer is invalid, specId is out of
    range, or the specialization cannot be applied due to game restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Apply Frost Specialization to a Mage Bot
    code: "Player* mageBot = ...; // Get reference to bot\nbool success = botTalentManager->ApplySpecialization(mageBot,\
      \ 0); // Apply Frost specialization\nif (success)\n{\n    // Specialization\
      \ applied successfully\n    LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"Frost specialization applied\
      \ to bot {}\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Apply Multiple Specializations to Different Bot Types
    code: 'Player* warriorBot = ...;

      Player* rogueBot = ...;


      // Apply Arms specialization to warrior

      botTalentManager->ApplySpecialization(warriorBot, 0);


      // Apply Subtlety specialization to rogue

      botTalentManager->ApplySpecialization(rogueBot, 2);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the bot's talent data directly and may not immediately
    reflect in the client UI without additional updates. The specId parameter should
    match the valid specialization IDs for the bot's class (typically 0-2). This function
    is part of the automated bot talent management system and is usually called during
    bot initialization or when changing bot behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid
    crashes. The specId must be within the valid range for the bot's class, otherwise
    the operation will fail silently. Applying invalid specializations may cause unexpected
    behavior in bot combat performance.
