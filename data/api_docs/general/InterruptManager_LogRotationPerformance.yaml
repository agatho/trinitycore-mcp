  method: LogRotationPerformance
  signature: void InterruptManager::LogRotationPerformance()
documentation:
  brief: Logs performance metrics for player rotation behavior during combat.
  description: The LogRotationPerformance method records timing and efficiency data
    related to a player's spell rotation during combat encounters. This method is
    typically invoked at strategic points in the combat flow to capture how effectively
    a player is executing their ability sequence, including latency, cooldown management,
    and overall rotation consistency. The logged data can be used for performance
    analysis, balancing adjustments, or identifying potential issues with player behavior
    or AI decision-making. It operates within the InterruptManager class, which handles
    various interrupt-related mechanics in the game's combat system.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Handler
    code: "void CombatHandler::OnPlayerAction()\n{\n    // ... perform player action\
      \ ...\n    interruptManager.LogRotationPerformance();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely aggregates timing data from multiple sources including
    spell casting times, global cooldowns, and ability availability. It may be called
    automatically by the core combat loop or manually during specific events such
    as boss encounter transitions or player input processing.
