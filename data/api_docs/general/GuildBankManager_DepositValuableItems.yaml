documentation:
  brief: Deposits valuable items from a player's inventory into the guild bank.
  description: The DepositValuableItems method transfers items of significant value
    from a specified player's inventory to the guild bank. This function is typically
    invoked when a player wishes to contribute valuable loot or items to the guild's
    shared resources. The method handles the necessary checks for item eligibility,
    inventory space, and guild permissions before performing the transfer. It ensures
    that only appropriate items are moved and maintains the integrity of both the
    player's inventory and the guild bank storage.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      or index within the game system. This parameter identifies which player's inventory
      will be processed for item deposit.

      GuildBankManager bankManager;

      bankManager.DepositValuableItems(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal game systems to verify item values
    and guild permissions. It may perform checks for item durability, stack limits,
    and whether the item is marked as valuable in the game's database. The function
    should be called only when appropriate game state conditions are met.
  warnings: Improper use of this method could lead to items being incorrectly transferred
    or lost if player identification is invalid. Ensure that the player pointer is
    valid and points to an active player before calling this method.
