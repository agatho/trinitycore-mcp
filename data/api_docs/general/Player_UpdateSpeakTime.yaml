  class: Player
  method: UpdateSpeakTime
  signature: void Player::UpdateSpeakTime(ChatFloodThrottle::Index index)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the timestamp for the specified chat flood throttle index.
  description: The UpdateSpeakTime method updates the internal timestamp associated
    with a specific chat flood throttle index, typically used to enforce rate limiting
    on player chat messages. This method is part of TrinityCore's anti-flood system
    that prevents players from spamming chat channels. It records the current time
    when a message is sent, which is then compared against previous timestamps to
    determine if the player is sending messages too rapidly. The method does not directly
    send or process chat messages; it only updates timing information for flood control
    purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: index
    description: The chat flood throttle index that identifies which channel or type
      of message is being updated. This typically corresponds to different chat channels
      like SAY, YELL, WHISPER, etc., and is used to track individual throttling limits
      per channel.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating speak time for a general chat message
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateSpeakTime(ChatFloodThrottle::Index::SAY);

      // This updates the timestamp for general say messages'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating speak time for a whisper message
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateSpeakTime(ChatFloodThrottle::Index::WHISPER);

      // This updates the timestamp for whisper messages'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game server when processing
    chat messages. Developers should not call this directly unless implementing custom
    chat flood control logic. The method uses internal timing mechanisms and relies
    on the player's session state to maintain accurate throttle tracking.
  warnings: Calling this method manually may interfere with normal chat throttling
    behavior. It should only be used in special circumstances where custom flood control
    is required, and even then, proper consideration must be given to how it affects
    overall server performance and user experience.
