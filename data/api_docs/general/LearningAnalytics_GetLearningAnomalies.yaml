  class: LearningAnalytics
  method: GetLearningAnomalies
  signature: std::vector<std::string> LearningAnalytics::GetLearningAnomalies(uint32_t
    botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of learning anomalies associated with a specified bot GUID.
  description: The GetLearningAnomalies method fetches a collection of anomaly identifiers
    related to a specific bot within the learning analytics system. This function
    is typically used in automated gameplay analysis or debugging scenarios where
    understanding deviations from expected behavior is required. The returned vector
    contains string representations of anomaly IDs that can be further processed or
    logged for diagnostic purposes. The method does not modify any internal state
    and is safe for repeated calls.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose learning anomalies
      are to be retrieved. This value must correspond to a valid bot entry in the
      system.
  returns: A std::vector<std::string> containing the identifiers of learning anomalies
    associated with the specified bot GUID. Each string represents an individual anomaly
    record. Returns an empty vector if no anomalies are found or if the provided botGuid
    is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and print learning anomalies for a bot
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = 12345;\nstd::vector<std::string> anomalies = analytics.GetLearningAnomalies(botGuid);\n\
      for (const auto& anomaly : anomalies) {\n    std::cout << \"Anomaly ID: \" <<\
      \ anomaly << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the LearningAnalytics system has been initialized
    and that the bot with the given GUID exists. Performance may be impacted if a
    large number of anomalies are associated with a single bot, though typical usage
    involves small sets of anomalies.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent botGuid may lead to
    undefined behavior or return unexpected results. Ensure proper validation of input
    parameters before invoking the function.
