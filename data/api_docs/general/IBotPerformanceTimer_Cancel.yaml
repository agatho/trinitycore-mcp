  method: Cancel
  signature: void IBotPerformanceTimer::Cancel()
documentation:
  brief: Cancels the performance timer, stopping any ongoing measurements and releasing
    associated resources.
  description: The Cancel method terminates an active performance timer instance,
    preventing further measurement collection and freeing up any allocated system
    resources. This method is typically used when a bot or AI component needs to halt
    timing operations before completing its intended task. The timer must be in an
    active state for this method to have an effect; calling it on a completed or already
    canceled timer may result in no operation. Once canceled, the timer cannot be
    restarted and should be disposed of if no further use is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: None
  examples:
  - title: Basic Timer Cancellation
    code: 'IBotPerformanceTimer* timer = new IBotPerformanceTimer();

      timer->Start();

      // ... perform some bot operations ...

      timer->Cancel(); // Stop the timer and release resources'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before destroying the timer object to ensure
    proper cleanup of internal state. It is recommended to check if the timer is already
    canceled before calling Cancel to avoid unnecessary operations.
  warnings: Calling Cancel on a timer that has already been canceled or is not active
    may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks in some implementations. Always
    verify the timer's status before cancellation if unsure.
