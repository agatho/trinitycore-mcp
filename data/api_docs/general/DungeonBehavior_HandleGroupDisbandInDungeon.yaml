  signature: void DungeonBehavior::HandleGroupDisbandInDungeon(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Disbands a group within a dungeon instance and handles cleanup of dungeon-related
    resources.
  description: The HandleGroupDisbandInDungeon method is responsible for properly
    disbanding a player group that is currently inside a dungeon instance. This method
    ensures that all dungeon-specific resources associated with the group are cleaned
    up appropriately, including removing any dungeon-specific buffs, resetting encounter
    states, and updating the dungeon's internal tracking of active groups. The method
    also handles notifying other players in the group about the disbanding event and
    may trigger necessary state transitions for the dungeon instance itself. This
    functionality is crucial for maintaining proper game state management during dynamic
    group changes within dungeon environments.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object that needs to be disbanded. Must not
      be null and must represent a valid group currently inside a dungeon instance.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of disbanding a dungeon group
    code: "Group* playerGroup = sObjectMgr->GetGroupById(groupId);\nif (playerGroup\
      \ && playerGroup->isInDungeon())\n{\n    dungeonBehavior->HandleGroupDisbandInDungeon(playerGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group parameter is valid and represents a group
    currently inside a dungeon. It's important to verify that the group is indeed
    in a dungeon before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior or crashes.
    The method may internally call other cleanup functions related to dungeon instances
    and player tracking.
  warnings: Calling this method on a group not currently in a dungeon may result in
    undefined behavior. Ensure proper validation of group state before invoking this
    function. Also, be aware that this method might modify the internal state of both
    the group and the dungeon instance, so it should only be called when appropriate
    for the current game context.
