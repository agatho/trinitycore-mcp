  class: GuildIntegration
  method: AnalyzeGuildDynamics
  signature: void GuildIntegration::AnalyzeGuildDynamics(int * guild)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes guild dynamics and updates internal tracking structures for the
    specified guild.
  description: The AnalyzeGuildDynamics method processes and evaluates the current
    state of a guild, including member activity, participation rates, and engagement
    levels. This method is typically invoked during periodic guild maintenance or
    when significant changes occur within the guild structure. It updates internal
    data structures used for guild performance monitoring and may trigger notifications
    or alerts based on predefined thresholds. The method operates on a provided guild
    identifier to ensure accurate analysis of the correct guild's dynamics.
  parameters:
  - name: guild
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the unique guild identifier (GUID)
      to analyze. Must point to a valid guild ID that exists in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Dynamics Analysis
    code: 'int guildId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration integration;

      integration.AnalyzeGuildDynamics(&guildId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from within the core game loop or maintenance
    routines. It performs database queries and may have performance implications when
    analyzing large guilds with many members. The method assumes that the provided
    guild ID is valid and corresponds to an existing guild in the system.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent guild ID may result
    in undefined behavior or database errors. Ensure that the guild identifier points
    to a real guild before invoking this method.
