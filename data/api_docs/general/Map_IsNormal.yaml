documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the map is a normal dungeon or raid instance
  description: The IsNormal method checks if the current map instance is a standard
    normal dungeon or raid, as opposed to an heroic or mythic difficulty variant.
    This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to distinguish
    between different difficulty levels of content. It returns true for normal instances
    and false for heroic or mythic instances. The method is particularly useful when
    determining which content should be accessed by players based on their current
    difficulty level.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map instance is a normal difficulty dungeon or raid,
    false otherwise. This indicates whether the instance is a standard normal mode
    rather than an heroic or mythic mode.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (map->IsNormal()) {\n    // Handle normal difficulty content\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with conditional logic
    code: "Map* map = player->GetMap();\nif (map->IsNormal()) {\n    // Normal instance\
      \ handling\n    // This can be used to determine appropriate loot distribution\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically checks the map's difficulty settings and may involve
    checking the instance's difficulty level. It is commonly used in conjunction with
    other difficulty-related methods to determine player access to content.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only applies to instances that have difficulty
    levels. Maps without difficulty levels (like certain outdoor zones) will always
    return true for normal instances.
