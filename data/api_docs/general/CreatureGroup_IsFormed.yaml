  signature: bool CreatureGroup::IsFormed() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature group has been formed and is active.
  description: The IsFormed method checks if a CreatureGroup object has completed
    its formation process and is currently active in the world. This method typically
    returns true when the group has successfully assembled its members and is ready
    to execute group behaviors such as following a leader, engaging in combat, or
    performing coordinated actions. The method does not modify any internal state
    but provides a read-only check on the group's current formation status. This functionality
    is crucial for AI-driven creature behavior systems within TrinityCore where groups
    of NPCs need to coordinate their actions based on their collective formation status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature group has been successfully formed and is
    active; otherwise, returns false if the group is still in the process of forming
    or has been disbanded.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a creature group is formed before engaging combat
    code: "if (creatureGroup->IsFormed()) {\n    // Proceed with group combat behavior\n\
      \    creatureGroup->EngageCombat();\n} else {\n    // Wait for formation or\
      \ handle formation process\n    sLog->outString(\"Creature group not yet formed.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other group management
    functions to ensure proper coordination of NPC behavior. It's important to note
    that a group may be formed but not necessarily active in combat, as additional
    conditions might be required for full engagement.
