documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current number of soul shards owned by the player
  description: The GetSoulShards method returns the floating-point value representing
    the current count of soul shards available to the player. In World of Warcraft's
    context, soul shards are a resource used primarily by warlocks for various abilities
    and spells. This method provides access to the player's current soul shard accumulation,
    which may be fractional depending on the game's internal representation and any
    active effects that modify shard counts. The returned value reflects the instantaneous
    state of the player's soul shard resource at the time of the call.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current number of soul shards owned by the
    player, which may include fractional portions depending on game mechanics and
    active buffs or debuffs.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float shards = player->GetSoulShards();\nif (shards >= 3.0f)\n{\n    //\
      \ Player has at least 3 soul shards\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Check for Spell Casting
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nfloat requiredShards = 1.0f;\nfloat availableShards\
      \ = player->GetSoulShards();\nif (availableShards >= requiredShards)\n{\n  \
      \  // Cast a spell that consumes soul shards\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other resource management
    functions to determine whether a player has sufficient soul shards to cast certain
    warlock abilities. The value returned may be affected by temporary modifiers such
    as buffs, debuffs, or game effects that alter the shard count.
  warnings: Be aware that soul shard values can change dynamically during gameplay
    due to various game events, so calling this method in a loop without considering
    performance implications might not be advisable. Also, fractional values should
    be handled carefully when performing comparisons or arithmetic operations.
