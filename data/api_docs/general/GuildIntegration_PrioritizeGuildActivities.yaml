  class: GuildIntegration
  method: PrioritizeGuildActivities
  signature: void GuildIntegration::PrioritizeGuildActivities(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Prioritizes guild activities for a given player by adjusting their activity
    levels and scheduling.
  description: The PrioritizeGuildActivities method in the GuildIntegration class
    is responsible for managing and optimizing the scheduling of guild-related activities
    for a specified player. This method adjusts the priority levels of various guild
    tasks, such as raids, dungeons, and social events, based on player availability
    and guild needs. It ensures that important guild activities are given appropriate
    attention and that players are properly scheduled to participate in key events.
    The method likely interacts with internal guild scheduling systems and may update
    player activity logs or status indicators within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) within the guild system. This parameter identifies which specific player's
      activities should be prioritized.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.PrioritizeGuildActivities(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Management
    code: "void UpdatePlayerActivity(Player* player)\n{\n    int playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      \    GuildIntegration guildInt;\n    guildInt.PrioritizeGuildActivities(&playerId);\n\
      \    // Additional logic to handle updated activity priorities\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal data structures related to player scheduling
    and guild activity management. Developers should be aware that this operation
    may trigger updates to the player's activity log or notification system. The method
    may also interact with other subsystems like raid management or event coordination.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed is valid and points to a legitimate
    player within the guild system. Passing an invalid or uninitialized pointer could
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This method should only be called when
    the player is actually part of a guild.
