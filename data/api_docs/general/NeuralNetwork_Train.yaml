  class: NeuralNetwork
  method: Train
  signature: void NeuralNetwork::Train(const int & input, const int & target, float
    learningRate)
documentation:
  brief: Trains the neural network using the provided input and target values with
    the specified learning rate.
  description: The Train method updates the weights and biases of the neural network
    based on the difference between the predicted output and the target value. This
    is a core function in the training process where the network adjusts its internal
    parameters to minimize error. The method takes an input vector, expected target
    output, and a learning rate that controls how much the weights are adjusted during
    each training step. In the context of World of Warcraft AI systems, this method
    would be used to teach the neural network to recognize patterns or make decisions
    based on game data such as player behavior, NPC reactions, or environmental conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: input
    description: The input value for training. In a neural network context, this typically
      represents the feature vector or data point that the network processes to produce
      an output.
  - name: target
    description: The expected target value that the network should learn to predict.
      This is the correct answer or desired output that the training process aims
      to achieve.
  - name: learningRate
    description: A scalar value that determines the step size at each iteration while
      moving toward a minimum of a loss function. Higher values may lead to faster
      convergence but can overshoot optimal solutions, while lower values ensure more
      stable learning but may require more iterations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Neural Network Training
    code: 'NeuralNetwork nn;

      int input = 5;

      int target = 10;

      float learningRate = 0.01f;

      nn.Train(input, target, learningRate);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the neural network has already been initialized
    with appropriate weights and biases. The training process is typically iterative,
    meaning multiple calls to Train are required for effective learning. It's important
    to ensure that inputs and targets are properly normalized if the network expects
    values within a specific range.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the neural network
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. Also, choosing an inappropriate
    learning rate can cause the training to fail to converge or oscillate around the
    optimal solution.
