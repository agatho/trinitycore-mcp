  class: QuestSelectionStrategy
  method: QuestSelectionStrategy
  signature: void QuestSelectionStrategy::QuestSelectionStrategy(Strategy strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new QuestSelectionStrategy with the specified strategy type.
  description: The QuestSelectionStrategy constructor initializes a quest selection
    strategy object with a given strategy parameter. This class is typically used
    within the TrinityCore AI system to determine how quests should be selected for
    players or NPCs. The strategy parameter defines the selection logic that will
    be applied when choosing which quests to present or pursue. This initialization
    is crucial for setting up proper quest behavior in AI-driven quest systems, particularly
    in scenarios involving dynamic quest generation or conditional quest selection
    based on player progress or game state.
  parameters:
  - name: strategy
    description: The strategy type that defines how quests should be selected. This
      parameter determines the logic flow for quest selection and can influence which
      quests are presented to players based on various conditions such as player level,
      faction, quest completion status, or other game state variables.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Selection Strategy Initialization
    code: QuestSelectionStrategy strategy(QuestSelectionStrategy::STRATEGY_RANDOM);
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing with Specific Strategy Type
    code: 'QuestSelectionStrategy questStrategy(QuestSelectionStrategy::STRATEGY_PRIORITY);

      // This would set up a strategy that prioritizes certain quests based on criteria
      like level requirements or reputation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during AI initialization or when creating
    new quest selection behaviors for NPCs. The strategy parameter should be validated
    to ensure it's one of the supported strategy types defined in the QuestSelectionStrategy
    enum. This method does not perform any complex operations but sets up internal
    state that will be used by other methods in the class.
  warnings: Ensure that the strategy parameter passed to this constructor is a valid
    value from the available strategy enumeration. Using an invalid strategy type
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect quest selection logic. This constructor
    should not be called after the strategy has already been initialized with a different
    value, as it may cause unexpected behavior in the AI system.
