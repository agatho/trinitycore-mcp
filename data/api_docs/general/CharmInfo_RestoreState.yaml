  brief: Restores the charm state of a creature to its original form
  description: The RestoreState method is used to revert a creature that has been
    charmed back to its original state. This typically occurs when the charm effect
    is removed or expires, allowing the creature to return to its natural behavior
    and AI state. The method ensures that any temporary modifications made during
    the charm period are properly reset, including restoring the creature's original
    faction, AI, and movement behaviors. It is an internal method called by the core
    system when a charm is no longer active.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in charm removal
    code: "void RemoveCharm()\n{\n    if (m_charmInfo)\n    {\n        m_charmInfo->RestoreState();\n\
      \        m_charmInfo = nullptr;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when a charm effect ends. It should not be called directly unless you are implementing
    custom charm behavior or debugging charm-related systems. The method assumes that
    all necessary cleanup has been performed before calling.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context may result in inconsistent
    creature state. Ensure that any charm effects have properly expired or been removed
    before calling RestoreState to avoid unexpected behavior.
