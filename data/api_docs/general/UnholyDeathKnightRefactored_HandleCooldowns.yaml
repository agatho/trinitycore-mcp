  signature: void UnholyDeathKnightRefactored::HandleCooldowns(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Manages and updates cooldowns for unholy death knight abilities
  description: The HandleCooldowns method is responsible for processing and updating
    the cooldown timers associated with various unholy death knight abilities and
    spells. This method ensures that abilities are properly managed according to their
    cooldown mechanics, preventing players from using abilities before they are ready.
    It typically iterates through the death knight's ability list, checks if each
    ability is on cooldown, and updates the remaining cooldown time accordingly. The
    method may also trigger visual or auditory feedback when abilities become available
    again. This functionality is crucial for maintaining game balance and proper spell
    usage mechanics within the unholy death knight class specialization.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target entity for cooldown
      processing. This parameter may be used to determine which specific abilities
      or effects should have their cooldowns updated, though its exact usage depends
      on implementation details within the UnholyDeathKnightRefactored class.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic cooldown handling with target
    code: 'int targetId = 42;

      UnholyDeathKnightRefactored dk;

      dk.HandleCooldowns(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Cooldown handling in combat loop
    code: "void UpdateCombat()\n{\n    int target = GetTarget();\n    if (target !=\
      \ 0)\n    {\n        dk.HandleCooldowns(&target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the core TrinityCore cooldown system to
    maintain proper spell timing. It may be called frequently during combat updates
    or at specific intervals to ensure accurate cooldown tracking. The target parameter
    might influence which abilities are processed, potentially allowing for selective
    cooldown management based on combat context.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target parameter could lead to incorrect cooldown
    calculations or application of cooldowns to unintended abilities. Ensure that
    the target value is valid and properly initialized before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior.
