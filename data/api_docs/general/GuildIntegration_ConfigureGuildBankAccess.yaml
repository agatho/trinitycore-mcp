api:
  class: GuildIntegration
  method: ConfigureGuildBankAccess
  signature: void GuildIntegration::ConfigureGuildBankAccess(uint32 playerGuid, bool
    autoDeposit, bool autoWithdraw)
documentation:
  brief: Configures guild bank access settings for a specified player, enabling or
    disabling auto-deposit and auto-withdrawal features.
  description: The ConfigureGuildBankAccess method sets the automatic deposit and
    withdrawal permissions for a given player within the guild bank system. This functionality
    allows guild masters or officers to control whether a player's items are automatically
    deposited into the guild bank when they are placed in their inventory, and whether
    they can automatically withdraw items from the guild bank. The method operates
    on a per-player basis and modifies the player's guild bank access configuration
    stored in the database. It does not perform any immediate banking actions but
    rather updates the settings that will be applied during subsequent bank transactions.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose guild bank access
      settings are to be configured. This value must correspond to a valid player
      in the database.
  - name: autoDeposit
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether auto-deposit is enabled for the
      specified player. When true, items placed in the player's inventory will automatically
      be moved to the guild bank. When false, no automatic deposits occur.
  - name: autoWithdraw
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether auto-withdrawal is enabled for
      the specified player. When true, items withdrawn from the guild bank will automatically
      be placed in the player's inventory. When false, no automatic withdrawals occur.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Auto-Deposit and Auto-Withdraw for Player
    code: GuildIntegration::ConfigureGuildBankAccess(123456, true, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Both Auto-Deposit and Auto-Withdraw for Player
    code: GuildIntegration::ConfigureGuildBankAccess(789012, false, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates the player's guild bank access configuration in
    the database. It may be called during guild member management operations or when
    a player joins/leaves a guild. The changes take effect immediately upon calling
    the method but do not affect existing transactions that are already in progress.
  warnings: Ensure that the playerGuid parameter refers to an actual existing player,
    as invalid GUIDs may cause errors or unexpected behavior. This method should only
    be called by authorized guild members (guild masters or officers) with appropriate
    permissions to modify guild bank settings.
