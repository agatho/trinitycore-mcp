  class: AddonChannelCommandHandler
  method: Send
  signature: void AddonChannelCommandHandler::Send(const int & msg)
documentation:
  brief: Sends an addon channel message with the specified integer value to connected
    clients.
  description: The Send method in AddonChannelCommandHandler is responsible for transmitting
    a message over the addon communication channel using a provided integer identifier.
    This functionality is typically used within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server
    implementation to facilitate communication between the server and client addons.
    The method likely encodes the integer value into a format suitable for network
    transmission and broadcasts it to all connected players who have the relevant
    addon enabled. It serves as part of the broader addon messaging system that allows
    custom extensions and modifications to interact with the game client.
  parameters:
  - name: msg
    description: An integer value representing the message to be sent through the
      addon channel. This value is typically used as a command identifier or data
      payload for addon communication.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending a basic addon message
    code: 'AddonChannelCommandHandler handler;

      int message = 1001;

      handler.Send(message);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending a command identifier to addon clients
    code: "void SendCustomCommand(uint32 commandId) {\n    AddonChannelCommandHandler\
      \ handler;\n    handler.Send(static_cast<int>(commandId));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the addon communication infrastructure and should
    only be used when addon support is properly configured. The integer parameter
    may be interpreted differently depending on the addon's implementation on the
    client side.
  warnings: Ensure that the message identifier being sent is valid and recognized
    by the target addons to avoid communication failures or unexpected behavior.
