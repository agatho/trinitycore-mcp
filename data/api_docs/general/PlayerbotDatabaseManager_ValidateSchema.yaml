  class: PlayerbotDatabaseManager
  method: ValidateSchema
  signature: bool PlayerbotDatabaseManager::ValidateSchema()
documentation:
  brief: Validates the database schema for player bot data to ensure compatibility
    and integrity.
  description: The ValidateSchema method checks whether the current database structure
    used by player bots is consistent with the expected schema. It verifies that all
    necessary tables, columns, and data types exist and match the required format.
    This validation is crucial for maintaining data integrity within the TrinityCore
    player bot system. The method typically runs during initialization or when database
    connections are established to prevent runtime errors caused by schema mismatches.
    If any inconsistencies are detected, the method returns false, indicating that
    the schema needs to be updated or corrected.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the database schema is valid and compatible with the player
    bot system requirements; otherwise returns false if schema validation fails due
    to missing tables, columns, or incorrect data types.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Schema Validation Check
    code: "if (PlayerbotDatabaseManager::ValidateSchema()) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ normal operation\n    LOG_INFO(\"playerbot\", \"Database schema is valid\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Handle schema error\n    LOG_ERROR(\"playerbot\", \"Database\
      \ schema validation failed\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform database queries to inspect table structures and
    should be called during system initialization. The validation process might have
    performance implications on large databases, so it's typically run once at startup
    rather than continuously.
