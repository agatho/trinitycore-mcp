  class: LearningAnalytics
  method: RecordModelUpdate
  signature: void LearningAnalytics::RecordModelUpdate(uint32_t botGuid, uint32_t
    modelVersion, float performance)
documentation:
  brief: Records a model update event with performance metrics for analytics purposes.
  description: The RecordModelUpdate method logs information about a bot's model version
    and its associated performance metric to the learning analytics system. This allows
    developers and analysts to track how different model versions perform in real-world
    scenarios within the game environment. The method is typically invoked when a
    bot's AI model is updated or retrained, capturing both the new model identifier
    and a quantifiable measure of its effectiveness. It serves as part of a broader
    data collection mechanism for machine learning and AI performance monitoring.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose model is being updated.
      This value must be a valid, non-zero GUID representing an existing bot in the
      system.
  - name: modelVersion
    description: Version number of the updated model. This typically represents a
      sequential or semantic version identifier that distinguishes between different
      iterations of the AI model used by the bot.
  - name: performance
    description: Performance metric value associated with the updated model. This
      is usually a floating-point number representing some measure of effectiveness,
      such as success rate, efficiency score, or other quantitative performance indicator.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: LearningAnalytics::RecordModelUpdate(12345u, 2u, 0.87f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Update Logic
    code: "void OnBotModelUpdate(uint32_t botGuid, uint32_t newVersion)\n{\n    float\
      \ performance = CalculateBotPerformance(botGuid);\n    LearningAnalytics::RecordModelUpdate(botGuid,\
      \ newVersion, performance);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of an asynchronous logging system and may not
    block execution. Ensure that the bot GUID corresponds to an active bot instance
    to avoid invalid data entries in analytics reports.
  warnings: Passing a zero or invalid botGuid can lead to data corruption or errors
    in analytics reporting. The performance value should be within expected ranges
    for accurate analysis; extreme outliers might skew results.
