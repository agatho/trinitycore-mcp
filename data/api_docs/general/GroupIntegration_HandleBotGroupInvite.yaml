  signature: void GroupIntegration::HandleBotGroupInvite(Player * inviter, Player
    * botPlayer)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the invitation of a bot player to a group by an inviter player.
  description: The HandleBotGroupInvite method processes the logic for inviting a
    bot player into a group led by another player. This method is typically used in
    TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft servers that support bot functionality, where
    players can control non-player characters (bots) and manage their group affiliations.
    It ensures proper group synchronization, updates group member lists, and may trigger
    related events or notifications for both the inviter and the invited bot player.
    The method assumes that the inviter is already in a group and has permission to
    invite members.
  parameters:
  - name: inviter
    description: A pointer to the Player object who is extending the invitation to
      the bot. Must be a valid player currently in a group with sufficient permissions
      to invite others.
  - name: botPlayer
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is being
      invited to join the group. This player must be a valid bot instance and not
      already in a group unless handled accordingly.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Group Invitation
    code: 'Player* inviter = ...; // Valid player in a group

      Player* bot = ...; // Valid bot player

      GroupIntegration::HandleBotGroupInvite(inviter, bot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal TrinityCore group management systems
    and may perform checks such as whether the inviter has permission to invite, if
    the bot is already in a group, or if the group has space for new members. It should
    be called only when both players are valid and in appropriate states.
  warnings: Ensure that the inviter player is actually in a group before calling this
    method; otherwise, unexpected behavior may occur. Also, verify that the botPlayer
    is properly initialized as a bot instance to avoid runtime errors or undefined
    behavior.
