  class: StormkeeperTracker
  method: ActivateProc
  signature: void StormkeeperTracker::ActivateProc(uint32 stacks)
documentation:
  brief: Activates a proc effect with the specified stack count for the StormkeeperTracker.
  description: The ActivateProc method is responsible for triggering a proc effect
    within the StormkeeperTracker class, applying a specific number of stacks to the
    proc mechanism. This method typically manages the internal state of the tracker
    to reflect that a proc has been activated, potentially modifying cooldowns, applying
    effects, or updating visual indicators. It is commonly used in conjunction with
    item procs or abilities that have a chance to activate based on certain conditions
    such as damage dealt or received. The method does not return any value and directly
    modifies the internal state of the tracker object.
  parameters:
  - name: stacks
    description: The number of stacks to apply to the proc effect. Valid values are
      typically positive integers, representing how many times the proc should be
      triggered or how much intensity it should have.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Proc Activation
    code: 'StormkeeperTracker tracker;

      tracker.ActivateProc(1); // Activate a single stack proc'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multi-Stack Proc Activation
    code: 'StormkeeperTracker tracker;

      tracker.ActivateProc(5); // Activate a proc with 5 stacks'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal cooldown tracking and may reset
    or modify the proc's timer. It is assumed to be called from within combat or game
    event handlers where procs are expected to occur.
