  class: GridInfo
  method: UpdateTimeTracker
  signature: void GridInfo::UpdateTimeTracker(time_t diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the time tracker for the grid information.
  description: The UpdateTimeTracker method is responsible for updating internal time
    tracking mechanisms within the GridInfo class. This method typically handles the
    management of time-based events or state changes that occur within a specific
    grid cell of the game world. It processes the time difference (diff) parameter
    to determine how much time has passed since the last update, and adjusts relevant
    internal timers or counters accordingly. The method is commonly invoked during
    the game loop to ensure that time-dependent systems within the grid remain synchronized
    with the overall server time.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference in seconds since the last update. This value
      represents how much time has elapsed and is used to advance internal timers
      or perform time-based calculations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    for (auto& grid : m_grids)\n    {\n  \
      \      grid.UpdateTimeTracker(sWorld->GetGameTimeDiff());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Grid Time Tracker with Custom Delta
    code: "void Map::UpdateGridTimeTrackers()\n{\n    time_t current_time = getMSTime();\n\
      \    time_t delta = current_time - m_lastUpdateTime;\n    \n    for (auto& grid_info\
      \ : m_grid_infos)\n    {\n        grid_info.UpdateTimeTracker(delta);\n    }\n\
      \    \n    m_lastUpdateTime = current_time;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the main game loop or update
    cycle. It's important to ensure that the diff parameter accurately reflects the
    time elapsed since the last call, as incorrect timing can lead to inconsistent
    behavior in time-sensitive systems such as respawn timers, quest progress, or
    NPC AI behaviors.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or negative time difference may cause
    unexpected behavior in time-based systems. Ensure that the diff value is always
    a positive number representing actual elapsed time.
