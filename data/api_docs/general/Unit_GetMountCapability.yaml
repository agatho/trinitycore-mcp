  method: GetMountCapability
  signature: const MountCapabilityEntry * Unit::GetMountCapability(uint32 mountType)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the mount capability entry for a specified mount type.
  description: This method retrieves the mount capability entry associated with a
    specific mount type from the unit's data. It is used to determine what mount capabilities
    are available for a given mount type, including whether the mount is usable, locked,
    or has any special restrictions. The method provides access to mount-related data
    that can be used in various game mechanics such as mount selection, validation,
    and player progression systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the MountCapabilityEntry structure which contains
    information about the mount capability for the specified mount type. If no valid
    entry exists for the mount type, it returns nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const MountCapabilityEntry* entry = unit->GetMountCapability(123);\nif\
      \ (entry)\n{\n    // Process the mount capability\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other mount-related APIs
    to determine if a player can mount or if a mount is available. It may be called
    during mount validation or when checking player progress for specific mounts.
  warnings: The returned pointer should not be dereferenced without checking for null,
    as it could lead to memory access violations if the entry does not exist.
