  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: GetCompletedQuests
  signature: int QuestTurnIn::GetCompletedQuests(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of completed quests for a specified player character.
  description: The GetCompletedQuests method calculates and returns the total number
    of quests that have been successfully completed by the given player character.
    This method is typically used within the context of quest management systems,
    such as those found in automated botting scripts or quest completion tracking
    utilities. It iterates through the player's quest log to identify all entries
    marked as completed and returns a count of these quests. The method assumes that
    the player object passed to it is valid and properly initialized within the game
    world.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object for which the completed quest count
      will be retrieved. This parameter must not be null and should represent an active
      player character in the game world.
  returns: An integer value representing the total number of quests that have been
    marked as completed by the specified player. Returns zero if no quests are completed
    or if the player object is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this points to a valid Player object

      int completedCount = QuestTurnIn::GetCompletedQuests(myBot);

      printf("Player has completed %d quests\n", completedCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Completion Logic
    code: "void CheckQuestProgress(Player* player)\n{\n    int completed = QuestTurnIn::GetCompletedQuests(player);\n\
      \    if (completed > 0)\n    {\n        // Perform actions based on completed\
      \ quests\n        printf(\"Player has %d completed quests\\n\", completed);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal quest log structure of TrinityCore and
    may not reflect quests that are marked as complete but not yet saved to the database.
    It is recommended to ensure that the player object passed is fully initialized
    and connected to the game world before calling this function.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer or an uninitialized Player object to this method
    will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate the player
    object before invoking this method.
