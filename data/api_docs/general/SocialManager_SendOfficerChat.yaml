documentation:
  brief: Sends a message to all officers in the player's social list
  description: The SendOfficerChat method broadcasts a specified message to all players
    who are marked as officers within the current player's social list. This functionality
    is typically used for guild-related communications where only guild officers should
    receive the message. The method returns true if the message was successfully queued
    for transmission, and false if there were issues with sending or processing the
    message. Officers in this context refer to players with officer permissions in
    the guild, not necessarily players with administrative roles in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: message
    description: The chat message string to be sent to all officers in the social
      list. Must be a valid UTF-8 encoded string with appropriate length restrictions
      for chat messages.
  returns: Returns true if the message was successfully queued for delivery to officers,
    false otherwise. The method may return false if the player has no officers in
    their social list, if the message is empty or invalid, or if there are system
    errors during transmission.
  examples:
  - title: Send Officer Chat Message
    code: "if (player->GetSocial()->SendOfficerChat(\"Meeting at 8 PM in the guild\
      \ hall!\")) {\n    // Message sent successfully\n} else {\n    // Handle send\
      \ failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the context of the player's social manager and
    relies on the underlying social list structure. It is designed to work with the
    guild officer system, where players are marked as officers through guild permissions.
    The actual delivery of messages depends on the network layer and may be subject
    to rate limiting or other server-side restrictions.
  warnings: This method only sends messages to players who are in the current player's
    social list and have officer status. It does not send to all guild members, only
    those specifically marked as officers. Ensure that the message content is appropriate
    for officer-only communication to avoid unintended exposure of information.
