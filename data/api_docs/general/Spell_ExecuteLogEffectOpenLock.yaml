  method: ExecuteLogEffectOpenLock
  signature: void Spell::ExecuteLogEffectOpenLock(int effect, Object * obj)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the log effect for opening locks, handling object interaction and
    lock mechanics.
  description: This method processes the execution of opening lock effects within
    the Spell system, specifically managing the interaction between spell effects
    and lock objects. It handles the logic for unlocking objects based on the effect
    index provided, ensuring proper game mechanics are applied when players interact
    with lockable objects. The method is part of the core spell execution flow and
    manages the specific behavior related to lock opening in World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: effect
    description: The effect index that determines which lock-related action to execute,
      typically representing the type of lock being opened or the effect being applied.
  - name: obj
    description: The object reference that represents the lockable item or container
      being interacted with. This could be a game object, item, or other object that
      supports lock mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Lock Opening Example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->ExecuteLogEffectOpenLock(1, obj);

      // Executes the opening of a lock with effect index 1 on object obj'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Lock Handling Example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      int effectIndex = 3;

      GameObject* obj = new GameObject();

      spell->ExecuteLogEffectOpenLock(effectIndex, obj);

      // Handles complex lock opening with multiple effects and object types'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell execution system and should be called only
    when a spell effect specifically requires lock opening behavior. Implementation
    details include handling of lock mechanics and object interaction, which may vary
    based on the type of object being opened.
  warnings: The method assumes that the object passed is valid and supports lock mechanics.
    Incorrect usage or passing invalid objects can lead to game-breaking behavior
    or crashes. Ensure proper validation before calling this method.
