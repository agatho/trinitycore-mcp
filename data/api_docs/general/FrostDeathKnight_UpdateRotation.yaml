  class: FrostDeathKnight
  method: UpdateRotation
  signature: void FrostDeathKnight::UpdateRotation(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the frost death knight's spell rotation based on the current target.
  description: The UpdateRotation method is responsible for determining and executing
    the optimal sequence of spells and abilities for a frost death knight AI during
    combat. This method evaluates the current state of the target, the player's resources
    (such as runes, energy, and cooldowns), and the game's tactical environment to
    decide which abilities should be cast next in order to maximize damage output
    or survivability. It typically integrates with the core TrinityCore AI framework
    to ensure proper behavior during encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Unit object representing the current combat target.
      This parameter is essential for determining spell targeting, range checks, and
      damage calculations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "void FrostDeathKnight::UpdateRotation(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (!target\
      \ || !target->IsAlive())\n        return;\n\n    // Logic to determine next\
      \ spell based on target state and resource availability\n    // Implementation\
      \ would include checks for rune usage, cooldowns, and targeting\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the AI system at regular intervals during
    combat. It should not be invoked manually unless implementing custom AI logic.
    The method assumes that the target is valid and alive before processing.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly without ensuring the target is valid
    and in combat; doing so may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also, avoid
    modifying internal state variables within this function unless explicitly intended
    for AI override logic.
