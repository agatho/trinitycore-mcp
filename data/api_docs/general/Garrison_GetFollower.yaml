  signature: const Follower * Garrison::GetFollower(uint64 dbId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a follower from the garrison by its database identifier.
  description: The GetFollower method retrieves a specific follower from the garrison
    using its unique database ID. This method is typically used in World of Warcraft's
    Garrison system to access individual followers for various operations such as
    displaying their information, modifying their stats, or managing their assignments.
    The returned pointer provides access to the follower's data and properties within
    the garrison context. The method performs a lookup in the internal garrison follower
    storage using the provided database ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to a Follower object if a follower with the specified
    database ID exists, or nullptr if no such follower is found in the garrison.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Check Follower
    code: "uint64 followerDbId = 123456789ULL;\nconst Follower* follower = garrison->GetFollower(followerDbId);\n\
      if (follower != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the follower object\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"Found follower with name: \" << follower->GetName() << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    std::cout << \"No follower found with ID: \" << followerDbId << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation which may have performance implications
    if called frequently in tight loops. The returned Follower pointer is valid only
    as long as the garrison and the specific follower remain in memory. Accessing
    the follower after it has been removed from the garrison may result in undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: The returned pointer should not be stored for extended periods as the
    follower might be destroyed or removed from the garrison. Always check for null
    return values before using the returned pointer to avoid segmentation faults.
