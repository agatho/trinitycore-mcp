  method: AcceptBestQuests
  signature: void QuestManager::AcceptBestQuests()
documentation:
  brief: Accepts the best available quests for the player based on quest flags and
    availability.
  description: The AcceptBestQuests method automatically selects and accepts the most
    suitable quests available to the player from the current quest givers. It evaluates
    quest eligibility, including level requirements, quest flags, and player state,
    to determine which quests should be accepted. This method is typically used when
    a player interacts with a quest giver who has multiple available quests, and the
    system needs to select the optimal one based on game logic. The method does not
    require explicit parameters as it operates on the current player's quest state
    and available quests.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      QuestManager& qm = player->GetQuestManager();

      qm.AcceptBestQuests();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the core quest system when
    a player interacts with a quest giver. It respects quest flags such as QUEST_FLAG_AUTO_ACCEPT
    and may not accept quests that are marked as hidden or invalid for the current
    player state.
  warnings: Calling this method directly without ensuring proper quest giver interaction
    may lead to unexpected behavior or quest acceptance failures. Ensure that the
    player is in a valid state with available quests before invoking this method.
