documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the GuildBankManager class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the GuildBankManager
    class, providing global access to a single instance of the guild bank management
    system. This method ensures that only one GuildBankManager object exists throughout
    the application lifecycle, centralizing all guild bank operations and data handling.
    The returned instance manages guild bank tabs, items, and access permissions across
    all realms and instances within the TrinityCore server environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton GuildBankManager instance. The method never
    returns NULL as it's implemented as a proper singleton with guaranteed instantiation.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing GuildBankManager instance
    code: 'GuildBankManager* bankManager = GuildBankManager::instance();

      // Use the manager to perform guild bank operations

      bankManager->UpdateGuildBankTabs(guildId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it's implemented using a static local variable
    pattern which ensures proper initialization in a multi-threaded environment. The
    singleton instance is created on first access and persists for the entire application
    lifetime.
