documentation:
  brief: Checks if the bot action is valid and can be executed
  description: The IsValid method determines whether a BotAction object has been properly
    initialized and contains valid data for execution. This method typically verifies
    that all required parameters are set, the action type is supported, and the bot
    state allows for the action to be performed. It serves as a safety check before
    attempting to execute a bot action to prevent runtime errors or invalid operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot action is valid and can be executed, false otherwise.
    A return value of false typically indicates that the action has not been properly
    configured or is in an invalid state for execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation check
    code: "if (botAction.IsValid()) {\n    // Proceed with executing the bot action\n\
      \    botAction.Execute();\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid action case\n   \
      \ LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Invalid bot action detected\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in bot command processing
    code: "void ProcessBotCommand(BotAction& action) {\n    if (!action.IsValid())\
      \ {\n        SendErrorMessage(\"Invalid bot command\");\n        return;\n \
      \   }\n    // Proceed with valid action execution\n    action.Execute();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before executing any bot action to ensure
    proper state. It may perform lightweight validation checks such as verifying non-null
    pointers, checking for valid action types, and ensuring required fields are populated.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or improperly constructed BotAction
    object may lead to undefined behavior. Always ensure the object is properly constructed
    before calling IsValid().
