  class: SocialManager
  method: IsInGuild
  signature: bool SocialManager::IsInGuild() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player is currently a member of a guild.
  description: The IsInGuild method determines if the player associated with the SocialManager
    instance belongs to any guild within the game world. This method performs a simple
    lookup against the player's current guild membership status and returns true if
    the player has been assigned to a guild, or false if they are not currently in
    any guild. The check is typically used in gameplay logic to enable or disable
    features that require guild participation, such as guild chat, guild commands,
    or guild-specific quests. This method does not validate the existence of the guild
    itself, only whether the player has a guild assignment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently in a guild, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Membership Check
    code: "if (player->GetSocial()->IsInGuild()) {\n    // Player is in a guild, allow\
      \ guild-specific actions\n    SendGuildChatMessage(\"Welcome to the guild!\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Player not in guild, show appropriate message\n    SendSystemMessage(\"\
      You must be in a guild to perform this action.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal guild membership state maintained by the
    SocialManager. It should be called only when the player object is valid and initialized.
    The result of this check may change during gameplay if a player joins or leaves
    a guild, so it's recommended to re-evaluate this condition when necessary.
