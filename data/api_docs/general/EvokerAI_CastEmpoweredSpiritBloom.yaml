  class: EvokerAI
  method: CastEmpoweredSpiritBloom
  signature: void EvokerAI::CastEmpoweredSpiritBloom(int * target, EmpowermentLevel
    level)
documentation:
  brief: Casts the Empowered Spirit Bloom spell with the specified target and empowerment
    level.
  description: The CastEmpoweredSpiritBloom method is used by EvokerAI to execute
    the Empowered Spirit Bloom spell on a designated target. This spell is a key ability
    for evokers, providing a powerful healing or damage effect based on the empowerment
    level. The method takes an integer pointer to the target and an EmpowermentLevel
    enum value that determines the spell's potency and effects. The AI will handle
    the spell casting logic including cooldowns, mana costs, and targeting validation.
    This method is typically invoked during combat situations where the evoker needs
    to utilize its empowered abilities for optimal performance.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit's identifier.
      This value should correspond to a valid GameObject, Creature, or Player GUID
      within the current map context.
  - name: level
    description: EmpowermentLevel enum value indicating the empowerment state of the
      spell. Valid values typically include LOW, MEDIUM, and HIGH, determining the
      spell's damage/healing output and duration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with target and empowerment level
    code: 'int targetGuid = 12345;

      EvokerAI* evoker = ...;

      evoker->CastEmpoweredSpiritBloom(&targetGuid, EmpowermentLevel::HIGH);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with dynamic target selection
    code: "Unit* target = SelectBestHealingTarget();\nif (target)\n{\n    int targetGuid\
      \ = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n    evoker->CastEmpoweredSpiritBloom(&targetGuid,\
      \ EmpowermentLevel::MEDIUM);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AI has already validated that the target is
    within range and that the spell can be cast. The method does not perform any validation
    on the target or empowerment level parameters, so callers should ensure these
    values are valid before invoking the method.
  warnings: The target parameter must point to a valid GUID; passing an invalid or
    null pointer may cause undefined behavior. The EmpowermentLevel parameter should
    match one of the predefined enum values, otherwise the spell behavior may be unpredictable.
