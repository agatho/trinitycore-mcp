  method: WindwalkerHitComboTracker
  signature: void WindwalkerHitComboTracker::WindwalkerHitComboTracker()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the WindwalkerHitComboTracker class for tracking
    hit combinations in Windwalker Monk gameplay.
  description: The WindwalkerHitComboTracker constructor initializes internal state
    variables and data structures required for tracking combo points and hit combinations
    specific to the Windwalker Monk specialization in World of Warcraft. This tracker
    is used primarily during combat to monitor the sequence of hits that generate
    combo points, which are essential for executing Windwalker abilities like Spinning
    Crane Kick and Storm, Earth, and Fire. The class maintains state information about
    current combo point count, last hit type, and timing of recent hits to ensure
    proper ability activation and cooldown management. This initialization occurs
    when a Windwalker Monk enters combat or when the tracker is explicitly instantiated
    by the game engine.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic instantiation of WindwalkerHitComboTracker
    code: 'WindwalkerHitComboTracker tracker;

      // Initializes a new combo tracker for Windwalker Monk combat

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when a Windwalker Monk character is created or enters combat. Developers should
    not manually instantiate this class unless implementing custom combat tracking
    logic. The tracker automatically integrates with the player's combat state and
    ability cooldown systems.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly in gameplay code without understanding
    its integration with the core combat system. Incorrect usage may lead to improper
    combo point tracking and broken ability mechanics for Windwalker Monks.
