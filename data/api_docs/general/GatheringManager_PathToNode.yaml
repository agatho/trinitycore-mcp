  class: GatheringManager
  method: PathToNode
  signature: bool GatheringManager::PathToNode(const GatheringNode & node)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a movement path to the specified gathering node for the player.
  description: The PathToNode method calculates and begins a movement path toward
    a given GatheringNode, typically used in World of Warcraft's gathering systems
    such as mining, herbalism, or skinning. It leverages the underlying navigation
    system to find a valid route from the current player position to the node's location.
    The method returns true if the path calculation and initiation were successful,
    and false otherwise. This function is commonly called when a player selects a
    resource node to gather from, ensuring that the character moves efficiently to
    the target location.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the movement path to the gathering node was successfully
    initiated; returns false if the path could not be calculated or the node is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GatheringNode node;\n// Assume node is initialized with valid data\nbool\
      \ success = gatheringManager.PathToNode(node);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Movement\
      \ started successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's current position and the node's location
    to calculate a path. It assumes that the node is within the same map or zone as
    the player. The actual movement execution depends on the game's movement system
    and may be interrupted by environmental factors such as obstacles or combat.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring that the node is valid or accessible
    may result in an invalid path, leading to a failed return value. Ensure the node
    is properly initialized and located within the player's current map before invoking
    this function.
