  signature: void DemonHunterAI::~DemonHunterAI()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a DemonHunterAI instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The DemonHunterAI destructor is automatically invoked when a DemonHunterAI
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory, resets internal state variables,
    and performs necessary deinitialization tasks for the demon hunter's AI behavior.
    In the context of TrinityCore's architecture, this destructor is part of the AI
    system that governs NPC demon hunter behavior in World of Warcraft. It handles
    cleanup of AI-related data structures and ensures no memory leaks occur when demon
    hunter creatures are removed from the game world or their AI control is relinquished.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of DemonHunterAI
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    DemonHunterAI* ai = new DemonHunterAI(creature);\n\
      \    // ... AI usage ...\n    delete ai; // Destructor called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is typically not called directly by developers. It's automatically
    invoked during object lifetime management. Developers should ensure that all references
    to the DemonHunterAI object are properly cleared before deletion to prevent dangling
    pointers.
