  signature: bool DependencyValidator::TestMySQLConnectivity()
documentation:
  brief: Tests the connectivity to the MySQL database used by the TrinityCore server.
  description: The TestMySQLConnectivity method attempts to establish a connection
    to the MySQL database configured for the TrinityCore server. It performs a basic
    validation check to ensure that the database is accessible and responsive. This
    method is typically used during server startup or configuration validation to
    confirm that all required dependencies are properly configured before proceeding
    with normal operations. The method does not perform any complex queries but rather
    ensures that the connection parameters (host, port, username, password, database
    name) are valid and that the MySQL service is reachable.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the MySQL connection is successfully established and validated;
    returns false if the connection fails or cannot be established due to incorrect
    configuration, network issues, or database unavailability.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in server initialization
    code: "if (!sDependencyValidator->TestMySQLConnectivity()) {\n    std::cerr <<\
      \ \"Failed to connect to MySQL database. Server cannot start.\" << std::endl;\n\
      \    return false;\n}\nstd::cout << \"MySQL connection successful. Proceeding\
      \ with server startup.\" << std::endl;"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the TrinityCore server initialization
    process to validate database connectivity before loading any world data or accepting
    client connections. It may involve a simple ping or SELECT query to verify that
    the database is responsive. The implementation likely uses the existing database
    connection pool or creates a temporary connection for testing purposes.
  warnings: If this method returns false, it indicates a critical configuration issue
    that must be resolved before the server can function properly. Ignoring a failed
    MySQL connectivity test may lead to runtime errors when attempting to access database
    resources later in the server lifecycle.
