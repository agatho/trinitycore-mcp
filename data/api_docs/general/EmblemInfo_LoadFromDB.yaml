documentation:
  brief: Loads emblem information from the database into the EmblemInfo object
  description: The LoadFromDB method retrieves emblem data from the database and populates
    the current EmblemInfo instance with the retrieved values. This method is typically
    used during character or guild loading processes to ensure that emblem-related
    data such as colors, patterns, and symbols are correctly initialized. The method
    expects a valid database connection and appropriate field mapping to be set up
    prior to invocation. It performs internal validation on loaded data to ensure
    consistency and integrity of the emblem configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the emblem data was successfully loaded from the database
    and validated; returns false if the operation failed due to database errors, missing
    data, or invalid field values.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Character Loading
    code: "EmblemInfo emblem;\nint fields[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}; // Example field values\n\
      if (emblem.LoadFromDB(fields)) {\n    // Emblem loaded successfully\n    printf(\"\
      Emblem loaded with ID: %d\\n\", emblem.GetId());\n} else {\n    // Handle load\
      \ failure\n    printf(\"Failed to load emblem data\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the database connection is already established and
    that the fields array contains valid data in the expected order. The method may
    perform additional internal validation steps which could impact performance if
    called frequently.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper database setup or with invalid field
    data can lead to undefined behavior or incomplete emblem configuration. Ensure
    that all required database fields are properly populated before invoking this
    method.
