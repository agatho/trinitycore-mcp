  class: HunterAI
  method: NeedsToKite
  signature: bool HunterAI::NeedsToKite(int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the hunter should use kiting behavior against a target.
  description: The NeedsToKite method evaluates the current combat situation for a
    hunter AI to decide if it should employ kiting tactics, which involve maintaining
    distance from the target while dealing damage. This decision is based on factors
    such as the hunter's current health, the target's proximity, available ranged
    attacks, and the overall threat level. The method returns true when kiting behavior
    is recommended, and false otherwise. It may also populate an integer pointer with
    the ID of the target that requires kiting behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer that will be set to the target's GUID if kiting
      is needed; can be null if only boolean result is required.
  returns: True if the hunter should kite the target, false otherwise. When true and
    target pointer is provided, it will contain the GUID of the relevant target.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if kiting is needed
    code: "if (hunterAI->NeedsToKite(nullptr)) {\n    // Perform kiting behavior\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check kiting and get target GUID
    code: "int targetGuid = 0;\nif (hunterAI->NeedsToKite(&targetGuid)) {\n    //\
      \ Use targetGuid to determine which enemy to kite\n    Creature* target = unit->GetMap()->GetCreature(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Unit,\
      \ targetGuid));\n    // Begin kiting logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI decision-making system for hunters in TrinityCore.
    It integrates with the hunter's combat state machine and considers various factors
    like health percentage, distance to target, and spell availability. The implementation
    may vary depending on the specific hunter class or specialization.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer passed to this method is valid and properly
    initialized to avoid undefined behavior. This method should only be called during
    active combat situations where kiting decisions are relevant.
