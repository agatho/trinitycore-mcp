  signature: void Unit::ApplyControlStatesIfNeeded()
documentation:
  brief: Applies control states to unit based on current game conditions and player
    status.
  description: This method manages the application of control states to a Unit object,
    ensuring that appropriate game mechanics are applied based on the unit's current
    status. It typically handles situations where a unit needs to be controlled or
    uncontrolled based on player state, such as when a player is in combat or when
    a unit is under player control. The method ensures that proper control states
    are applied to maintain game balance and prevent exploits.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->ApplyControlStatesIfNeeded();'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include checking for player control status, applying
    appropriate control states based on game mechanics, and ensuring that the method
    does not cause conflicts with existing control systems. Performance considerations
    involve avoiding unnecessary calls when control state is already applied.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly in most cases; it's typically
    invoked by internal game systems to manage unit control states. Avoid calling
    this method repeatedly without proper checks to prevent potential control state
    conflicts or game mechanics issues.
