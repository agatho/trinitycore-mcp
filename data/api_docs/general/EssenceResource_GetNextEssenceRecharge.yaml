  class: EssenceResource
  method: GetNextEssenceRecharge
  signature: uint32 EssenceResource::GetNextEssenceRecharge() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the timestamp when the next essence recharge will
    occur for the resource.
  description: The GetNextEssenceRecharge method determines the next time at which
    an essence resource will be replenished based on the current state of the resource
    and its recharge mechanics. This method is typically used in conjunction with
    game timers or cooldown systems to manage when players can next use or gain essence
    resources. The returned value represents a Unix timestamp (in seconds) indicating
    when the recharge will complete. If no recharge is pending, it may return 0 or
    the current time, depending on implementation details. This method does not modify
    any internal state of the resource and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the Unix timestamp (in seconds) when the next
    essence recharge will complete. Returns 0 if no recharge is scheduled or pending.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 nextRechargeTime = player->GetEssenceResource()->GetNextEssenceRecharge();\n\
      if (nextRechargeTime > 0)\n{\n    uint32 currentTime = time(nullptr);\n    uint32\
      \ timeRemaining = nextRechargeTime - currentTime;\n    printf(\"Next essence\
      \ recharge in %u seconds\\n\", timeRemaining);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of the last recharge time and the
    configured recharge duration. It assumes that the resource's recharge logic is
    properly initialized and active. The returned timestamp should be compared against
    the current system time to determine remaining cooldowns or availability.
  warnings: Ensure that the EssenceResource object is valid before calling this method,
    as calling it on a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also, be aware
    that depending on implementation, the return value might not reflect real-time
    changes if the resource state has been modified externally without updating internal
    tracking variables.
