  class: IBotSpawner
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool IBotSpawner::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot spawner system, setting up necessary resources and configurations
    for creating and managing AI-controlled bots.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the IBotSpawner instance for operation
    by performing essential setup tasks such as loading configuration data, initializing
    internal data structures, and establishing connections or references needed for
    bot creation. This method should be called once during system startup or when
    the spawner needs to be reinitialized after a reset. It ensures that all required
    dependencies are available before attempting to spawn bots. The initialization
    process may involve reading from database tables, caching configuration values,
    or preparing thread-safe resources. If initialization fails, subsequent calls
    to bot spawning methods may not function correctly until a successful re-initialization
    occurs.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initialization was successful and all required setup
    completed without errors; returns false if any critical failure occurred during
    the initialization process, indicating that the spawner is not ready for use.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "IBotSpawner* spawner = new BotSpawner();\nif (spawner->Initialize()) {\n\
      \    // Spawner is ready to create bots\n    std::cout << \"Bot spawner initialized\
      \ successfully.\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n\
      \    std::cerr << \"Failed to initialize bot spawner.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called only once during the lifetime of a bot spawner
    instance. Repeated calls may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks if not
    properly handled by the implementation. The method should be thread-safe, but
    it's recommended to call it from a single-threaded context during system initialization.
  warnings: Calling this method after the spawner has already been initialized without
    proper cleanup may result in inconsistent state or memory leaks. Ensure that any
    existing bot instances are properly terminated before calling Initialize() again.
