documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new SmartScriptHolder instance with default values.
  description: The SmartScriptHolder constructor initializes a new instance of the
    SmartScriptHolder class. This class is used to manage and store smart script data
    for AI behaviors in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore emulation. The constructor
    sets up internal data structures and initializes member variables to their default
    states, preparing the object for use in script execution contexts. It ensures
    that all contained smart script entries are properly initialized before being
    processed by the AI system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new SmartScriptHolder instance
    code: 'SmartScriptHolder* holder = new SmartScriptHolder();

      // The holder is now ready to be populated with smart script data

      // and will be used by the AI system for behavior execution'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when creating AI script containers. Developers should not directly instantiate
    SmartScriptHolder objects unless implementing custom AI behaviors or debugging
    smart scripts. The class manages memory and lifecycle automatically within the
    core AI system.
