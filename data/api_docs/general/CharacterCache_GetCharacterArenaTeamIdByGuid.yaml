  method: GetCharacterArenaTeamIdByGuid
  signature: uint32 CharacterCache::GetCharacterArenaTeamIdByGuid(int guid, uint8
    type) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the arena team ID associated with a character given their GUID
    and arena type.
  description: The GetCharacterArenaTeamIdByGuid method is used to look up the unique
    identifier of an arena team that a specific character belongs to. This method
    requires both the character's globally unique identifier (GUID) and the type of
    arena (such as 2v2, 3v3, or 5v5) to determine which arena team the character is
    part of. It is typically used in arena-related systems within TrinityCore to manage
    player participation in different types of competitive battlegrounds. The method
    accesses internal character cache data structures to efficiently retrieve this
    information without requiring database queries for every lookup.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The globally unique identifier (GUID) of the character whose arena
      team ID is being retrieved. This value uniquely identifies a player within the
      game world.
  - name: type
    description: The type of arena the character is participating in. Valid values
      are typically 2 (for 2v2), 3 (for 3v3), or 5 (for 5v5). This parameter determines
      which specific arena team ID to return.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the arena team ID that the character
    belongs to for the specified arena type. If the character is not part of any arena
    team for the given type, it returns 0, indicating no association.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 teamId = CharacterCache::GetCharacterArenaTeamIdByGuid(123456, 3);\n\
      if (teamId != 0)\n{\n    // Character is in an arena team\n    printf(\"Player\
      \ belongs to arena team ID: %u\\n\", teamId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player is\
      \ not in any arena team for 3v3\n    printf(\"Player is not in any 3v3 arena\
      \ team.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Arena Types
    code: "int playerGuid = 123456;\nfor (uint8 type : {2, 3, 5})\n{\n    uint32 teamId\
      \ = CharacterCache::GetCharacterArenaTeamIdByGuid(playerGuid, type);\n    if\
      \ (teamId != 0)\n    {\n        printf(\"Player is in %uv%u arena team ID: %u\\\
      n\", type, type, teamId);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        printf(\"Player is\
      \ not in any %uv%u arena team.\\n\", type, type);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on cached character data and should only be called after
    the character's arena team information has been loaded into memory. The cache
    is typically populated during login or when arena team data is accessed for the
    first time. This function does not perform any database lookups directly, making
    it efficient for frequent calls within arena-related systems.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID provided corresponds to a valid character in the
    game world; otherwise, unexpected behavior may occur. Also, be aware that this
    method will return 0 if the character is not part of an arena team for the given
    type, which might be confused with an error condition.
