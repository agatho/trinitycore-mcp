  brief: Teleports units to specified locations using spell effects
  description: This method handles the teleportation of units based on spell effects,
    typically used in spell mechanics where units are moved from one location to another.
    It processes the teleportation logic for various spell effects that involve unit
    movement, including handling of destination coordinates and potential target restrictions.
    The method is part of the core spell handling system and operates within the context
    of World of Warcraft's spell mechanics, ensuring proper execution of teleport-related
    effects.

    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->EffectTeleportUnits();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell execution and requires proper
    handling of target positions. Implementation may involve checking for valid destination
    coordinates and ensuring that the teleportation does not occur in invalid locations
    such as walls or water.
  warnings: Improper handling of teleportation can lead to units being placed in invalid
    locations, potentially causing game crashes or unexpected behavior. Ensure that
    destination coordinates are properly validated before execution.
