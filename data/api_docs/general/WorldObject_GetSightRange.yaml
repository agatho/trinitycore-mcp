  class: WorldObject
  method: GetSightRange
  signature: float WorldObject::GetSightRange(const WorldObject * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the sight range of this WorldObject to a target WorldObject.
  description: The GetSightRange method computes the maximum distance at which this
    WorldObject can see the specified target object. This calculation takes into account
    various factors such as the object's vision capabilities, environmental conditions,
    and game mechanics like line-of-sight blocking. The returned value represents
    the effective sight range in yards. This method is commonly used for determining
    whether an object can detect or interact with another object within its visual
    range.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the sight range in yards to the target object.
    Returns 0.0 if the target is null or if there's no line of sight between the objects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: float range = player->GetSightRange(npc);
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if Target is Within Sight Range
    code: "if (player->GetSightRange(target) > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Target is within sight\
      \ range\n    player->SendPacket(somePacket);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method considers the object's current state and environment when calculating
    sight range, including potential obstacles or visual impairments. It may return
    different values based on the specific implementation of the WorldObject subclass
    (Player, Creature, GameObject, etc.).
