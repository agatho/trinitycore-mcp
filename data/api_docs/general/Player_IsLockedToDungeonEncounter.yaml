  signature: bool Player::IsLockedToDungeonEncounter(uint32 dungeonEncounterId, int
    difficulty) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is locked to a specific dungeon encounter.
  description: This method checks if the player is currently locked to a specific
    dungeon encounter, typically used for determining if a player can access certain
    content based on their current lock status. The method returns true if the player
    is locked to the specified encounter, false otherwise. This functionality is commonly
    used in World of Warcraft's dungeon and raid content systems where players must
    be locked to specific encounters before they can progress through them.
  parameters:
  - name: dungeonEncounterId
    description: The unique identifier for the dungeon encounter being checked. This
      corresponds to the ID of a specific encounter within a dungeon or raid instance.
  - name: difficulty
    description: The difficulty level of the encounter being checked. This can be
      1 for normal, 2 for heroic, or 3 for mythic difficulty levels.
  returns: Returns true if the player is locked to the specified dungeon encounter,
    false otherwise. The method may return false if the player has not yet been locked
    to that encounter or if they are not currently in a locked state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsLockedToDungeonEncounter(1234, 1)) {\n    // Player is locked\
      \ to normal difficulty encounter 1234\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "bool locked = player->IsLockedToDungeonEncounter(5678, 3);\nif (locked)\
      \ {\n    // Player is locked to mythic difficulty encounter 5678\n    // Perform\
      \ actions that require locked access\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other lock-related functions
    and may be part of a broader system for managing player access to dungeon content.
    The implementation likely involves checking against internal lock state variables
    within the player object.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a player can enter a dungeon,
    as it only checks if they are locked to a specific encounter. Players may still
    have access to a dungeon even if they are not locked to a particular encounter.
