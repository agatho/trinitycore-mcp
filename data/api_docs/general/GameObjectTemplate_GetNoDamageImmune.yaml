documentation:
  brief: Returns the damage immunity flag for the game object template.
  description: The GetNoDamageImmune method retrieves the immunity state of a game
    object template against damage. This flag determines whether the object is immune
    to all forms of damage, including physical, magical, and environmental damage.
    The returned value is typically used in game logic to bypass damage calculations
    for specific game objects such as certain doors, chests, or interactive environment
    elements that should not be damaged by player actions or environmental effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the damage immunity state of the game object.
    The value is usually 0 (no immunity) or 1 (immune to all damage). Higher values
    may indicate specific immunity types or categories depending on how the flag is
    interpreted in the TrinityCore codebase.
  examples:
  - title: Check if GameObject is immune to damage
    code: "GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (goTemplate && goTemplate->GetNoDamageImmune() > 0)\n{\n    // This game\
      \ object is immune to all damage\n    sLog->outString(\"GameObject ID %u is\
      \ immune to damage.\", 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly accesses a cached value from the GameObjectTemplate
    data structure. The immunity flag is typically set during database loading or
    template initialization and does not change at runtime unless explicitly modified
    by server-side code.
