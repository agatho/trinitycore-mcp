  class: RestorationHoTTracker
  method: ApplyRejuvenation
  signature: void RestorationHoTTracker::ApplyRejuvenation(int guid, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a Rejuvenation spell effect to a target with specified duration.
  description: The ApplyRejuvenation method initiates or refreshes the Rejuvenation
    healing-over-time (HoT) effect on a specified target player. This method is typically
    used in the context of Druid restoration spells within the TrinityCore framework.
    It sets up the necessary tracking for the HoT, including duration and healing
    ticks. The method likely interacts with the target's aura system to maintain the
    spell effect over time, ensuring periodic healing application according to game
    mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target player who will receive
      the Rejuvenation effect. This is typically a 32-bit unsigned integer representing
      the object's identifier in the World of Warcraft database.
  - name: duration
    description: The total duration in milliseconds for which the Rejuvenation effect
      should remain active. This value determines how long the HoT will tick and apply
      healing to the target.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'RestorationHoTTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyRejuvenation(12345, 12000); // Apply Rejuvenation to player with
      GUID 12345 for 12 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Dynamic Duration
    code: 'uint32 spellDuration = 12000; // 12 seconds

      uint32 targetGuid = player->GetGUID();

      tracker.ApplyRejuvenation(targetGuid, spellDuration);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely integrates with TrinityCore's aura system and event handling
    mechanisms to manage the periodic healing ticks. It may also interact with the
    target's health regeneration system or combat state tracking. The implementation
    should ensure proper cleanup of the HoT when it expires or is removed.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID corresponds to a valid player object before calling
    this method, as invalid GUIDs could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also,
    be aware that applying Rejuvenation to an already affected target may overwrite
    or refresh existing effects depending on implementation details.
