  class: BotWorldPositioner
  method: GetZoneName
  signature: std::string BotWorldPositioner::GetZoneName(uint32 zoneId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the name of a zone corresponding to the given zone identifier.
  description: The GetZoneName method fetches the localized name of a specific zone
    within the World of Warcraft game world using its unique zone identifier. This
    function is typically used by AI systems or bots to understand spatial context
    and navigate the game environment effectively. The method operates on a cached
    lookup table or database query to retrieve zone names, ensuring fast access during
    gameplay operations. It assumes that the provided zone ID is valid and corresponds
    to an existing zone in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the localized name of the zone identified by the
    zoneId parameter. If the zone ID does not correspond to any known zone, an empty
    string may be returned depending on implementation behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 zoneId = 141; // Elwynn Forest

      std::string zoneName = botWorldPositioner.GetZoneName(zoneId);

      TC_LOG_INFO("bot", "Current zone: %s", zoneName.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal game data structures or cached zone
    information for performance. It should not be called excessively in tight loops
    due to potential lookup overhead. The returned string is localized based on the
    current client's language settings.
  warnings: Ensure that the zoneId parameter is valid before calling this method,
    as invalid IDs might lead to undefined behavior or empty string returns. This
    function may not be thread-safe if used concurrently without proper synchronization
    mechanisms.
