documentation:
  brief: Manages weapon swapping logic for warrior AI during combat.
  description: The HandleWeaponSwapping method in WarriorAI is responsible for determining
    and executing appropriate weapon swaps based on current combat conditions, player
    specialization, and available weapons. This method evaluates the warrior's current
    equipped weapons, checks for optimal weapon combinations (such as dual-wielding
    or switching to a two-handed weapon), and performs the necessary equipment changes
    to maximize damage output or defensive capabilities. It integrates with the AI
    decision-making system to ensure that weapon selection aligns with the warrior's
    tactical role in combat.

  - title: Basic usage within AI update loop
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    HandleWeaponSwapping();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically gets called during the AI update cycle and may involve
    checks for weapon durability, combat stance, and specialization-specific abilities.
    The implementation likely considers factors such as attack speed differences between
    weapons, damage per second calculations, and current target threat levels.
