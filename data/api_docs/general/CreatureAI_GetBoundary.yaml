  class: CreatureAI
  method: GetBoundary
  signature: const CreatureBoundary * CreatureAI::GetBoundary() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the boundary area defined for this creature's AI behavior.
  description: The GetBoundary method returns a pointer to the CreatureBoundary object
    that defines the allowed movement area for the creature controlled by this AI.
    This boundary is typically set during the creature's initialization or through
    AI configuration and restricts the creature's patrol routes, combat movement,
    and general behavior within a defined spatial limit. The returned pointer is const,
    ensuring that the boundary data cannot be modified externally through this interface.
    If no boundary has been set for the creature, the method may return nullptr, indicating
    that the creature has no restricted movement area.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to a CreatureBoundary object defining the creature's
    allowed movement area, or nullptr if no boundary is defined.
  examples:
  - title: Check if creature has a defined boundary
    code: "if (CreatureAI* ai = creature->GetAI())\n{\n    const CreatureBoundary*\
      \ boundary = ai->GetBoundary();\n    if (boundary)\n    {\n        // Creature\
      \ has a defined movement boundary\n        // Use boundary data for custom AI\
      \ logic\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // No boundary set - creature can move\
      \ freely\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The CreatureBoundary object returned by this method is managed internally
    by the AI system and should not be deleted or modified directly. The boundary
    data is typically initialized during creature creation or through script configuration.
    This method does not perform any locking or thread synchronization, so access
    should be considered safe only from within the same thread context where the AI
    operates.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-null return value means the creature will always
    stay within the boundary - additional AI logic may override boundary restrictions
    in certain situations. Also, the returned pointer is only valid as long as the
    AI and creature remain active; accessing it after the creature has been destroyed
    or despawned leads to undefined behavior.
