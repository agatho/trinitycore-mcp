documentation:
  brief: Removes the quest slot state for a specified quest slot and state.
  description: This method removes the quest slot state from a player's quest log,
    effectively clearing the specified slot's state for a given quest. It is used
    internally by TrinityCore to manage quest tracking and state management within
    the player's quest log. The method ensures that the specified slot and state combination
    are removed from the player's active quest tracking system, allowing for proper
    quest progression and state handling.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The quest slot number to remove the state from, typically ranging
      from 0-25. This represents the specific position in the player's quest log where
      the quest is stored.
  - name: state
    description: The quest state to remove from the specified slot. This represents
      the specific state (e.g., quest completion, objective progress) that should
      be cleared from the slot.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->RemoveQuestSlotState(0, 1);

      // Removes state 1 from slot 0'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during quest completion or when a quest is
    removed from the player's quest log. It ensures that the player's quest tracking
    system remains consistent and accurate.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect quest state tracking,
    potentially causing quests to appear incomplete or uncompleted in the player's
    quest log.
