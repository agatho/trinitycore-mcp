  method: StartEvent
  signature: bool GameEventMgr::StartEvent(uint16 event_id, bool overwrite)
documentation:
  brief: Activates a game event by its identifier, optionally overwriting existing
    events.
  description: The StartEvent method is used to activate a specific game event within
    the TrinityCore server. It takes an event ID and an optional overwrite flag that
    determines whether to replace any currently active event with the same ID. This
    method is typically invoked when a game event needs to be initiated, such as holidays
    or seasonal celebrations. The method returns true if the event was successfully
    started or false if it failed due to invalid parameters or internal errors. Game
    events in TrinityCore are managed through a central event manager and can affect
    various aspects of gameplay including NPC behavior, item spawns, and world conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: event_id
    description: The unique identifier of the game event to start. This ID must correspond
      to a valid event defined in the database.
  - name: overwrite
    description: If true, any currently active event with the same ID will be overwritten.
      If false, the method will not start the event if another instance is already
      active.
  returns: Returns true if the event was successfully started or updated; returns
    false if the event could not be started due to invalid parameters, internal errors,
    or if overwrite is false and an event with the same ID is already active.
  examples:
  - title: Start a game event without overwriting
    code: "if (sGameEventMgr->StartEvent(1234, false)) {\n    // Event started successfully\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Event 1234 started.\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to start\
      \ event\n    sLog->outString(\"Failed to start event 1234.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Start a game event with overwrite
    code: sGameEventMgr->StartEvent(5678, true); // Force start event 5678, overwriting
      any existing instance
    language: cpp
  notes: This method interacts with the global GameEventMgr singleton which maintains
    a list of active events. The event system in TrinityCore relies on database entries
    for event definitions and timing. When an event is started, it may trigger various
    hooks or scripts that modify game state.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid event_id will likely result in undefined
    behavior or silent failure. Ensure the event ID exists in your database before
    calling this function. Additionally, frequent calls to StartEvent without proper
    cooldowns might cause performance issues if not managed carefully.
