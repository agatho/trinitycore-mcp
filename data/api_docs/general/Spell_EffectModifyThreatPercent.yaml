  brief: Modifies threat percentage for spell effects in the World of Warcraft TrinityCore
    API
  description: This method adjusts the threat percentage applied to spell effects
    within the TrinityCore framework, specifically modifying how much threat is generated
    or modified when a spell hits target. The function operates on the spell's effect
    data and influences the behavior of threat generation during combat. It typically
    affects the calculation of threat values for spells that modify threat levels,
    such as those involving damage or healing spells that generate threat. This method
    is part of the core spell system implementation and is used to adjust the effectiveness
    of threat-modifying spells in various game mechanics contexts.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->EffectModifyThreatPercent();'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include the fact that this method likely modifies
    internal threat calculations based on spell effect parameters, and may involve
    adjustments to the threat generation formula. Performance considerations include
    potential impact on combat system calculations when used frequently. Thread safety
    is not explicitly mentioned but should be considered in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without proper context; it's
    part of internal spell handling mechanisms and requires correct spell effect parameters
    to function properly. Incorrect usage may lead to unexpected threat behavior or
    combat issues.
