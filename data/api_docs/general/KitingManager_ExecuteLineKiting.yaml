  signature: KitingResult KitingManager::ExecuteLineKiting(const KitingContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Executes line kiting behavior based on the provided kiting context.
  description: The ExecuteLineKiting method performs the core logic for executing
    a line-based kiting movement pattern. It evaluates the current kiting context,
    which includes target position, player state, and environmental factors, to determine
    the appropriate movement strategy. This method is typically used in AI-driven
    kiting behaviors where an NPC or player needs to maintain distance from a target
    while moving along a straight path. The execution considers factors such as movement
    speed, turning radius, and collision avoidance to ensure realistic kiting behavior.
    The method returns a KitingResult that indicates success or failure of the kiting
    operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a KitingResult enum value indicating the outcome of the kiting
    execution. Possible values may include KITING_SUCCESS, KITING_FAILED, KITING_INTERRUPTED,
    or other status codes depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecuteLineKiting
    code: "KitingContext context;\n// Configure context with target and player state\n\
      KitingResult result = kitingManager.ExecuteLineKiting(context);\nif (result\
      \ == KITING_SUCCESS) {\n    // Handle successful kiting\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the KitingContext has been properly initialized
    with valid data before calling. The implementation may involve complex pathfinding
    and movement calculations that could impact performance during high-frequency
    calls. Consider caching or optimizing context data to avoid redundant computations.
  warnings: Calling this method without a properly configured KitingContext may result
    in undefined behavior or failed kiting attempts. Ensure that all required fields
    in the context are populated before execution. The method may not handle edge
    cases such as invalid target positions or extreme environmental conditions gracefully.
