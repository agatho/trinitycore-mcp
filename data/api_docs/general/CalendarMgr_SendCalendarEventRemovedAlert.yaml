documentation:
  brief: Sends a calendar event removed alert to all affected players.
  description: The SendCalendarEventRemovedAlert method is responsible for notifying
    all players who are subscribed to or have interest in a specific calendar event
    that the event has been removed. This method ensures proper synchronization of
    calendar data across the game world by broadcasting the removal event to relevant
    users. It typically gets invoked when an event organizer deletes or cancels an
    event, and it handles the necessary communication to update client-side calendars
    accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: calendarEvent
    description: A constant reference to the CalendarEvent object that has been removed
      from the calendar system. This parameter contains all the metadata and details
      about the event being removed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing a Calendar Event and Sending Alert
    code: 'CalendarEvent event;

      // ... populate event data ...

      CalendarMgr::instance()->SendCalendarEventRemovedAlert(event);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely iterates through all players who are attending or have
    been invited to the specified calendar event and sends them a notification packet.
    It may also update internal tracking structures to reflect the removal of the
    event.
