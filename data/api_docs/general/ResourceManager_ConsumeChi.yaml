  method: ConsumeChi
  signature: void ResourceManager::ConsumeChi(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified amount of chi resource from the player
  description: The ConsumeChi method reduces the player's current chi resource by
    the specified amount. This method is typically used in game mechanics where abilities
    or effects require consuming chi as a resource cost. The method performs validation
    to ensure that the requested amount does not exceed the available chi. If the
    requested amount exceeds available chi, the method will consume all remaining
    chi. This method is commonly used in classes such as Monks who utilize chi as
    their primary resource for special abilities and attacks.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of chi to consume from the player's resource pool. Must
      be a non-negative integer value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chi Consumption
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->GetResourceManager()->ConsumeChi(10);

      // Consumes 10 chi from the player''s current resource pool'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Chi Consumption
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nResourceManager* rm = player->GetResourceManager();\n\
      uint32 chiToConsume = 25;\nif (rm->GetChi() >= chiToConsume)\n{\n    rm->ConsumeChi(chiToConsume);\n\
      \    // Perform ability effect\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle insufficient chi\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during ability execution or resource management
    events. The implementation should ensure thread safety when accessed from different
    game systems. It's recommended to check available chi before calling this method
    to prevent unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with a zero or negative value will have no effect
    on the chi pool. Ensure that the amount parameter is validated before calling
    to avoid unintended resource consumption.
