documentation:
  brief: Resets all statistics tracked by the BotSpawnEventBus instance.
  description: The ResetStats method clears and initializes all internal counters
    and tracking data within the BotSpawnEventBus class. This function is typically
    invoked to reset performance metrics, spawn event logs, or any accumulated statistical
    information related to bot spawning activities in the game environment. It ensures
    a clean state for subsequent operations without carrying over previous data. The
    method does not require any external inputs and performs its operation entirely
    within the object's scope.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotSpawnEventBus eventBus;

      // ... perform some bot spawning operations ...

      eventBus.ResetStats(); // Reset all tracked statistics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully during runtime as it may affect ongoing
    monitoring or logging of spawn events. It is recommended to call this only when
    a complete reset of statistics is required, such as at the start of a new session
    or after a major system update.
