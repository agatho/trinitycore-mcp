  signature: void DungeonBehavior::UpdateGroupFormation(Group * group, const DungeonEncounter
    & encounter)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the formation of a group during a dungeon encounter based on the
    current encounter state.
  description: The UpdateGroupFormation method is responsible for adjusting the positioning
    and grouping behavior of players within a dungeon environment. It takes a pointer
    to a Group object and a reference to a DungeonEncounter object, which contains
    information about the current encounter state. This method ensures that group
    members are properly positioned according to encounter mechanics, such as maintaining
    proper distance, facing directions, or formation layouts. The method is typically
    called during dynamic dungeon encounters where group positioning affects combat
    outcomes or quest progression.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group whose formation
      needs to be updated. Must not be null.
  - name: encounter
    description: Reference to a DungeonEncounter object containing current encounter
      state information including phase, location, and encounter-specific rules that
      affect group positioning.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in dungeon encounter handler
    code: "void OnEncounterStart(Group* group, const DungeonEncounter& encounter)\n\
      {\n    dungeonBehavior.UpdateGroupFormation(group, encounter);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating formation during dynamic encounter phase
    code: "void UpdateEncounterPhase(Group* group, const DungeonEncounter& encounter)\n\
      {\n    if (encounter.GetPhase() == PHASE_COMBAT)\n    {\n        dungeonBehavior.UpdateGroupFormation(group,\
      \ encounter);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the group's positioning system and may
    trigger visual updates for players. It should be called during appropriate encounter
    events rather than continuously to avoid performance overhead. The implementation
    might involve checking group member positions, adjusting movement paths, or modifying
    combat stance.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. This method modifies
    group state and should only be called when encounter conditions are appropriate
    for formation changes.
