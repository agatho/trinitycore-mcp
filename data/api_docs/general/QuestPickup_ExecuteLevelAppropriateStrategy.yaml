  class: QuestPickup
  method: ExecuteLevelAppropriateStrategy
  signature: void QuestPickup::ExecuteLevelAppropriateStrategy(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a level-appropriate quest pickup strategy for the specified bot
    player.
  description: The ExecuteLevelAppropriateStrategy method determines and applies an
    optimal quest pickup behavior based on the player's current level and game context.
    This method is typically used in AI-driven questing systems where bots need to
    make intelligent decisions about which quests to accept or pick up. It evaluates
    factors such as quest level requirements, available quest givers, and the bot's
    progression state to select the most appropriate quest for pickup. The strategy
    ensures that the bot follows a logical progression path while maintaining game
    balance and immersion.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will execute
      the quest pickup strategy. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot AI
    code: "void MyBotAI::OnQuestAccept(Player* player)\n{\n    QuestPickup pickup;\n\
      \    pickup.ExecuteLevelAppropriateStrategy(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal quest data structures and may
    cache results for performance. It should only be called when the bot is in a valid
    state for quest interaction.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior or crashes.
