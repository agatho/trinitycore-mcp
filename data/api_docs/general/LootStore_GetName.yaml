  class: LootStore
  method: GetName
  signature: const char * LootStore::GetName() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the name of the loot store.
  description: The GetName method retrieves the human-readable name associated with
    a LootStore instance. This name typically represents the identifier used to reference
    the loot table in the game's database or configuration files. The returned string
    is managed internally by the LootStore object and should not be modified or freed
    by the caller. This method is commonly used for debugging, logging, or displaying
    user-facing information about loot tables.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a null-terminated character string containing the name of
    the loot store. The returned pointer is valid only as long as the LootStore instance
    exists and should not be freed by the caller.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LootStore* store = sLootMgr->GetLootStore(12345);

      const char* name = store->GetName();

      printf("Loot store name: %s\n", name);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Debug Logging
    code: "for (auto& lootStore : sLootMgr->GetLootStores()) {\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"loot\"\
      , \"Processing loot store: {}\", lootStore->GetName());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is marked as const, indicating it does not modify the internal
    state of the LootStore object. The returned string pointer points to an internal
    buffer that is managed by the class and guaranteed to be valid during the lifetime
    of the LootStore instance.
