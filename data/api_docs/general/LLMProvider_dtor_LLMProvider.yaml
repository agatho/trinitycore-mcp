  method: ~LLMProvider
  signature: void LLMProvider::~LLMProvider()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an LLMProvider instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the LLMProvider class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or system resources that were acquired during
    the object's lifetime. This method ensures proper resource deallocation when the
    LLMProvider instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context
    of TrinityCore, this may involve releasing language model buffers, closing connections
    to external services, or freeing internal data structures used for large language
    model inference. The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime and
    should not be called manually.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of LLMProvider instance
    code: "void exampleFunction() {\n    LLMProvider provider; // Constructor called\n\
      \    // ... use provider ...\n} // Destructor automatically called here"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly virtual in C++ if the class has virtual methods.
    Since this is a base class, it's important that any derived classes properly implement
    their own destructors to ensure complete cleanup of resources. The LLMProvider
    destructor should be thread-safe if used in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke this destructor as it will lead to undefined behavior.
    Ensure that all pointers to LLMProvider objects are properly managed using smart
    pointers or RAII principles to avoid memory leaks.
