  class: TargetSelector
  method: GetMaxTargets
  signature: uint32 TargetSelector::GetMaxTargets() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum number of targets that can be selected by this target
    selector.
  description: The GetMaxTargets method retrieves the upper limit of targets that
    a TargetSelector instance is configured to choose from. This value typically defines
    how many enemies or allies the AI will consider when selecting targets for spells,
    abilities, or actions. The returned value may be influenced by various factors
    such as spell properties, AI behavior settings, or game mechanics like targetting
    restrictions. It's commonly used in conjunction with other targeting logic to
    determine valid target sets within the context of a creature's AI decision-making
    process.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of targets this selector
    can choose. Returns 0 if no targets are allowed or if the selector is not properly
    initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Context
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override {\n        TargetSelector selector;\n        uint32 maxTargets =\
      \ selector.GetMaxTargets();\n        if (maxTargets > 0) {\n            // Proceed\
      \ with target selection logic\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Max Targets for Spell Targeting
    code: "if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_RANDOM, 0, 0.0f, true)) {\n\
      \    uint32 maxTargets = me->GetAI()->GetMaxTargets();\n    if (maxTargets >\
      \ 1) {\n        // Cast area-of-effect spell\n        DoCast(target, SPELL_AREA_EFFECT,\
      \ true);\n    } else {\n        // Cast single-target spell\n        DoCast(target,\
      \ SPELL_SINGLE_TARGET, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI decision-making loops where target selection
    logic needs to know the maximum number of valid targets before proceeding. The
    value returned should be consistent with the selector's configuration and may
    vary depending on spell context or AI module settings.
  warnings: Ensure that the TargetSelector instance has been properly initialized
    before calling this method, as uninitialized selectors might return unexpected
    values. This method does not validate whether targets are actually available;
    it only returns the configured maximum count.
