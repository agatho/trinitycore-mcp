documentation:
  brief: Destroys a PlayerChoiceScript instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the PlayerChoiceScript class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the lifetime of the script instance. This method ensures proper resource deallocation
    when a PlayerChoiceScript object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In
    the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server implementation, this destructor
    may handle cleanup of choice-related data structures, UI elements, or internal
    state management associated with player choice interactions such as quest choices,
    gossip options, or dialogue trees. The method does not take any parameters and
    performs no return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Automatic destruction of PlayerChoiceScript
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    PlayerChoiceScript* script = new PlayerChoiceScript();\n\
      \    // ... use the script ...\n    delete script; // Triggers ~PlayerChoiceScript()\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when a PlayerChoiceScript
    object is destroyed. Developers should not manually call this destructor unless
    implementing custom memory management patterns. The destruction process typically
    involves calling base class destructors and releasing any heap-allocated resources
    held by the instance.
