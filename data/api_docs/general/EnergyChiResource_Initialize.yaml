  class: EnergyChiResource
  method: Initialize
  signature: void EnergyChiResource::Initialize(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the energy and chi resource system for a player bot.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the energy and chi resource tracking
    system for a specified player bot. This method configures internal resource management
    structures, establishes baseline values for energy and chi, and prepares the system
    to handle resource-related game mechanics such as ability usage, regeneration
    rates, and resource consumption. The initialization process ensures that the bot's
    resource state is properly synchronized with the game's resource system and that
    all necessary callbacks or event handlers are registered. This method should be
    called during the bot's creation or activation phase before any resource-based
    operations are performed.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will have
      its energy and chi resources initialized. Must not be null.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get reference to bot

      EnergyChiResource resourceSystem;

      resourceSystem.Initialize(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization with Error Handling
    code: "Player* bot = GetPlayerBot();\nif (bot != nullptr)\n{\n    EnergyChiResource\
      \ resourceSystem;\n    resourceSystem.Initialize(bot);\n    // Resource system\
      \ is now ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Player object has already been validated and
    is in a usable state. The initialization process may involve reading player class-specific
    configurations, setting up resource regeneration timers, and registering with
    game event systems. It's recommended to call this method before any resource-based
    actions are performed on the bot.
  warnings: Calling Initialize on an already initialized resource system may lead
    to undefined behavior or resource leaks. Ensure that each bot is only initialized
    once. Passing a null pointer for the bot parameter will likely cause a crash or
    segmentation fault.
