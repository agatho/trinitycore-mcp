  method: Garrison
  signature: void Garrison::Garrison(Player * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Garrison instance for the specified player owner.
  description: The Garrison constructor initializes a new garrison instance for a
    given player. This method sets up the internal state and data structures required
    for managing a player's garrison, including its buildings, followers, and resource
    management systems. The garrison system in World of Warcraft allows players to
    build and manage their own base of operations with various structures and units.
    This constructor is typically called during player login or when a new garrison
    is created for a player character. It establishes the relationship between the
    player and their garrison, ensuring all subsequent garrison-related operations
    function correctly.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Garrison Initialization
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      Garrison* garrison = new Garrison(player);

      // The garrison is now initialized for the player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely performs initialization of internal data structures
    such as building placement arrays, follower management systems, and resource tracking.
    It may also register the garrison with the game world's garrison manager system.
  warnings: This method should only be called once per player instance to avoid memory
    leaks or inconsistent state. Calling it multiple times on the same player without
    proper cleanup can lead to undefined behavior.
