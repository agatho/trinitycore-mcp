documentation:
  brief: Manages healing prioritization and execution for the Evoker's Preservation
    ability.
  description: The ManagePreservationHealing method is responsible for determining
    when and how to apply the Evoker's Preservation healing ability. This method evaluates
    the current health status of nearby allies, identifies targets that require immediate
    healing, and executes the appropriate healing spell based on game mechanics and
    cooldown states. It integrates with the Evoker's AI decision-making process to
    ensure optimal resource usage and effective support of the group during combat
    situations.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    ManagePreservationHealing();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly within the Evoker's AI update cycle
    to ensure timely healing application. The method respects spell cooldowns and
    target selection rules defined by the Evoker class. Performance is optimized through
    efficient target scanning and prioritization algorithms.
  warnings: Ensure this method is not called during critical combat phases where immediate
    threat response takes precedence. Avoid calling it multiple times per update cycle
    as it may cause redundant healing applications or resource waste.
