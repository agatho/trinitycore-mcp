  class: SpecChoice
  method: SpecChoice
  signature: void SpecChoice::SpecChoice(uint8 spec, std::string name, GroupRole role,
    float conf)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a specialization choice with specified role, confidence, and
    name.
  description: The SpecChoice constructor initializes a specialization choice object
    with the provided specialization ID, name, group role, and confidence level. This
    method is typically used in player class specialization selection logic within
    TrinityCore's raid and group management systems. The specialization ID determines
    which class specialization is being chosen, the name provides a human-readable
    identifier for the spec, the role defines the intended group role (tank, healer,
    damage dealer), and the confidence value represents how certain the system is
    about this choice. This constructor is part of the core gameplay mechanics that
    determine player behavior in group content such as raids and dungeons.
  parameters:
  - name: spec
    description: The specialization ID (uint8) representing the class specialization
      being chosen. Valid values depend on the player's class and available specializations
      in the game.
  - name: name
    description: A string identifier for the specialization choice. This provides
      a human-readable name that can be used for UI display or logging purposes.
  - name: role
    description: The group role (GroupRole enum) indicating the intended function
      of this specialization in a group context. Valid values include TANK, HEALER,
      and DAMAGE.
  - name: conf
    description: A float confidence value (0.0 to 1.0) representing how certain the
      system is about this specialization choice. Higher values indicate greater certainty.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic SpecChoice Initialization
    code: SpecChoice choice(257, "Frost Mage", GroupRole::DAMAGE, 0.9f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Healer Specialization Choice
    code: SpecChoice healerChoice(256, "Discipline Priest", GroupRole::HEALER, 0.85f);
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used in conjunction with group management systems
    to determine optimal player distribution for raid encounters. The confidence value
    may be updated dynamically based on gear, talents, or other factors during gameplay.
  warnings: Ensure that the spec ID corresponds to a valid specialization for the
    player's class; invalid IDs may cause undefined behavior or errors in group assignment
    logic.
