  signature: int32 FarmingCoordinator::GetSkillGap(int * player, ProfessionType profession)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the skill gap between a player's current profession level and
    the maximum possible level for that profession.
  description: The GetSkillGap method determines the difference between a player's
    current skill level in a specified profession and the maximum skill level they
    can achieve for that profession. This calculation is essential for determining
    how much more training or practice a player needs to reach the peak of their profession.
    The method takes into account the player's current skill value and the maximum
    allowed skill cap for the given profession type, returning the numerical gap that
    must be bridged. It is commonly used in crafting systems, skill progression tracking,
    and determining available training options within the game's profession mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      or internal player reference. This parameter identifies which player's skill
      level is being evaluated.
  - name: profession
    description: Enumeration value of type ProfessionType that specifies the profession
      for which the skill gap is calculated. This determines the maximum skill cap
      used in the calculation.
  returns: Returns an int32 value representing the numerical difference between the
    player's current skill level and the maximum achievable skill level for the specified
    profession. A positive value indicates how much more skill points are needed to
    reach the cap, while zero or negative values may indicate that the player has
    already reached or exceeded the maximum skill level.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int32 gap = coordinator.GetSkillGap(&playerId, PROFESSION_ENGINERING);
    language: cpp
  - title: Skill Gap Check for Crafting
    code: "int32 gap = coordinator.GetSkillGap(&playerId, PROFESSION_BLACKSMITHING);\n\
      if (gap > 0) {\n    printf(\"Player needs %d skill points to max out Blacksmithing.\\\
      n\", gap);\n} else {\n    printf(\"Player has reached maximum Blacksmithing\
      \ skill.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal player data structures and profession
    skill tables to perform its calculation. It may be called frequently during skill
    progression checks or when displaying training information to players. The implementation
    might cache results for performance optimization depending on how often this value
    is queried.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as passing an invalid reference could lead to undefined behavior. Also,
    verify that the ProfessionType parameter corresponds to a valid profession, as
    invalid values may cause incorrect calculations or crashes.
