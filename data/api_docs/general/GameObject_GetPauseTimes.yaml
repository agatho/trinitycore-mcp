documentation:
  brief: Returns the pause times array for the GameObject
  description: This method retrieves the pause times associated with the GameObject,
    which are typically used to control when the object is paused or resumed during
    gameplay. The returned array contains integer values representing time intervals
    in milliseconds that determine how long the GameObject remains paused. This functionality
    is essential for managing game mechanics such as object interactions, animations,
    and state transitions during World of Warcraft gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to an array of integers representing pause times. Each
    integer value corresponds to a time interval in milliseconds that determines how
    long the GameObject remains paused. The array may be null if no pause times are
    set or if the GameObject is not configured for pause behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int* pauseTimes = gameObject->GetPauseTimes();\nif (pauseTimes != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i)\n    {\n        std::cout << \"Pause time:\
      \ \" << pauseTimes[i] << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with GameObject's state management
    functions and may be related to other pause-related methods like SetPauseTime
    or GetPauseTime. Performance considerations include potential memory allocation
    if the array is dynamically allocated, though it's likely a static array in most
    implementations.
  warnings: Caution should be taken when using this method as the returned pointer
    might be null or invalid if the GameObject has not been initialized with pause
    times. Accessing invalid memory can lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
