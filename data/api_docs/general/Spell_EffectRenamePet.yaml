  brief: Renames a pet using a spell effect
  description: The EffectRenamePet method handles the process of renaming a player's
    pet through a spell effect. This method is typically invoked when a spell that
    allows pet renaming is applied, such as the Pet Rename spell. It modifies the
    pet's name within the game world and ensures proper synchronization with the client.
    The method operates on the pet's GUID and updates its name according to the specified
    parameters.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(player, SPELL_PET_RENAME);

      spell->EffectRenamePet();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method requires the pet to be owned by the player and must be properly
    initialized before execution. The renaming process involves updating the pet's
    name in the database and sending a notification to the client.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method may lead to synchronization issues with
    the pet's name, potentially causing display errors or invalidation of the pet's
    ownership.
