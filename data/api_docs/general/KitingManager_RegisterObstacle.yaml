  class: KitingManager
  method: RegisterObstacle
  signature: void KitingManager::RegisterObstacle(const int & obstacle, float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Registers an obstacle with the kiting manager for pathfinding and movement
    calculations.
  description: The RegisterObstacle method adds a new obstacle to the KitingManager's
    internal obstacle list. This allows the kiting system to properly avoid obstacles
    when calculating movement paths for units. The method takes an obstacle identifier
    and a radius parameter that defines the size of the obstacle for collision detection
    purposes. Obstacles registered with this method will be considered during kiting
    calculations to prevent units from moving through or into these objects.
  parameters:
  - name: obstacle
    description: A unique identifier representing the obstacle to be registered. This
      is typically a GUID or object ID that uniquely identifies the obstacle in the
      game world.
  - name: radius
    description: The radius of the obstacle used for collision detection and pathfinding
      calculations. Must be a positive float value representing the size of the obstacle
      in world units.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic obstacle registration
    code: 'KitingManager* kitingMgr = player->GetKitingManager();

      uint32 treeGUID = 12345;

      float treeRadius = 2.5f;

      kitingMgr->RegisterObstacle(treeGUID, treeRadius);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering multiple obstacles during initialization
    code: "KitingManager* kitingMgr = player->GetKitingManager();\nstd::vector<std::pair<uint32,\
      \ float>> obstacles = {\n    {1001, 1.5f},\n    {1002, 3.0f},\n    {1003, 0.8f}\n\
      };\nfor (const auto& obstacle : obstacles) {\n    kitingMgr->RegisterObstacle(obstacle.first,\
      \ obstacle.second);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The KitingManager maintains an internal list of obstacles that are used for
    pathfinding calculations. Obstacles should be registered before they are needed
    in movement calculations to ensure proper avoidance behavior. The radius parameter
    directly affects the collision detection and pathfinding behavior, so accurate
    values are important for realistic kiting behavior.
  warnings: Registering obstacles with very large radius values may cause performance
    issues or unexpected pathfinding behavior. Ensure that obstacle identifiers are
    unique and properly managed to avoid conflicts in the internal obstacle list.
