  class: Vehicle
  method: InitMovementInfoForBase
  signature: void Vehicle::InitMovementInfoForBase()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes movement information for the vehicle's base object.
  description: The InitMovementInfoForBase method prepares and sets up the movement
    data structure for a vehicle's base entity. This function is typically invoked
    during vehicle initialization or when establishing the vehicle's movement state
    within the game world. It ensures that the underlying movement information is
    correctly configured to support vehicle behavior such as acceleration, deceleration,
    turning, and other motion-related mechanics. The method likely initializes default
    values for movement parameters including speed, orientation, and position data
    required by the TrinityCore movement system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vehicle Initialization
    code: 'Vehicle* vehicle = new Vehicle();

      vehicle->InitMovementInfoForBase();

      // Movement information is now initialized for the vehicle base'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any movement-related operations are performed
    on the vehicle. It's typically part of an initialization sequence and may not
    be safe to call after movement has already begun.
  warnings: Calling this method after a vehicle has already started moving might lead
    to inconsistent movement state or unexpected behavior in the game world.
