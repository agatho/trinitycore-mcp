  class: FormationManager
  method: ExecuteFormationCommand
  signature: bool FormationManager::ExecuteFormationCommand(const FormationCommand
    & command)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a formation command for managing creature group behaviors in World
    of Warcraft.
  description: The ExecuteFormationCommand method processes and applies a given FormationCommand
    to control how creatures within a formation behave, such as moving together, attacking
    targets, or following a leader. This method is part of the FormationManager class
    which handles AI-based group coordination for mobs in TrinityCore. It ensures
    that commands are properly interpreted and executed by the underlying creature
    AI systems. The method returns true if the command was successfully processed,
    false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for implementing complex mob behaviors
    like raid encounters or scripted events where multiple creatures need to act in
    unison.
  parameters:
  - name: command
    description: A const reference to a FormationCommand object containing the specific
      action to be executed. The command structure typically includes target information,
      movement instructions, and behavior flags that define how the formation should
      respond.
  returns: Returns true if the formation command was successfully processed and applied
    to the creatures in the formation; returns false if the command failed due to
    invalid parameters, missing entities, or other execution errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Formation Command Execution
    code: "FormationCommand cmd;\ncmd.type = FORMATION_MOVE;\ncmd.targetX = 100.0f;\n\
      cmd.targetY = 200.0f;\nbool result = formationManager.ExecuteFormationCommand(cmd);\n\
      if (result)\n{\n    // Command executed successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Executing Attack Formation Command
    code: "FormationCommand attackCmd;\nattackCmd.type = FORMATION_ATTACK;\nattackCmd.targetGuid\
      \ = player->GetGUID();\nbool success = formationManager.ExecuteFormationCommand(attackCmd);\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Creatures will now attack the specified target\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the context of creature AI and requires that
    the FormationManager has valid references to the creatures involved in the formation.
    The command processing may involve multiple steps including validation, state
    transitions, and communication with individual creature AIs. Performance considerations
    include avoiding frequent calls during high-frequency updates.
  warnings: Calling this method without properly initializing the FormationManager
    or providing invalid FormationCommand structures can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that all referenced creatures are valid and active before executing
    commands.
