  class: QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr
  method: QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr
  signature: void QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr::QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr(int * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr instance with the specified owner
    identifier.
  description: The QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr constructor initializes a new instance
    of the QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr class, associating it with a specific owner identified
    by the provided integer parameter. This manager is responsible for tracking and
    managing quest objective criteria progress for the given owner, which typically
    corresponds to a player or NPC in the World of Warcraft environment. The owner
    parameter likely represents a unique identifier such as a GUID or internal object
    ID that links the criteria manager to its associated game entity. This constructor
    sets up internal data structures necessary for handling quest-related objectives
    and their progression states.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier of the owner
      (typically a player or NPC) that this criteria manager will track quest progress
      for. The value should be a valid object identifier within the TrinityCore system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr* criteriaMgr = new QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Player Context
    code: "class Player {\nprivate:\n    int m_guid;\n    QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr*\
      \ m_criteriaMgr;\npublic:\n    Player(int guid) : m_guid(guid) {\n        m_criteriaMgr\
      \ = new QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr(&m_guid);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This appears to be a constructor method, not a regular member function. The
    'owner' parameter is passed by reference (as a pointer), suggesting that the manager
    may need to access or modify the owner's data during quest progression tracking.
    The manager likely maintains internal state related to active quests and their
    objective completion status.
  warnings: Ensure that the owner identifier passed to this constructor remains valid
    throughout the lifetime of the QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr instance, as invalid
    references could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This constructor should
    only be called once per instance to avoid memory leaks or duplicate initialization.
