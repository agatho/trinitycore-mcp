  class: BotPriorityManager
  method: SuspendLowPriorityBots
  signature: void BotPriorityManager::SuspendLowPriorityBots(uint32 targetCount)
documentation:
  brief: Suspends low-priority bots to manage server resources based on a target count.
  description: The SuspendLowPriorityBots method is responsible for managing bot priority
    within the TrinityCore framework by suspending bots that are classified as low
    priority. This mechanism helps optimize server performance and resource allocation,
    particularly in environments with many active bots. The method takes a target
    count parameter which determines how many bots should remain active, suspending
    the rest based on their priority levels. It is typically invoked during periods
    of high server load or when specific resource management policies are enforced.
  parameters:
  - name: targetCount
    description: The number of bots that should remain active. All bots with lower
      priority than this threshold will be suspended.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: BotPriorityManager::instance()->SuspendLowPriorityBots(10);
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Resource Management Context
    code: "void ManageServerLoad()\n{\n    uint32 activeBotCount = GetActiveBotCount();\n\
      \    if (activeBotCount > MAX_ALLOWED_BOTS)\n    {\n        BotPriorityManager::instance()->SuspendLowPriorityBots(MAX_ALLOWED_BOTS);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot management system and should be called carefully
    to avoid disrupting gameplay. The suspension mechanism typically involves setting
    a flag or state on the bots, which may affect their behavior until resumed. The
    implementation likely uses internal sorting or prioritization logic to determine
    which bots are considered low priority.
  warnings: Calling this method while bots are in active combat or performing critical
    tasks may result in unexpected behavior or loss of bot functionality. Ensure that
    any bot suspension is done during appropriate maintenance windows or when the
    system can safely handle interruptions.
