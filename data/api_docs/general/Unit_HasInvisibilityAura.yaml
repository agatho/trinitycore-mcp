  signature: bool Unit::HasInvisibilityAura() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit has an invisibility aura applied.
  description: This method determines whether a Unit object possesses an invisibility
    aura, which is a special game mechanic that makes the unit invisible to other
    players and creatures. Invisibility auras are commonly used for stealth abilities,
    illusions, or temporary invisibility effects in World of Warcraft. The method
    returns true if any invisibility aura is present on the unit, false otherwise.
    This check is essential for determining visibility status during combat and interaction
    with other units.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit has any invisibility aura applied, false otherwise.
    This indicates that the unit is currently invisible to others due to an active
    invisibility effect.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (unit->HasInvisibilityAura()) {\n    // Do something\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method internally checks the unit's aura list for any invisibility-related
    auras. It is recommended to use this method in conjunction with other visibility
    checks for comprehensive gameplay logic. Performance-wise, this method is lightweight
    as it only performs a simple aura check.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a direct replacement for checking specific
    aura types; it returns true for any invisibility effect, including those from
    different sources like stealth or illusion spells.
