documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a new rogue AI instance for a bot character
  description: The CreateRogueAI method is responsible for instantiating a new rogue
    AI controller for a bot character within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    allocates memory for the AI component, sets up the necessary behavior patterns
    specific to rogue class gameplay, and initializes the AI's decision-making systems.
    The method typically integrates with the broader AI system to ensure proper coordination
    between different AI types and game mechanics. It handles the creation of combat
    behaviors, stealth management, and ability usage specific to rogue characters
    such as stealth, pickpocketing, and poison application.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure status of the
    AI creation process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful creation,
    while negative values may represent various error conditions such as insufficient
    memory, invalid bot reference, or failed initialization. Positive non-zero values
    might indicate specific status codes related to the AI creation process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic rogue AI creation
    code: "int* bot = nullptr;\nint result = factory->CreateRogueAI(bot);\nif (result\
      \ == 0) {\n    // AI created successfully\n    printf(\"Rogue AI initialized\
      \ successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle error\n    printf(\"Failed to\
      \ create rogue AI, error code: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's bot AI system and requires proper
    initialization of the bot character before calling. The returned bot pointer should
    be validated before use to prevent null pointer dereferences. Implementation may
    involve memory allocation and initialization of complex AI state machines.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper preconditions may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the bot parameter points to a valid bot object
    before invoking this method. The method may fail if system resources are insufficient
    for creating the AI component.
