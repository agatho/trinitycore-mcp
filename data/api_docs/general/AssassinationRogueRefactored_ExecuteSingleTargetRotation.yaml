  class: AssassinationRogueRefactored
  method: ExecuteSingleTargetRotation
  signature: void AssassinationRogueRefactored::ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(int *
    target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the assassination rogue's single-target rotation logic for the current
    combat target.
  description: The ExecuteSingleTargetRotation method implements the core decision-making
    logic for an assassination rogue's single-target combat rotation. This method
    evaluates the current state of the player and their target to determine the optimal
    ability to cast next, considering factors such as energy levels, combo points,
    buff/debuff status, and cooldowns. It is typically called during the AI's update
    cycle when the rogue has a valid target and is in combat. The method modifies
    internal state variables and may trigger ability casts or updates to the player's
    action queue based on the calculated rotation.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's unique identifier
      (GUID) for the current combat target. This parameter is used to validate that
      the rogue is targeting a valid enemy unit before executing rotation logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void MyRogueAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n \
      \   {\n        int targetGuid = me->GetVictim()->GetGUID();\n        ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(&targetGuid);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat State Management
    code: "void AssassinationRogueRefactored::ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(int* target)\n\
      {\n    if (!target || *target <= 0)\n        return;\n\n    Unit* victim = me->GetUnit(*target);\n\
      \    if (!victim || !victim->IsAlive())\n        return;\n\n    // Rotation\
      \ logic implementation here\n    // e.g., check for combo points, energy, abilities\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the rogue is already in combat and has a valid target.
    It does not perform validation of the target's existence or validity beyond checking
    if the GUID is non-zero. The method may modify internal state variables related
    to ability usage, cooldown tracking, and combo point management.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target parameter can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the target pointer points to a valid GUID before calling
    this method. This method should not be called outside of combat context without
    proper validation.
