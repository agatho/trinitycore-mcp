    category) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves performance statistics for a specified AI decision category.
  description: The GetCategoryStats method returns detailed performance metrics for
    a given AI decision category. This includes timing data, execution counts, and
    other relevant statistics that help developers understand how efficiently the
    AI system is processing decisions within that category. The method is typically
    used for profiling and optimization purposes during development or debugging of
    AI behaviors in TrinityCore. It provides insight into which categories of AI decisions
    are consuming the most resources or taking the longest to execute.
  parameters: []
  returns: A CategoryPerformanceStats object containing aggregated performance data
    for the specified AI decision category, including execution times, call counts,
    and other relevant metrics.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve AI Decision Statistics
    code: 'CategoryPerformanceStats stats = aiProfiler.GetCategoryStats(AIDecisionCategory::Combat);

      std::cout << "Combat decisions executed: " << stats.executionCount << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Average time per decision: " << stats.averageTimeMs << " ms" <<
      std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from within the AI profiling subsystem
    and may not be thread-safe if accessed concurrently. The returned CategoryPerformanceStats
    object should be treated as read-only for performance reasons.
