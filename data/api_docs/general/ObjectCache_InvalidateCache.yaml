documentation:
  brief: Clears all cached objects from the ObjectCache instance
  description: The InvalidateCache method removes all entries from the ObjectCache,
    effectively clearing the cache of all stored objects. This method is typically
    used when cache invalidation is required due to changes in game state, such as
    when a player logs out, a zone is reset, or when the system needs to ensure fresh
    data is retrieved on next access. The method does not take any parameters and
    performs no validation checks before clearing the cache contents.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cache Invalidation
    code: 'ObjectCache* cache = ObjectCache::GetGlobalCache();

      cache->InvalidateCache();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe in most implementations, but developers should
    verify the specific locking mechanism used by the ObjectCache implementation.
    The invalidation process may trigger cleanup callbacks for cached objects if implemented.
  warnings: Calling InvalidateCache while other threads are accessing the cache may
    lead to race conditions or inconsistent behavior. Ensure proper synchronization
    when using this method in multi-threaded environments.
