  class: LevelBracket
  method: GetDeviation
  signature: float LevelBracket::GetDeviation(uint32 totalBots) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the deviation value for a given total bot count within
    the level bracket.
  description: The GetDeviation method computes a floating-point deviation value based
    on the total number of bots specified in the parameter. This method is typically
    used in game mechanics that involve balancing or scaling difficulty based on player
    or bot population. The calculation likely takes into account the current level
    bracket's configuration and adjusts the deviation accordingly. It may be used
    for determining how much variance to apply to stats, experience gains, or other
    gameplay elements when bots are present in a group or instance. This method does
    not modify any internal state and is purely computational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated deviation based on the total
    bot count. The exact meaning of this deviation depends on the context within which
    it's used, but typically represents a scaling factor or variance modifier for
    gameplay elements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LevelBracket bracket;

      float deviation = bracket.GetDeviation(5);

      // Returns the deviation value for a group with 5 bots'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system that manages level-based balancing
    in World of Warcraft instances or battlegrounds. The deviation may be used to
    adjust enemy difficulty, loot distribution, or experience rewards based on the
    number of AI-controlled participants.
