  class: InterruptManager
  method: ~InterruptManager
  signature: void InterruptManager::~InterruptManager()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an InterruptManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ~InterruptManager destructor is called automatically when an InterruptManager
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any internal data structures, memory allocations, and resources managed
    by the interrupt manager. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation,
    this class likely handles the management of spell interrupts, ability cancellations,
    or other game events that require interruption logic. The destructor performs
    necessary cleanup operations to prevent memory leaks and maintain system stability.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of InterruptManager instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    InterruptManager manager;\n    // ... use manager\
      \ ...\n    // manager is automatically destroyed here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of InterruptManager pointer
    code: 'InterruptManager* manager = new InterruptManager();

      // ... use manager ...

      delete manager; // Triggers ~InterruptManager destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when objects go
    out of scope or are explicitly deleted. Developers should not manually call this
    destructor unless implementing custom memory management patterns. The cleanup
    process may involve releasing internal linked lists, clearing interrupt queues,
    or notifying other subsystems about resource deallocation.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke this destructor in normal code flow as it will
    lead to undefined behavior. When using dynamic allocation, ensure proper deletion
    to avoid memory leaks. Be aware that the destructor may perform operations that
    could affect other systems if called at inappropriate times during server shutdown
    or object lifecycle transitions.
