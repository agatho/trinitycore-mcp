  class: SceneMgr
  method: RemoveAurasDueToSceneId
  signature: void SceneMgr::RemoveAurasDueToSceneId(uint32 sceneId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes all auras that were applied due to a specific scene ID.
  description: The RemoveAurasDueToSceneId method removes all active auras from players
    and units that were originally applied as part of a scene triggered by the given
    scene ID. This is typically used when a scene completes or is interrupted, ensuring
    that any temporary effects or buffs applied during the scene are properly cleared.
    The method iterates through all affected entities and strips auras that have the
    specified scene ID associated with them. It's commonly called internally by the
    scene system when scenes end or are cancelled.
  parameters:
  - name: sceneId
    description: The unique identifier of the scene for which auras should be removed.
      This corresponds to the SceneId used when starting the scene.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove all auras from scene ID 12345
    code: SceneMgr::RemoveAurasDueToSceneId(12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove auras after completing a quest scene
    code: "if (Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindConnectedPlayer(playerGuid))\n\
      {\n    SceneMgr::RemoveAurasDueToSceneId(54321);\n    // Additional cleanup\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the scene system upon scene
    completion or cancellation. It's important to note that this only removes auras
    that were explicitly applied due to the scene ID; it does not affect other auras
    that might be active on the same unit.
