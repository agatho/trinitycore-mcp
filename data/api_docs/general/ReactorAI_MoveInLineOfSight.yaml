  class: ReactorAI
  method: MoveInLineOfSight
  signature: void ReactorAI::MoveInLineOfSight(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Processes incoming units that come within the reactor AI's line of sight.
  description: The MoveInLineOfSight method is a core component of the ReactorAI class
    in TrinityCore, responsible for detecting and responding to units that enter the
    AI-controlled creature's line of sight. This method is typically invoked by the
    game engine when a unit (player or NPC) moves into the detection range of the
    reactor AI. It evaluates whether the incoming unit is a valid target based on
    faction, visibility, and other conditions, and triggers appropriate AI behaviors
    such as aggro, movement, or spell casting. The method plays a critical role in
    enemy detection and combat initiation for scripted reactor-based creatures.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer parameter that likely represents the unit's
      GUID or index within the game world's unit list. This parameter is used internally
      by the AI system to identify and process the specific unit entering line of
      sight.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in custom AI behavior
    code: "class MyReactorAI : public ReactorAI {\npublic:\n    void MoveInLineOfSight(int*\
      \ unitGuid) override {\n        // Custom logic before calling base class\n\
      \        if (unitGuid && *unitGuid != 0) {\n            // Process the unit\
      \ entering line of sight\n            ReactorAI::MoveInLineOfSight(unitGuid);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Extended AI behavior with custom targeting
    code: "class AdvancedReactorAI : public ReactorAI {\npublic:\n    void MoveInLineOfSight(int*\
      \ unitGuid) override {\n        if (unitGuid && *unitGuid != 0) {\n        \
      \    Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*unitGuid);\n            if (target\
      \ && target->IsHostileTo(GetCreature())) {\n                // Custom reaction\
      \ to hostile units\n                DoCast(target, SPELL_CHARGE);\n        \
      \    }\n        }\n        ReactorAI::MoveInLineOfSight(unitGuid);\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically called by the TrinityCore engine when units
    enter the AI's detection range. Developers should not directly invoke this method
    unless implementing a custom AI override. The parameter 'param0' is expected to
    be a valid unit GUID or index; passing invalid data may result in undefined behavior.
  warnings: Improper handling of the unit GUID parameter can lead to crashes or incorrect
    AI behavior. Ensure that any override of this method calls the base implementation
    to maintain core AI functionality.
