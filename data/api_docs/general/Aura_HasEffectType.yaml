  method: HasEffectType
  signature: bool Aura::HasEffectType(AuraType type) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the aura has a specific effect type.
  description: The HasEffectType method determines whether the current aura instance
    contains at least one effect of the specified aura type. This is commonly used
    in World of Warcraft spell and aura handling logic to verify the presence of particular
    effects such as damage over time, healing, or stat modifications. The method iterates
    through all active effects within the aura and returns true if any match the provided
    aura type. It's an essential utility for conditional spell behavior and effect
    validation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the aura has at least one effect of the specified type;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check for Damage Over Time Effect
    code: "if (aura->HasEffectType(SPELL_AURA_PERIODIC_DAMAGE)) {\n    // Handle DoT\
      \ aura logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Verify Healing Aura Presence
    code: "if (playerAura->HasEffectType(SPELL_AURA_PERIODIC_HEAL)) {\n    // Apply\
      \ healing effect logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear scan through all aura effects, so performance
    should be considered when used in frequently called code paths. The method is
    const and safe to call from any thread that has access to the aura object.
