  class: LootCoordination
  method: ResolveConflictByVote
  signature: void LootCoordination::ResolveConflictByVote(Group * group, const LootItem
    & item, const int & conflictingPlayers)
documentation:
  brief: Resolves loot conflicts within a group by conducting a vote among players.
  description: The ResolveConflictByVote method handles the resolution of loot conflicts
    in a World of Warcraft group scenario. When multiple players have expressed interest
    in the same item, this function initiates a voting process to determine the final
    loot recipient. The method takes into account the number of conflicting players
    and applies the appropriate voting logic to ensure fair distribution. This mechanism
    is typically invoked when loot cannot be automatically assigned due to overlapping
    claims or when manual intervention is required by the group leader.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group involved
      in the loot conflict. Must not be null and should represent a valid group with
      active members.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing details about the
      conflicting item, including its ID, stack size, and other relevant properties.
  - name: conflictingPlayers
    description: Integer value indicating the number of players who have expressed
      interest in the same loot item. Should be a positive integer representing the
      count of competing players.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group loot resolution
    code: "void HandleLootConflict(Group* group, LootItem& item)\n{\n    int conflictingPlayers\
      \ = 3;\n    lootCoordination->ResolveConflictByVote(group, item, conflictingPlayers);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with loot distribution system
    code: "void DistributeLoot(Group* group, LootItem& item)\n{\n    if (item.IsConflicting())\n\
      \    {\n        int conflictingPlayers = GetConflictingPlayerCount(group, item);\n\
      \        lootCoordination->ResolveConflictByVote(group, item, conflictingPlayers);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        AssignLootToPlayer(group, item);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the loot coordination system and assumes that group
    leadership and voting rights are properly configured. It relies on the internal
    state of the Group object to determine eligible voters and their voting preferences.
    The implementation may involve network communication to synchronize vote results
    across all players in the group.
  warnings: Ensure that the group parameter is valid and active before calling this
    method, as passing a null or inactive group could lead to undefined behavior.
    Also, be aware that this method modifies the internal state of the loot coordination
    system and may affect future loot distribution decisions.
