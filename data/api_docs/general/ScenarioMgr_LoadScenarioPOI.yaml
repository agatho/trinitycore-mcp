documentation:
  brief: Loads scenario point of interest data from the database into memory for use
    in World of Warcraft scenarios.
  description: The LoadScenarioPOI method initializes and loads all scenario point
    of interest (POI) data from the database into the ScenarioMgr's internal data
    structures. This method is typically called during server startup or when initializing
    scenario-related systems. It processes entries from the `scenario_poi` database
    table, which defines various points of interest within scenarios such as quest
    objectives, locations, and interactive elements. The loaded POI data is used to
    display scenario-specific markers on the minimap and provide contextual information
    to players during scenario events. This method ensures that all scenario-related
    POIs are available for runtime use when players enter or interact with specific
    scenarios.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleScenarioPoIRequest()\n{\n    sScenarioMgr->LoadScenarioPOI();\n\
      \    // POIs are now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    scenario data needs to be refreshed. The method performs database queries and
    loads data into memory, so it may have performance implications if called frequently.
    It's typically invoked automatically by the core system during startup.
