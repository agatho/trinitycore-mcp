documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the BotThreatAssignment class for managing
    threat distribution among bot players in World of Warcraft.
  description: The BotThreatAssignment constructor initializes the internal state
    and data structures required for handling threat assignment logic within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method sets up default values for threat management parameters,
    establishes necessary references to player and creature data, and prepares the
    system for distributing threat among bot players in a controlled manner. The initialization
    process ensures that subsequent threat calculations and assignments operate correctly
    without requiring additional setup. This constructor is typically invoked when
    creating new bot instances or when reinitializing threat management systems during
    gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic instantiation of BotThreatAssignment
    code: 'BotThreatAssignment threatAssigner;

      // This creates a new threat assignment manager

      // that can be used to distribute threat among bots'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or data loading.
    It simply sets up the basic structure needed for threat management operations.
    The actual threat calculation and assignment logic is handled by other methods
    in the class, such as UpdateThreat() or AssignThreat(). Developers should ensure
    that this object is properly initialized before calling any threat-related methods.
