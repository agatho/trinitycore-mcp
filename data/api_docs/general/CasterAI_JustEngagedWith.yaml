  class: CasterAI
  method: JustEngagedWith
  signature: void CasterAI::JustEngagedWith(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Called when the caster AI becomes engaged with a target, initiating combat
    behavior.
  description: The JustEngagedWith method is invoked by the CasterAI class when a
    creature or NPC enters combat with a target. This method typically initializes
    combat-related behaviors such as casting spells, setting up threat management,
    or triggering specific AI actions. It serves as an entry point for customizing
    how caster-based creatures behave upon engaging enemies in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework. The method is part of the broader AI system and is usually
    called automatically by the core engine when combat begins.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target entity's identifier
      or index within the game world. This parameter is typically used internally
      by TrinityCore to reference the engaged unit.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Override Example
    code: "void MyCasterAI::JustEngagedWith(int* target)\n{\n    // Custom logic when\
      \ engaged\n    if (target)\n        DoCast(target, SPELL_FIREBALL);\n    CasterAI::JustEngagedWith(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Override with Conditional Logic
    code: "void MyCasterAI::JustEngagedWith(int* target)\n{\n    if (!target || !me->IsInWorld())\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Cast a special spell on engagement\n    if (urand(0,\
      \ 1))\n        DoCast(target, SPELL_SUMMON_MINION);\n    else\n        DoCast(target,\
      \ SPELL_SHADOW_BOLT);\n    \n    CasterAI::JustEngagedWith(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically overridden in custom AI implementations to add unique
    behaviors during combat initiation. Developers should ensure proper handling of
    the target parameter and avoid modifying core engine state unless necessary. The
    method is called from within the game's combat loop, so performance considerations
    are important.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you understand its internal behavior;
    it's intended to be invoked by the AI system. Incorrectly handling the target
    parameter may lead to undefined behavior or crashes in the AI subsystem.
