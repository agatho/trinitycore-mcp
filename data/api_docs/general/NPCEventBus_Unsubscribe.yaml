  class: NPCEventBus
  method: Unsubscribe
  signature: void NPCEventBus::Unsubscribe(BotAI * subscriber)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a BotAI subscriber from the NPC event bus.
  description: The Unsubscribe method removes a specified BotAI subscriber from the
    NPC event bus, effectively detaching it from receiving any further events broadcast
    by the bus. This method is typically used during cleanup or when a bot AI instance
    is no longer needed to prevent memory leaks and ensure proper event handling.
    The operation is performed synchronously and ensures that the subscriber will
    not receive any future notifications from the event bus.
  parameters:
  - name: subscriber
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that should be removed from the event
      bus. Must not be null, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: None. This method does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Unsubscribe Usage
    code: 'BotAI* myBot = new BotAI();

      // ... subscribe bot to events ...

      npcEventBus.Unsubscribe(myBot);

      // Bot is now unsubscribed and will no longer receive events'
    language: cpp
  - title: Unsubscribe with Null Check
    code: "if (myBot != nullptr) {\n    npcEventBus.Unsubscribe(myBot);\n    delete\
      \ myBot;\n    myBot = nullptr;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BotAI instance was previously subscribed using
    the Subscribe method. It's important to ensure that all subscriptions are properly
    managed to avoid dangling pointers or memory leaks. The event bus internally maintains
    a list of subscribers, and this method performs a lookup to remove the specified
    subscriber.
  warnings: Calling Unsubscribe with a null pointer may result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the BotAI instance is valid and has been previously subscribed before
    calling this method. Failure to unsubscribe may lead to memory leaks or unexpected
    event delivery to disposed objects.
