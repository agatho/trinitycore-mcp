documentation:
  brief: Consumes all arcane charges from the resource pool
  description: The ConsumeAllCharges method immediately depletes the entire arcane
    charge resource, removing all available charges from the player's resource pool.
    This method is typically invoked when a spell or ability requires the consumption
    of all remaining arcane charges, such as during the execution of high-cost arcane
    abilities or specific class mechanics. The operation is immediate and does not
    require any conditional checks, making it a direct resource management function
    within the arcane charge system.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Consuming All Arcane Charges
    code: 'ArcaneChargeResource* arcaneResource = player->GetArcaneChargeResource();

      arcaneResource->ConsumeAllCharges();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal charge count and should be used
    carefully in scenarios where charge state is critical for spell validation or
    resource tracking. It does not trigger any events or callbacks related to charge
    depletion, so additional logic may be required for game mechanics that depend
    on such notifications.
