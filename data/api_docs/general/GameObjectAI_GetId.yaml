  signature: uint32 GameObjectAI::GetId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the GameObjectAI instance.
  description: The GetId method retrieves the unique identifier (ID) associated with
    the GameObjectAI instance. This ID typically corresponds to the GameObject's entry
    ID from the database, which identifies the specific type of game object. The returned
    value is used internally by the TrinityCore framework to distinguish between different
    types of game objects and their behaviors. This method is commonly used in AI
    logic to make decisions based on the specific type of GameObject being controlled.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the unique identifier (entry ID) of the GameObject
    that this AI instance controls. This corresponds to the GameObject's entry in
    the database and is used to determine the object's behavior and properties.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to identify GameObject type
    code: "void MyGameObjectAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    uint32 gameObjectId\
      \ = GetId();\n    if (gameObjectId == 176511) // Example: Chest entry ID\n \
      \   {\n        // Handle chest-specific logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that returns cached data. It should be safe
    to call from any thread context where the GameObjectAI instance is valid. The
    returned ID directly maps to entries in the gameobject_template table in the database.
