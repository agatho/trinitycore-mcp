  class: WarriorBaselineRotation
  method: ExecuteRotation
  signature: bool WarriorBaselineRotation::ExecuteRotation(int * bot, int * target,
    BaselineRotationManager & manager)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the warrior's baseline rotation logic for optimal combat performance.
  description: The ExecuteRotation method implements the core decision-making logic
    for a warrior class AI in TrinityCore. It evaluates the current combat state,
    including player health, target conditions, and available abilities, to determine
    the most effective sequence of actions. The method interacts with the BaselineRotationManager
    to manage rotation state and ensure proper ability cooldowns and resource management.
    This function is typically called during combat updates and returns true if a
    valid action was executed, or false if no suitable action could be determined.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot player object representing the warrior AI character
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target enemy object that the warrior is engaging in
      combat
  - name: manager
    description: Reference to the BaselineRotationManager which handles rotation state
      and ability tracking
  returns: Returns true if a valid combat action was successfully executed, false
    otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that no suitable action
    could be performed due to resource constraints, cooldowns, or invalid target states.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat loop
    code: "void CombatUpdate()\n{\n    if (player->IsInCombat())\n    {\n        if\
      \ (!warriorRotation.ExecuteRotation(&botPlayer, &currentTarget, rotationManager))\n\
      \        {\n            // No valid action performed, consider alternative behavior\n\
      \            HandleNoAction();\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI state machine
    code: "bool WarriorBaselineRotation::ExecuteRotation(int* bot, int* target, BaselineRotationManager&\
      \ manager)\n{\n    if (!bot || !target) return false;\n    \n    Player* player\
      \ = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(*bot);\n    Unit* unitTarget = ObjectAccessor::FindUnit(*target);\n\
      \    \n    if (!player || !unitTarget || !unitTarget->IsAlive())\n        return\
      \ false;\n    \n    // Execute rotation logic here\n    return true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently during combat updates and
    should not block execution for extended periods. The BaselineRotationManager must
    be properly initialized before calling this method, as it relies on rotation state
    tracking. Performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary object lookups
    and ensuring that target validity checks are efficient.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat situations without proper validation,
    as it may cause undefined behavior. Ensure that both bot and target pointers are
    valid before invocation to prevent crashes. The method assumes the player is in
    a valid combat state and may behave unexpectedly if called during non-combat phases.
