  signature: bool BotSessionFactory::IsCacheValid() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot session cache is valid and up-to-date.
  description: The IsCacheValid method determines if the current bot session cache
    contains valid data that can be used for bot operations. This method typically
    evaluates internal cache state flags or timestamps to ensure the cached session
    information hasn't expired or become stale. In the context of TrinityCore's bot
    system, this check is crucial before performing any operations that rely on cached
    session data to prevent using outdated or corrupted information. The method does
    not modify any state and is purely a query operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the cache is valid and can be safely used; returns false
    if the cache is invalid, expired, or needs to be refreshed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cache Validation Check
    code: "if (sessionFactory.IsCacheValid()) {\n    // Proceed with bot session operations\n\
      \    sessionManager.InitializeBotSession();\n} else {\n    // Refresh the cache\
      \ before proceeding\n    sessionFactory.RefreshCache();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the bot system before accessing
    cached session data. It may perform lightweight checks such as timestamp validation
    or flag state inspection, making it suitable for frequent calls without significant
    performance impact.
