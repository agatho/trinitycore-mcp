  class: TradeManager
  method: AcceptTrade
  signature: bool TradeManager::AcceptTrade()
documentation:
  brief: Completes the trade process by accepting the current trade agreement between
    two players.
  description: The AcceptTrade method finalizes a pending trade between two players
    in World of Warcraft. It validates that both parties have agreed to the trade
    terms, ensures the trade is still active and valid, and then processes the item
    transfers and gold exchanges. This method typically gets called when a player
    clicks the 'Accept' button during a trade interaction. The method checks for various
    conditions such as inventory space availability, item restrictions, and trade
    validity before completing the transaction. If successful, it updates both player's
    inventories and sends appropriate update packets to the clients.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the trade was successfully accepted and completed, false
    if the trade could not be finalized due to validation failures or other issues
    such as invalid trade state, insufficient inventory space, or item restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trade Acceptance
    code: "if (player1->GetTradeData()->AcceptTrade()) {\n    // Trade completed successfully\n\
      \    player1->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"Trade accepted.\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Trade failed to complete\n    player1->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"\
      Trade could not be completed.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the trade is in a valid state and
    both players have confirmed their agreement. It's important to check that the
    trade data is still valid before calling this method, as the trade may have been
    cancelled or modified by one of the parties.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation can lead to inconsistent
    game state, including item duplication or loss. Always ensure both players are
    still present and the trade has not expired before accepting.
