    uint32 enchantId, bool apply, Player * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes enchantment bonuses from an artifact power for the specified
    item slot.
  description: The ApplyArtifactPowerEnchantmentBonuses method manages the application
    and removal of enchantment bonuses associated with artifact powers on a specific
    item slot. This method is used internally by the TrinityCore framework to handle
    artifact power modifications when enchantments are applied or removed from items.
    It interacts with the player's artifact power system to ensure that enchantment
    effects are properly calculated and reflected in the item's stat modifiers. The
    method requires a valid player owner to correctly apply bonuses to the artifact
    item's enchantment slots.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The enchantment slot index where the bonus should be applied or removed.
      Valid values are typically defined by the EnchantmentSlot enum, representing
      different artifact power slots.
  - name: enchantId
    description: The unique identifier of the enchantment to apply or remove. This
      ID corresponds to an entry in the game's enchantment database and determines
      which bonuses are applied to the artifact power.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the enchantment bonuses from the artifact power.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object that owns the item. This is required
      to properly access and modify the player's artifact power state and ensure correct
      bonus application.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Apply Artifact Power Enchantment Bonus
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      Item* item = ...; // Get artifact item

      item->ApplyArtifactPowerEnchantmentBonuses(EQUIPMENT_SLOT_MAINHAND, 12345, true,
      player);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove Artifact Power Enchantment Bonus
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      Item* item = ...; // Get artifact item

      item->ApplyArtifactPowerEnchantmentBonuses(EQUIPMENT_SLOT_OFFHAND, 67890, false,
      player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during enchantment application or removal
    events. It directly affects the artifact power calculations and should only be
    invoked when the item is properly equipped by a valid player. The method does
    not perform any validation on the enchantId or slot parameters, so callers must
    ensure these values are valid.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid parameters (e.g., non-existent enchantId
    or invalid slot) may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the
    owner parameter is a valid player object and that the item is properly equipped
    before calling this method.
