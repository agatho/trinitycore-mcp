  method: AddTransmogFlag
  signature: void Player::AddTransmogFlag(uint32 slot, uint32 flag)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a transmogrification flag to a specific inventory slot for the player.
  description: This method adds a transmog flag to the specified inventory slot, allowing
    the player to apply transmogrification effects to their gear. The method is used
    primarily in the context of World of Warcraft's transmogrification system, where
    players can change the appearance of their items without altering their stats.
    It typically involves setting flags on item slots that determine which transmog
    options are available for a specific item. This method is part of the player's
    internal transmog management system and should be used carefully to avoid conflicts
    with existing transmog settings.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The inventory slot index where the transmog flag will be applied.
      Valid values are typically 0-18, representing different equipment slots (head,
      neck, shoulder, etc.).
  - name: flag
    description: The transmog flag value to add to the specified slot. This represents
      a unique identifier for the transmogrification item or effect that can be applied
      to the slot.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->AddTransmogFlag(15, 12345);

      // Adds transmog flag 12345 to slot 15 (main hand)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: '// Assuming player has a valid transmog system setup

      uint32 slot = 10;

      uint32 flag = 67890;

      player->AddTransmogFlag(slot, flag);

      // This would add the transmog flag to the chest slot'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player is in a valid state for
    transmogrification. Implementation details include ensuring that the flag value
    corresponds to a valid transmog entry in the game database, and that the slot
    is properly validated against the player's inventory structure. Performance considerations
    are minimal as this is a simple flag addition operation.
  warnings: This method should not be used on invalid slots or with invalid flag values.
    Using incorrect values may result in corrupted transmog data or unexpected behavior
    in-game. Care must be taken to ensure that the flags being added are valid and
    correspond to existing transmog entries.
