documentation:
  brief: Updates the progress of quest objectives for the player associated with this
    QuestManager instance.
  description: The UpdateObjectiveProgress method is responsible for processing and
    updating the state of quest objectives within the player's active quests. This
    method typically checks the current status of each objective (such as killing
    monsters, collecting items, or visiting locations) and advances the quest progress
    accordingly. It ensures that the player's quest log reflects the most up-to-date
    information based on their actions in the game world. The method is usually invoked
    automatically by the game engine when relevant events occur, but can also be called
    manually to force an update. This functionality is crucial for maintaining accurate
    quest tracking and ensuring proper quest completion conditions are evaluated.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'QuestManager* qm = player->GetQuestManager();

      qm->UpdateObjectiveProgress(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may trigger quest completion checks internally. It should be
    called after significant player actions that affect quest progress, such as defeating
    mobs or picking up items. The method operates on the player's current quest data
    and does not directly modify database records.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper game logic can cause
    performance issues. Avoid calling it in tight loops or high-frequency event handlers
    unless necessary.
