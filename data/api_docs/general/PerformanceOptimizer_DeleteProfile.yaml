  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: DeleteProfile
  signature: void PerformanceOptimizer::DeleteProfile(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Deletes a performance profile associated with the specified bot GUID from
    the optimizer's data structures.
  description: The DeleteProfile method removes a previously stored performance profile
    linked to a specific bot identified by its unique global identifier (GUID). This
    operation is typically used when a bot is no longer needed or has been removed
    from the system, ensuring that memory and resources allocated for its performance
    tracking are properly released. The method performs no validation on the existence
    of the profile before attempting deletion, which may result in undefined behavior
    if called with an invalid or non-existent GUID. It is expected that this function
    will be invoked as part of a larger bot lifecycle management process within the
    TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique global identifier (GUID) of the bot whose performance
      profile should be deleted. This value must correspond to an existing bot in
      the system; otherwise, the behavior is undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      optimizer.DeleteProfile(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the internal data structures used to store performance
    profiles are thread-safe. If multiple threads access or modify these structures
    concurrently, additional synchronization mechanisms may be required to prevent
    race conditions.
  warnings: Calling this method with a non-existent bot GUID can lead to memory corruption
    or other undefined behavior. Ensure that the GUID corresponds to an actual bot
    before invoking this function.
