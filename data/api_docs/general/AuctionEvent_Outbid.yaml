api:
  class: AuctionEvent
  method: Outbid
  signature: AuctionEvent AuctionEvent::Outbid(int playerGuid, uint32 auctionId, uint64
    newBid)
documentation:
  brief: Processes an auction outbid event for a specified player and auction.
  description: The Outbid method handles the logic when a player places a bid that
    exceeds the current highest bid on an auction. It updates the auction's state,
    records the new bidder, and may trigger notifications or additional game mechanics
    such as refunding the previous bidder. This method is typically invoked by the
    auction house system when a new bid is placed. The method ensures that auction
    data remains consistent and that players are properly notified of bid changes.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who placed the outbid.
  - name: auctionId
    description: The unique identifier of the auction being outbid.
  - name: newBid
    description: The new bid amount that exceeds the previous highest bid.
  returns: Returns an AuctionEvent object representing the updated state of the auction
    after processing the outbid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Outbid Event Handling
    code: AuctionEvent event = auctionEvent.Outbid(12345, 67890, 5000000); // Player
      12345 outbids with 500g
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing Outbid in Auction House System
    code: "void HandleAuctionOutbid(uint32 bidderGuid, uint32 auctionId, uint64 newBid)\
      \ {\n    AuctionEvent event = AuctionEvent::Outbid(bidderGuid, auctionId, newBid);\n\
      \    // Process event for notifications or logging\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the new bid is valid and higher than the current
    highest bid. It does not validate the bid amount against minimum increments or
    player funds. The returned AuctionEvent object should be used to update the auction's
    state in the game world.
  warnings: Ensure that the auction ID and player GUID are valid before calling this
    method, as invalid identifiers may lead to undefined behavior or data corruption.
    This method does not perform automatic refunds of previous bidders; that logic
    must be handled separately.
