  class: StartupSpawnOrchestrator
  method: ShouldTransitionPhase
  signature: bool StartupSpawnOrchestrator::ShouldTransitionPhase() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the startup spawn orchestrator should transition to the
    next phase of object spawning.
  description: The ShouldTransitionPhase method evaluates the current state of the
    startup spawn orchestrator to decide if it's time to advance to the next phase
    of object spawning within a World of Warcraft instance. This method is typically
    used during the server initialization process when various game objects, creatures,
    and game events are being spawned in a controlled sequence. The decision to transition
    phases is based on internal state tracking, completion flags, or timing mechanisms
    that ensure proper sequencing of spawn operations. It's commonly called by the
    core game loop or spawn management systems to coordinate the gradual loading and
    activation of world content during server startup or instance creation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the orchestrator has completed its current phase and should
    proceed to the next one; returns false if the current phase is still active or
    if no transition is required at this time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spawn management
    code: "if (orchestrator.ShouldTransitionPhase()) {\n    orchestrator.AdvancePhase();\n\
      \    LOG_INFO(\"worldserver\", \"Transitioned to next spawn phase\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with server startup loop
    code: "void WorldServer::UpdateStartupSpawns() {\n    static StartupSpawnOrchestrator\
      \ orchestrator;\n    if (orchestrator.ShouldTransitionPhase()) {\n        orchestrator.TransitionToNextPhase();\n\
      \        // Continue with next phase logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called in a tight loop during server startup or
    instance initialization. It's designed to be lightweight and fast, as it may be
    invoked frequently. The internal state tracking mechanism ensures that transitions
    happen only when appropriate, preventing premature advancement of spawn phases.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the intended spawn orchestration context,
    as it relies on internal state that may not be properly initialized or maintained
    in other scenarios. Incorrect usage could lead to inconsistent object spawning
    behavior.
