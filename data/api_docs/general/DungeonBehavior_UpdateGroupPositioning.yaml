    & encounter)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the positioning of a group within a dungeon encounter.
  description: The UpdateGroupPositioning method is responsible for adjusting the
    spatial arrangement and positioning of players within a group during a dungeon
    encounter. This method ensures that group members are properly positioned relative
    to each other and to encounter-specific objectives, such as boss locations or
    environmental hazards. It typically handles coordination of player movement, formation
    maintenance, and positioning adjustments based on encounter mechanics. The method
    operates on a provided Group object and uses DungeonEncounter data to determine
    appropriate positioning strategies.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose positioning needs to be updated.
      Must not be null and should represent an active group in the dungeon.
  - name: encounter
    description: Reference to the DungeonEncounter object that defines the current
      encounter state and positioning requirements. Used to determine positioning
      rules and constraints for the group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Positioning Update
    code: "void MyDungeonScript::OnEncounterStart(Group* group, const DungeonEncounter&\
      \ encounter)\n{\n    dungeonBehavior.UpdateGroupPositioning(group, encounter);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Positioning with Custom Logic
    code: "void MyDungeonScript::UpdateEncounterPositioning(Group* group, const DungeonEncounter&\
      \ encounter)\n{\n    // Pre-condition: Ensure group is valid and in dungeon\n\
      \    if (!group || !encounter.IsValid())\n        return;\n    \n    // Apply\
      \ custom positioning logic before updating\n    AdjustGroupFormation(group,\
      \ encounter);\n    \n    // Update positioning using core behavior\n    dungeonBehavior.UpdateGroupPositioning(group,\
      \ encounter);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during dungeon encounter events and should
    be invoked after the encounter state has been initialized. The implementation
    may involve movement coordination, formation adjustments, and positioning constraints
    based on encounter-specific rules. Performance considerations include avoiding
    excessive repositioning calls during active combat situations.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Calling with an invalid group or encounter reference may result in undefined
    behavior or client-side errors. This method should not be called outside of proper
    dungeon encounter contexts.
