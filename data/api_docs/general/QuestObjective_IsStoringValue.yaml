  class: QuestObjective
  method: IsStoringValue
  signature: bool QuestObjective::IsStoringValue() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the quest objective is configured to store a value.
  description: The IsStoringValue method checks if the current quest objective has
    been set up to track and store a specific value during quest progression. This
    is typically used in objectives that require counting items, killing creatures,
    or achieving certain conditions where a numerical value needs to be maintained
    and updated throughout the quest lifecycle. The method returns true if the objective
    is designed to store a value, and false otherwise. This functionality is crucial
    for proper quest state management within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest objective is configured to store a value; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Objective Stores Value
    code: "if (questObjective->IsStoringValue()) {\n    // Handle logic for objectives\
      \ that track values\n    uint32 currentValue = questObjective->GetProgress();\n\
      \    // ... process value tracking logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other quest objective methods
    to determine how to handle progress updates and completion conditions. It's important
    to note that objectives which store values typically require additional methods
    like GetProgress() or SetProgress() to manage the actual stored value.
