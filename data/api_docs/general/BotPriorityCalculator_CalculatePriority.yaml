  class: BotPriorityCalculator
  method: CalculatePriority
  signature: uint32 BotPriorityCalculator::CalculatePriority(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the priority value for a bot based on its current
    state and configuration.
  description: The CalculatePriority method determines the operational priority of
    a bot within the TrinityCore framework. This priority value influences how the
    bot is scheduled for execution, resource allocation, and decision-making processes.
    The method evaluates various factors such as the bot's health, mana levels, target
    status, and current activity to assign an appropriate priority level. It serves
    as a core component in the bot management system, ensuring that higher-priority
    bots receive more attention from the game engine. The calculation considers both
    immediate tactical needs and long-term strategic goals of the bot.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot's identifier or internal
      state. This parameter is used to access the specific bot instance whose priority
      is being calculated.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the calculated priority of the specified
    bot. Higher values indicate higher priority, with 0 typically representing the
    lowest possible priority level.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Priority Calculation
    code: 'int botId = 42;

      uint32 priority = calculator.CalculatePriority(&botId);

      // priority now contains the calculated priority value for bot #42'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Priority in Bot Management
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < botCount; ++i)\n{\n    uint32 priority = calculator.CalculatePriority(&bots[i]);\n\
      \    if (priority > highestPriority)\n    {\n        highestPriority = priority;\n\
      \        highestPriorityBot = i;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during bot update cycles to dynamically adjust
    priorities based on changing conditions. The implementation may involve complex
    calculations including health percentages, mana levels, threat assessment, and
    target distance. Performance considerations are important as this method may be
    called frequently during gameplay.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter points to a valid bot instance; passing
    an invalid or null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. The priority values
    returned should not be used directly for critical game logic without proper validation.
