  signature: bool VendorInteraction::IsJunkItem(Item * item) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given item is classified as junk by the vendor interaction
    system.
  description: The IsJunkItem method evaluates whether a specified Item object should
    be considered junk within the context of vendor interactions. This classification
    typically determines if an item can be sold to vendors or discarded, often based
    on item quality, type, or other game-defined criteria. The method is commonly
    used during vendor transactions to filter out items that are not worth selling
    or to identify low-value items for automatic disposal. It does not modify the
    item's state but rather performs a read-only check to determine its junk status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item is classified as junk, false otherwise. An item
    is considered junk when it meets specific criteria such as being below a certain
    quality threshold or belonging to a category that vendors typically ignore for
    selling purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an item is junk before selling
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0, slot);\nif (vendorInteraction->IsJunkItem(item))\
      \ {\n    // Skip selling this item\n    continue;\n} else {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with vendor transaction\n    vendorInteraction->SellItem(item);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal vendor configuration rules or item database
    flags to determine junk status. It may be called frequently during vendor interactions,
    so performance is important. The implementation might cache results for efficiency
    if the same items are checked multiple times.
  warnings: Ensure that the Item pointer passed to this method is valid and not null;
    otherwise, calling this method could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This
    method should only be used in contexts where vendor interaction logic is active.
