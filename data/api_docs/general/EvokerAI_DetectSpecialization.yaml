  class: EvokerAI
  method: DetectSpecialization
  signature: EvokerSpec EvokerAI::DetectSpecialization()
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the evoker's current specialization based on spell
    knowledge and combat role.
  description: The DetectSpecialization method evaluates the evoker's current state,
    including known spells, active abilities, and combat behavior to identify which
    of the three evoker specializations they are currently utilizing. This method
    is crucial for AI decision-making in TrinityCore's implementation of the Evoker
    class, allowing the AI to adapt its spell selection and tactics according to the
    chosen specialization. The function typically checks for key spells or abilities
    unique to each specialization such as 'Invoke the Void' for Shadow, 'Emerald Blossom'
    for Restoration, or 'Sudden Death' for Destruction. It ensures that the AI's behavior
    aligns with the player's current specialization for optimal performance and role-specific
    gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'Returns an EvokerSpec enum value indicating the detected specialization:
    EVOKER_SPEC_VOID for Void, EVOKER_SPEC_RESTORATION for Restoration, or EVOKER_SPEC_DESTRUCTION
    for Destruction. If no specialization can be determined, it may return EVOKER_SPEC_NONE
    or throw an exception depending on implementation.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "EvokerSpec spec = evokerAI->DetectSpecialization();\nif (spec == EVOKER_SPEC_DESTRUCTION)\n\
      {\n    // Use destruction-specific abilities\n    evokerAI->CastSpell(SPELL_SUNNY_DEATH);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Decision Making
    code: "EvokerSpec spec = evokerAI->DetectSpecialization();\nswitch (spec)\n{\n\
      \    case EVOKER_SPEC_VOID:\n        evokerAI->CastSpell(SPELL_INVOKE_THE_VOID);\n\
      \        break;\n    case EVOKER_SPEC_RESTORATION:\n        evokerAI->CastSpell(SPELL_EMERALD_BLOSSOM);\n\
      \        break;\n    case EVOKER_SPEC_DESTRUCTION:\n        evokerAI->CastSpell(SPELL_SUNNY_DEATH);\n\
      \        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spell tracking and may not be immediately
    accurate during specialization transitions or when spells are temporarily unavailable.
    The AI should cache this value unless frequent updates are required for tactical
    reasons. Performance is generally low as it involves checking multiple spell conditions,
    but caching can mitigate this.
  warnings: The method might return an incorrect specialization if the evoker's spell
    state is not fully synchronized with their actual class specialization. Avoid
    calling this method too frequently in tight loops without caching to prevent unnecessary
    performance overhead.
