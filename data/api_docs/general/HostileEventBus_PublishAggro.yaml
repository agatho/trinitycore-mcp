  class: HostileEventBus
  method: PublishAggro
  signature: void HostileEventBus::PublishAggro(int hostile, int target, uint32 zoneId)
documentation:
  brief: Publishes an aggro event to the hostile event bus when a hostile unit targets
    a player or creature.
  description: 'The PublishAggro method is used to notify the HostileEventBus of an
    aggro event occurring in the game world. It is typically called when a hostile
    NPC (such as a mob) begins targeting a player or another creature. This method
    broadcasts the event so that other systems, such as AI behavior modules or combat
    log handlers, can react accordingly. The method takes three parameters: the ID
    of the hostile unit, the ID of the target unit, and the zone ID where the event
    occurred. It does not return any value and is designed to be a fire-and-forget
    operation within the game''s event-driven architecture.'
  parameters:
  - name: hostile
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the hostile unit that is initiating
      the aggro. This is typically an NPC or mob ID.
  - name: target
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the target unit that is being aggroed
      by the hostile unit. This can be a player or another creature.
  - name: zoneId
    description: The zone ID where the aggro event occurred. Used for spatial context
      and event filtering in the event bus.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Aggro Event Publishing
    code: HostileEventBus::instance().PublishAggro(12345, 67890, 123);
    language: cpp
  - title: Aggro Event with Dynamic Targeting
    code: 'uint32 zoneId = player->GetZoneId();

      HostileEventBus::instance().PublishAggro(mob->GetEntry(), player->GetGUIDLow(),
      zoneId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the event-driven system in TrinityCore and should
    be called whenever a hostile unit begins targeting another unit. It is not thread-safe,
    so ensure that calls are made from the appropriate game thread context. The zone
    ID parameter allows for better filtering and localization of events within specific
    zones.
  warnings: Ensure that the hostile and target IDs are valid before calling this method
    to avoid unexpected behavior or crashes in the event bus system. Avoid calling
    this method outside of combat or AI logic contexts unless necessary.
