  method: EnableCollision
  signature: void GameObject::EnableCollision(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables collision detection for the GameObject, allowing it to interact with
    players and other objects.
  description: The EnableCollision method toggles the collision state of a GameObject,
    determining whether it can be interacted with by players or other game entities.
    When enabled, the GameObject will respond to player interactions and can trigger
    events such as quest completion or item collection. This method is typically used
    during object spawning or initialization to ensure proper game mechanics behavior.
    The method affects the GameObject's physical presence in the world and its ability
    to be picked up or interacted with.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->EnableCollision(true);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during GameObject initialization or when changing
    the object's state. It affects the object's physical properties and may impact
    performance if used frequently. Thread safety depends on the implementation context.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to objects not being interactable,
    potentially causing quest failures or missing interactions. Ensure that collision
    is enabled only when needed for gameplay mechanics.
