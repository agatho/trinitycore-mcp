documentation:
  brief: Rolls a random breed for a specified battle pet species
  description: The RollPetBreed method generates a random breed identifier for a given
    battle pet species. This function is typically used during pet creation or breeding
    mechanics within the Battle Pet system. The method takes a species ID as input
    and returns a breed value that determines the pet's genetic traits. The implementation
    likely uses a pseudo-random number generator to select from valid breeds associated
    with the provided species. This method may be called internally by the game engine
    when creating new battle pets or when processing breeding operations.
  parameters:
  - name: species
    description: The unique identifier for the battle pet species. This value corresponds
      to the pet's species ID as defined in the game's database.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the randomly selected breed ID for the
    specified pet species. A negative value may indicate an error or invalid species
    ID was provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine pet breed
    code: "int breedId = battlePetMgr->RollPetBreed(12345);\nif (breedId >= 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Successfully rolled a valid breed\n    printf(\"Rolled breed ID: %d\\\
      n\", breedId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid species or error condition\n\
      \    printf(\"Failed to roll breed for species 12345\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal game data tables that map species to
    valid breeds. The randomization may be seeded based on the current time or other
    factors to ensure different results during breeding operations. This function
    should only be called with valid species IDs to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid species ID may result in unexpected
    behavior or return values. Ensure that the species parameter corresponds to a
    known battle pet species in the game database before invoking this method.
