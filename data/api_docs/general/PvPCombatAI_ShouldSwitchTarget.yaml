  class: PvPCombatAI
  method: ShouldSwitchTarget
  signature: bool PvPCombatAI::ShouldSwitchTarget(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the AI should switch to a new target based on PvP combat
    conditions.
  description: The ShouldSwitchTarget method evaluates current combat state and player
    engagement to decide if the AI should abandon its current target and select a
    new one. This method is typically used in PvP scenarios where targets may become
    invalid or less optimal due to distance, health, or threat changes. It considers
    factors such as target validity, threat level, and proximity to determine whether
    switching targets would improve combat effectiveness. The method does not perform
    the actual target switch; it only makes the decision.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer that will be set to the GUID of the new target
      if a switch is recommended. May be null if only decision-making is required.
  returns: True if the AI should switch targets, false otherwise. When true, the player
    parameter is updated with the GUID of the recommended new target.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat loop
    code: "if (ai->ShouldSwitchTarget(&newTargetGuid)) {\n    // Switch to new target\n\
      \    me->SetTarget(newTargetGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with threat-based targeting logic
    code: "int targetGuid = 0;\nif (ai->ShouldSwitchTarget(&targetGuid)) {\n    if\
      \ (targetGuid != 0) {\n        // Update to new target\n        me->SetTarget(targetGuid);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PvPCombatAI class and is designed specifically
    for player versus player combat scenarios. It relies on internal AI state tracking
    and may be influenced by factors such as target health, distance, and threat level.
    The method assumes that the AI has already been initialized with valid combat
    data.
  warnings: Ensure that the player parameter is properly initialized before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior. This method should not be called during
    critical AI processing phases where target stability is required.
