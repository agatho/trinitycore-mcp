  class: BotPopulationManager
  method: Update
  signature: void BotPopulationManager::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the bot population manager's internal state and processes any pending
    bot-related operations.
  description: The Update method is responsible for maintaining the state of the bot
    population within the TrinityCore environment. It handles periodic tasks such
    as processing bot AI behaviors, managing bot spawn queues, updating bot statistics,
    and synchronizing bot data with the game world. This method is typically called
    from the main game loop at regular intervals to ensure bots remain responsive
    and behave according to their configured settings. The implementation likely includes
    checks for bot lifecycle management, resource allocation, and integration with
    the core WorldObject update system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other updates ...\n\
      \    botPopulationManager.Update(diff);\n    // ... other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Update with Timing Considerations
    code: "void BotManager::UpdateBots(uint32 diff)\n{\n    static uint32 lastUpdate\
      \ = 0;\n    if (getMSTime() - lastUpdate >= BOT_UPDATE_INTERVAL)\n    {\n  \
      \      botPopulationManager.Update(diff);\n        lastUpdate = getMSTime();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the main game update loop. The
    'diff' parameter represents the time elapsed since the last update in milliseconds
    and is crucial for maintaining consistent bot behavior regardless of system performance
    variations.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper timing control may lead to inconsistent
    bot behavior or performance issues. Ensure that the diff parameter accurately
    reflects the actual time passed between updates.
