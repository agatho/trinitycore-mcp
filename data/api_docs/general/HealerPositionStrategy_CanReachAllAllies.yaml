  class: HealerPositionStrategy
  method: CanReachAllAllies
  signature: bool HealerPositionStrategy::CanReachAllAllies(const int & pos, int allies)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the healer can reach all nearby allies from a given position.
  description: The CanReachAllAllies method evaluates if a healer unit can effectively
    reach and provide healing to all allied targets within range from a specified
    position. This method is typically used in AI decision-making processes for positioning
    strategies, particularly in group scenarios where optimal healer placement is
    crucial for maintaining team survivability. The method considers factors such
    as movement range, line of sight, and target proximity to determine if all allies
    can be healed from the given location. It serves as a core component in pathfinding
    and positioning logic for healer units in TrinityCore's AI system.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position coordinate (likely x or y axis value) from which to
      evaluate reachability to allies
  - name: allies
    description: An integer identifier or count representing the number of allies
      or their group configuration that need to be reachable
  returns: Returns true if all specified allies can be reached from the given position,
    false otherwise. This indicates whether the healer's positioning strategy is viable
    for covering all nearby friendly units.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in healer AI decision making
    code: "if (healerStrategy.CanReachAllAllies(currentPosition, allyCount)) {\n \
      \   // Proceed with healing action\n    healer->CastSpell(target, SPELL_HEAL);\n\
      } else {\n    // Move to a better position\n    healer->MoveToBetterPosition();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with pathfinding for optimal healer positioning
    code: "int bestPosition = 0;\nbool isValidPosition = false;\nfor (int i = 0; i\
      \ < maxPositions; ++i) {\n    if (healerStrategy.CanReachAllAllies(i, totalAllies))\
      \ {\n        bestPosition = i;\n        isValidPosition = true;\n        break;\n\
      \    }\n}\nif (isValidPosition) {\n    healer->SetPosition(bestPosition);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal AI pathfinding and range calculations to
    determine reachability. Performance may be impacted in large groups or complex
    environments where many ally positions need evaluation. The method assumes that
    allies are within a reasonable proximity for healing mechanics.
  warnings: The method's behavior might vary depending on the healer's current state
    (moving, casting, etc.) and may not account for dynamic obstacles or changing
    ally positions during execution. Using this method in high-frequency loops could
    cause performance degradation if not properly optimized.
