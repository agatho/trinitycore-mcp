  signature: void HunterAI::UpdateRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the hunter's combat rotation based on target and current game state
  description: The UpdateRotation method is responsible for determining and executing
    the appropriate combat actions for a hunter AI character. It evaluates the current
    target, available spells, ammunition status, and other relevant factors to decide
    the optimal sequence of abilities to perform. This method typically integrates
    with the hunter's decision-making process to ensure efficient and effective combat
    behavior. The method modifies internal AI state and may trigger spell casts or
    movement actions based on the calculated rotation.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target identifier (GUID) for
      which the rotation should be updated. This parameter is used to determine the
      current target of the hunter AI.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void HunterAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        int targetGuid = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n        UpdateRotation(&targetGuid);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Target Management
    code: "void HunterAI::UpdateRotation(int* target)\n{\n    if (!target || *target\
      \ <= 0)\n        return;\n\n    Unit* unitTarget = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*this,\
      \ *target);\n    if (!unitTarget || !unitTarget->IsAlive())\n        return;\n\
      \n    // Core rotation logic would be implemented here\n    // e.g., check for\
      \ ranged attack, trap placement, pet control, etc.\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should not
    be invoked directly from outside the AI framework. The target parameter must point
    to a valid unit GUID; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. Implementation
    details may vary based on specific hunter class specialization and current game
    state.
  warnings: Do not call this method with a null pointer or invalid target GUID as
    it may lead to crashes or incorrect AI behavior. This method assumes that the
    target is valid and alive before processing.
