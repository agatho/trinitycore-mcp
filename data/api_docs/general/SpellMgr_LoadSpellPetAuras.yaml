documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes spell pet auras from the database into memory for use
    in the game world.
  description: The LoadSpellPetAuras method is responsible for loading all spell pet
    aura definitions from the database into the SpellMgr's internal data structures.
    These auras define how pets behave when they are summoned or controlled by players,
    including their passive abilities, buffs, and debuffs. This method typically runs
    during server startup or reload operations to ensure that all pet-related spell
    effects are properly registered and available for application to summoned creatures.
    The method does not take any parameters and performs no direct return value operations;
    instead, it populates internal caches and lookup tables used by the spell system
    when handling pet-related gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadSpellPetAuras()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->LoadSpellPetAuras();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked during server initialization or database reloads.
    It assumes that the database connection is already established and that the relevant
    spell pet aura tables contain valid data. The loaded auras are cached internally
    for fast lookup during runtime, so repeated calls after initial loading have no
    effect.
