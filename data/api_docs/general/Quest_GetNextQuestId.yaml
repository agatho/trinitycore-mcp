  method: GetNextQuestId
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetNextQuestId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the next quest ID in the chain for a given quest.
  description: The GetNextQuestId method retrieves the unique identifier of the next
    quest in the quest chain, which is used to determine the progression of quest
    completion. This method is essential for understanding how quests connect and
    transition from one to another within the game's quest system. It helps developers
    and scripters track quest progression and implement proper quest handling logic.
    The method returns a uint32 value representing the next quest ID in the sequence,
    which can be used to check if a quest has been completed or to determine what
    quest should be triggered next.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the unique identifier of the next quest in
    the chain. This value is typically used to identify the next quest in the quest
    progression and may be zero if there are no more quests in the chain or if the
    quest has reached its end.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Chain Retrieval
    code: "Quest* quest = player->GetQuestForEntry(12345);\nuint32 nextQuestId = quest->GetNextQuestId();\n\
      if (nextQuestId != 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with next quest\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to properly handle quest progression. It's important to note that the returned
    value may be zero if there are no more quests in the chain or if the quest has
    reached its end, which could indicate a completed quest or a missing next quest
    in the sequence.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it can lead to incorrect
    quest progression if not properly handled. The method should only be used when
    the quest is valid and has been properly initialized. Incorrect usage may result
    in quest chain loops or missing quest progression.
