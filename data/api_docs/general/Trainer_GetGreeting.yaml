  method: GetGreeting
  signature: const std::string & Trainer::GetGreeting(LocaleConstant locale) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the greeting message displayed to players when interacting with
    a trainer.
  description: The GetGreeting method returns the localized greeting string that is
    shown to players when they interact with a trainer NPC. This message typically
    contains initial dialogue or instructions related to training services offered
    by the NPC. The method supports localization through the provided locale parameter,
    allowing different messages to be returned based on the player's language settings.
    The greeting is usually displayed in the trainer's dialog window before any training
    options are presented.
  parameters:
  - name: locale
    description: The LocaleConstant value specifying which localized version of the
      greeting to retrieve. This parameter determines the language variant of the
      returned string, supporting multiple languages for internationalization.
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the localized greeting
    message for the trainer. The string may be empty if no greeting is defined for
    the specified locale.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve trainer greeting
    code: 'Trainer* trainer = ...; // Assume trainer object is obtained

      const std::string& greeting = trainer->GetGreeting(DEFAULT_LOCALE);

      printf("Trainer greeting: %s\n", greeting.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using locale-specific greeting for player interaction
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player object is available\nLocaleConstant\
      \ playerLocale = player->GetSession()->GetSessionDbcLocale();\nconst std::string&\
      \ greeting = trainer->GetGreeting(playerLocale);\nif (!greeting.empty()) {\n\
      \    // Display the greeting to the player\n    player->SendNotification(greeting.c_str());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method returns a constant reference, so modifications to the returned
    string will not affect the internal trainer data. The locale parameter should
    be validated against supported locales in the game's localization system. This
    method is typically called during NPC interaction initialization and may cache
    results for performance.
  warnings: Ensure that the locale parameter is valid before calling this method,
    as invalid locale values might return unexpected or empty strings. Avoid storing
    references to the returned string beyond the scope of the current function call,
    as the internal data might be modified or destroyed.
