  method: GetStartPosition
  signature: const int & PathGenerator::GetStartPosition() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the starting position of a path generated by the PathGenerator.
  description: The GetStartPosition method retrieves the initial coordinate point
    from which a path was calculated. This method is typically used in navigation
    and movement systems within TrinityCore to determine where an NPC or player's
    movement path begins. The returned value represents the x-coordinate of the starting
    position, as the method signature suggests it returns a const int reference, implying
    that the underlying data structure likely stores positions in a structured format
    such as a vector or array. This method does not modify any internal state and
    is safe to call multiple times without side effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the x-coordinate of the
    starting position of the path. The actual coordinate system and units depend on
    the context in which the PathGenerator is used, typically matching the game world's
    coordinate system.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Starting Position
    code: 'PathGenerator pathGen;

      // Assume pathGen has been initialized with a valid path

      const int& startPos = pathGen.GetStartPosition();

      std::cout << "Start X position: " << startPos << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the PathGenerator object has already computed or
    loaded a valid path. If called before any path generation, it may return an undefined
    or invalid value depending on implementation details. The returned reference points
    to internal data and should not be modified directly.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the value returned by this method as it's a const
    reference to internal data. Accessing the returned reference after the PathGenerator
    object has been destroyed results in undefined behavior. Ensure that the path
    has been properly generated or loaded before calling this method.
