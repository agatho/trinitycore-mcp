  class: LFGGroupCoordinator
  method: Update
  signature: void LFGGroupCoordinator::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the LFG group coordinator state based on the elapsed time since last
    update.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and maintaining the
    state of a Looking For Group (LFG) coordinator. It handles internal logic such
    as checking for group member changes, updating quest status, managing cooldowns,
    and synchronizing group data with the LFG system. This method is typically called
    by the game loop at regular intervals to ensure that the LFG group remains synchronized
    with current player availability and quest requirements. The method uses the provided
    time delta (diff) to perform time-based calculations and state transitions.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      value is used to calculate time-based operations such as cooldown expiration,
      timeout checks, and status updates.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = GetMillisecondsSinceLastUpdate();\n\
      \    lfgGroupCoordinator->Update(diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Update with Conditional Logic
    code: "void ProcessGameTick(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (lfgGroupCoordinator->IsGroupActive())\n\
      \    {\n        lfgGroupCoordinator->Update(diff);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n\
      \        // Handle inactive group logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the main game loop to maintain
    LFG group integrity. The diff parameter must represent actual elapsed time for
    proper behavior. The implementation may internally manage timers and state transitions
    that depend on accurate timing.
  warnings: Do not call this method with incorrect or zero time deltas, as it may
    cause unexpected behavior in LFG group management. Ensure the coordinator is properly
    initialized before calling Update.
