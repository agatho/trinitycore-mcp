documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is an armorer, returning true if the unit has
    armor training.
  description: The IsArmorer method checks if a Unit object possesses armor training
    capabilities. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework to identify whether a character or creature can equip armor types. The
    function returns true when the unit has the ability to wear armor, which typically
    applies to classes like warriors, paladins, and other classes that are allowed
    to use armor. It may also be used in conjunction with other methods to determine
    equipment eligibility for specific unit types.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is an armorer, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the unit can wear armor or not.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (unit->IsArmorer()) {\n    // Unit can equip armor\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other methods that check
    for class-specific abilities or equipment requirements. It may be related to the
    unit's class or specialization, and should be considered when determining if a
    unit can wear specific armor types.
  warnings: The method does not guarantee that the unit will actually equip armor;
    it only indicates whether the unit has the capability to do so. This method is
    often used in conjunction with other checks to determine actual equipment eligibility.
