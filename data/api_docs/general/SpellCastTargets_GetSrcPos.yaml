documentation:
  brief: Returns the source position coordinates of a spell cast target.
  description: The GetSrcPos method retrieves the source position coordinates associated
    with a spell cast target. This method is typically used in the context of spell
    casting mechanics to determine where a spell originates from, such as the caster's
    location when casting a spell. The returned pointer points to an array of integers
    representing the X, Y, and Z coordinates of the source position. It is important
    to note that the returned pointer is const, meaning the data should not be modified
    directly. The method does not perform any validation on whether the source position
    has been set or is valid; it simply returns whatever value is stored internally.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an array of three integers representing the X, Y, and
    Z coordinates of the spell's source position. Returns nullptr if no source position
    has been set.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "SpellCastTargets targets;\n// Assume targets has been populated with a\
      \ source position\nconst int* srcPos = targets.GetSrcPos();\nif (srcPos != nullptr)\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"Source X: \" << srcPos[0] << \", Y: \" << srcPos[1]\
      \ << \", Z: \" << srcPos[2] << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Source Position in Spell Logic
    code: "void CastSpellAtPosition(SpellCastTargets& targets) {\n    const int* srcPos\
      \ = targets.GetSrcPos();\n    if (srcPos != nullptr) {\n        // Use srcPos[0],\
      \ srcPos[1], srcPos[2] for spell positioning logic\n        float x = static_cast<float>(srcPos[0]);\n\
      \        float y = static_cast<float>(srcPos[1]);\n        float z = static_cast<float>(srcPos[2]);\n\
      \        // Perform spell casting logic using these coordinates\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned pointer points to internal data within the SpellCastTargets
    object. Modifying the values through this pointer directly may lead to unexpected
    behavior or inconsistencies in the spell target tracking system. The method assumes
    that if a source position exists, it is stored as an array of three integers in
    order (X, Y, Z).
  warnings: Do not modify the data pointed to by the returned pointer as it can corrupt
    internal state. Always check for nullptr before dereferencing the returned pointer
    to avoid segmentation faults.
