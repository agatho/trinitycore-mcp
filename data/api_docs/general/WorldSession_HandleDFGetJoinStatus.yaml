documentation:
  brief: Handles a request to retrieve the player's current dungeon finder join status.
  description: This method processes incoming client requests to check whether the
    player is currently eligible to join a dungeon finder group. It evaluates the
    player's current LFG (Looking For Group) state, including any active queues, cooldowns,
    or restrictions that might prevent joining. The method typically responds by sending
    back a packet containing the join status information to the client. This functionality
    is integral to the World of Warcraft's dungeon finding system and ensures players
    are not allowed to join groups under invalid conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Session Handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleDFGetJoinStatus(WorldPackets::LFG::DFGetJoinStatus&\
      \ dfGetJoinStatus)\n{\n    // Process the request to get join status\n    SendDFJoinStatus();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG subsystem and relies on internal state tracking
    of player group eligibility. It should be called only when a client explicitly
    requests join status via the DFGetJoinStatus packet.
