  method: ~Battleground
  signature: void Battleground::~Battleground()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a battleground instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ~Battleground destructor is automatically invoked when a battleground
    object is destroyed. This method ensures proper cleanup of all resources allocated
    during the battleground's lifetime, including removing players from the battleground,
    cleaning up event handlers, and releasing any memory or references held by the
    battleground instance. The destructor is part of the standard C++ object lifecycle
    and is called implicitly when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this method plays
    a crucial role in maintaining server stability by preventing memory leaks and
    ensuring proper state management during battleground transitions.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of battleground instance
    code: 'Battleground* bg = new Battleground();

      // ... gameplay logic ...

      delete bg; // Destructor called here automatically'
    language: cpp
  - title: Battleground lifecycle management
    code: "void HandleBattlegroundEnd(Battleground* bg)\n{\n    // Clean up battleground\
      \ resources\n    delete bg;\n    bg = nullptr;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime when a Battleground
    object is deleted. It's important to note that this method should not be called
    directly unless you're explicitly managing the object lifecycle. The destructor
    ensures that all players are properly removed from the battleground and that any
    associated resources are freed, which is essential for maintaining server performance
    and preventing memory leaks.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke this destructor unless you have a specific reason
    to do so. The destructor should only be called as part of normal object destruction.
    Improper use can lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. Also note that
    the destructor does not handle player removal from the game world - that is handled
    separately by the battleground management system.
