documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Shaman AI should use the Elemental Mastery ability
    based on current combat state and spell availability.
  description: The ShouldUseElementalMastery method evaluates various conditions to
    decide if the Shaman AI should activate the Elemental Mastery talent. This includes
    checking if the ability is off cooldown, if the shaman has sufficient mana, and
    whether using the ability would improve overall damage output or survivability
    in the current combat scenario. The method considers the current target's health,
    available spells, and the shaman's current resource state to make an informed
    decision about when to use this powerful elemental ability.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Shaman AI should use Elemental Mastery at this moment;
    otherwise returns false. A return value of true indicates that all conditions
    for optimal usage have been met, while false means it is not currently advantageous
    to use the ability.

    code: "if (shamanAI->ShouldUseElementalMastery()) {\n    // Execute Elemental\
      \ Mastery logic\n    shamanAI->DoElementalMastery();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Logic
    code: "void ShamanAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff) {\n    if (ShouldUseElementalMastery())\
      \ {\n        DoElementalMastery();\n        return;\n    }\n    // Continue\
      \ with normal AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and may be influenced
    by other factors such as target type, encounter phase, or specific encounter mechanics.
    The decision-making process accounts for both immediate tactical needs and longer-term
    resource management.
