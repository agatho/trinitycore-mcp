  class: Player
  method: SetSaveTimer
  signature: void Player::SetSaveTimer(uint32 timer)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's save timer to the specified value in milliseconds.
  description: The SetSaveTimer method configures the internal save timer for a Player
    object, determining how often the player's data will be automatically saved to
    the database. This timer is typically used to control the frequency of periodic
    saves during gameplay to prevent data loss in case of unexpected shutdowns or
    crashes. The timer value represents the interval in milliseconds between automatic
    saves. Setting this value too low may cause performance issues due to excessive
    database I/O, while setting it too high increases the risk of data loss if the
    server crashes before the next scheduled save.
  parameters:
  - name: timer
    description: The save interval in milliseconds. This value determines how frequently
      the player's data will be automatically saved to the database. A value of 0
      disables automatic saving.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Save Timer to 30 Seconds
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->SetSaveTimer(30000); // Save every 30 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Automatic Saving
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->SetSaveTimer(0); // Disable automatic saving'
    language: cpp
  notes: The save timer is managed internally by the TrinityCore server and affects
    how frequently player data is flushed to the database. This method should typically
    be used during player login or logout processes, or when changing game settings
    that affect save frequency. The actual save operation occurs asynchronously in
    the background.
  warnings: Setting the save timer to very small values (e.g., less than 1000ms) can
    severely impact server performance due to excessive database writes. Avoid calling
    this method frequently during gameplay as it may cause unnecessary load on the
    database server.
