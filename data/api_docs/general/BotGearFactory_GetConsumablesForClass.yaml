  class: BotGearFactory
  method: GetConsumablesForClass
  signature: int BotGearFactory::GetConsumablesForClass(uint8 cls, uint32 level)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of consumable items appropriate for a specified class
    and level.
  description: The GetConsumablesForClass method determines how many consumable items
    (such as potions, food, or scrolls) are available for a given player class at
    a specific level. This is typically used by bot AI systems to evaluate inventory
    needs and gear selection strategies. The method likely consults internal databases
    or configuration files that define consumable item sets per class and level thresholds.
    It returns an integer representing the number of consumables, which may be zero
    if no consumables are defined for the specified class and level combination.
  parameters:
  - name: cls
    description: The player class identifier (e.g., CLASS_WARRIOR = 1, CLASS_MAGE
      = 8). Valid values correspond to the standard TrinityCore class constants.
  - name: level
    description: The character level for which consumables are being evaluated. Must
      be a positive integer within valid game level ranges (typically 1-80).
  returns: An integer representing the number of consumable items available for the
    specified class and level. Returns 0 if no consumables are defined or applicable
    for the given parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Get consumables count for a warrior at level 60
    code: 'int count = botGearFactory->GetConsumablesForClass(CLASS_WARRIOR, 60);

      // Returns number of consumables available for a level 60 warrior'
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine consumable needs for mage at max level
    code: "uint8 mageClass = CLASS_MAGE;\nuint32 maxLevel = 80;\nint consumablesCount\
      \ = botGearFactory->GetConsumablesForClass(mageClass, maxLevel);\nif (consumablesCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with logic to acquire or use these consumables\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger gear recommendation system for bot
    characters. The actual implementation may involve database lookups or hardcoded
    tables mapping class/level combinations to consumable item counts. Performance
    should be minimal as it's expected to be called infrequently during bot initialization
    or gear evaluation phases.
  warnings: Ensure that the class parameter corresponds to valid TrinityCore class
    constants; invalid values might lead to unexpected behavior or default returns.
    The method assumes level values are within reasonable game bounds, and extreme
    values could potentially cause issues if not validated.
