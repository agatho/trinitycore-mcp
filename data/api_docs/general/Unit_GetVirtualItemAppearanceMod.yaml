  method: GetVirtualItemAppearanceMod
  signature: uint16 Unit::GetVirtualItemAppearanceMod(uint32 slot) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the appearance modifier for a virtual item at the specified slot.
  description: This method returns the appearance modifier value associated with a
    virtual item at the given slot position. Virtual items are used in World of Warcraft
    to represent items that have no physical appearance but still provide gameplay
    effects, such as weapon enchantments or cosmetic items. The method allows access
    to the specific modifier value for each slot, which can be useful for determining
    item properties or implementing custom gameplay mechanics. This function is typically
    used within the context of item handling and virtual item management in TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint16 value representing the appearance modifier for the virtual
    item at the specified slot. The value may be zero if no modifier exists or if
    the slot is invalid, indicating that no special appearance modification is applied
    to the virtual item.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint16 modifier = unit->GetVirtualItemAppearanceMod(0);\nif (modifier >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Handle non-zero modifier\n    // Do something with the modifier\
      \ value\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Unit class and should be used carefully within
    the context of item management. It may not always return valid data depending
    on how virtual items are configured in the game world, and should be used in conjunction
    with other item-related methods for full functionality.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it may return zero values
    if no modifier exists or if the slot is invalid. Additionally, this method does
    not validate whether the slot corresponds to a valid virtual item; developers
    should ensure that proper checks are performed before calling this method.
