  method: NearWater
  signature: bool ShamanAI::NearWater() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the shaman AI agent is near a body of water.
  description: The NearWater method checks if the shaman AI unit is currently positioned
    close to any water source in the game world. This functionality is typically used
    by shaman AI behavior logic to make decisions related to water-based abilities,
    such as casting healing waves or summoning totems near water. The method evaluates
    the unit's current position against known water boundaries or zones within the
    game environment. It returns true if the unit is within a specified proximity
    threshold of any water body, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the shaman AI agent is near water. Returns
    true if the unit's current location is within a defined proximity to a water source;
    returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (shamanAI->NearWater()) {\n    // Cast Water Walking or other water-related\
      \ spell\n    shamanAI->CastSpell(target, SPELL_WATER_WALKING);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Behavior Based on Proximity to Water
    code: "if (shamanAI->NearWater()) {\n    // Execute water-based abilities\n  \
      \  shamanAI->CastSpell(target, SPELL_HEALING_WAVE);\n} else {\n    // Fallback\
      \ to land-based abilities\n    shamanAI->CastSpell(target, SPELL_LIGHTNING_BOLT);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the game's internal world map data and water zone detection.
    The proximity threshold for what constitutes 'near' water may vary based on the
    specific implementation and game version. Performance is generally low as it involves
    spatial checks against world geometry.
  warnings: The method may return inaccurate results if the AI unit is in an area
    with incomplete or missing water data in the game world. Additionally, this check
    does not account for temporary environmental changes like summoned water effects
    or dynamic terrain modifications.
