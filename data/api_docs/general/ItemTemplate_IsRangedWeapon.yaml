documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the item template represents a ranged weapon.
  description: The IsRangedWeapon method checks if the current item template corresponds
    to a ranged weapon type. This method evaluates the item's class and subclass to
    determine if it falls under the category of ranged weapons, which includes weapons
    such as bows, guns, crossbows, wands, and thrown weapons. It is commonly used
    in game logic to enforce weapon usage restrictions, calculate damage multipliers,
    or determine valid attack types for characters. The method performs a simple lookup
    against predefined item class and subclass constants to make this determination.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item template represents a ranged weapon; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (itemTemplate->IsRangedWeapon()) {\n    // Handle ranged weapon logic\n\
      \    printf(\"This is a ranged weapon\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Attack Logic
    code: "void Player::ValidateAttack() {\n    ItemTemplate* template = GetItemTemplate();\n\
      \    if (template->IsRangedWeapon()) {\n        // Apply ranged-specific attack\
      \ rules\n        ApplyRangedAttackModifiers();\n    } else {\n        // Apply\
      \ melee-specific attack rules\n        ApplyMeleeAttackModifiers();\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the item's class and subclass values being properly
    initialized. It does not account for enchantments or temporary modifications to
    weapon properties. The implementation uses hardcoded constants for item classes
    and subclasses, making it efficient but potentially requiring updates if new ranged
    weapon types are added to the game.
  warnings: This method should not be used as the sole validation for attack eligibility.
    Additional checks such as player inventory, ammo requirements, and character state
    should also be considered when determining if a player can perform a ranged attack.
