  class: RotateMovementGenerator
  method: Reset
  signature: void RotateMovementGenerator::Reset(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the rotation movement generator to its initial state.
  description: The Reset method initializes or reinitializes the RotateMovementGenerator,
    preparing it for new rotation behavior. This typically involves resetting internal
    counters, clearing previous rotation states, and ensuring the generator is ready
    to execute a new rotation sequence. The method is commonly called when a creature
    or unit needs to restart its rotational movement pattern, such as when changing
    targets or repositioning. It ensures that any ongoing rotation is properly terminated
    and the generator returns to a clean state before beginning new operations.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An integer pointer parameter that likely controls reset behavior
      or specifies reset mode. The exact meaning depends on implementation context,
      but typically indicates whether to perform a soft reset (preserving some state)
      or hard reset (clearing all state). Valid values are usually 0 for default reset
      behavior or 1 for forced reset.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'RotateMovementGenerator* rotator = new RotateMovementGenerator();

      rotator->Reset(nullptr); // Reset with default parameters

      // The generator is now ready to start a new rotation sequence'
    language: cpp
  - title: Forced Reset with Parameter
    code: 'int resetMode = 1;

      RotateMovementGenerator* rotator = new RotateMovementGenerator();

      rotator->Reset(&resetMode); // Force a complete reset

      // All internal state is cleared and generator is fully initialized'
    language: cpp
  notes: The Reset method should be called before initiating any new rotation sequence
    to ensure clean state. It's important to note that this method may not be thread-safe,
    so proper synchronization should be used if multiple threads access the same movement
    generator instance.
  warnings: Calling Reset without proper initialization or after destruction of the
    movement generator can lead to undefined behavior. Always verify that the generator
    object is valid before calling Reset.
