  signature: void ScriptObject::ScriptObject(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a ScriptObject with the specified name for use in TrinityCore's
    scripting system.
  description: The ScriptObject constructor initializes a script object with a given
    name, which is essential for registering and identifying scripts within the TrinityCore
    framework. This constructor is typically used when creating custom AI behaviors,
    event handlers, or other scripted components that need to be managed by the core
    server. The name parameter serves as a unique identifier for the script instance
    and is used internally by the scripting system to manage and dispatch events appropriately.
    When a ScriptObject is instantiated using this constructor, it becomes part of
    the global script registry and can be referenced by the server's scripting engine.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated character string that serves as the unique identifier
      for this script object. This name must be unique within the scope of registered
      scripts to avoid conflicts. The name is used internally by TrinityCore's scripting
      system to manage and reference the script instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic ScriptObject Initialization
    code: "class MyCustomAI : public ScriptObject\n{\npublic:\n    MyCustomAI() :\
      \ ScriptObject(\"MyCustomAI\")\n    {\n        // Constructor logic here\n \
      \   }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Custom Script with Unique Name
    code: "class QuestScriptExample : public ScriptObject\n{\npublic:\n    QuestScriptExample()\
      \ : ScriptObject(\"QuestScriptExample_12345\")\n    {\n        // This script\
      \ will be registered under the name \"QuestScriptExample_12345\"\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The ScriptObject constructor should only be called during object initialization
    and not from within gameplay loops or event handlers. The name parameter must
    remain valid for the lifetime of the object, as it's used internally by the scripting
    system. This constructor is part of the base class for all TrinityCore scripts
    and should not be overridden unless necessary.
  warnings: Do not use duplicate names for ScriptObject instances as this may cause
    conflicts in the script registry. The name parameter must not be null or empty,
    though the exact validation behavior depends on the core implementation. Avoid
    calling this constructor from multithreaded contexts without proper synchronization.
