  class: Corpse
  method: SetClass
  signature: void Corpse::SetClass(int playerClass)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the class identifier for a corpse object, typically used to store player
    class information upon death.
  description: The SetClass method assigns a player class value to a Corpse object.
    This is commonly used in World of Warcraft's game mechanics to preserve the player's
    class information when they die and their body becomes a corpse. The class identifier
    is typically one of the standard player class values (e.g., Warrior = 1, Paladin
    = 2, etc.). This method does not validate the input value against valid class
    IDs, so it's up to the caller to ensure that the provided value corresponds to
    a legitimate player class. The change affects how the corpse is displayed and
    handled in the game world, particularly for loot distribution and resurrection
    mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: playerClass
    description: An integer representing the player's class ID. Valid values typically
      correspond to standard WoW class IDs such as 1 (Warrior), 2 (Paladin), 3 (Hunter),
      4 (Rogue), 5 (Priest), 6 (Death Knight), 7 (Shaman), 8 (Mage), 9 (Warlock),
      10 (Monk), 11 (Druid), and 12 (Demon Hunter).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Class for a Corpse
    code: 'Corpse* corpse = new Corpse();

      corpse->SetClass(1); // Sets the corpse to represent a Warrior class'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Class Assignment
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player object exists\nCorpse* corpse =\
      \ player->GetCorpse();\nif (corpse)\n{\n    corpse->SetClass(player->getClass());\
      \ // Assigns the current player's class to their corpse\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal state of the Corpse object. It should
    be called before the corpse is made visible to players or when the corpse is being
    initialized. The method does not perform any validation on the input class value,
    so invalid values may lead to unexpected behavior in game mechanics.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid class ID may cause issues with loot
    distribution, resurrection mechanics, or visual representation of the corpse.
    Ensure that the playerClass parameter is a valid class identifier before calling
    this method.
