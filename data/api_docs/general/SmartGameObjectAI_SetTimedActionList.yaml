  class: SmartGameObjectAI
  method: SetTimedActionList
  signature: void SmartGameObjectAI::SetTimedActionList(SmartScriptHolder & e, uint32
    entry, Unit * invoker)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns a timed action list to the smart game object AI based on the provided
    script holder and entry.
  description: The SetTimedActionList method initializes or updates the timed action
    list for a SmartGameObjectAI instance. It takes a SmartScriptHolder reference
    containing the script data, an entry identifier, and an optional invoker unit.
    This method is typically used in TrinityCore's smart scripting system to configure
    how a game object responds to timed events or triggers. The method does not return
    any value but modifies the internal state of the AI instance to reflect the new
    action list configuration. It is commonly invoked during script initialization
    or when a specific event occurs that requires updating the timed actions associated
    with the game object.
  parameters:
  - name: e
    description: Reference to a SmartScriptHolder structure containing the script
      data and action list for timed events.
  - name: entry
    description: Unique identifier (entry ID) used to determine which specific timed
      action list should be applied to this game object.
  - name: invoker
    description: Optional pointer to a Unit that triggered or invoked this action
      list. Can be NULL if no specific invoker is involved.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Smart Script
    code: 'SmartScriptHolder script;

      // Assume script is populated with timed actions

      uint32 entryId = 12345;

      Unit* invoker = nullptr;

      smartGOAI->SetTimedActionList(script, entryId, invoker);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Invoker Unit
    code: 'SmartScriptHolder script;

      // Assume script is populated with timed actions

      uint32 entryId = 12345;

      Unit* playerInvoker = unit; // Player who triggered the event

      smartGOAI->SetTimedActionList(script, entryId, playerInvoker);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's smart AI system and integrates with
    the broader scripting framework. It should only be called when the SmartGameObjectAI
    instance is properly initialized and ready to accept timed action lists. The method
    modifies internal state without returning a value, so it's important to ensure
    that the provided SmartScriptHolder contains valid data before calling this function.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or uninitialized SmartScriptHolder
    may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the entry ID corresponds to a valid
    script in the database. Passing a NULL invoker is safe but may affect conditional
    logic within the timed actions if they depend on the invoker's presence.
