  brief: Sends a LFG teleport error message to the player's client
  description: This method sends a LFG (Looking for Group) teleport error result to
    the connected player's client. It is used within the TrinityCore framework to
    communicate teleportation failures during group matching or dungeon finding operations.
    The method takes a teleport result code that indicates the specific reason for
    the teleport failure, such as being in an invalid location, already in a group,
    or lacking required permissions. This functionality is part of the game's LFG
    system which helps manage player movement and group formation within World of
    Warcraft content.
  parameters:
  - name: err
    description: The LFG teleport result error code indicating the reason for teleport
      failure. Valid values are defined in the lfg::LfgTeleportResult enum, including
      codes like LFG_TELEPORT_ERROR_NONE, LFG_TELEPORT_ERROR_INVALID_LOCATION, LFG_TELEPORT_ERROR_NOT_IN_GROUP,
      etc.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending a teleport error when player is in invalid location
    code: "WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();\nif (player->IsInCombat())\n\
      {\n    session->SendLfgTeleportError(lfg::LFG_TELEPORT_ERROR_INVALID_LOCATION);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending teleport error based on group state
    code: "WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();\nif (!player->GetGroup())\n\
      {\n    session->SendLfgTeleportError(lfg::LFG_TELEPORT_ERROR_NOT_IN_GROUP);\n\
      }\nelse if (player->GetGroup()->IsFull())\n{\n    session->SendLfgTeleportError(lfg::LFG_TELEPORT_ERROR_GROUP_FULL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG system and should only be called when a teleport
    operation fails during group matching. The error codes are defined in the lfg
    namespace and correspond to specific client-side messages. This method does not
    perform any validation on the input parameter - it directly sends the provided
    error code to the client.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called when appropriate teleportation
    conditions fail, as calling it incorrectly may confuse players with invalid error
    messages. The method assumes proper session state and does not validate if the
    player actually has an active session before sending the message.
