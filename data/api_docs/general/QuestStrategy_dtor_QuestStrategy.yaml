  signature: void QuestStrategy::~QuestStrategy()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a QuestStrategy object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The QuestStrategy destructor is responsible for cleaning up any dynamically
    allocated memory or resources held by the QuestStrategy instance. This method
    is automatically invoked when a QuestStrategy object goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this destructor ensures that
    quest-related data structures and strategy mappings are properly freed to prevent
    memory leaks. The destruction process typically involves releasing references
    to quest templates, clearing internal caches, and ensuring no dangling pointers
    remain in the AI subsystem.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of QuestStrategy
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    QuestStrategy* strategy = new QuestStrategy();\n\
      \    // ... use strategy ...\n    delete strategy; // Destructor called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-based QuestStrategy destruction
    code: "void AnotherFunction()\n{\n    QuestStrategy strategy; // Constructor called\n\
      \    // ... use strategy ...\n    // Destructor automatically called when strategy\
      \ goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a virtual function in the base class, allowing proper cleanup
    of derived classes. It's important to note that QuestStrategy objects should not
    be accessed after their destruction has begun. The destructor may be called during
    server shutdown or when AI modules are reloaded.
  warnings: Never manually call the destructor unless you're implementing custom memory
    management. Calling destructors directly on stack-allocated objects can lead to
    undefined behavior. Also, ensure that no other objects hold references to the
    destroyed QuestStrategy before it's deleted.
