  brief: Adds a combat resurrection charge to the instance script.
  description: The AddCombatResurrectionCharge method increments the combat resurrection
    charge counter within an InstanceScript. This functionality is typically used
    in battlegrounds or instances where players can gain additional resurrection abilities
    during combat. The method does not take any parameters and performs no direct
    actions beyond updating internal state. It's commonly called when a player dies
    in combat or when specific game events occur that grant resurrection charges.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Death Handler
    code: "void Player::HandleDeath()\n{\n    // ... other death handling code ...\n\
      \    if (InstanceScript* instance = GetMap()->GetInstanceScript())\n    {\n\
      \        instance->AddCombatResurrectionCharge();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger combat resurrection system that tracks
    how many times players can be resurrected during active combat. The actual implementation
    may vary depending on the specific instance or battleground type.
