  class: MapEntry
  method: GetFlags
  signature: int MapEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flags associated with a map entry, indicating its properties
    and behavior in the game world.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitmask
    of flags defined for a specific map entry. These flags determine various characteristics
    of the map such as whether it's a battleground, raid instance, dungeon, or has
    special gameplay mechanics. The returned value is typically used by the game engine
    to make decisions about player access, combat rules, and map-specific behaviors.
    This method does not modify any internal state and is safe for repeated calls.
    The flags are usually defined in the game's database or configuration files and
    are loaded at server startup.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing a bitmask of flags associated with the map
    entry. Each bit in the integer corresponds to a specific property or behavior
    flag, such as whether the map is a battleground (bit 0), raid instance (bit 1),
    dungeon (bit 2), etc. The exact meaning of each bit depends on the game's internal
    flag definitions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Map Type
    code: "MapEntry* entry = sMapStore.LookupEntry(1); // Get map entry for map ID\
      \ 1\nint flags = entry->GetFlags();\nif (flags & MAP_FLAG_BATTLEGROUND)\n{\n\
      \    // This is a battleground map\n    printf(\"This map is a battleground\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Map Flags
    code: "MapEntry* entry = sMapStore.LookupEntry(530); // Get map entry for map\
      \ ID 530\nint flags = entry->GetFlags();\nif (flags & MAP_FLAG_RAID)\n{\n  \
      \  printf(\"This map is a raid instance\\n\");\n}\nif (flags & MAP_FLAG_DUNGEON)\n\
      {\n    printf(\"This map is a dungeon\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flags returned by this method are typically pre-defined constants that
    represent specific map behaviors. Developers should be aware that the exact bit
    positions and meanings of these flags may vary between different versions of TrinityCore
    or custom modifications. The method is thread-safe as it only reads from immutable
    data structures.
  warnings: Be cautious when using bitwise operations on the returned flag value,
    as incorrect bit masking can lead to unexpected behavior. Ensure that your code
    properly handles all possible flag combinations and doesn't assume specific bit
    positions without checking the game's official documentation or source code.
