documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player's personal phases tracker contains any active phases.
  description: The IsEmpty method determines if the PlayerPersonalPhasesTracker object
    currently holds no active phase entries. This utility function is commonly used
    in World of Warcraft TrinityCore to evaluate whether a player has any personal
    phases assigned, which may affect quest visibility, world events, or other phase-based
    gameplay mechanics. The method performs a simple check on the internal data structure
    that stores player-specific phase information and returns true if no phases are
    present, false otherwise. This functionality is essential for conditional logic
    in scripts and game systems that rely on phase tracking for dynamic content delivery.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the tracker contains no active phases; returns false if
    there are one or more phases currently registered.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (player->GetPersonalPhasesTracker()->IsEmpty())\n{\n    // Player has\
      \ no personal phases\n    player->SendNotification(\"No active phases.\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Logic
    code: "void CheckPhaseBasedQuests(Player* player)\n{\n    if (!player->GetPersonalPhasesTracker()->IsEmpty())\n\
      \    {\n        // Proceed with phase-based quest checks\n        for (auto&\
      \ phase : player->GetPersonalPhasesTracker()->GetPhases())\n        {\n    \
      \        // Process each active phase\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n \
      \       // Handle case when no phases are active\n        player->CompleteQuest(QUEST_NO_PHASES);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in performance-critical sections of the game
    engine where quick checks for phase state are needed. It's recommended to cache
    the result if the same check will be performed multiple times within a single
    execution context to avoid redundant operations.
