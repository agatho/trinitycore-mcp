  signature: void DynamicObject::BuildValuesCreate(int * data, int flags, const int
    * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and populates object data for a dynamic object during creation.
  description: The BuildValuesCreate method is responsible for setting up the initial
    field values of a DynamicObject when it is being created and sent to clients.
    This method prepares the object's data structure by filling in relevant fields
    such as position, orientation, spell effects, and other properties that define
    how the dynamic object appears and behaves in the game world. It ensures that
    client-side representations are properly initialized with all necessary information
    for rendering and interaction. The method typically gets called during the object's
    construction phase or when it is first added to the world.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array where the object's field values will
      be written. This buffer must be large enough to hold all required field data
      for the dynamic object type.
  - name: flags
    description: Integer flags that determine which fields should be included in the
      data array and how they should be processed. These flags control the serialization
      behavior and may indicate special handling requirements.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer array containing target information for the
      dynamic object, such as the GUID of the caster or affected unit. This parameter
      is used to populate relevant fields in the data structure.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'DynamicObject* dynObj = new DynamicObject();

      int data[100];

      int flags = 0;

      int target[4] = {0};


      // Initialize the dynamic object''s creation values

      dynObj->BuildValuesCreate(data, flags, target);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore framework
    during object lifecycle management. Developers should not generally call this
    directly unless implementing custom object creation logic or extending dynamic
    object functionality. The size of the 'data' array must be sufficient to accommodate
    all fields required for the specific dynamic object type being created.
  warnings: Incorrectly sizing the 'data' buffer can lead to memory corruption or
    undefined behavior. The 'target' parameter should always contain valid GUID data
    if used, otherwise it may result in invalid references or incorrect visual effects.
