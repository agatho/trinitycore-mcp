documentation:
  brief: Loads static flags override data for creatures from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadCreatureStaticFlagsOverride method initializes and populates
    internal data structures with creature static flags overrides stored in the database.
    This functionality allows server administrators to modify specific static flags
    for individual creatures without requiring code changes. The method typically
    executes during server startup or reload operations to ensure that any custom
    flag configurations are properly applied to creature templates. It reads from
    the creature_template_addon table or similar storage mechanisms and caches the
    data for fast lookup during runtime.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadCustomData()\n{\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadCreatureStaticFlagsOverride();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or database reload
    processes. The loaded data is cached in memory for performance reasons, so changes
    to the underlying database require a server restart or explicit reload to take
    effect.
  warnings: Modifying creature static flags overrides can significantly affect creature
    behavior and AI logic. Incorrect flag values may cause creatures to behave unexpectedly
    or fail to spawn properly. Always test changes in a development environment before
    applying to production servers.
