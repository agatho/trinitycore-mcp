  method: GetSlot
  signature: uint16 AuraApplication::GetSlot() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the aura slot index where this aura application is stored.
  description: The GetSlot method retrieves the specific slot index within an aura
    container where this AuraApplication instance is currently stored. In World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, auras are managed in slots, typically corresponding
    to the player's or creature's aura system. Each aura can occupy one slot, and
    these slots are numbered sequentially from 0 upwards. This method allows developers
    to determine exactly which slot holds a particular aura application, which is
    useful for managing aura states, performing lookups, or debugging aura-related
    issues. The returned value represents the zero-based index of the slot in the
    aura container.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint16 value representing the zero-based index of the slot where this
    aura application is stored within its owner's aura container. Returns 0 if the
    aura is not currently applied or if the slot has not been assigned yet.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Aura Slot for Debugging
    code: "AuraApplication* app = player->GetAuraApplication(12345);\nif (app)\n{\n\
      \    uint16 slot = app->GetSlot();\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"aura\", \"Aura 12345\
      \ is in slot %u\", slot);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterate Through Aura Slots
    code: "for (uint16 i = 0; i < MAX_AURAS; ++i)\n{\n    if (AuraApplication* app\
      \ = player->GetAuraApplication(i))\n    {\n        uint16 slot = app->GetSlot();\n\
      \        TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"aura\", \"Found aura in slot %u with ID %u\", slot,\
      \ app->GetId());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the core aura management system.
    The slot index returned is only valid while the aura application is active and
    stored in an aura container. If the aura is removed or expired, the slot may become
    invalid or reused.
  warnings: Do not rely on the slot value for persistent identification of auras across
    removals or reapplications. The slot can change if the aura is refreshed or re-applied
    to a different slot.
