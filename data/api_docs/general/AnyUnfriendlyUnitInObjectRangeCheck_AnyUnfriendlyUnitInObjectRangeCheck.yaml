  class: AnyUnfriendlyUnitInObjectRangeCheck
  method: AnyUnfriendlyUnitInObjectRangeCheck
  signature: void AnyUnfriendlyUnitInObjectRangeCheck::AnyUnfriendlyUnitInObjectRangeCheck(const
    int * obj, const int * funit, float range)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a check for any unfriendly unit within a specified range of an
    object or unit.
  description: The AnyUnfriendlyUnitInObjectRangeCheck constructor initializes a range-based
    check to determine whether there are any hostile or non-friendly units within
    a given distance from a specified object or unit. This utility is commonly used
    in AI behavior scripting and combat logic to detect nearby enemies, trigger attacks,
    or initiate avoidance behaviors. The method sets up internal parameters for range
    checking but does not perform the actual check; it merely configures the conditions
    for later evaluation. This class likely serves as part of a larger system that
    evaluates unit relationships and spatial proximity in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: obj
    description: Pointer to an object or unit identifier used as the reference point
      for range checking. Typically represents a GameObject, Creature, or Player instance.
  - name: funit
    description: Pointer to a unit (Creature or Player) that is considered the focal
      unit for determining unfriendliness. Used in conjunction with obj to establish
      the context of the check.
  - name: range
    description: Floating-point value specifying the maximum distance within which
      to search for unfriendly units. Defines the radius of the area around obj to
      scan.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize range check for nearby enemies
    code: AnyUnfriendlyUnitInObjectRangeCheck check(&player, &enemy, 10.0f);
    language: cpp
  notes: This class appears to be a predicate or functor used in conjunction with
    other range-checking utilities within TrinityCore's AI framework. It likely requires
    additional methods to actually evaluate the condition once initialized.
