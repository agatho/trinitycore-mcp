  signature: void Spell::EffectAddFarsight()
documentation:
  brief: Adds a far-sight effect to the spell, allowing the caster to see through
    another unit's perspective.
  description: The EffectAddFarsight method enables a spell to establish a far-sight
    connection with a target unit, allowing the caster to view the world from that
    unit's perspective. This effect is commonly used in spells that grant vision or
    sight abilities, particularly those involving mind control or magical observation.
    The method typically activates when the spell effect is applied and can be used
    to create visual connections between units, such as in mind control or vision-based
    spells. It may also be used for creating a temporary visual connection between
    the caster and target during gameplay.

    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely requires the spell to have a valid target and may depend
    on specific spell mechanics or effects. It should be used carefully when implementing
    gameplay mechanics involving vision or control.
