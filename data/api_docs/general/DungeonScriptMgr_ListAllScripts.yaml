documentation:
  brief: Logs a comprehensive list of all dungeon scripts registered within the DungeonScriptMgr
    instance.
  description: The ListAllScripts method enumerates and outputs all dungeon scripts
    currently managed by the DungeonScriptMgr. This utility function is primarily
    intended for debugging and development purposes, allowing developers to inspect
    which scripts are available for dungeon-related events and triggers. The method
    does not modify any game state or data; it simply iterates through the internal
    registry of dungeon scripts and prints their identifiers or names to the system
    log. It is typically invoked during server startup, script loading phases, or
    when troubleshooting dungeon behavior issues.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Debug Context
    code: DungeonScriptMgr::instance()->ListAllScripts();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed for diagnostic use only and should not be called
    frequently in production environments due to potential performance overhead from
    logging large amounts of data. It assumes that the DungeonScriptMgr instance has
    been properly initialized before invocation.
