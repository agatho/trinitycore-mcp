  class: MageAI
  method: ConsumeResource
  signature: void MageAI::ConsumeResource(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes mana or other resources required for casting a specified spell by
    the Mage AI.
  description: The ConsumeResource method is responsible for deducting the necessary
    resources, such as mana, from the Mage AI's current resource pool when a spell
    is cast. This method ensures that the AI respects the resource constraints of
    the game mechanics and prevents casting spells without sufficient resources. It
    typically interacts with the AI's internal resource tracking system to reduce
    available resources based on the spell's cost. The method does not validate whether
    the spell ID is valid, so it should be called only with known valid spell IDs.
    This is a core part of the Mage AI's decision-making process for spell selection
    and execution.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell being cast. This ID determines
      the resource cost and type required for the spell.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Mage AI
    code: "void MageAI::CastSpell(uint32 spellId)\n{\n    // Check if we have enough\
      \ resources\n    if (HasEnoughResources(spellId))\n    {\n        ConsumeResource(spellId);\n\
      \        // Proceed with actual spell casting logic\n        DoCast(spellId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AI has already validated that sufficient resources
    exist for the given spell. It is typically called after resource validation but
    before the spell is actually cast. The implementation may vary depending on whether
    the spell requires mana, rage, energy, or other resource types.
  warnings: Calling this method without prior resource validation can lead to negative
    resource values, which might cause unexpected behavior in the AI's decision-making
    process. Ensure that the spellId corresponds to a valid spell with defined resource
    costs.
