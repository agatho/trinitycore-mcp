  class: PathfindingManager
  method: FindPath
  signature: PathResult PathfindingManager::FindPath(const int & goal, PathFlags flags)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a path from the current agent's position to the specified
    goal node using pathfinding algorithms.
  description: The FindPath method computes a navigational path from the entity's
    current location to a designated goal node within the game world. It utilizes
    internal pathfinding mechanisms such as A* or similar graph traversal algorithms
    to determine the most efficient route while considering obstacles, terrain, and
    other environmental factors. The method takes into account the provided PathFlags
    which may influence how the path is calculated, including whether to avoid certain
    types of terrain or entities. This function is typically used by AI systems, movement
    controllers, or any component requiring path navigation in the game world. The
    result is encapsulated in a PathResult object that contains the computed waypoints
    and metadata about the path validity.
  parameters:
  - name: goal
    description: The identifier of the destination node or position to navigate towards.
      This value represents a valid point in the navigation mesh or world space.
  - name: flags
    description: A bitmask of PathFlags that control how the pathfinding algorithm
      behaves during computation. These flags may specify avoidance rules, movement
      type preferences, or other constraints affecting path generation.
  returns: A PathResult object containing the computed path waypoints and metadata.
    If no valid path exists, the result will typically indicate failure with an empty
    or invalid path.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pathfinding Usage
    code: "PathResult result = pathfindingManager->FindPath(12345, PathFlags::PATHFLAG_NORMAL);\n\
      if (result.IsValid()) {\n    // Process the computed waypoints\n    for (auto&\
      \ waypoint : result.GetWaypoints()) {\n        // Move towards each waypoint\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Pathfinding with Custom Flags
    code: "PathFlags flags = PathFlags::PATHFLAG_NORMAL | PathFlags::PATHFLAG_NO_JUMP;\n\
      PathResult result = pathfindingManager->FindPath(67890, flags);\nif (result.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Handle the path that avoids jumping\n}\nelse {\n    // Handle case\
      \ where no valid path was found\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core navigation system and relies on precomputed
    navigation meshes. The performance can vary depending on the complexity of the
    environment and the distance between start and goal positions. For high-frequency
    path requests, consider caching or using asynchronous pathfinding to prevent blocking
    the main thread.
  warnings: The method assumes that the goal node identifier is valid and exists within
    the current navigation mesh. Invalid or unreachable goals may return an empty
    or invalid PathResult without throwing exceptions. Always check the validity of
    the returned PathResult before attempting to use its waypoints.
