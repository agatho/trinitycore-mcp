  method: CanUseDragonriding
  signature: bool MountManager::CanUseDragonriding(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can use dragonriding mechanics in World of Warcraft.
  description: The CanUseDragonriding method evaluates if a given player is eligible
    to utilize dragonriding abilities within the game. This typically involves checking
    various conditions such as player level requirements, quest progress, faction
    status, and whether the player has acquired the necessary mount or ability. The
    method returns true if all prerequisites are met and dragonriding can be used;
    otherwise, it returns false. In TrinityCore's implementation, this check is often
    tied to the Dragonriding ability being unlocked through achievements or specific
    in-game events.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter specifies which player's eligibility for dragonriding
      is being evaluated.
  returns: Returns true if the specified player meets all requirements and can use
    dragonriding mechanics, false otherwise. The method does not return null or error
    codes as it is a boolean evaluation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nif (mountManager->CanUseDragonriding(&playerId))\
      \ {\n    // Player can use dragonriding\n    printf(\"Player can use dragonriding\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Player cannot use dragonriding\n    printf(\"Player\
      \ cannot use dragonriding\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Object
    code: "Player* player = session->GetPlayer();\nint playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      if (mountManager->CanUseDragonriding(&playerId)) {\n    // Enable dragonriding\
      \ UI elements or allow flight\n    player->SetCanDragonride(true);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Disable dragonriding features\n    player->SetCanDragonride(false);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal checks against the player's current
    game state, including achievement flags, level requirements, and possibly faction-specific
    restrictions. Developers should be aware that this check may involve database
    queries or cached data lookups depending on how TrinityCore implements the dragonriding
    system.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID passed is valid and corresponds to an active
    player session; passing invalid or uninitialized pointers could lead to undefined
    behavior. Also, note that even if this method returns true, additional runtime
    checks may still be required for actual use of dragonriding mechanics.
