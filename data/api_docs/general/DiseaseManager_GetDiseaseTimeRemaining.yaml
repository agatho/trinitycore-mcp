  class: DiseaseManager
  method: GetDiseaseTimeRemaining
  signature: int DiseaseManager::GetDiseaseTimeRemaining(Unit * target, DiseaseType
    type)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the remaining time in milliseconds for a specified disease effect
    on a target unit.
  description: 'The GetDiseaseTimeRemaining method is used to determine how much time
    remains before a disease effect expires on a given unit. This functionality is
    typically employed in game mechanics involving disease effects, such as those
    from abilities like Corruption or Shadow Word: Pain. The method takes a pointer
    to the target unit and the specific type of disease to query. It returns the time
    remaining in milliseconds, which can be used for various purposes including UI
    display, effect tracking, or conditional logic within gameplay systems.'
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Unit object on which the disease effect is applied.
      This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid game entity such
      as a player or creature.
  - name: type
    description: An enum value of type DiseaseType that specifies which disease effect's
      remaining time should be retrieved. The exact values depend on the implementation
      but typically include types like DISEASE_TYPE_CORRUPTION, DISEASE_TYPE_POISON,
      etc.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the time in milliseconds remaining for
    the specified disease effect on the target unit. If no such disease is active,
    it may return zero or a negative value depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Check Remaining Time for Corruption Effect
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetVictim();\nint timeRemaining = diseaseManager->GetDiseaseTimeRemaining(target,\
      \ DISEASE_TYPE_CORRUPTION);\nif (timeRemaining > 0)\n{\n    // Display remaining\
      \ time to player\n    player->SendNotification(\"Corruption has %d ms remaining.\"\
      , timeRemaining);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use Remaining Time for Conditional Logic
    code: "Unit* target = GetTarget();\nint poisonTime = diseaseManager->GetDiseaseTimeRemaining(target,\
      \ DISEASE_TYPE_POISON);\nif (poisonTime < 5000) // Less than 5 seconds\n{\n\
      \    // Apply a buff or trigger an event\n    target->AddAura(SPELL_ID_ENHANCED_POISON_RESISTANCE,\
      \ target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal disease tracking data structures maintained
    by the DiseaseManager. It's important to ensure that the target unit is valid
    and has the specified disease effect applied before calling this method to avoid
    undefined behavior or incorrect results.
  warnings: Calling this method on a null target pointer will result in a crash or
    undefined behavior. Additionally, if the disease type is not recognized by the
    system, the return value may be unreliable or invalid.
