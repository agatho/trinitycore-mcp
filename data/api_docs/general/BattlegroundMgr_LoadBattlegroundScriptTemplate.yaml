  signature: void BattlegroundMgr::LoadBattlegroundScriptTemplate()
documentation:
  brief: Loads battleground script templates from the database into memory for use
    during battleground initialization.
  description: The LoadBattlegroundScriptTemplate method initializes and loads all
    battleground script templates stored in the database into the game's memory. This
    method is typically called during server startup or when battleground data needs
    to be refreshed. It retrieves template configurations such as spawn points, objectives,
    and event triggers for various battleground types. The loaded templates are used
    by the battleground system to properly configure instances when players enter
    battlegrounds. This method ensures that battlegrounds can be instantiated with
    correct scripted behaviors and configurations based on predefined templates stored
    in the database.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeBattlegrounds()\n{\n    sBattlegroundMgr->LoadBattlegroundScriptTemplate();\n\
      \    // Battleground templates are now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    database changes require template reloading. The method performs database queries
    to fetch all battleground templates, which may cause a slight performance impact
    during startup. It's important that this method is thread-safe as it's typically
    called from the main thread during server boot-up.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate template entries or memory leaks. Ensure that no battlegrounds are active
    when reloading templates to avoid inconsistencies in ongoing matches.
