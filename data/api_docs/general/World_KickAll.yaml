documentation:
  brief: Kicks all connected players from the server
  description: The KickAll method immediately disconnects all currently connected
    players from the World of Warcraft server. This function is typically used for
    server maintenance, emergency shutdowns, or administrative actions where immediate
    player removal is required. The method iterates through all active sessions and
    forces their disconnection without sending any warning messages to the players.
    It does not perform any cleanup operations on the players' characters or data,
    as the disconnect is immediate and abrupt.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for server maintenance
    code: 'World::instance()->KickAll();

      // All players will be disconnected immediately'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from administrative commands or during server
    shutdown procedures. It bypasses normal logout sequences and should only be used
    when immediate disconnection is required. The operation is synchronous and will
    block until all player sessions are processed.
  warnings: Using KickAll can result in data loss if players have unsaved progress
    or are in the middle of important actions like combat, quests, or transactions.
    It should be used sparingly and only in emergency situations or planned maintenance
    windows.
