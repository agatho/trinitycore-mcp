  class: PathfindingAdapter
  method: ArePositionsClose
  signature: bool PathfindingAdapter::ArePositionsClose(const int & pos1, const int
    & pos2, float threshold) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether two positions are within a specified threshold distance
    of each other.
  description: The ArePositionsClose method evaluates whether two given positions,
    represented as integer coordinates, are closer than a defined threshold distance.
    This utility function is commonly used in pathfinding and AI logic to determine
    proximity between entities or waypoints. The method performs a simple Euclidean
    distance check using the provided integer coordinates and compares the result
    against the specified floating-point threshold. It's particularly useful for checking
    if a unit has reached a target location or if two points are close enough to be
    considered equivalent within game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: pos1
    description: The first position represented as an integer identifier, typically
      used in pathfinding systems to reference specific waypoints or locations.
  - name: pos2
    description: The second position represented as an integer identifier, typically
      used in pathfinding systems to reference specific waypoints or locations.
  - name: threshold
    description: A floating-point value representing the maximum allowed distance
      between positions for them to be considered 'close'. Must be non-negative.
  returns: Returns true if the two positions are within the specified threshold distance
    of each other; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic proximity check
    code: "if (pathfinder.ArePositionsClose(100, 101, 5.0f)) {\n    // Positions 100\
      \ and 101 are within 5 units of each other\n    printf(\"Positions are close\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in pathfinding decision logic
    code: "bool isNearTarget = pathfinder.ArePositionsClose(currentWaypoint, targetPosition,\
      \ 2.0f);\nif (isNearTarget) {\n    // Proceed to next waypoint or task\n   \
      \ moveToNextNode();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that positions are represented as integer identifiers
    that map to actual coordinates in the game world. The threshold value should be
    carefully chosen based on the scale of movement and precision requirements of
    your specific use case. Performance is generally optimal for simple distance comparisons,
    but multiple calls may impact performance in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Be cautious when using very small threshold values as floating-point precision
    errors might affect results. Ensure that position identifiers are valid and correspond
    to actual locations in the pathfinding system to avoid unexpected behavior.
