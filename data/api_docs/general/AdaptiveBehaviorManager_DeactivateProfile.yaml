  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: DeactivateProfile
  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::DeactivateProfile(const std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Deactivates a specified adaptive behavior profile by name.
  description: The DeactivateProfile method removes or disables an active adaptive
    behavior profile within the AdaptiveBehaviorManager. This action typically prevents
    the profile from being applied to NPCs or players, effectively stopping its influence
    on AI decision-making. The method expects a valid profile name string and will
    likely throw an exception or produce undefined behavior if the profile does not
    exist. It is commonly used during runtime configuration changes or when cleaning
    up unused behavior profiles.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The unique identifier (name) of the adaptive behavior profile to
      deactivate. Must correspond to an existing profile registered with the AdaptiveBehaviorManager.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: AdaptiveBehaviorManager::GetSingleton().DeactivateProfile("AggressiveCombatProfile");
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Deactivation
    code: "if (AdaptiveBehaviorManager::GetSingleton().IsProfileActive(\"DefensiveFormation\"\
      )) {\n    AdaptiveBehaviorManager::GetSingleton().DeactivateProfile(\"DefensiveFormation\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may not be thread-safe and should ideally be called from the
    main game thread or within a synchronized context. Ensure that any references
    to the deactivated profile are removed before calling this method to avoid dangling
    pointers.
  warnings: Calling DeactivateProfile with an invalid or non-existent profile name
    might lead to undefined behavior, especially if internal lookup mechanisms do
    not perform proper validation.
