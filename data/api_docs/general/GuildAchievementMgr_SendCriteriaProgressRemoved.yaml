  signature: void GuildAchievementMgr::SendCriteriaProgressRemoved(uint32 criteriaId)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a packet to all guild members notifying them that a criteria progress
    has been removed from an achievement.
  description: The SendCriteriaProgressRemoved method is responsible for broadcasting
    a message to all online members of a guild when a specific achievement criteria
    progress is removed. This typically occurs when a player's progress toward an
    achievement is reset or invalidated, such as when they complete the achievement
    and it is no longer tracked, or when certain conditions are met that cause the
    removal of partial progress. The method ensures that all guild members are synchronized
    with the current state of achievements within the guild. It operates at the network
    level by sending a specific packet through the TrinityCore server infrastructure
    to update client-side UI elements related to guild achievements.
  parameters:
  - name: criteriaId
    description: The unique identifier of the achievement criteria whose progress
      has been removed. This ID corresponds to a specific requirement within an achievement,
      such as killing a certain number of mobs or completing a quest.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing Criteria Progress for a Guild Achievement
    code: "void RemovePlayerAchievementProgress(Player* player, uint32 criteriaId)\n\
      {\n    // Assume some logic determines that progress should be removed\n   \
      \ if (player->GetGuild())\n    {\n        GuildAchievementMgr* mgr = player->GetGuild()->GetGuildAchievementMgr();\n\
      \        mgr->SendCriteriaProgressRemoved(criteriaId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely sends a packet using the WorldPacket system to update
    client-side UI elements. It should only be called when the criteria progress is
    actually removed from the guild's tracking system, not just visually hidden. The
    method may internally handle sending updates to all online guild members.
  warnings: Ensure that the criteriaId parameter is valid and corresponds to an actual
    achievement criteria before calling this method. Calling it with an invalid ID
    might cause undefined behavior or client-side errors. This method should not be
    used for regular progress updates; it's specifically for removal notifications.
