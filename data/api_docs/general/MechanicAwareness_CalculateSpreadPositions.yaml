  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: CalculateSpreadPositions
  signature: int MechanicAwareness::CalculateSpreadPositions(const int & group, float
    minDistance)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates spread positions for a given group with a minimum distance constraint.
  description: The CalculateSpreadPositions method determines optimal spread positions
    for a specified group within the game world, ensuring that each position maintains
    at least the minimum required distance from others. This functionality is typically
    used in AI behavior systems where mobs or NPCs need to maintain spatial awareness
    and avoid clustering. The method operates on internal group data structures and
    modifies position assignments based on game mechanics such as collision detection
    and pathfinding constraints. It returns a count of successfully calculated positions,
    which can be zero if no valid placements are found or if the group is invalid.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The identifier of the group for which spread positions are to be
      calculated. This typically corresponds to a group's unique ID within the game
      world.
  - name: minDistance
    description: The minimum distance that must be maintained between any two calculated
      positions. Must be a positive value; negative or zero values may result in undefined
      behavior.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of valid spread positions successfully
    calculated for the specified group. A return value of zero indicates either no
    valid positions were found, the group was invalid, or all positions failed to
    meet the minimum distance constraint.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: int count = mechanicAwareness.CalculateSpreadPositions(12345, 5.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling Example
    code: "int result = mechanicAwareness.CalculateSpreadPositions(0, 2.0f);\nif (result\
      \ == 0) {\n    // Handle case where no positions could be calculated\n    LOG_ERROR(\"\
      world\", \"Failed to calculate spread positions for group 0\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal game state and assumes that the provided group
    ID exists and has valid members. Performance may degrade with large groups or
    when many positions are required, as it involves complex spatial calculations.
    The method is not thread-safe and should only be called from within a controlled
    game context.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid group ID may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that minDistance is always positive to avoid unexpected results.
    This method does not validate whether positions are actually walkable or within
    bounds; additional checks might be necessary for full implementation safety.
