  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: HandleQuestGiverNotFound
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::HandleQuestGiverNotFound(Player * bot, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the case when a quest giver is not found for a specified quest ID.
  description: The HandleQuestGiverNotFound method is responsible for managing scenarios
    in which a player attempts to turn in a quest but the corresponding quest giver
    (NPC or object) cannot be located in the game world. This typically occurs when
    the quest giver has been destroyed, removed, or is otherwise inaccessible. The
    method ensures proper cleanup and messaging to the player, preventing errors and
    maintaining game state consistency. It may also log relevant information for debugging
    purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot attempting to turn
      in the quest.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest that the player is trying to turn
      in.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest handling logic
    code: "void SomeQuestHandler(Player* bot, uint32 questId)\n{\n    if (!sObjectMgr->GetQuestGiver(questId))\n\
      \    {\n        QuestTurnIn::HandleQuestGiverNotFound(bot, questId);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during quest completion logic when a quest
    giver cannot be resolved. It's important to ensure that the player is notified
    appropriately and any related quest state is properly reset or logged.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the quest giver is indeed missing
    may lead to incorrect behavior or unnecessary logging. Ensure that appropriate
    checks are performed before invoking this function.
