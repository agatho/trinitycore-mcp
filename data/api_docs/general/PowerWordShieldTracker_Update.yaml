  class: PowerWordShieldTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void PowerWordShieldTracker::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: 'Updates the Power Word: Shield tracker for the specified player, managing
    shield application and removal logic.'
  description: 'The Update method in PowerWordShieldTracker is responsible for maintaining
    the state of Power Word: Shield effects on a given player. It evaluates whether
    shields should be applied, refreshed, or removed based on combat conditions and
    spell mechanics. This method typically runs during AI updates or periodic checks
    to ensure proper shield management according to class-specific rules and game
    balance requirements. The method operates on a single Player object and modifies
    the internal tracking state of the shield effects.'
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: 'Pointer to the Player object for which the Power Word: Shield tracker
      should be updated. Must not be null and must represent a valid player in the
      game world.'
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\n    if\
      \ (m_powerWordShieldTracker)\n        m_powerWordShieldTracker->Update(m_bot);\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Shield Tracker Update
    code: "Player* target = ObjectAccessor::FindConnectedPlayer(\"TargetPlayer\");\n\
      if (target && target->IsInWorld())\n{\n    PowerWordShieldTracker* tracker =\
      \ new PowerWordShieldTracker();\n    tracker->Update(target);\n    delete tracker;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from AI update loops or periodic game tick
    handlers. It assumes that the player object passed is valid and in a consistent
    state. The implementation may perform spell effect checks, target validation,
    and shield stacking calculations internally.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the bot parameter will likely cause undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure the Player object remains valid throughout the method
    execution as it may be accessed multiple times during the update cycle.
