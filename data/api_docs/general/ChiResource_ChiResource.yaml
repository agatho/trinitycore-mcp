documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new ChiResource object with default values.
  description: The ChiResource constructor initializes a new instance of the ChiResource
    class, setting up internal state variables to their default values. This method
    is typically called when creating a new ChiResource object, either as part of
    object instantiation or during resource management operations within the TrinityCore
    framework. The initialization process ensures that all member variables are properly
    configured before the object is used in gameplay mechanics related to chi resource
    handling.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic ChiResource Initialization
    code: 'ChiResource chiResource;

      // This creates a new ChiResource object with default initialization'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is automatically invoked when a ChiResource object is created.
    It's important to note that this method does not perform any validation or resource
    allocation beyond basic initialization. The actual chi resource values and properties
    are typically managed through other methods in the class.
