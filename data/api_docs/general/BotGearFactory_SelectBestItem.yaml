  signature: uint32 BotGearFactory::SelectBestItem(uint8 cls, uint32 specId, uint32
    level, uint8 slot, uint32 targetQuality)
documentation:
  brief: Selects the best item for a bot based on class, specialization, level, slot,
    and target quality.
  description: The SelectBestItem method determines the highest-quality item available
    for a bot character that fits the specified criteria. It evaluates items based
    on the provided class, specialization ID, character level, equipment slot, and
    desired quality threshold. This method is typically used in bot AI systems to
    ensure bots are equipped with optimal gear according to their role and progression.
    The method considers various factors such as item level, stats, and enchantments
    to determine the best possible match for the given parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: cls
    description: The class identifier of the bot character (e.g., 1 for Warrior, 2
      for Paladin, etc.). Valid values are class constants defined in TrinityCore's
      player class system.
  - name: specId
    description: The specialization ID of the bot character. This determines the specific
      role and stat priorities for item selection (e.g., 250 for Arms Warrior, 251
      for Fury Warrior).
  - name: level
    description: The current level of the bot character. Used to filter items that
      are appropriate for the character's progression stage.
  - name: slot
    description: The equipment slot for which an item is being selected (e.g., 1 for
      Head, 2 for Shoulders, etc.). Values correspond to inventory slot constants.
  - name: targetQuality
    description: The minimum quality level of items to consider (e.g., 0 for Poor,
      1 for Common, 2 for Uncommon, 3 for Rare, 4 for Epic, 5 for Legendary).
  returns: Returns the entry ID of the best matching item from the game database.
    If no suitable item is found, it returns 0, indicating failure to find an appropriate
    item.
  examples:
  - title: Selecting Best Weapon for a Warrior Bot
    code: uint32 weaponId = botGearFactory.SelectBestItem(1, 256, 80, 16, 4); // Warrior,
      Protection spec, level 80, main hand slot, epic quality
    language: cpp
  - title: Finding Best Armor for a Mage Bot
    code: uint32 armorId = botGearFactory.SelectBestItem(8, 62, 70, 5, 3); // Mage,
      Arcane spec, level 70, chest slot, rare quality
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the TrinityCore item database and assumes that all
    relevant items are properly configured in the game data. The selection process
    may be influenced by bot AI settings or configuration files that define item preference
    weights. Performance is generally good for typical usage but can be affected if
    large numbers of items need to be evaluated.
  warnings: Ensure that the class and specialization IDs provided match valid TrinityCore
    constants, otherwise the method may return unexpected results or fail to find
    appropriate items. The target quality parameter should be within the expected
    range (0-5) for proper item filtering.
