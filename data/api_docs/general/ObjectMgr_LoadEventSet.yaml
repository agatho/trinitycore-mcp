documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes all event sets from the database into memory for use
    during world updates.
  description: The LoadEventSet method is responsible for retrieving all defined event
    sets from the database tables and loading them into memory. This method is typically
    called during server startup or when reloading game data. It processes event set
    configurations including their conditions, triggers, and associated game objects
    or creatures. The loaded event sets are then used by the game world to manage
    dynamic events such as seasonal celebrations, holiday activities, or scripted
    sequences that occur based on specific in-game conditions or timeframes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::Initialize()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadEventSet();\n\
      \    // Continue with other initialization...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server startup or when a full
    data reload is required. It performs database queries and loads potentially large
    amounts of event configuration data into memory, which may cause temporary performance
    impact. The method assumes that the database connection is already established
    and functional.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    duplicate event set entries in memory. This method should not be called during
    active gameplay sessions as it may disrupt ongoing event processing. Ensure all
    database tables containing event set data are properly populated before calling
    this method.
