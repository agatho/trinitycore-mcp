  signature: void AuctionHouse::CacheFrequentAuctions()
documentation:
  brief: Caches frequently accessed auctions in memory for improved performance.
  description: The CacheFrequentAuctions method preloads a set of commonly requested
    auction items into an internal cache structure to reduce database query overhead
    and improve response times for auction house operations. This method is typically
    invoked during server initialization or periodic maintenance intervals to ensure
    that the most popular auction items are readily available in memory. The caching
    mechanism helps optimize performance by minimizing repeated database lookups for
    frequently accessed auction data, particularly beneficial during high-traffic
    periods when many players are browsing or searching the auction house.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AuctionHouse* ah = sAuctionHouseMgr;

      ah->CacheFrequentAuctions();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after the auction house data has been initialized
    but before normal operation begins. The caching process may temporarily block
    other operations while building the cache, so it's recommended to run this during
    low-traffic periods or server startup.
