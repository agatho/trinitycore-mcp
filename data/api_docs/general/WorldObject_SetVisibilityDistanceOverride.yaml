  signature: void WorldObject::SetVisibilityDistanceOverride(VisibilityDistanceType
    type)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the visibility distance override type for this WorldObject.
  description: This method configures the visibility distance behavior for a WorldObject
    by setting its visibility distance override type. The visibility distance determines
    how far other players or objects can see this object in the game world. This is
    commonly used to control visibility for specific types of objects such as players,
    creatures, or game objects. The method does not directly set a numeric distance
    value but instead assigns a predefined visibility distance type that influences
    how the system calculates and applies visibility distances.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Visibility Distance Override to Normal
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->SetVisibilityDistanceOverride(VISIBILITY_DISTANCE_NORMAL);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Set Visibility Distance Override for Game Object
    code: 'GameObject* go = ...;

      go->SetVisibilityDistanceOverride(VISIBILITY_DISTANCE_GAMEOBJECT);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the object's visibility range calculation and is typically
    used during object initialization or when changing visibility behavior dynamically.
    The actual visibility distance values are determined by the game's configuration
    and system settings, not directly by this method.
  warnings: Changing visibility distance override types may affect performance if
    used excessively on many objects. Ensure that visibility types are set appropriately
    for the object type to maintain optimal gameplay experience.
