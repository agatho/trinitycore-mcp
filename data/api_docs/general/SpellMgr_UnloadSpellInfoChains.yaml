  class: SpellMgr
  method: UnloadSpellInfoChains
  signature: void SpellMgr::UnloadSpellInfoChains()
documentation:
  brief: Clears all spell information chains from memory, releasing associated resources.
  description: The UnloadSpellInfoChains method removes all loaded spell data chains
    from the SpellMgr's internal storage. This operation is typically invoked during
    server shutdown or when reloading spell definitions to free up memory and prevent
    memory leaks. The method ensures that any dynamically allocated spell information
    structures are properly deallocated, clearing references to spell effects, triggers,
    and other related data. It does not affect currently active spells or ongoing
    spell casts, but prevents new spell instances from being created using the previously
    loaded definitions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Shutdown
    code: "void World::UpdateWorldState()\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n    sSpellMgr->UnloadSpellInfoChains();\n\
      \    // ... cleanup logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when no spell-related operations are in
    progress. It is typically used as part of a larger cleanup sequence during server
    shutdown or reload procedures. The method does not perform any locking internally,
    so it must be called from a thread-safe context.
  warnings: Calling this method while spells are actively being cast or processed
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always ensure that all spell operations
    have completed before invoking this function.
