  class: InterruptCoordinatorFixed
  method: SetMinInterruptDelay
  signature: void InterruptCoordinatorFixed::SetMinInterruptDelay(uint32 delayMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the minimum delay in milliseconds between interruptible actions.
  description: The SetMinInterruptDelay method configures the minimum time interval,
    specified in milliseconds, that must pass before another interruptible action
    can be initiated. This mechanism is typically used to prevent rapid successive
    interrupts or to enforce cooldowns on interrupt-based abilities within the game's
    AI or combat system. The delay applies globally to all interrupt operations managed
    by this coordinator instance. This method does not validate the input value but
    assumes it represents a valid time duration in milliseconds.
  parameters:
  - name: delayMs
    description: The minimum delay in milliseconds between interruptible actions.
      Must be a non-negative integer representing time duration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Minimum Interrupt Delay to 500ms
    code: 'InterruptCoordinatorFixed coordinator;

      coordinator.SetMinInterruptDelay(500);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Dynamic Delay Configuration
    code: 'uint32 dynamicDelay = GetCombatSettings().GetInterruptCooldown();

      interruptCoordinator.SetMinInterruptDelay(dynamicDelay);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies an internal state variable and should be called
    before any interrupt operations begin. It is recommended to set this value early
    during initialization or when changing combat behavior configurations.
