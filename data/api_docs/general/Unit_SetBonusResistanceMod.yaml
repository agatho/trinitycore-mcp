  class: Unit
  method: SetBonusResistanceMod
  signature: void Unit::SetBonusResistanceMod(int school, int32 val)
documentation:
  brief: Sets bonus resistance modifier for a specified school of magic.
  description: This method modifies the bonus resistance value for a specific magical
    school, allowing developers to adjust how much resistance a unit has against certain
    types of spells. The method affects the unit's resistance to magic elements such
    as fire, frost, nature, and others, with the value being applied as a modifier
    to the base resistance. This is commonly used in spell effects or aura modifications
    where resistance is altered by a fixed amount.
  parameters:
  - name: school
    description: The magical school for which the resistance modifier is being set.
      Valid values are typically 0-4 representing different schools (fire, frost,
      nature, shadow, arcane).
  - name: val
    description: The amount by which to modify the resistance value. Positive values
      increase resistance, while negative values decrease it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetUnit();


      // Set bonus resistance for fire school to +10

      target->SetBonusResistanceMod(0, 10);


      // Set bonus resistance for frost school to -5

      target->SetBonusResistanceMod(1, -5);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other resistance-related
    methods and may be part of larger spell effect implementations. It should be called
    carefully as it affects how units respond to magical attacks.
  warnings: This method does not directly affect the unit's base resistance; it modifies
    bonus resistance only. Improper use can lead to incorrect resistance calculations
    or unexpected behavior in combat.
