api:
  class: GroupReference
  method: setSubGroup
  signature: void GroupReference::setSubGroup(int pSubGroup)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the subgroup index for a group member referenced by this GroupReference
    object.
  description: The setSubGroup method assigns a specific subgroup number to the player
    represented by this GroupReference. In World of Warcraft's grouping system, players
    can be organized into subgroups within a larger raid or party. This method updates
    the internal state of the group reference to reflect the new subgroup assignment.
    The subgroup index typically ranges from 0 to 8 for raid groups and 0 to 4 for
    party groups, though valid values may depend on the current group type and configuration.
    This operation is commonly used when reorganizing group members during raids or
    parties, such as assigning players to specific roles like tanks, healers, or damage
    dealers.
  parameters:
  - name: pSubGroup
    description: The subgroup index to assign to the player. Valid values are typically
      0-8 for raid groups and 0-4 for party groups. A value of -1 may indicate removal
      from any subgroup.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Assigning a Player to Subgroup 3
    code: 'GroupReference* ref = player->GetGroupRef();

      ref->setSubGroup(3);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Player from Subgroup
    code: 'GroupReference* ref = player->GetGroupRef();

      ref->setSubGroup(-1);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal group reference state and should
    only be called when the group is in a valid state. The actual subgroup change
    may not be immediately visible to other players until the group update is processed
    by the server.
  warnings: Calling this method on a GroupReference that does not belong to an active
    group can lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the player is actually part
    of a group before calling this method.
