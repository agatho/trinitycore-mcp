  class: PhaseShift
  method: Clear
  signature: void PhaseShift::Clear()
documentation:
  brief: Clears all phase information from the PhaseShift object, resetting it to
    an empty state.
  description: The Clear method removes all active phase definitions and resets the
    internal phase data structure of the PhaseShift object. This operation effectively
    disables any custom phase restrictions that may have been applied to a player
    or game object. The method is typically used when transitioning between different
    zones or scenarios where previous phase constraints should no longer apply. After
    calling Clear, the PhaseShift object will contain no active phases and will not
    filter any events based on phase membership.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to reset phase shifts
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      PhaseShift& phaseShift = player->GetPhaseShift();

      phaseShift.Clear(); // Resets all phase information for the player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully during zone transitions or when removing
    custom phase restrictions. It does not notify other systems about the change in
    phase state, so additional logic may be required to update client-side visibility
    or event handling.
