  method: DeterminePriority
  signature: BotPriority BotPriorityManager::DeterminePriority(Player * bot) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the priority level for a given bot player based on
    configured rules and conditions.
  description: The DeterminePriority method evaluates a specified bot player and assigns
    a priority level according to internal logic within the BotPriorityManager. This
    priority level influences how the bot is managed, scheduled, or prioritized in
    various systems such as resource allocation, task assignment, or AI behavior decisions.
    The method considers factors like bot role, activity status, player level, and
    other relevant attributes to compute its result. It is typically invoked during
    bot initialization, state changes, or periodic priority recalculations. The method
    does not modify the bot's state directly but returns a value that may be used
    by other systems to make decisions about the bot's behavior or treatment.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose priority
      is to be determined. Must not be null; otherwise, behavior is undefined.
  returns: Returns a BotPriority enum value indicating the computed priority level
    for the specified bot. Possible values may include LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, or others
    depending on implementation details and configuration settings.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine bot priority
    code: "BotPriority priority = botManager->DeterminePriority(playerBot);\nif (priority\
      \ == BotPriority::HIGH) {\n    // Handle high-priority bot logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using priority in a conditional assignment
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player\nBotPriorityManager*\
      \ manager = BotPriorityManager::Instance();\nBotPriority priority = manager->DeterminePriority(myBot);\n\
      switch (priority) {\n    case BotPriority::LOW:\n        // Assign low-priority\
      \ tasks\n        break;\n    case BotPriority::HIGH:\n        // Assign high-priority\
      \ tasks\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not have side effects
    on the input player object. It relies on internal configuration data that may
    be updated dynamically, so repeated calls might return different results over
    time. The exact logic used for determining priority depends on the implementation
    of BotPriorityManager and its associated rules.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null; passing a null pointer will likely cause undefined behavior or crashes.
    Also, be aware that the returned BotPriority value may change over time if underlying
    conditions affecting priority are modified.
