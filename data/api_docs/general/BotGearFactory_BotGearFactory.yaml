documentation:
  brief: Copies the state of another BotGearFactory instance
  description: The BotGearFactory copy constructor initializes a new BotGearFactory
    object by copying all member variables and state from an existing BotGearFactory
    instance. This constructor is typically used when creating a duplicate of an existing
    gear factory configuration, ensuring that the new instance maintains identical
    settings and parameters. In the context of TrinityCore's AI bot system, this allows
    for the replication of gear generation configurations for different bot instances
    or scenarios without manually reconfiguring each parameter.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotGearFactory instance to copy from
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Copy Construction
    code: 'BotGearFactory factory1;

      // Configure factory1...

      BotGearFactory factory2(factory1); // Creates a copy of factory1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Bot Creation Context
    code: 'BotGearFactory baseFactory;

      // Setup base configuration

      baseFactory.SetGearLevel(80);

      baseFactory.SetItemQuality(ItemQuality::UNCOMMON);


      // Create new factory with same settings for another bot

      BotGearFactory newBotFactory(baseFactory);

      // Both factories now have identical configurations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs a shallow copy of all member variables. If the
    BotGearFactory contains pointers or dynamic allocations, care must be taken to
    ensure proper deep copying behavior is implemented elsewhere in the class. The
    copy constructor should be used carefully when dealing with shared resources or
    complex data structures.
  warnings: When using this constructor, ensure that any dynamically allocated memory
    or resource handles are properly managed to avoid double-free errors or resource
    leaks. If the class manages external resources, consider implementing a proper
    copy assignment operator alongside this constructor.
