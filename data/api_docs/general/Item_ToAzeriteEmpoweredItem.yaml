  signature: const int * Item::ToAzeriteEmpoweredItem() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to an array of Azerite empowered item IDs associated with
    this item.
  description: The ToAzeriteEmpoweredItem method retrieves a constant integer pointer
    that points to an array containing the identifiers of Azerite empowered items
    linked to the current Item object. This functionality is primarily used in World
    of Warcraft's Azerite system, where items can be empowered with Azerite traits
    and effects. The returned array typically contains multiple IDs representing different
    Azerite powers or traits that are active on the item. It's important to note that
    this method may return a null pointer if the item is not an Azerite empowered
    item or if no Azerite data is available for the item.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const int* pointing to an array of integers representing Azerite empowered
    item IDs. Returns nullptr if the item does not have associated Azerite empowered
    data or if the item is not an Azerite empowered item.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if item has Azerite empowered data
    code: "const int* azeriteIds = item->ToAzeriteEmpoweredItem();\nif (azeriteIds\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Item has Azerite empowered data\n    for (int i = 0;\
      \ i < 5; ++i) // Assuming max 5 Azerite powers\n    {\n        if (azeriteIds[i]\
      \ == 0) break;\n        printf(\"Azerite Power ID: %d\\n\", azeriteIds[i]);\n\
      \    }\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No Azerite empowered data available\n    printf(\"\
      Item is not Azerite empowered.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned pointer points to internal data structures and should not be
    modified or freed by the caller. The array size is implementation-defined but
    typically contains up to 5 elements for standard Azerite empowered items. This
    method is part of TrinityCore's Azerite system integration and requires that the
    item has been properly initialized with Azerite data.
  warnings: Do not assume the array length; always check for null returns and verify
    data validity before accessing elements. Accessing beyond the valid range of the
    returned array can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
