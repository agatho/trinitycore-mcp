  method: GetTradeData
  signature: TradeData * Player::GetTradeData() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the trade data object associated with the player's current trading
    session.
  description: This method retrieves the TradeData object that represents the current
    trade session between the player and another party. The returned object contains
    information about the items being traded, the gold amount, and other trade-related
    details. It is typically used during trade operations to access or modify trade
    data before completing or canceling a trade transaction. The method is essential
    for handling trade mechanics in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the TradeData object representing the current trade
    session. If no trade is currently active, this may return nullptr or an empty
    TradeData object. This pointer should not be deleted or freed by the caller as
    it is managed internally by the player object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trade Data Access
    code: "TradeData* tradeData = player->GetTradeData();\nif (tradeData != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Process trade data\n    uint64_t gold = tradeData->GetGold();\n  \
      \  // ... other trade operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned TradeData object is managed by the player's internal trade system
    and should not be directly deleted. This method is typically called during trade
    operations, such as when a player accepts or cancels a trade. The trade data object
    may be null if no trade session exists.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in multi-threaded environments; ensure
    that the trade session hasn't been completed or canceled before accessing the
    TradeData object. Also, avoid modifying the returned TradeData object directly
    as it may cause inconsistencies in trade mechanics.
