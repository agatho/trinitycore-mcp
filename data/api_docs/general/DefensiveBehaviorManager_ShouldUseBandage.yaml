  class: DefensiveBehaviorManager
  method: ShouldUseBandage
  signature: bool DefensiveBehaviorManager::ShouldUseBandage() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player should use a bandage based on current health
    and behavior settings.
  description: The ShouldUseBandage method evaluates the player's current health status
    and defensive behavior configuration to decide if using a bandage is appropriate.
    This method typically checks if the player's health is below a certain threshold
    and if bandaging is enabled in the defensive behavior settings. It is commonly
    used by AI systems to make decisions about self-healing during combat or non-combat
    situations. The decision-making process may also consider factors such as available
    bandages, cooldowns, and the player's current threat level.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player should use a bandage based on health status
    and defensive behavior settings; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (defensiveBehaviorManager.ShouldUseBandage()) {\n    // Player should\
      \ use a bandage\n    player.UseItem(BANDAGE_ITEM_ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Health Check Logic
    code: "bool shouldBandage = defensiveBehaviorManager.ShouldUseBandage();\nif (shouldBandage\
      \ && player.GetHealth() < player.GetMaxHealth() * 0.3f) {\n    // Player is\
      \ critically low on health and should bandage\n    player.CastSpell(BANDAGE_SPELL_ID);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal defensive behavior settings that may be configured
    through the game's configuration files or in-game UI. The decision logic might
    vary depending on the player's class, specialization, and current combat state.
    Performance is generally minimal as it only performs simple health comparisons.
  warnings: Ensure that the DefensiveBehaviorManager instance is properly initialized
    before calling this method, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. This method
    does not account for consumable item availability beyond basic checks, so additional
    validation may be needed in complex scenarios.
