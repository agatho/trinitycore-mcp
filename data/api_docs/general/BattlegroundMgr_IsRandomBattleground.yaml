  signature: bool BattlegroundMgr::IsRandomBattleground(uint32 battlemasterListId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a battleground is a random battleground based on its battlemaster
    list identifier.
  description: The IsRandomBattleground method checks if a specific battleground,
    identified by its battlemaster list ID, is classified as a random battleground.
    In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, random battlegrounds are those
    that are automatically assigned to players without requiring them to queue for
    a specific battleground type. This method is typically used during battleground
    initialization or player assignment logic to determine appropriate gameplay behavior
    and reward distribution. The method relies on internal battleground configuration
    data to make this determination.
  parameters:
  - name: battlemasterListId
    description: The unique identifier for the battlemaster list entry that corresponds
      to a specific battleground type. This ID is used to look up the battleground's
      properties in the game's internal configuration tables.
  returns: Returns true if the specified battleground is a random battleground, false
    otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the battleground can be automatically
    assigned to players through the random battleground system.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a Battleground is Random
    code: "if (sBattlegroundMgr->IsRandomBattleground(32)) {\n    // This is a random\
      \ battleground\n    sLog->outString(\"Battleground ID 32 is a random battleground.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // This is not a random battleground\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Battleground ID 32 is not a random battleground.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other BattlegroundMgr functions
    to manage player assignments and battleground lifecycle. The battlemasterListId
    parameter should correspond to valid battleground entries defined in the game's
    database or configuration files.
