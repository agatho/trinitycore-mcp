  brief: Retrieves the current resource state of the AI instance
  description: The GetResourceState method provides access to the internal resource
    state managed by the ThreadSafeClassAI class. This method returns a constant reference
    to the ResourceState object, allowing callers to inspect the current state without
    modifying it. The returned resource state typically contains information about
    available resources, usage statistics, or allocation status that the AI component
    relies on for decision making and behavior execution. Since this is a thread-safe
    implementation, multiple threads can safely call this method concurrently without
    requiring additional synchronization.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the ResourceState object representing the current
    state of resources managed by this AI instance. The resource state may include
    information such as available mana, health levels, cooldowns, or other contextual
    data needed for AI decision making.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "ThreadSafeClassAI* ai = ...;\nconst ResourceState& state = ai->GetResourceState();\n\
      if (state.HasMana()) {\n    // Proceed with mana-dependent actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Resource Availability
    code: "ThreadSafeClassAI* ai = ...;\nconst ResourceState& state = ai->GetResourceState();\n\
      if (state.GetMana() > 50) {\n    // Execute spell or ability requiring moderate\
      \ mana\n} else if (state.GetHealth() < 30) {\n    // Consider healing or fleeing\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is implemented as thread-safe and does not require external locking
    mechanisms. The returned reference remains valid only for the duration of the
    method call and should not be stored for later use. The ResourceState object is
    typically updated by internal AI logic or game events, so repeated calls may return
    different values.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned ResourceState reference as it's const. Modifying
    it would lead to undefined behavior. Be aware that the resource state might change
    between consecutive calls if other threads are updating the AI's internal state.
