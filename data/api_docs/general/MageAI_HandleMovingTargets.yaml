  class: MageAI
  method: HandleMovingTargets
  signature: void MageAI::HandleMovingTargets(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the MageAI's target handling logic based on the provided unit target.
  description: The HandleMovingTargets method in the MageAI class is responsible for
    processing and updating the AI's behavior when a moving target is detected. This
    method likely adjusts spell casting priorities, movement patterns, or targeting
    strategies specific to mage abilities that are effective against moving enemies.
    It may also handle pathfinding adjustments or threat calculation updates related
    to the target's movement state. The method operates on the current target unit
    passed as a parameter and modifies internal AI state accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the moving target that the
      mage AI should process. This parameter must be a valid pointer to a Unit instance,
      typically representing an enemy player or creature that is currently moving.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in Mage AI context
    code: "void SomeMageAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO,\
      \ 0, 0.0f, true))\n    {\n        HandleMovingTargets(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the Mage's spell selection system and may
    influence which abilities are prioritized based on target movement patterns. It
    is expected to be called during AI update cycles when a valid moving target is
    present.
