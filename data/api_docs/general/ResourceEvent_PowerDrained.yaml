api:
  class: ResourceEvent
  method: PowerDrained
  signature: ResourceEvent ResourceEvent::PowerDrained(int player, Powers type, int32
    amt)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a ResourceEvent object representing a power drain action
    on a player.
  description: The PowerDrained method constructs and returns a ResourceEvent instance
    that signifies a player's resource (such as mana, rage, or energy) has been drained.
    This method is typically used within the TrinityCore framework to track and manage
    resource changes during gameplay events like spell effects, abilities, or environmental
    interactions. The returned event encapsulates details about which player was affected,
    what type of power was drained, and the amount of power removed. It allows for
    proper event handling and logging throughout the game's resource management system.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose resource is being
      drained. This should be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  - name: type
    description: The type of power being drained, specified as a Powers enum value.
      Valid values include POWER_MANA, POWER_RAGE, POWER_ENERGY, etc., depending on
      the game's resource system.
  - name: amt
    description: The amount of power drained from the player. This can be positive
      or negative, with negative values indicating power restoration rather than draining.
  returns: A ResourceEvent object representing the power drain event. This object
    contains all necessary information about the action and can be used for further
    processing, logging, or event propagation within the TrinityCore framework.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Power Drain Event Creation
    code: ResourceEvent event = ResourceEvent::PowerDrained(12345, POWER_MANA, -100);
      // Restores 100 mana to player with GUID 12345
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Power Drain Event for Rage
    code: ResourceEvent event = ResourceEvent::PowerDrained(playerGuid, POWER_RAGE,
      -50); // Drains 50 rage from player
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's resource management system and should
    be used consistently with other event creation methods to maintain proper event
    flow. The ResourceEvent object returned can be passed to event handlers or stored
    for later processing. Ensure that the player GUID and power type values are valid
    within the context of the current game world.
  warnings: Be cautious when using negative amounts as they may indicate power restoration
    rather than draining, which could affect gameplay balance if not handled properly.
    Also ensure that the player GUID corresponds to an actual player in the game world
    to prevent invalid event creation.
