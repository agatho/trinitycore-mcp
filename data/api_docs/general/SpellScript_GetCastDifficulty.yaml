  class: SpellScript
  method: GetCastDifficulty
  signature: Difficulty SpellScript::GetCastDifficulty() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the difficulty level associated with the current spell cast.
  description: The GetCastDifficulty method returns the Difficulty enum value that
    represents the current spell's casting difficulty. This is typically used within
    SpellScript implementations to determine or modify behavior based on the difficulty
    setting of the spell being cast. The returned value corresponds to the game's
    difficulty levels such as Normal, Heroic, etc., and can be used to adjust spell
    effects, damage, or other mechanics depending on the difficulty context. This
    method is commonly invoked during spell execution to ensure proper handling of
    difficulty-specific logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A Difficulty enum value indicating the current spell's difficulty level.
    Possible values include DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_NORMAL, DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_HEROIC,
    and others depending on the game mode and content type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in SpellScript
    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleEffect()\
      \ override\n    {\n        Difficulty diff = GetCastDifficulty();\n        if\
      \ (diff == DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_HEROIC)\n        {\n            // Apply heroic-specific\
      \ effects\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during the execution of a spell script,
    typically within effect handlers or other spell lifecycle methods. The returned
    difficulty value is determined by the spell's context and may differ from the
    player's current difficulty setting if the spell itself is designed for a specific
    difficulty mode.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a valid spell script context may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect return values. Ensure that the spell script
    is properly initialized before invoking this method.
