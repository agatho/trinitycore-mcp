  brief: Summon a personal game object for the caster
  description: This method summons a personal game object, typically a summoned object
    or trap, for the caster. It is used in spell effects to create objects that are
    bound to the caster's ownership and can be interacted with by the player. The
    summoned object will remain in the world until it is destroyed or the caster leaves
    the game world.

  notes: Implementation details include handling of object ownership and positioning.
    This method typically creates a GameObject that is bound to the caster's GUID
    and can be interacted with by the player.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly, as it is intended to be used
    internally by spell processing code. Care must be taken to ensure proper object
    cleanup when the caster leaves the world.
