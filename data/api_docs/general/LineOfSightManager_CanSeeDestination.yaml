  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: CanSeeDestination
  signature: bool LineOfSightManager::CanSeeDestination(const int & destination)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current object has a clear line of sight to the specified
    destination.
  description: The CanSeeDestination method evaluates whether there is an unobstructed
    path between the calling object and a given destination point. This functionality
    is essential for game mechanics such as spell casting, NPC behavior, and AI decision-making
    where visibility plays a critical role. The method typically uses raycasting or
    similar techniques to check for obstacles in the path. It's commonly used in scenarios
    like determining if a mob can see a player, or if a spell can be cast without
    being blocked by terrain or objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if there is a clear line of sight from the current object
    to the destination; otherwise returns false if an obstruction blocks the view.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in NPC AI
    code: "if (unit->GetLineOfSightManager()->CanSeeDestination(playerGUID)) {\n \
      \   // NPC can see player and may engage\n    unit->Attack(player, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Spell casting validation
    code: "if (caster->GetLineOfSightManager()->CanSeeDestination(targetPosition))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with spell cast\n    caster->CastSpell(target, spellId,\
      \ true);\n} else {\n    // Inform player that target is not visible\n    caster->SendSpellFailed(client,\
      \ spellId, SPELL_FAILED_NO_LINE_OF_SIGHT);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform expensive calculations depending on the complexity
    of the environment. It's recommended to cache results when checking visibility
    frequently or in performance-critical sections. The implementation likely uses
    spatial partitioning and collision detection systems already present in TrinityCore.
  warnings: The method assumes that the destination parameter represents a valid location
    within the game world. Invalid coordinates or non-existent entities may cause
    undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate inputs before calling this method
    in critical code paths.
