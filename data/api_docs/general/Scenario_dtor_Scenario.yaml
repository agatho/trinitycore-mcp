documentation:
  brief: Destroys a Scenario object and cleans up its associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the Scenario class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated to a scenario instance. This includes cleaning
    up internal data structures, removing references to related objects, and ensuring
    no memory leaks occur when a scenario is no longer needed. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, scenarios are used to manage dynamic content such
    as world events, quest chains, or special encounters that may have complex state
    tracking requirements. The destructor ensures proper cleanup of these resources
    to maintain system stability and prevent resource exhaustion.

  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Scenario Destruction
    code: 'Scenario* scenario = new Scenario();

      // ... use scenario ...

      delete scenario; // Triggers ~Scenario() destructor'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic Cleanup with Smart Pointer
    code: '#include <memory>

      std::unique_ptr<Scenario> scenario = std::make_unique<Scenario>();

      // ... use scenario ...

      // Destructor automatically called when unique_ptr goes out of scope'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when a Scenario object goes out of
    scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to note that this method should
    not be called directly unless you're managing the object lifecycle manually. The
    implementation may include cleanup of internal references, timers, and event listeners
    associated with the scenario.
  warnings: Never call the destructor directly on stack-allocated objects as it will
    lead to undefined behavior. Also, be cautious about calling delete on a pointer
    that has already been deleted or is null, which could cause memory corruption
    or crashes.
