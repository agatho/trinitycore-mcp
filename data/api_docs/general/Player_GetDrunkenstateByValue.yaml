documentation:
  brief: Returns the drunken state value based on the player's current intoxication
    level.
  description: This method retrieves and returns the DrunkenState value corresponding
    to the player's current intoxication level. It is used internally by TrinityCore
    to determine the player's drunken state, which affects various game mechanics
    including movement speed, combat abilities, and visual effects. The method takes
    into account the player's current alcohol level and maps it to appropriate drunken
    state values for gameplay purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Represents the current drunken state of the player, with possible values
    including DrunkenState::DRUNKEN_STATE_SOber (0), DrunkenState::DRUNKEN_STATE_Tipsy
    (1), DrunkenState::DRUNKEN_STATE_Drunken (2), and DrunkenState::DRUNKEN_STATE_Blackout
    (3). The value indicates the level of intoxication affecting player behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      DrunkenState state = player->GetDrunkenstateByValue(0);

      // Returns DrunkenState::DRUNKEN_STATE_SOber'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used internally by TrinityCore's game mechanics system
    and may not be directly called by external code. It relies on player's current
    alcohol level to determine the appropriate drunken state value.
  warnings: This method should only be used when player's intoxication level is known
    or when it's safe to assume the player has a valid alcohol level. Improper use
    can lead to incorrect gameplay behavior.
