  class: Strategy
  method: AddAction
  signature: void Strategy::AddAction(const std::string & name, std::shared_ptr<Action>
    action)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a new action to the strategy with the specified name and action handler.
  description: The AddAction method registers a new action within the Strategy class,
    associating it with a unique name and a shared pointer to an Action object. This
    allows the strategy to execute defined actions during AI decision-making processes.
    The method is typically used during initialization or configuration of AI behaviors
    in TrinityCore's game entities. Actions added via this method are stored internally
    and can be invoked by the strategy when appropriate conditions are met. The action
    name must be unique within the scope of the strategy to avoid conflicts.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A unique string identifier for the action being added. This name
      is used to reference the action during strategy execution and must be distinct
      within the strategy's context.
  - name: action
    description: A shared pointer to an Action object that defines the behavior to
      be executed when this action is triggered by the strategy. The action object
      should implement the necessary logic for the AI behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'std::shared_ptr<Action> moveAction = std::make_shared<MoveAction>();

      strategy->AddAction("move_to_target", moveAction);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Actions
    code: 'strategy->AddAction("attack_target", std::make_shared<AttackAction>());

      strategy->AddAction("cast_spell", std::make_shared<CastSpellAction>(spellId));

      strategy->AddAction("follow_leader", std::make_shared<FollowAction>());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not validate whether the action name is already in use;
    adding duplicate names may lead to unexpected behavior. The Action object passed
    must remain valid for the lifetime of the strategy, as it's stored as a shared
    pointer.
