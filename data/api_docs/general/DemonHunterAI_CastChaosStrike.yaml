  class: DemonHunterAI
  method: CastChaosStrike
  signature: void DemonHunterAI::CastChaosStrike(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the Chaos Strike ability cast on the specified target.
  description: The CastChaosStrike method executes the Demon Hunter's Chaos Strike
    ability, which is a damaging melee attack that deals damage based on the hunter's
    current energy and weapon damage. This method handles the casting logic including
    checking for valid targets, ensuring the Demon Hunter has sufficient resources,
    and applying the appropriate spell effects. The ability typically deals high damage
    and may have additional effects such as generating Fury or triggering other abilities
    depending on the Demon Hunter's specialization and talents.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit's identifier (GUID).
      This parameter specifies which unit the Chaos Strike ability should be cast
      upon.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chaos Strike Usage
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::ExecuteChaosStrike()\n{\n    Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO);\n\
      \    if (target)\n    {\n        CastChaosStrike(&target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Demon Hunter AI has already validated that Chaos
    Strike is available for casting. The target parameter should be a valid unit GUID,
    and the method does not perform additional validation checks on the target's state
    or eligibility.
  warnings: The method requires that the Demon Hunter has sufficient energy to cast
    Chaos Strike. If called without proper resource management, it may result in an
    invalid spell cast or error. Ensure that target validation is performed before
    calling this method to prevent undefined behavior.
