  brief: Clears the changes mask of the active player data, resetting all tracked
    modifications.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask within
    the ActivePlayerData class. This operation is typically used to indicate that
    all previously tracked field modifications have been processed or acknowledged.
    In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this method helps
    manage synchronization between the server state and client updates by clearing
    the bitmask that tracks which fields have been modified since the last update.
    The method does not take any parameters and performs no return operations, making
    it a simple state reset function.
