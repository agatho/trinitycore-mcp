  method: GetPlayerGuildMetrics
  signature: GuildMetrics GuildIntegration::GetPlayerGuildMetrics(uint32 playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves guild-related metrics for a specified player
  description: The GetPlayerGuildMetrics method fetches comprehensive guild statistics
    and performance data associated with a given player. This includes information
    such as guild rank, contribution points, activity levels, and other relevant metrics
    that define the player's involvement within their guild context. The method operates
    on the player's unique identifier (GUID) to locate and return their specific guild-related
    data. It is typically used for displaying player guild status in UI elements or
    calculating guild-based rewards and achievements.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose guild metrics are
      to be retrieved. Must correspond to a valid online or offline player character
      in the game database.
  returns: A GuildMetrics object containing detailed statistics and performance indicators
    for the specified player's guild membership, including rank, contribution points,
    activity levels, and other relevant data points.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 playerId = 12345;\nGuildMetrics metrics = guildIntegration.GetPlayerGuildMetrics(playerId);\n\
      TC_LOG_INFO(\"guild\", \"Player %u has guild rank %u with %u contribution points.\"\
      ,\n    playerId, metrics.rank, metrics.contributionPoints);"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "uint32 playerId = 12345;\nGuildMetrics metrics = guildIntegration.GetPlayerGuildMetrics(playerId);\n\
      if (metrics.rank > 0) {\n    // Process valid guild metrics\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      guild\", \"Guild rank: %u, Contribution: %u\", metrics.rank, metrics.contributionPoints);\n\
      } else {\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"guild\", \"Failed to retrieve guild metrics for\
      \ player %u\", playerId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve database lookups and should be used judiciously in
    performance-critical sections of code. The returned GuildMetrics object is typically
    populated from cached or stored data rather than real-time calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided playerGuid corresponds to an existing player
    in the database, as invalid GUIDs might lead to undefined behavior or failed lookups.
    This method does not validate whether the player is currently in a guild; it only
    retrieves stored metrics.
