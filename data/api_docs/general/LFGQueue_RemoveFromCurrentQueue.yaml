  class: LFGQueue
  method: RemoveFromCurrentQueue
  signature: void LFGQueue::RemoveFromCurrentQueue(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from the current LFG queue based on their GUID.
  description: The RemoveFromCurrentQueue method removes a specific player, identified
    by their globally unique identifier (GUID), from the current Looking for Group
    (LFG) queue. This function is typically used when a player cancels their LFG request,
    leaves a group, or when the system needs to clean up inactive queue entries. The
    method operates on the internal queue structure of the LFG system and ensures
    that the specified player is no longer considered for group matching. It does
    not return any value, as its purpose is purely to modify the state of the queue.
    This operation may trigger updates to other systems that depend on LFG queue status,
    such as group finder interfaces or matchmaking algorithms.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The globally unique identifier (GUID) of the player to be removed
      from the current LFG queue. This value uniquely identifies a specific player
      within the TrinityCore instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove Player from LFG Queue
    code: 'LFGQueue* lfgQueue = sLFGMgr->GetQueue(PLAYER_GUID);

      lfgQueue->RemoveFromCurrentQueue(PLAYER_GUID);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GUID corresponds to an existing player in the
    LFG queue. If called with an invalid or non-existent GUID, it may result in undefined
    behavior or silently fail depending on internal validation logic. The function
    is likely thread-safe within the context of TrinityCore's architecture but should
    be used carefully in multi-threaded scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID is valid and corresponds to a player currently
    in the LFG queue before calling this method. Calling this function with an invalid
    GUID may lead to inconsistencies in the LFG system or potential crashes if not
    properly validated.
