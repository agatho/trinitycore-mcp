  brief: Clears the changes mask of the bank tab settings, resetting any modified
    flags.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with the BankTabSettings object. This operation is typically used after applying
    or acknowledging changes made to the bank tab configuration, ensuring that subsequent
    checks for modifications will not detect previously applied updates. The method
    does not take any parameters and performs no return operations. It is commonly
    invoked in the context of updating player bank tab permissions or configurations
    within the TrinityCore framework.

      settings.ClearChangesMask();'

  notes: This method is often used internally by the TrinityCore server when synchronizing
    bank tab configurations with the client. It ensures that only newly modified settings
    are sent over the network, reducing unnecessary data transfer.
