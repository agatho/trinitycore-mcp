documentation:
  brief: Moves ownership of an arena team's data to another arena team object.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment operation on an ArenaTeam
    object, transferring all resources and data from the source arena team to the
    target arena team. This is a move semantics implementation that efficiently transfers
    ownership without deep copying. The method is typically used when assigning one
    arena team instance to another, particularly in scenarios involving temporary
    objects or when optimizing resource management. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework, this operation ensures proper cleanup of the source object while transferring
    its state to the destination. This method adheres to C++ move semantics best practices
    and should be used carefully to avoid dangling references.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The rvalue reference to another ArenaTeam object whose resources
      will be moved to this object.
  returns: A reference to the current ArenaTeam object after the move assignment has
    been completed, allowing for chaining of assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'ArenaTeam team1;

      ArenaTeam team2 = std::move(team1); // Uses operator=

      // team1 is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // team2 contains the data previously in team1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Assignment in Container
    code: 'std::vector<ArenaTeam> teams;

      ArenaTeam newTeam;

      teams.push_back(std::move(newTeam)); // Move assignment during vector push

      // newTeam is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method implements move semantics which is essential for efficient resource
    management. After the move, the source object should not be used unless reinitialized.
    The implementation likely handles internal pointers and dynamic memory transfers
    to avoid double-free errors. This is a standard C++11 feature that improves performance
    by avoiding unnecessary copying.
  warnings: Do not use the source object after performing a move assignment as its
    state becomes undefined but valid. Ensure that any pointers or references to the
    moved-from object are invalidated or reinitialized. Improper usage can lead to
    undefined behavior or memory corruption.
