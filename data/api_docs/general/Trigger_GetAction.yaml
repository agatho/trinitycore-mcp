documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the action identifier associated with the trigger.
  description: The GetAction method returns the integer identifier representing the
    action type or index assigned to a trigger object. In the context of TrinityCore's
    AI and scripting system, triggers are often used to define events or conditions
    that activate specific behaviors. This method allows developers to query what
    action is linked to a particular trigger instance, which can be crucial for implementing
    conditional logic, event handling, or debugging trigger-based systems. The returned
    value typically corresponds to predefined action types within the game's scripting
    framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the action identifier associated with this trigger.
    The specific meaning of this value depends on the context in which the trigger
    is used, but it generally corresponds to a predefined action type or index in
    the game's AI or script system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int action = trigger->GetAction();\nif (action == 1)\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ action type 1\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Debugging Trigger Actions
    code: 'Trigger* trigger = ...; // Assume trigger is initialized

      int actionId = trigger->GetAction();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("scripts", "Trigger action ID: %d", actionId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other trigger-related methods
    to fully understand and manipulate trigger behavior. The action identifier returned
    may be interpreted differently depending on the specific trigger type or script
    context.
