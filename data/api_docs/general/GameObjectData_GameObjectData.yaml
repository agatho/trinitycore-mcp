documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new GameObjectData object with default values.
  description: The GameObjectData constructor initializes a new instance of the GameObjectData
    class, setting all member variables to their default states. This constructor
    is typically used when creating game object data entries that will be populated
    with specific values later, such as when loading data from the database or creating
    new game objects dynamically. The initialization ensures that all fields are in
    a valid state before any operations are performed on the object. In the context
    of TrinityCore's architecture, this constructor is part of the GameObjectData
    class which represents the base data structure for game objects in the world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new GameObjectData instance
    code: 'GameObjectData newData;

      // The newData object is now initialized with default values

      // and can be used to store game object information'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs basic initialization of member variables but does
    not populate any specific data. It's important to note that GameObjectData objects
    created with this constructor should have their fields properly set before being
    used in gameplay operations. The class likely contains fields such as GUID, entry
    ID, position coordinates, rotation values, and other game object metadata.
  warnings: Since this is a constructor, it should not be called directly on already
    initialized objects. Calling it on an existing GameObjectData instance may lead
    to data loss or undefined behavior if the object was already populated with data.
    Always ensure proper initialization sequence when working with GameObjectData
    objects.
