documentation:
  brief: Returns a GameObject instance by its spawn ID from the map.
  description: This method retrieves a GameObject object from the map's internal storage
    using the specified spawn ID. It is commonly used in World of Warcraft server
    development to access game objects that have been spawned and are present in the
    current map instance. The method performs a lookup in the map's GameObject container,
    returning a pointer to the GameObject if found, or nullptr if no such object exists.
    This functionality is essential for managing object references during quest handling,
    NPC interactions, and other game mechanics where specific game objects need to
    be located by their spawn ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the GameObject instance if found by the given spawn
    ID, otherwise returns nullptr if no matching GameObject exists in the map's storage.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "GameObject* go = map->GetGameObjectBySpawnId(12345);\nif (go)\n{\n    //\
      \ Use the game object\n    go->SetGoState(GO_STATE_READY);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and operates on the map's internal GameObject
    storage. Performance considerations include the fact that it performs a linear
    search through the map's GameObject container, so for large maps with many objects,
    this lookup may become slower. Developers should be aware that the returned pointer
    can be nullptr if no object exists with that spawn ID.
  warnings: This method will return nullptr if the GameObject does not exist in the
    map's storage, which could lead to null pointer dereference errors if not properly
    checked before use. Always validate the return value before accessing methods
    on the returned GameObject.
