  method: IsGarrison
  signature: bool Map::IsGarrison() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current map is a garrison map.
  description: This method checks if the map instance represents a garrison area within
    World of Warcraft. It returns true when the map is specifically designated as
    a garrison, which includes various garrison-related zones such as the garrison
    building areas, garrison mission maps, or other garrison-specific content. The
    method is commonly used to distinguish between regular world maps and garrison
    maps in game logic, particularly for handling garrison-specific mechanics and
    interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map is a garrison map, false otherwise. This indicates
    that the current map instance belongs to the garrison system and is used for garrison-related
    gameplay such as building management, mission handling, or garrison-specific content.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (map->IsGarrison())\n{\n    // Handle garrison-specific logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other map-related methods
    to determine the type of map being processed. It's important to note that this
    method may not be available in all map types, particularly in older versions of
    TrinityCore where garrison mechanics were not yet implemented.
  warnings: This method should only be called on valid map instances; calling it on
    invalid or null map pointers can result in undefined behavior or crashes. Also,
    the method does not distinguish between different garrison types (e.g., alliance
    vs horde garrison), so additional checks may be needed for more specific garrison
    logic.
