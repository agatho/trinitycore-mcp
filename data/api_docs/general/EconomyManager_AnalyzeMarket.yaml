documentation:
  brief: Analyzes market data for a specified item and returns detailed pricing and
    availability information.
  description: The AnalyzeMarket method retrieves comprehensive market statistics
    for a given item ID, including current price trends, supply levels, and demand
    indicators. This function is typically used by in-game economy systems or third-party
    tools to monitor market conditions. The method performs internal lookups within
    the game's auction house database and calculates relevant metrics such as average
    price, minimum/maximum prices, and total quantity available. It requires that
    the item ID corresponds to a valid tradable item within the game's database.
  parameters: []
  returns: A MarketData object containing detailed market analysis for the specified
    item, including current price, supply quantity, demand level, and other relevant
    economic metrics. Returns an empty MarketData structure if the item ID is invalid
    or no market data exists for that item.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Market Analysis
    code: "MarketData data = economyMgr.AnalyzeMarket(12345);\nif (!data.IsEmpty())\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"Average Price: \" << data.GetAveragePrice() << std::endl;\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Quantity Available: \" << data.GetQuantityAvailable() <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve database queries and should be used judiciously in
    performance-critical code paths. The returned MarketData structure is designed
    to be thread-safe for read operations, but modifications should be handled carefully
    in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid item ID will result in an empty MarketData
    return value. Always validate the return value before accessing its members to
    avoid potential access violations.
