  signature: bool PlayerbotMigrationMgr::LoadMigrationFiles()
documentation:
  brief: Loads migration files for player bot data
  description: The LoadMigrationFiles method initializes and loads all necessary migration
    files required for player bot functionality in TrinityCore. This method is responsible
    for reading configuration files, database schemas, and data transformation scripts
    that enable the migration of player bot data between different versions or states.
    It ensures that all player bot related data structures are properly initialized
    before any bot operations can be performed. The method typically runs during server
    startup or when a migration process is triggered.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all migration files were successfully loaded and processed,
    false otherwise. A return value of false indicates that at least one required
    file failed to load or process correctly, which may prevent proper player bot
    functionality.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during server initialization
    code: "PlayerbotMigrationMgr* migrationMgr = PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance();\n\
      bool success = migrationMgr->LoadMigrationFiles();\nif (!success) {\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to load player bot migration files\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the server's initialization
    phase. Multiple calls may result in duplicate file loading or unexpected behavior.
    The method relies on proper file permissions and existence of migration files
    in the expected directory structure.
  warnings: Do not call this method after player bots have already been initialized,
    as it may cause data corruption or inconsistent states. Ensure that all required
    migration files are present before calling this method to avoid runtime errors.
