  class: GossipHandler
  method: ClearCache
  signature: void GossipHandler::ClearCache()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the gossip cache for the player's current interaction.
  description: The ClearCache method invalidates and removes cached gossip data associated
    with the player's current conversation. This ensures that subsequent gossip interactions
    will fetch fresh data from the database or script handlers rather than using stale
    cached information. The method is typically invoked when a player's state changes
    significantly, such as after completing quests, gaining levels, or transitioning
    between different NPC dialogues. It helps maintain consistency in the game's dialogue
    system by preventing outdated options from appearing in the gossip menu.

  - title: Basic Usage in Gossip Handler
    code: "void HandleGossipHello(Player* player, Creature* creature)\n{\n    // ...\
      \ some logic ...\n    GossipHandler::ClearCache();\n    // ... more logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the core when a player's gossip
    state needs to be refreshed. Developers should not typically call this directly
    unless implementing custom gossip behavior that requires cache invalidation.
