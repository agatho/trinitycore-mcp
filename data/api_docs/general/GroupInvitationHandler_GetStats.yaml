documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current invitation statistics for the group invitation handler.
  description: The GetStats method returns a constant reference to an InvitationStats
    object that contains detailed information about the group invitation process.
    This includes data such as the number of invitations sent, accepted, rejected,
    and expired. The method provides insight into the group invitation system's behavior
    and performance. It is typically used for monitoring, debugging, or administrative
    purposes within the TrinityCore framework. The returned statistics are updated
    dynamically as invitations are processed.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an InvitationStats object containing current invitation-related
    metrics including sent, accepted, rejected, and expired invitation counts.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Display Invitation Statistics
    code: 'const InvitationStats& stats = groupInvitationHandler.GetStats();

      std::cout << "Sent: " << stats.sent << ", Accepted: " << stats.accepted << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned InvitationStats object is read-only and should not be modified
    directly. The statistics are maintained internally by the GroupInvitationHandler
    and updated in real-time as invitations are processed. This method is thread-safe
    and can be called from any thread context.
