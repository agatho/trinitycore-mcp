documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new GuildEvent object with default values.
  description: The GuildEvent constructor initializes a new instance of the GuildEvent
    class, setting up internal data members to their default states. This method is
    typically called when creating a new guild event object, either for storing event
    information or for triggering events within the guild system. The constructor
    ensures that all member variables are properly initialized before the object can
    be used for guild-related operations such as event creation, modification, or
    notification handling.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new GuildEvent instance
    code: 'GuildEvent event;

      // The event object is now initialized with default values

      // and can be used for guild event operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any validation or initialization of external
    dependencies. It simply sets internal member variables to their default states,
    which may include zero-initialization for numeric types and null/empty values
    for pointers and containers.
