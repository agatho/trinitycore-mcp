  brief: Determines whether the quest is a Dungeon Finder quest
  description: The IsDFQuest method checks if the current quest is a Dungeon Finder
    quest, which is a type of quest that can be completed in a dungeon or raid instance.
    This method returns true when the quest has the Dungeon Finder flag set, indicating
    it's part of the Dungeon Finder system and can be used for dungeon finding activities.
    The method is commonly used to identify quests that are specifically designed
    for Dungeon Finder mechanics rather than regular quest progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest is a Dungeon Finder quest, false otherwise. This
    indicates whether the quest can be used within the Dungeon Finder system or not.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (quest->IsDFQuest()) {\n    // Quest is a Dungeon Finder quest\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking quest type in a quest handler
    code: "bool isDungeonFinder = quest->IsDFQuest();\nif (isDungeonFinder) {\n  \
      \  // Handle Dungeon Finder specific logic\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the quest's flags and properties to determine if it's
    a Dungeon Finder quest. The implementation may vary based on how the quest is
    defined in the database or through game mechanics. Performance considerations
    are minimal as this is a simple boolean check.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining quest completion status,
    only for identifying whether the quest is part of the Dungeon Finder system. Using
    it inappropriately may lead to incorrect logic handling.
