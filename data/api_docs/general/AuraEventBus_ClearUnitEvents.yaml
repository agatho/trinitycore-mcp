  class: AuraEventBus
  method: ClearUnitEvents
  signature: void AuraEventBus::ClearUnitEvents(int unitGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes all aura events associated with a specified unit GUID from the event
    bus.
  description: The ClearUnitEvents method is responsible for purging all registered
    aura events that are linked to a specific unit identified by its GUID. This function
    ensures that no lingering event handlers or callbacks remain for the given unit,
    which is essential for memory management and preventing potential dangling references
    when units are removed or destroyed. The method operates within the context of
    TrinityCore's aura system where events are tracked and managed through an event
    bus architecture. It is typically invoked during unit cleanup, destruction, or
    when resetting aura states to prevent memory leaks or unexpected behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: unitGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the unit whose aura events should
      be cleared. This value must represent a valid unit in the game world, typically
      obtained from GameObject, Creature, or Player objects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing Aura Events for a Player
    code: 'AuraEventBus& eventBus = AuraEventBus::Instance();

      Player* player = ...; // Assume player is valid

      uint64 playerGuid = player->GetGUID();

      eventBus.ClearUnitEvents(playerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing Events Before Unit Destruction
    code: 'AuraEventBus& eventBus = AuraEventBus::Instance();

      Creature* creature = ...; // Assume creature is valid

      uint64 creatureGuid = creature->GetGUID();

      eventBus.ClearUnitEvents(creatureGuid);

      // Proceed with creature destruction

      creature->DeleteFromDB();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided unitGuid is valid and corresponds to
    an existing unit in the game world. It's recommended to verify the existence of
    a unit before calling this method to avoid unintended behavior. The implementation
    likely uses internal data structures such as maps or hash tables to efficiently
    locate and remove events associated with the given GUID.
  warnings: Calling ClearUnitEvents on a non-existent unit GUID may lead to undefined
    behavior if the underlying event bus implementation does not perform validation
    checks. Always ensure that the unit exists in the game world before invoking this
    method, especially when dealing with dynamically created or destroyed units.
