documentation:
  brief: Updates the auto-repeat spell for the unit, handling ranged attack animations
    and spell casting.
  description: This method manages the auto-repeat spell behavior for Unit objects,
    typically used for players or NPCs with ranged attacks. It handles the updating
    of the auto-repeat spell state, including checking if the unit should be casting
    a spell automatically, managing the spell's cooldown, and ensuring proper animation
    handling. The method is called internally during combat updates and is crucial
    for maintaining proper ranged attack behavior in World of Warcraft. It ensures
    that the auto-repeat spell is properly updated based on the unit's current state
    and conditions.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->_UpdateAutoRepeatSpell();

      // This updates the auto-repeat spell for the unit'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat update cycles and should be
    invoked only when the unit is actively engaged in ranged combat. The method handles
    both spell casting and animation updates, making it essential for maintaining
    proper gameplay mechanics.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by external code unless specifically
    needed; it's usually invoked automatically during combat updates. Improper usage
    can lead to incorrect spell behavior or animation issues.
