documentation:
  brief: Initializes Death Knight AI behavior when entering combat with a target
  description: The OnCombatStart method is invoked when a Death Knight AI unit begins
    combat with a target. This method initializes the AI's combat state, sets up necessary
    variables, and prepares the Death Knight for battle. It typically handles the
    initial setup of abilities, positioning, and targeting logic specific to the Death
    Knight class. The method ensures that the AI responds appropriately to the start
    of combat by activating relevant mechanics such as rune management, ability cooldowns,
    and threat generation. This is a core part of the Death Knight's AI lifecycle
    and directly affects how the NPC behaves during encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that the Death Knight is beginning combat
      with. This represents the enemy target that initiated or will be engaged in
      combat.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic OnCombatStart Implementation
    code: "void DeathKnightAI::OnCombatStart(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (!target)\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Initialize combat-specific variables\n    _combatStarted\
      \ = true;\n    _target = target;\n    \n    // Start combat abilities or setup\n\
      \    me->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n    me->Attack(target, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the core AI system when a Death Knight
    enters combat. It's important to note that the target parameter may be null in
    certain edge cases, so proper null checking should be implemented. The method
    should not perform heavy operations as it's part of the combat initialization
    sequence.
  warnings: Ensure that all combat-related variables are properly initialized before
    calling any combat mechanics. Failure to properly set up the AI state can lead
    to unexpected behavior or crashes during combat. Avoid making asynchronous calls
    within this method as it may interfere with the combat flow.
