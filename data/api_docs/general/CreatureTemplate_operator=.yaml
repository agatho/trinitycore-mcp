  brief: Moves the contents of another CreatureTemplate object to this instance
  description: The move assignment operator transfers ownership of resources from
    the source CreatureTemplate object to this object. This operation is typically
    used in scenarios where temporary or intermediate CreatureTemplate objects need
    to be efficiently transferred without unnecessary copying. The method performs
    a move semantics implementation, which means that the internal data members of
    the source object are relocated to the target object, leaving the source in a
    valid but unspecified state. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft
    emulation, this operator is particularly relevant when working with creature templates
    during database loading or runtime template modifications.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current CreatureTemplate object after the move operation
    has completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'CreatureTemplate template1;

      // ... initialize template1 ...

      CreatureTemplate template2 = std::move(template1); // Uses move assignment

      // template1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Container Context
    code: 'std::vector<CreatureTemplate> templates;

      templates.emplace_back();

      // ... populate template ...

      templates.push_back(std::move(template)); // Move template to vector

      // Original template is now in moved-from state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator implements move semantics which is more efficient than copy
    semantics. The source object after a move operation should not be used for any
    operations that require valid data, though it remains in a valid state. This method
    is typically auto-generated by the compiler when no user-defined assignment operator
    exists, but can be explicitly defined to provide custom move behavior.
  warnings: After calling this move assignment operator, the source object should
    not be accessed or used for any operations that require its data to remain valid.
    The moved-from object is left in a valid but unspecified state and may contain
    garbage values or partially constructed data.
