  method: GetStyle
  signature: uint32 EmblemInfo::GetStyle() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the emblem style identifier associated with the EmblemInfo object.
  description: The GetStyle method returns the unique style identifier that defines
    the visual appearance of an emblem within the World of Warcraft client. This identifier
    corresponds to predefined emblem styles stored in the game's database and is used
    to determine how the emblem should be rendered, including its shape, border, and
    overall design. The returned value typically maps to entries in the Emblems.dbc
    file or similar internal data structures that define emblem properties. This method
    is commonly used when processing guild emblems, player avatars, or any UI elements
    that display customizable emblems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the emblem style identifier. This numeric ID
    corresponds to a specific emblem design defined in the game's data files and determines
    how the emblem appears visually in the client.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'EmblemInfo emblem;

      uint32 styleId = emblem.GetStyle();

      // styleId now contains the emblem style identifier

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Style ID for UI Logic
    code: "EmblemInfo guildEmblem;\nuint32 style = guildEmblem.GetStyle();\nif (style\
      \ == 10)\n{\n    // Apply special rendering logic for a specific emblem style\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter and does not perform any expensive operations.
    It directly returns a cached value from the EmblemInfo object, making it safe
    to call frequently. The returned style ID should be validated against known emblem
    definitions in the game's data files to ensure proper rendering.
