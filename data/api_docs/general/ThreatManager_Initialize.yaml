  brief: Initializes the threat management system for a creature or player.
  description: The ThreatManager::Initialize method sets up the initial threat state
    for a creature or player within the game world. This method establishes the base
    threat level and initializes the internal tracking mechanisms that govern how
    the entity responds to threat changes during combat. It is typically called when
    a creature or player enters combat, ensuring proper threat management behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic initialization example
    code: 'ThreatManager* threatMgr = new ThreatManager();

      threatMgr->Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per entity during combat initialization.
    The method does not directly interact with the player's or creature's AI behavior,
    but rather sets up the internal threat tracking system for proper combat management.
