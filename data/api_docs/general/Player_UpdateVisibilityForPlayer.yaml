  brief: Updates the visibility state of the player for nearby entities in the game
    world
  description: The UpdateVisibilityForPlayer method recalculates and synchronizes
    the visibility state of a player character with surrounding objects in the game
    world. This includes updating which creatures, game objects, and other players
    are visible to the player based on distance, line of sight, and other visibility
    conditions. The method is typically invoked automatically by the core when a player's
    position or state changes, ensuring that the client's view accurately reflects
    the current game state. It handles both adding new visible entities and removing
    those that have gone out of visibility range.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateVisibilityForPlayer();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the TrinityCore server core and
    should not typically be invoked manually unless implementing custom visibility
    logic. It may trigger network packets to be sent to the player's client, so excessive
    calls could impact performance.
