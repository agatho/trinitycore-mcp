  method: PlaceTrap
  signature: void MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::PlaceTrap(uint32 param0, int param1)
documentation:
  brief: Places a trap at the specified location with given parameters.
  description: 'The PlaceTrap method is used by Marksmanship Hunters to deploy traps
    in the world. This method handles the placement logic for various trap types including
    Snake Trap, Freezing Trap, and others. The method takes two parameters: the first
    specifies the trap type or template ID, while the second controls the trap''s
    behavior or duration. The trap will be placed at the hunter''s current position
    or target location depending on the implementation details. This method is typically
    called during the hunter''s ability usage and integrates with the game''s trap
    system to manage cooldowns, visual effects, and trap activation mechanics.'
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Trap type or template ID specifying which kind of trap to place.
      Valid values correspond to specific trap types defined in the game's trap system,
      such as Snake Trap (1), Freezing Trap (2), etc.
  - name: param1
    description: Behavioral parameter controlling trap properties such as duration,
      damage, or activation delay. The exact meaning depends on the trap type being
      placed and can influence how long the trap lasts or what effect it applies when
      triggered.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Place a Snake Trap
    code: hunter->PlaceTrap(1, 3000); // Places a Snake Trap with 3 second duration
    language: cpp
  - title: Place a Freezing Trap
    code: hunter->PlaceTrap(2, 5000); // Places a Freezing Trap with 5 second duration
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the hunter's pet system and trap cooldown
    management. It may also trigger visual effects and sound cues for trap placement.
    The implementation should handle validation of trap types and ensure proper positioning
    within the game world.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of parameters may result
    in invalid trap placement or game state corruption. Ensure that param0 corresponds
    to a valid trap type defined in the game database.
