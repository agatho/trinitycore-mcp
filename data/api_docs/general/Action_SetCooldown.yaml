  class: Action
  method: SetCooldown
  signature: void Action::SetCooldown(uint32 cooldownMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the cooldown duration for the action in milliseconds.
  description: The SetCooldown method configures the cooldown period for an action,
    determining how long the action remains unavailable after being used. This is
    a fundamental mechanic in World of Warcraft that prevents players from spamming
    abilities or items. The method accepts a time value in milliseconds and applies
    it to the action's internal cooldown timer. When called, the action will be on
    cooldown for the specified duration, during which it cannot be executed. This
    method is typically used within AI scripts or game logic to control ability usage
    timing.
  parameters:
  - name: cooldownMs
    description: The cooldown duration in milliseconds. Must be a non-negative integer
      value representing the time the action should remain on cooldown after activation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cooldown Setting
    code: 'Action* action = player->GetAction(1);

      action->SetCooldown(3000); // Set 3-second cooldown'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Long Duration Cooldown
    code: 'Action* action = player->GetAction(2);

      action->SetCooldown(10000); // Set 10-second cooldown for special ability'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the action's internal cooldown state. It does
    not trigger any visual effects or send packets to clients; those are handled separately
    by the game engine. The cooldown timer starts immediately upon calling this method.
  warnings: Setting a cooldown of zero milliseconds effectively disables the cooldown
    for that action, which may cause unintended behavior if not carefully managed.
    Ensure proper validation of input values to prevent negative or excessively large
    cooldown durations.
