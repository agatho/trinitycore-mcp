documentation:
  brief: Updates the internal tracking of echo targets for the evoker AI.
  description: The TrackEchoTargets method is responsible for maintaining an up-to-date
    list of valid target entities that can be affected by the evoker's Echo ability.
    This method iterates through the current threat list and identifies eligible targets
    based on game mechanics such as target validity, distance, and combat state. It
    ensures that the AI has accurate information about which units are suitable for
    echo-based abilities, allowing for proper targeting and decision-making during
    combat. The method is typically called during AI update cycles to keep target
    data current.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update cycle
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    TrackEchoTargets();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal member variables that store target references.
    It should only be called when the AI is in combat or has valid targets to process.
    The method may filter out targets that are currently invulnerable, dead, or outside
    of the echo ability's range.
