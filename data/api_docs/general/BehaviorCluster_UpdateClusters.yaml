  signature: void BehaviorCluster::UpdateClusters()
documentation:
  brief: Updates all behavior clusters in the current environment
  description: The UpdateClusters method is responsible for processing and refreshing
    the state of all active behavior clusters within the TrinityCore AI system. This
    method typically iterates through registered behavior clusters, evaluates their
    current conditions, updates their internal states, and applies any necessary behavioral
    changes to the associated units or entities. It serves as a central coordination
    point for AI behavior management and is usually invoked during the game loop's
    update cycle to ensure that all AI behaviors remain synchronized with the current
    game state.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // Update all behavior clusters\n    sBehaviorCluster->UpdateClusters();\n\
      \    // Continue with other updates...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game loop or AI update thread.
    It may perform operations that could impact performance if there are many active
    behavior clusters, so it's recommended to monitor execution time in performance-critical
    scenarios.
