  signature: void BotActionProcessor::~BotActionProcessor()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BotActionProcessor instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotActionProcessor class is responsible for
    releasing all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This
    includes cleaning up any internal data structures, stopping active threads if
    applicable, and ensuring proper shutdown of bot action processing components.
    In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this method ensures that when a bot
    action processor is no longer needed, it properly terminates its operations without
    leaving dangling pointers or memory leaks. The destructor should be called automatically
    by the C++ runtime when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BotActionProcessor
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    BotActionProcessor processor;\n    // ... use\
      \ processor ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when processor goes\
      \ out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of BotActionProcessor
    code: 'BotActionProcessor* processor = new BotActionProcessor();

      // ... use processor ...

      delete processor; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is typically called automatically by the C++ runtime. Developers
    should not manually invoke destructors unless implementing custom memory management
    patterns. Ensure that no other objects hold references to this processor after
    destruction to prevent use-after-free errors.
