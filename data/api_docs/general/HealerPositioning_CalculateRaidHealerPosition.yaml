  class: HealerPositioning
  method: CalculateRaidHealerPosition
  signature: int HealerPositioning::CalculateRaidHealerPosition(const int & raidMembers,
    const CombatPositionContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal healer position within a raid based on
    combat context and member count.
  description: The CalculateRaidHealerPosition method determines the most effective
    positioning for a healer within a raid environment. It evaluates the number of
    raid members and the current combat context to compute an ideal position that
    maximizes healing efficiency and minimizes movement. This method is typically
    used in dynamic raid scenarios where positioning significantly impacts group survivability.
    The calculation considers factors such as player distribution, threat levels,
    and proximity to key targets. The result represents a position identifier or coordinate
    that can be used by the AI system to guide healer movement.
  parameters:
  - name: raidMembers
    description: The total number of raid members participating in combat. Must be
      a positive integer representing valid player count.
  - name: context
    description: CombatPositionContext object containing current combat state information
      including player positions, threat levels, and target data.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated optimal healer position.
    A positive value indicates a valid position coordinate, while negative values
    may indicate error conditions or invalid input parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in raid combat
    code: "int position = healerPositioning.CalculateRaidHealerPosition(25, combatContext);\n\
      if (position >= 0) {\n    // Use calculated position for healer movement\n \
      \   std::cout << \"Optimal healer position: \" << position << std::endl;\n}\
      \ else {\n    // Handle error case\n    std::cerr << \"Failed to calculate healer\
      \ position\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI decision making
    code: "class RaidHealerAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdatePosition() {\n        int\
      \ optimalPosition = healerPositioning.CalculateRaidHealerPosition(raidSize,\
      \ currentContext);\n        if (optimalPosition >= 0) {\n            MoveToPosition(optimalPosition);\n\
      \        } else {\n            // Fallback to default positioning\n        \
      \    MoveToCenter();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the CombatPositionContext contains valid and up-to-date
    information about raid members. The calculation may be computationally intensive
    in large raids, so caching results when possible is recommended for performance
    optimization.
  warnings: Ensure that raidMembers parameter is always positive and that context
    object contains valid data before calling this method. Passing invalid or outdated
    combat context data may result in suboptimal positioning decisions.
