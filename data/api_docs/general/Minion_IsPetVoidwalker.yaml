documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the minion is a voidwalker pet.
  description: This method checks if the current minion instance represents a voidwalker
    pet in World of Warcraft. It returns true if the minion's creature entry corresponds
    to a voidwalker (typically entry 1860), and false otherwise. This functionality
    is commonly used in warlock pet management systems to differentiate between various
    types of summoned creatures. The method performs a simple type check based on
    the minion's creature template data.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the minion is a voidwalker pet, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if minion is a voidwalker
    code: "if (minion->IsPetVoidwalker()) {\n    // Handle voidwalker specific logic\n\
      \    SendChatMessage(\"I am a voidwalker!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional pet behavior based on type
    code: "void HandlePetAction(Minion* minion) {\n    if (minion->IsPetVoidwalker())\
      \ {\n        // Apply voidwalker specific abilities\n        minion->CastSpell(minion,\
      \ 34936); // Shadow Bolt\n    } else if (minion->IsPetFelguard()) {\n      \
      \  // Apply felguard specific abilities\n        minion->CastSpell(minion, 30151);\
      \ // Intercept\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the minion's creature entry ID matching that of a voidwalker.
    The implementation assumes that voidwalkers are consistently identified by entry
    ID 1860 in the game database. This check is performed at runtime and should be
    used carefully in performance-critical sections.
  warnings: Ensure that the minion pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid null pointer dereferences. While the method itself is lightweight, calling
    it repeatedly in tight loops may impact performance if not necessary.
