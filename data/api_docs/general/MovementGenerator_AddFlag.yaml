documentation:
  brief: Adds a movement flag to the movement generator's flag set.
  description: The AddFlag method is used to set or enable a specific movement flag
    within the MovementGenerator class. This method allows for the manipulation of
    movement behavior by adding predefined flags that control how an object moves
    through the game world. Movement flags are typically used in conjunction with
    movement generators to define movement types, restrictions, or special behaviors
    for units such as players, creatures, or game objects. The method modifies internal
    state and is often called during movement initialization or when changing movement
    modes.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: The movement flag value to be added. This should be a constant or
      enum value representing a specific movement behavior or restriction, such as
      MOVEMENTFLAG_WALKING, MOVEMENTFLAG_FLYING, or other predefined movement flags
      used in TrinityCore's movement system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Walking Movement Flag
    code: 'MovementGenerator* mg = new MovementGenerator();

      mg->AddFlag(MOVEMENTFLAG_WALKING);

      // This enables walking movement for the associated unit.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Multiple Movement Flags
    code: 'MovementGenerator* mg = new MovementGenerator();

      mg->AddFlag(MOVEMENTFLAG_FLYING);

      mg->AddFlag(MOVEMENTFLAG_SWIMMING);

      // Enables both flying and swimming movement modes.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state flags that are used by the movement system
    to determine how a unit should move. It's important to understand that movement
    flags are cumulative - multiple flags can be added simultaneously to create complex
    movement behaviors. The actual implementation likely involves bitwise operations
    on an internal flag variable.
  warnings: Ensure that the flag value passed is valid and defined within the movement
    flag enumeration system. Incorrect or undefined flags may lead to unexpected movement
    behavior or runtime errors. This method should not be called during active movement
    processing as it might interfere with current movement state.
