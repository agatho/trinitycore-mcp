  class: ObjectPosSelector
  method: NextUsedAngle
  signature: bool ObjectPosSelector::NextUsedAngle(float & angle)
documentation:
  brief: Advances to and returns the next used angle in the object position selector.
  description: The NextUsedAngle method advances the internal iterator of the ObjectPosSelector
    to the next used angle and retrieves that angle value. This method is typically
    used in pathfinding or positioning calculations where multiple angles are considered
    for object placement or movement. It maintains an internal state to track which
    angles have already been used, ensuring that subsequent calls return different
    angles until all possibilities are exhausted. The method returns false when no
    more unused angles are available.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if a valid next used angle was retrieved and the iterator advanced
    successfully; false if there are no more used angles to iterate through.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of NextUsedAngle
    code: "ObjectPosSelector selector;\nfloat angle;\nif (selector.NextUsedAngle(angle))\
      \ {\n    // Use the retrieved angle for positioning\n    printf(\"Next used\
      \ angle: %f\\n\", angle);\n} else {\n    // No more angles available\n    printf(\"\
      No more used angles available.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a selector system that manages multiple potential
    angles for object positioning, commonly used in AI pathfinding or spell targeting
    logic within TrinityCore. The internal state management ensures that each angle
    is only returned once per iteration cycle.
