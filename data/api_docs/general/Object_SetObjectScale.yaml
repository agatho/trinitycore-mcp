documentation:
  brief: Sets the scale factor of an object to modify its visual size.
  description: This method allows developers to adjust the scale of any Object instance,
    which affects how the object appears visually in the game world. The scale parameter
    controls the size of the object relative to its original dimensions, with values
    less than 1 making objects smaller and values greater than 1 making them larger.
    This functionality is particularly useful for adjusting visual effects like boss
    fights or custom models without altering the underlying data structure. The method
    directly modifies the object's scale property and does not return any value.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Scale Adjustment Example
    code: 'Object* target = new Object();

      target->SetObjectScale(1.5f);

      // This makes the object appear 50% larger than normal'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Scale for Specific Game Mechanics
    code: 'Creature* boss = new Creature();

      boss->SetObjectScale(2.0f);

      // Adjusts boss scale to make it visually more imposing

      // Used in custom boss fight mechanics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the object's scale property and should be used
    carefully as it affects visual representation only. It does not alter the object's
    physical size or collision properties, only its visual appearance.
  warnings: Improper use of scale values can lead to visual inconsistencies in game
    world, such as objects appearing too large or too small relative to their intended
    design. Also, this method should be used with caution when dealing with objects
    that have specific scaling requirements for gameplay mechanics.
