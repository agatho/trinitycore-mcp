  class: Player
  method: GetGameObjectIfCanInteractWith
  signature: int * Player::GetGameObjectIfCanInteractWith(const int & guid, int type)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the game object that the player can interact with based on GUID and
    type.
  description: This method retrieves a GameObject that the player can interact with,
    given a specific GUID and type. It checks if the player has the necessary permissions
    or conditions to interact with the specified GameObject. The method is commonly
    used in quest and interaction handling within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework. It ensures that the GameObject is valid and accessible for interaction
    by the player.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the game object to check for interaction.
  - name: type
    description: The type of the game object, determining how it should be handled
      in interaction logic.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the GameObject if the player can interact with it,
    otherwise returns nullptr. The returned value represents a valid GameObject that
    is accessible for interaction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interaction Example
    code: "GameObject* go = player->GetGameObjectIfCanInteractWith(guid, type);\n\
      if (go != nullptr)\n{\n    // Player can interact with the game object\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Interaction Example
    code: "int type = 3;\nGameObject* go = player->GetGameObjectIfCanInteractWith(guid,\
      \ type);\nif (go != nullptr)\n{\n    // Perform interaction logic\n    go->Use(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other interaction methods
    to determine whether a player can interact with a game object. It may involve
    checks for distance, visibility, and player state. Performance considerations
    include checking if the GameObject exists before calling this method.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may return nullptr if the player
    does not meet interaction requirements. Ensure that the GUID and type parameters
    are valid to avoid undefined behavior.
