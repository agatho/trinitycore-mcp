documentation:
  brief: Checks if the game object is currently spawned in the world.
  description: The isSpawned() method determines whether a GameObject instance is
    actively present and visible in the game world. This status indicates that the
    object has been successfully created, initialized, and added to the server's active
    object lists. The method returns true when the object is spawned and false if
    it is either despawned, not yet spawned, or has been destroyed. In TrinityCore,
    this check is commonly used in AI scripts, event handlers, and quest logic to
    verify an object's availability before performing operations on it.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the GameObject is currently spawned and visible in the
    world; returns false if it is not spawned or has been removed from the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spawn Status Check
    code: "if (gameObject->isSpawned())\n{\n    // Object is active in the world\n\
      \    // Perform operations on the spawned object\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Quest Event Handler
    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    GameObject*\
      \ go = player->FindNearestGameObject(GO_ID, 5.0f);\n    if (go && go->isSpawned())\n\
      \    {\n        // Proceed with quest-related logic\n        go->SetGoState(GO_STATE_ACTIVE);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple state check and has minimal performance impact.
    It's safe to call from any thread context where the GameObject object is accessible,
    though it should not be called on objects that might be destroyed concurrently.
  warnings: Be aware that an object may be marked as spawned but not necessarily in
    a usable state if it's in a despawning process or has been flagged for removal.
    Always ensure proper synchronization when checking spawn status in multithreaded
    environments.
