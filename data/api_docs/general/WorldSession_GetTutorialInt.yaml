  class: WorldSession
  method: GetTutorialInt
  signature: uint32 WorldSession::GetTutorialInt(uint8 index) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a tutorial integer value at the specified index from the player's
    tutorial data.
  description: The GetTutorialInt method retrieves a 32-bit unsigned integer value
    stored at a specific index within the player's tutorial data array. This data
    is typically used to track the progress of various in-game tutorials, quests,
    or initial setup states for new players. The method accesses internal tutorial
    bitmasks and flags that are managed by the server and synchronized with the client.
    It is commonly used during character login and gameplay to determine which tutorials
    have been completed or skipped by the player.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a 32-bit unsigned integer value representing the tutorial data
    at the specified index. The value typically represents a bitmask or flag indicating
    tutorial completion status, progress state, or other tutorial-related information.
    Returns zero if the index is invalid or no tutorial data exists for that index.
  examples:
  - title: Check Tutorial Completion Status
    code: "uint32 tutorialData = session->GetTutorialInt(0);\nif (tutorialData & 0x01)\n\
      {\n    // Tutorial step 1 is completed\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Retrieve Player's Tutorial Progress
    code: 'WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();

      uint32 progress = session->GetTutorialInt(5);

      // Use progress value to determine which tutorial steps have been completed

      // This is often used in conjunction with other tutorial methods like SetTutorialInt'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method accesses internal tutorial data that is part of the player's saved
    state. Tutorial indices are typically predefined and correspond to specific tutorial
    systems within the game. The returned value may be a bitmask where individual
    bits represent different tutorial states or steps. This method should only be
    called on valid WorldSession objects with an active player connection.
  warnings: This method assumes that the session has a valid player object associated
    with it. Calling this method on a session without an active player connection
    may result in undefined behavior. The index parameter must be within valid tutorial
    data bounds, otherwise the returned value may not represent meaningful data.
