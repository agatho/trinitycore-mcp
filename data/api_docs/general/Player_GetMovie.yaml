documentation:
  brief: Returns the movie ID associated with the player's current cinematic sequence.
  description: The GetMovie method retrieves the unique identifier of the cinematic
    movie that is currently playing for the player. This method is typically used
    in conjunction with the player's cinematic sequence handling to determine which
    movie is being displayed during specific game events or cutscenes. The returned
    value represents the ID of a movie file that can be used to control or query cinematic
    behavior within the game. This method does not require any parameters and operates
    on the player object directly, returning a uint32 value representing the movie
    ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the ID of the currently playing cinematic
    movie. This value corresponds to an entry in the Movie database table and can
    be used to identify specific cinematic sequences or control their playback behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 movieID = player->GetMovie();\nif (movieID > 0)\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ the movie ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other cinematic-related
    methods such as SetMovie or GetCinematicSequence. The returned movie ID may be
    zero if no cinematic sequence is currently active, and it's important to note
    that this value might change during gameplay depending on the player's current
    cinematic state.
  warnings: This method should not be used in situations where the player is not actively
    engaged in a cinematic sequence, as it may return unexpected values or zero. Additionally,
    using this method outside of proper cinematic contexts could lead to incorrect
    behavior if not handled carefully.
