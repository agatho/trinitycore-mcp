  class: AuctionManager
  method: CalculateVendorValue
  signature: uint64 AuctionManager::CalculateVendorValue(Item * item)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the vendor value of an item based on its properties
    and market dynamics.
  description: The CalculateVendorValue method determines the appropriate vendor sell
    price for a given item by analyzing its quality, level, stats, and other intrinsic
    properties. This calculation is used when items are sold back to vendors or when
    determining auction house pricing. The method considers factors such as item rarity,
    enchantments, gem sockets, and potential market value to compute a fair vendor
    price that reflects the item's worth in the game economy.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the calculated vendor sell price of the item
    in copper coins. This value indicates how much a vendor would pay for the item
    when a player attempts to sell it back.
  examples:
  - title: Calculate Vendor Value for an Item
    code: 'Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0, SLOT_HEAD);

      uint64 vendorValue = sAuctionMgr->CalculateVendorValue(item);

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Vendor value of head item: %u", vendorValue);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during item transactions with vendors or
    when calculating auction house prices. It may be influenced by server-side economy
    settings and player reputation levels in some implementations.
  warnings: Ensure that the Item pointer passed to this method is valid and not null,
    as passing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The
    returned value should always be treated as a monetary amount in copper coins.
