  signature: WorldSession * Player::GetSession() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the active WorldSession associated with the player
  description: The GetSession method retrieves the WorldSession object that represents
    the current connection between the player and the server. This session contains
    all relevant information about the player's connection, including authentication
    status, packet handling capabilities, and client-specific data. The method is
    essential for accessing player-related communication and network operations within
    the TrinityCore framework. It provides access to session-specific data that can
    be used for various game mechanics such as packet processing, chat messaging,
    and player state management.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the WorldSession object associated with this player.
    If no active session exists, it returns nullptr. The returned session object allows
    access to connection-related data and methods for handling communication with
    the client.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Session Access
    code: "WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();\nif (session)\n{\n    //\
      \ Use session for packet handling\n    session->SendPacket(&packet);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Session Check Before Usage
    code: "WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();\nif (session && session->GetPlayer())\n\
      {\n    // Access player data through session\n    Player* player = session->GetPlayer();\n\
      \    // Perform operations on player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. It returns
    a pointer to the session object which is managed by the server's connection handling
    system. The returned session may be nullptr if the player is not connected or
    has been disconnected.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in scenarios where the session might
    be null, as dereferencing a null pointer can cause crashes. Always check for null
    before using the session object.
