  signature: void BattlegroundScript::OnInit()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the battleground script with default settings and registers required
    event handlers.
  description: The OnInit method is called during the initialization phase of a battleground
    script to set up internal state, register event handlers, and prepare the battleground
    for gameplay. This method is invoked once per battleground instance when it is
    created and ready to be used. It typically sets up default values, initializes
    variables, and ensures that all necessary components are in place before the battleground
    begins accepting players or processing game events. The method should not be called
    manually by developers, as it's automatically invoked by the TrinityCore framework
    during battleground lifecycle management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic battleground script initialization
    code: "class MyBattlegroundScript : public BattlegroundScript\n{\npublic:\n  \
      \  MyBattlegroundScript() : BattlegroundScript(\"MyBattleground\") {}\n    \n\
      \    void OnInit() override\n    {\n        // Initialize custom variables\n\
      \        m_myCustomVar = 0;\n        \n        // Register event handlers\n\
      \        // ... other initialization code\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground lifecycle and should only be overridden
    in custom battleground scripts. It's automatically called by the framework and
    must complete quickly to avoid blocking battleground creation. Developers should
    avoid performing heavy operations or database queries within this method.
  warnings: Do not call OnInit() manually as it's intended to be invoked internally
    by the TrinityCore framework. Any custom initialization logic should be placed
    in this method, but avoid long-running operations that could block battleground
    startup.
