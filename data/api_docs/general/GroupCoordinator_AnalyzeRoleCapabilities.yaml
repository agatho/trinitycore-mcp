  signature: int GroupCoordinator::AnalyzeRoleCapabilities() const
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and evaluates the role capabilities of group members for optimal
    assignment.
  description: The AnalyzeRoleCapabilities method performs a comprehensive evaluation
    of each group member's role proficiency within the GroupCoordinator system. This
    method assesses player attributes, class specializations, gear levels, and previous
    role performance to determine suitable roles for group activities such as dungeons,
    raids, or world events. It returns an integer status code indicating success or
    failure of the analysis process. The method is typically invoked when forming
    or reorganizing groups to ensure optimal team composition based on individual
    capabilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value where 0 indicates successful analysis and non-zero
    values represent various error conditions such as invalid group state, missing
    member data, or internal processing failures. The specific meaning of non-zero
    return codes should be referenced in the TrinityCore source code documentation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "GroupCoordinator coordinator;\nint result = coordinator.AnalyzeRoleCapabilities();\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // Analysis completed successfully\n    // Proceed with\
      \ role assignment logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely computationally intensive as it needs to evaluate multiple
    factors for each group member. It should be called sparingly during group formation
    rather than on every game tick. The method may require all group members to be
    present and valid before execution.
  warnings: Calling this method on an empty or invalid group may result in undefined
    behavior or error codes. Ensure that the GroupCoordinator instance contains valid
    group data before invoking this method. This method does not modify group state
    directly but rather provides analysis results for subsequent role assignment decisions.
