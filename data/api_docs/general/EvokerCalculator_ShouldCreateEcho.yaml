  class: EvokerCalculator
  method: ShouldCreateEcho
  signature: bool EvokerCalculator::ShouldCreateEcho(int * caster, int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an Echo spell should be created based on caster and target
    parameters.
  description: The ShouldCreateEcho method evaluates conditions to decide if an Echo
    spell should be generated. This method is typically used in the context of evoker
    class mechanics within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework. It checks various
    factors such as player state, spell cooldowns, and combat conditions to determine
    if creating an Echo is valid. The method takes two integer pointers representing
    the caster and target entities and returns a boolean indicating whether the Echo
    creation should proceed.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the caster's identifier or state.
      This typically refers to the evoker player or creature that is attempting to
      cast the Echo spell.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or state.
      This represents the entity being targeted by the Echo spell.
  returns: Returns true if the conditions are met for creating an Echo spell; otherwise,
    returns false. A return value of false indicates that either the caster is invalid,
    the target is not suitable, or other game mechanics prevent Echo creation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in evoker spell logic
    code: "int casterId = player->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\nint targetId = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n\
      if (evokerCalculator->ShouldCreateEcho(&casterId, &targetId)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with Echo spell creation\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_ECHO, true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat state checks
    code: "if (player->IsInCombat() && evokerCalculator->ShouldCreateEcho(&casterId,\
      \ &targetId)) {\n    // Only create Echo if player is in combat\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_ECHO, true);\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid conditions\n    player->SendSpellFailed(0,\
      \ SPELL_ECHO, SPELL_FAILED_CANT_DO_THAT_RIGHT_NOW);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal evoker state tracking and may
    be part of a larger spell system. Developers should ensure that the caster and
    target pointers are valid before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
    The method might also consider factors like line of sight, distance, and target
    validity.
  warnings: Calling this method with null or invalid pointer values can lead to crashes
    or unexpected behavior. Always validate that both caster and target parameters
    point to valid entities before invoking ShouldCreateEcho.
