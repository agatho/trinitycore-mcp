  class: BotPacketRelay
  method: GetRelayOpcodes
  signature: const int & BotPacketRelay::GetRelayOpcodes()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the opcode values used for packet relay operations within the bot
    system
  description: The GetRelayOpcodes method retrieves the set of opcode values that
    are utilized by the BotPacketRelay class to identify and process specific network
    packets. These opcodes define which types of client-server communications should
    be intercepted, modified, or forwarded by the bot's packet relay mechanism. This
    method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore bot system to configure
    packet filtering and handling logic. The returned reference provides direct access
    to the internal opcode storage, allowing for efficient retrieval without unnecessary
    copying.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the opcode values used
    for packet relay operations. This value typically corresponds to a specific network
    protocol identifier that determines how packets are processed by the bot system.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Relay Opcodes
    code: "BotPacketRelay relay;\nconst int& opcodes = relay.GetRelayOpcodes();\n\
      // Use opcodes for packet filtering logic\nif (opcodes == 0x1234) {\n    //\
      \ Handle specific opcode\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to internal storage within the BotPacketRelay
    instance. Modifying the value through this reference may affect the behavior of
    packet relay operations. This method is likely called frequently during packet
    processing, so performance should be considered when implementing dependent logic.
  warnings: Since this returns a const reference to internal data, modifying the returned
    value will not affect the original data. Be cautious when using the returned opcode
    values in conditional logic that might change based on external factors.
