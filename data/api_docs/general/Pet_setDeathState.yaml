  class: Pet
  method: setDeathState
  signature: void Pet::setDeathState(int s)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the death state of the pet to the specified value.
  description: The setDeathState method is used to change the current death state
    of a Pet object. This method accepts an integer parameter that represents the
    desired death state, which typically corresponds to different states such as alive,
    dead, or dying. The implementation likely updates internal flags or variables
    within the pet's data structure to reflect this new state. This functionality
    is crucial for managing pet behavior in World of Warcraft, particularly when handling
    pet deaths, resurrections, or status changes during combat or other game events.
  parameters:
  - name: s
    description: 'The death state value to set. Valid values typically include: 0
      (alive), 1 (dead), and possibly 2 (dying). The exact meaning of each value depends
      on the internal implementation and game mechanics.'
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set pet to dead state
    code: 'Pet* myPet = player->GetPet();

      myPet->setDeathState(1); // Set pet to dead state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Set pet to alive state
    code: 'Pet* myPet = player->GetPet();

      myPet->setDeathState(0); // Set pet to alive state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal state updates and may notify the game
    world or client about the change in pet status. It's important to note that changing
    a pet's death state directly might bypass normal game logic, so it should be used
    carefully in custom scripts or modifications.
  warnings: Directly calling setDeathState without proper context may lead to inconsistent
    game state or unexpected behavior. Always ensure that setting the death state
    aligns with game rules and player expectations. Improper use could cause visual
    glitches or break pet functionality.
