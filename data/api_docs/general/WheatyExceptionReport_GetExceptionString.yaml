  method: GetExceptionString
  signature: LPCTSTR WheatyExceptionReport::GetExceptionString(DWORD dwCode)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a human-readable string representation of an exception code.
  description: The GetExceptionString method takes an exception code (DWORD) and returns
    a descriptive string that explains what the exception represents. This is commonly
    used in debugging and logging scenarios where developers need to understand the
    nature of an exception that occurred within the TrinityCore server environment.
    The method maps standard Windows exception codes to meaningful descriptions, making
    it easier for developers to diagnose issues during runtime. It's particularly
    useful in crash reporting systems or when analyzing error logs from the game server.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a constant string (LPCTSTR) that contains the descriptive
    name of the exception code. Returns NULL if the exception code is not recognized
    or valid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Exception Handling
    code: "DWORD exceptionCode = 0xC0000005; // Access violation\nLPCTSTR exceptionDesc\
      \ = report.GetExceptionString(exceptionCode);\nif (exceptionDesc)\n{\n    printf(\"\
      Exception: %s\\n\", exceptionDesc);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Exception Details
    code: "void LogException(WheatyExceptionReport& report, DWORD code)\n{\n    LPCTSTR\
      \ desc = report.GetExceptionString(code);\n    if (desc)\n    {\n        sLog->outError(\"\
      Caught exception: %s (0x%08X)\", desc, code);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n    \
      \    sLog->outError(\"Caught unknown exception: 0x%08X\", code);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically part of a crash reporting or debugging utility within
    TrinityCore. The returned string pointer is valid only for the lifetime of the
    WheatyExceptionReport object and should not be freed by the caller. It's designed
    to work with standard Windows structured exception codes, but may not cover all
    custom or game-specific exception types.
  warnings: Do not assume that all possible exception codes are handled by this method.
    Some custom or non-standard exception codes might return NULL. Always check for
    a NULL return value before using the returned string to avoid crashes.
