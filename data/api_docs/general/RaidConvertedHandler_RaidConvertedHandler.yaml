documentation:
  brief: Handles the conversion of a raid group to a bot AI system
  description: The RaidConvertedHandler method is responsible for managing the transition
    of a player's raid group into a bot-controlled AI system. This handler typically
    activates when a raid instance is converted to allow bot participation, enabling
    automated gameplay for groups that may not have enough players or when testing
    scenarios are required. The method likely initializes bot AI behavior, assigns
    roles within the raid, and ensures proper coordination between human and bot participants.
    It serves as a bridge between traditional player-based raid mechanics and AI-assisted
    gameplay implementations.

  - title: Basic Usage in Raid Conversion Context
    code: "void MyRaidManager::ConvertRaidToBotSystem(BotAI* botAI)\n{\n    RaidConvertedHandler\
      \ handler;\n    handler.RaidConvertedHandler(botAI);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely requires proper initialization of the BotAI system before
    execution. The conversion process may involve state changes in the raid management
    system and should be called only when a raid transition is confirmed. Implementation
    details may vary based on specific TrinityCore version and bot AI framework integration.
  warnings: Improper usage of this handler without proper BotAI initialization can
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all raid participants are properly
    registered with the bot system before invoking this method.
