  class: BotCharacterDistribution
  method: LoadFromDatabase
  signature: bool BotCharacterDistribution::LoadFromDatabase()
documentation:
  brief: Loads character distribution data from the database into memory for use in
    bot behavior management.
  description: The LoadFromDatabase method retrieves stored character distribution
    information from the TrinityCore database and initializes internal data structures
    required for managing bot character assignments. This method is typically invoked
    during server startup or when reloading bot configurations to ensure that all
    bot-related character distributions are properly loaded and available for runtime
    operations. The method performs database queries to fetch relevant distribution
    tables and populates internal caches with the retrieved data. It ensures that
    bot systems have access to up-to-date character distribution rules, which may
    include class distributions, level ranges, or other criteria used for assigning
    bots to specific character types.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the database loading process completes successfully and
    all data is properly loaded into memory; returns false if any errors occur during
    the database query execution or data parsing phase.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BotCharacterDistribution distribution;\nbool success = distribution.LoadFromDatabase();\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Proceed with bot character assignment logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the database connection is established
    and valid. It's recommended to call this method during server initialization or
    when reloading bot configurations to avoid race conditions. The method may block
    during database I/O operations, so it should not be called from time-critical
    code paths.
  warnings: Calling this method while bots are actively running may lead to inconsistent
    behavior if the internal data structures are modified mid-execution. Ensure all
    bot systems are paused or in a consistent state before invoking this method.
