  class: MistweaverMonkRefactored
  method: GetOptimalRange
  signature: float MistweaverMonkRefactored::GetOptimalRange(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal attack range for the Mistweaver Monk based
    on target distance and spell mechanics.
  description: The GetOptimalRange method determines the most effective distance at
    which the Mistweaver Monk should engage targets for maximum damage output or healing
    efficiency. This calculation considers the monk's current abilities, target position,
    and game mechanics such as spell range limitations and line-of-sight requirements.
    The method is typically used in AI decision-making processes to determine when
    to move closer to or farther from a target. It does not require any parameters
    as it internally evaluates the current state of the monk and its target.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the optimal engagement range in yards.
    A negative value may indicate an error condition or invalid target state, while
    zero typically means no valid range could be calculated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "float optimalRange = monk.GetOptimalRange();\nif (optimalRange > 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Proceed with movement or spell casting logic\n    if (monk.GetDistanceToTarget()\
      \ > optimalRange)\n        monk.MoveToTarget(optimalRange);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely incorporates internal state tracking of the monk's current
    abilities and target information. It may be called frequently during AI processing,
    so performance optimization is important. The value returned should be interpreted
    in context with other range-based calculations such as spell casting range or
    movement distance.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer passed to this method is valid before calling,
    otherwise undefined behavior may occur. The return value should always be checked
    for validity before use in distance comparisons.
