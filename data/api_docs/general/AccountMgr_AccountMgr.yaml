documentation:
  brief: Moves an AccountMgr object to another AccountMgr object, transferring ownership
    of its resources.
  description: The AccountMgr move constructor transfers the internal state and resources
    from one AccountMgr instance to another. This is a fundamental part of C++'s move
    semantics, allowing efficient resource management by avoiding unnecessary copying.
    The source object is left in a valid but unspecified state after the operation.
    In the context of TrinityCore's authentication system, this constructor may be
    used when managing account data structures during login processes or session handling,
    where moving objects can improve performance by eliminating redundant memory allocations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move AccountMgr instance
    code: 'AccountMgr sourceManager;

      // ... initialize sourceManager ...

      AccountMgr targetManager = std::move(sourceManager); // Move constructor usage'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a regular constructor. It should only be
    called with an rvalue (temporary object or explicitly moved lvalue). After calling
    this constructor, the source object should not be used unless reinitialized.
  warnings: Using this constructor on an already moved-from object may lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the source object is not accessed after being moved from.
