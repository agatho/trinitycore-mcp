  brief: Rewards honor to a player based on kill-related criteria.
  description: The _RewardHonor method is responsible for granting honor points to
    a Player object upon successful kills. This method is typically invoked during
    combat resolution when a player eliminates an enemy target. It calculates the
    appropriate honor amount based on factors such as the killed unit's level, faction,
    and other game mechanics. The method ensures that players receive proper honor
    rewards according to World of Warcraft's progression systems.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Context
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is valid

      KillRewarder rewarder;

      rewarder._RewardHonor(player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal honor calculation systems and
    may be called from combat-related event handlers. It's important to ensure that
    the Player object passed is valid and currently in a state where honor can be
    awarded.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the player object or
    game state may lead to undefined behavior or client-side desynchronization. Ensure
    that the player has not been deleted or is in an invalid combat state before invoking
    this method.
