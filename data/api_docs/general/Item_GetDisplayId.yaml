api:
  class: Item
  method: GetDisplayId
  signature: uint32 Item::GetDisplayId(const Player * owner) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the display ID of the item, which determines its visual appearance
    in the game.
  description: The GetDisplayId method retrieves the unique display ID associated
    with an Item object, which controls how the item appears to players in the game
    world. This display ID is used by the client to show the correct model and texture
    for the item. The method takes into account the owner's player data when determining
    the display ID, ensuring that the visual representation matches the player's perspective.
    This functionality is essential for proper item rendering and can affect gameplay
    mechanics such as item appearance in inventory or equipment slots.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the display ID of the item, which corresponds
    to the model and texture used by the client to render the item visually.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      uint32 displayId = item->GetDisplayId(player);

      // displayId now contains the visual ID of the item'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method may be affected by player's equipment or inventory state, and
    it's important to note that this value is not necessarily the same as the item's
    ID. The display ID can vary based on player's class, race, or other factors related
    to the item's properties.
  warnings: This method should not be called in situations where the item is not properly
    initialized or when the owner is not a valid Player object, as it may lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes.
