  method: IsSummonedBy
  signature: void CreatureAI::IsSummonedBy(WorldObject * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the creature was summoned by a specific WorldObject.
  description: The IsSummonedBy method determines whether the current creature AI
    instance was summoned by a particular WorldObject, typically used to identify
    the summoner of a creature. This method is commonly invoked during creature AI
    events such as update or combat logic to understand the relationship between summoned
    creatures and their summoners. It is part of the TrinityCore's CreatureAI system
    which manages AI behavior for creatures in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A pointer to the WorldObject that may have summoned this creature.
      This can be a Player, Creature, or GameObject depending on how the creature
      was summoned.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update method
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (IsSummonedBy(player)) {\n            // Perform\
      \ actions specific to being summoned by a player\n            DoCast(SPELL_SUMMONED_AURA);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking summoner type in combat
    code: "void MyCreatureAI::EnterCombat(Unit* who) {\n    if (IsSummonedBy(who))\
      \ {\n        // Creature was summoned by the attacker\n        Talk(SAY_SUMMONED);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of summoner relationships within
    the TrinityCore framework. It should be used carefully in performance-critical
    code paths as it may involve object reference checks. The method is typically
    called from AI event handlers and should not be used outside of AI context unless
    proper safety checks are in place.
  warnings: Ensure that param0 is a valid pointer before calling this method, as passing
    null or invalid pointers can lead to undefined behavior. This method does not
    perform any automatic cleanup or reference counting; it simply evaluates the relationship
    between the creature and its potential summoner.
