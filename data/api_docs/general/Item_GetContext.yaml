  signature: int Item::GetContext() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the context value of the item, which determines its quality and level.
  description: The GetContext method retrieves the context value associated with an
    Item object, which represents the item's quality and level in the game. This context
    value is used by TrinityCore to determine item properties such as item level,
    quality, and other characteristics that affect gameplay. The method is typically
    used during item processing and evaluation within the game mechanics. It returns
    a numeric value that corresponds to the item's context, which can be used for
    various game logic operations including item evaluation, crafting, and loot distribution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the context value of the item. This value
    typically corresponds to the item's quality level or item level, with higher values
    indicating better items. The return value may be negative in certain cases, such
    as when dealing with specific item types or when the item is not yet fully initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      int context = item->GetContext();

      // context will be a positive integer representing item quality'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in item evaluation
    code: "Item* item = GetItemFromPlayer();\nint context = item->GetContext();\n\
      if (context > 0)\n{\n    // Item is valid and has proper context\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Item may be invalid or not fully initialized\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Item class's internal API and should be used carefully.
    The context value returned by this method is typically determined during item
    initialization and can be influenced by various factors including item level,
    quality, and player's level. Performance considerations are minimal as this method
    simply returns a stored value.
  warnings: The context value may not always reflect the actual item level or quality
    in all scenarios. In some cases, especially with items that have been modified
    or crafted, the context value might be different from what is expected. Also,
    if the item object is not fully initialized, this method may return unexpected
    values.
