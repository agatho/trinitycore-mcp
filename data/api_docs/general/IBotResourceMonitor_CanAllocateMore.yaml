  class: IBotResourceMonitor
  method: CanAllocateMore
  signature: bool IBotResourceMonitor::CanAllocateMore() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether additional resources can be allocated by the bot.
  description: The CanAllocateMore method checks if the bot's resource monitor has
    sufficient capacity to allocate more resources. This is typically used in AI systems
    or resource management modules to prevent over-allocation of system resources
    such as memory, CPU cycles, or game object references. The method evaluates internal
    thresholds and current usage to make this determination. It is commonly called
    before attempting to allocate new resources to avoid exceeding system limits or
    causing performance degradation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if additional resources can be allocated; otherwise returns
    false. A return value of false indicates that the bot has reached its resource
    limit and further allocations would be unsafe or prohibited.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Allocation Check
    code: "if (botResourceMonitor->CanAllocateMore()) {\n    // Proceed with allocating\
      \ new resources\n    AllocateNewResource();\n} else {\n    // Handle resource\
      \ limit reached\n    LogWarning(\"Cannot allocate more resources: limit reached.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented as a read-only check that does not modify
    internal state. It may involve checking against configurable limits or thresholds
    defined in the bot's configuration. The implementation should be fast and thread-safe
    if used in concurrent environments.
  warnings: Do not assume that calling this method guarantees successful allocation,
    as race conditions might occur between the check and actual allocation. Always
    validate resource availability before performing allocations in multi-threaded
    scenarios.
