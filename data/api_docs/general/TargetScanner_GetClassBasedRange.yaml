  class: TargetScanner
  method: GetClassBasedRange
  signature: float TargetScanner::GetClassBasedRange() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the class-based range value used for target scanning
    in combat situations.
  description: The GetClassBasedRange method computes and returns a floating-point
    value representing the effective range threshold used by the TargetScanner class
    for identifying valid targets. This range is typically derived from the caster's
    class-specific abilities, weapon range, or spell range modifiers. The returned
    value determines how far away a target can be and still be considered valid for
    targeting purposes during combat calculations. This method is commonly used in
    AI logic to ensure that creatures or players only target enemies within their
    effective combat range.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the class-based range threshold, typically measured
    in yards or game units. This value defines the maximum distance at which a target
    can be considered valid for engagement by the scanner.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override {\n        if (!UpdateVictim())\n            return;\n\n        TargetScanner\
      \ scanner(creature);\n        float range = scanner.GetClassBasedRange();\n\
      \        \n        if (me->GetDistance(SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\
      \ > range)\n            DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely caches the computed range value to avoid recalculating
    it on every call, improving performance in high-frequency AI update loops. The
    implementation may vary based on the specific class type of the caster (e.g.,
    ranged vs melee classes).
