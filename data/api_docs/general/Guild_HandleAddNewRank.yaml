  signature: void Guild::HandleAddNewRank(WorldSession * session, std::string_view
    name)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a new rank to the guild with the specified name.
  description: The HandleAddNewRank method is responsible for adding a new rank to
    a guild. It takes a WorldSession pointer and a string view representing the name
    of the new rank. This method is typically invoked when a guild leader or officer
    attempts to create a new rank within their guild's hierarchy. The method ensures
    that the new rank is properly registered within the guild's data structure, allowing
    for future assignment to guild members. It likely performs validation checks such
    as ensuring the rank name is not empty and does not already exist in the guild's
    rank list.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession object representing the client session
      of the player attempting to add the new rank.
  - name: name
    description: String view containing the name of the new rank to be added to the
      guild. Must not be empty and should be unique within the guild's ranks.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a New Rank to Guild
    code: 'WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();

      std::string_view rankName = "Officer";

      player->GetGuild()->HandleAddNewRank(session, rankName);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the guild management functionality in TrinityCore
    and interacts with the game's internal guild data structures. It may trigger updates
    to the guild's rank list displayed in the client UI.
