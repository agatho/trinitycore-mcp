  class: Map
  method: Respawn
  signature: void Map::Respawn(SpawnObjectType type, int spawnId, int dbTrans)
documentation:
  brief: Respawns objects of a specified type with the given spawn ID on the map.
  description: The Respawn method is used to respawn game objects such as creatures
    or game objects that have been despawned or destroyed. It operates based on the
    provided spawn type and identifier, allowing for targeted respawning within the
    map's context. This functionality is essential for managing dynamic world elements
    like quest-related NPCs or interactive objects that need to reappear after a certain
    event or time period. The method may also take into account database transaction
    handling if specified.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type of spawn object to respawn, typically indicating whether
      it's a creature or game object.
  - name: spawnId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific spawn instance to be respawned.
  - name: dbTrans
    description: Database transaction handle used to ensure consistency during the
      respawn operation; can be 0 if no transaction is required.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Respawn a creature with ID 12345
    code: map->Respawn(SPAWN_TYPE_CREATURE, 12345, 0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Respawn a game object with ID 67890 using a database transaction
    code: map->Respawn(SPAWN_TYPE_GAMEOBJECT, 67890, dbTransaction);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core system when handling
    respawn timers or quest completion events. It ensures that objects are properly
    re-added to the map's active object lists and their associated AI or behavior
    scripts are initialized.
  warnings: Improper use of spawn IDs can lead to incorrect respawning or even crashes
    if the ID refers to a non-existent or improperly registered object. Always validate
    spawn IDs before calling this method.
