  class: IdleMovementFactory
  method: Create
  signature: MovementGenerator * IdleMovementFactory::Create(Unit * object) const
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new idle movement generator for the specified unit.
  description: The Create method of IdleMovementFactory is responsible for instantiating
    a MovementGenerator object that governs idle behavior for a given Unit. This factory
    pattern implementation ensures that each unit receives an appropriate movement
    generator tailored to its idle state, which typically involves no active movement
    but may include minor adjustments such as standing animations or periodic orientation
    changes. The generated MovementGenerator is designed to maintain the unit's current
    position while allowing for basic AI processing and potential transitions to other
    movement states.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a newly created MovementGenerator object that manages idle
    movement behavior for the provided unit. Returns nullptr if the creation fails
    or if the input unit is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of IdleMovementFactory::Create
    code: "Unit* player = ...; // Assume valid player pointer\nIdleMovementFactory\
      \ factory;\nMovementGenerator* idleGen = factory.Create(player);\nif (idleGen)\n\
      {\n    // Use the movement generator to set idle behavior for the unit\n   \
      \ player->SetMovementGenerator(idleGen);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the factory pattern and should be used in conjunction
    with proper memory management. The returned MovementGenerator must be properly
    initialized and assigned to a Unit's movement system to take effect. The factory
    does not perform any validation on the input unit beyond checking for null, so
    it is expected that the caller ensures the unit is valid before invoking this
    method.
  warnings: The returned MovementGenerator pointer should not be deleted directly
    by the caller as it may be managed by the game's movement system. Improper use
    of the returned pointer or failure to assign it correctly to a Unit can lead to
    undefined behavior or memory leaks.
