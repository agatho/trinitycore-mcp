  method: HasEcho
  signature: bool EchoController::HasEcho(int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific echo target exists and returns true if found, false
    otherwise.
  description: The HasEcho method determines whether a given echo target identifier
    is currently active or registered within the EchoController system. This method
    is typically used in game mechanics involving echo-based interactions, such as
    tracking player echoes, object reflections, or temporal echoes. The method takes
    a pointer to an integer representing the target identifier and performs a lookup
    operation to verify its existence. It's commonly used before attempting operations
    on echo targets to prevent invalid access or errors.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer that represents the echo target identifier
      to check for existence. This value should be a valid identifier previously registered
      with the EchoController.
  returns: Returns true if the specified echo target exists and is currently active;
    otherwise returns false. A return value of false indicates either the target was
    never registered or has been removed from the system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for echo target existence
    code: "int targetId = 12345;\nif (echoController.HasEcho(&targetId)) {\n    //\
      \ Target exists, proceed with echo-related operations\n    printf(\"Echo target\
      \ %d is active\\n\", targetId);\n} else {\n    // Target does not exist\n  \
      \  printf(\"Echo target %d is not found\\n\", targetId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using HasEcho in conditional logic for echo management
    code: "void ManageEchoTarget(int targetId) {\n    if (echoController.HasEcho(&targetId))\
      \ {\n        // Perform operations on existing echo\n        ProcessActiveEcho(targetId);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Register new echo if it doesn't exist\n        echoController.RegisterEcho(targetId);\n\
      \        ProcessNewEcho(targetId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation which may have performance implications
    if called frequently in tight loops. The target parameter should be a valid integer
    identifier that has been previously registered with the EchoController to avoid
    undefined behavior. Ensure thread safety when accessing echo targets from multiple
    threads.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the target parameter will result in undefined
    behavior. Always validate that the target identifier is valid before calling this
    method. Be aware that echo targets may be removed at any time, so checking existence
    does not guarantee continued availability during subsequent operations.
