  brief: Removes the morphed state from a unit, restoring its original appearance
  description: The DeMorph method removes any morphed state from a Unit object, returning
    it to its original form. This method is typically used when a player or creature
    needs to revert from a morphed state back to their normal appearance. The operation
    involves removing visual effects such as polymorph, disguise, or other transformation
    states that may have been applied to the unit. It is commonly used in conjunction
    with Morph methods to manage character appearance and gameplay mechanics.

  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with morph-related functions
    to manage visual state changes. It should be called carefully during gameplay
    to ensure proper synchronization of visual effects.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may cause visual inconsistencies or game state
    issues, particularly if used outside of proper context.
