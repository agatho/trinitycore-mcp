documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the account identifier associated with a given character GUID from
    the character cache.
  description: The GetCharacterAccountIdByGuid method is used to fetch the unique
    account ID that owns a specific character within the TrinityCore server environment.
    This method operates on cached data, meaning it retrieves information stored in
    memory rather than querying the database directly. It's commonly used during authentication
    and session management processes where the system needs to verify which account
    controls a particular character. The method takes a character's globally unique
    identifier (GUID) as input and returns the corresponding account ID. If the GUID
    is not found in the cache, the behavior may vary depending on implementation details
    but typically results in an invalid or zero value being returned.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the account ID (uint32) associated with the specified character
    GUID. If no matching entry exists in the cache, it returns 0, indicating either
    a missing record or an invalid GUID was provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 accountId = CharacterCache::GetCharacterAccountIdByGuid(12345);\n\
      if (accountId != 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Account ID for character is: %u\\n\", accountId);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"Character not found in cache.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses cached data which may be outdated if the underlying
    database has been modified without a cache refresh. Ensure that the character
    GUID passed to this function is valid and corresponds to an existing character
    in the server's database. This method is thread-safe when used with proper synchronization
    mechanisms.
  warnings: Using an invalid or non-existent character GUID can result in returning
    0, which might be interpreted as a valid account ID in some contexts. Always validate
    the returned value before using it for critical operations such as authentication
    checks.
