  signature: void InstanceCoordination::ApplyInstanceSpecificStrategy(Group * group,
    uint32 instanceId)
documentation:
  brief: Applies instance-specific strategies to a group based on the provided instance
    ID.
  description: The ApplyInstanceSpecificStrategy method is responsible for executing
    instance-specific logic or behaviors for a given group within a World of Warcraft
    instance. This typically involves applying custom rules, modifications, or actions
    that are unique to a particular dungeon, raid, or scenario. The method takes a
    Group object and an instance ID as parameters, allowing the system to determine
    which specific strategy should be applied. It is commonly used in TrinityCore's
    instance management system to handle special behaviors for different types of
    content such as heroic modes, mythic+ dungeons, or custom instance scripts.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object that will have instance-specific strategies
      applied. This group represents a collection of players who are part of the same
      instance.
  - name: instanceId
    description: Unique identifier for the instance where the group is located. This
      ID determines which specific strategy or behavior should be applied to the group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ApplyInstanceSpecificStrategy
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nuint32 currentInstanceId = player->GetInstanceId();\n\
      if (playerGroup && currentInstanceId)\n{\n    sInstanceCoordination->ApplyInstanceSpecificStrategy(playerGroup,\
      \ currentInstanceId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during instance entry or when a group's instance
    state changes. It may involve checking for special conditions such as player roles,
    loot settings, or encounter-specific rules. The implementation likely uses internal
    lookup tables or strategy patterns to determine the appropriate behavior based
    on the instance ID.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Also, verify that the instanceId corresponds to a valid active instance
    to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes.
