documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the action is beneficial or useful for the bot's current
    AI state
  description: The IsUseful method evaluates if a given action should be considered
    for execution based on the current state of the bot's AI. It checks various conditions
    such as resource availability, target status, and situational relevance to decide
    whether performing this action would provide meaningful benefit to the bot's behavior.
    This method is typically called during the AI decision-making process to filter
    out actions that are not currently advantageous or relevant.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the action is deemed useful or beneficial in the current
    AI context, false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (action->IsUseful(ai)) {\n    action->Execute(ai);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is crucial for efficient bot behavior as it prevents unnecessary
    or counterproductive actions. The implementation likely considers factors such
    as health status, mana levels, target distance, and combat state to make its determination.
