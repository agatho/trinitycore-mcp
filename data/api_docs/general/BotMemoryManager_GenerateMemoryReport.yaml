  class: BotMemoryManager
  method: GenerateMemoryReport
  signature: void BotMemoryManager::GenerateMemoryReport(std::string & report, uint32_t
    botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Generates a memory usage report for a specified bot, populating the provided
    string with detailed memory statistics.
  description: The GenerateMemoryReport method creates a comprehensive memory usage
    report for a specific bot identified by its GUID. This function collects and formats
    information about the bot's memory consumption, including allocated memory blocks,
    object counts, and other relevant metrics. The resulting report is stored in the
    provided string parameter, which should be pre-allocated or empty before calling
    this method. This functionality is typically used for debugging, performance monitoring,
    or administrative purposes within the TrinityCore framework to analyze bot resource
    utilization.
  parameters:
  - name: report
    description: Reference to a std::string that will be populated with the generated
      memory report. The string is cleared and filled with formatted memory statistics
      for the specified bot.
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which the memory report
      is being generated. This value must correspond to a valid existing bot within
      the system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Memory Report Generation
    code: 'std::string memoryReport;

      BotMemoryManager memoryManager;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      memoryManager.GenerateMemoryReport(memoryReport, botGuid);

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Memory Report:\n%s", memoryReport.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Memory Report for Debugging
    code: "void DebugBotMemory(uint32_t botGuid) {\n    std::string report;\n    sBotMemoryManager->GenerateMemoryReport(report,\
      \ botGuid);\n    if (!report.empty()) {\n        TC_LOG_DEBUG(LOG_FILTER_BOT,\
      \ \"Bot %u Memory Report:\\n%s\", botGuid, report.c_str());\n    } else {\n\
      \        TC_LOG_ERROR(LOG_FILTER_BOT, \"Failed to generate memory report for\
      \ bot %u\", botGuid);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and does not modify any persistent
    state. It may involve significant CPU overhead during execution as it traverses
    memory structures, so it should not be called frequently in performance-critical
    sections of code.
  warnings: The report string must be properly managed by the caller to prevent memory
    leaks or corruption. If an invalid botGuid is provided, the behavior is undefined
    and may result in crashes or corrupted data.
