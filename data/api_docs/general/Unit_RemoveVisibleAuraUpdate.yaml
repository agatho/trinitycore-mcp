documentation:
  brief: Removes a visible aura update from the unit's aura application.
  description: The RemoveVisibleAuraUpdate method is responsible for removing a specific
    aura application from the unit's visible aura list. This method is typically called
    when an aura is removed or expires, ensuring that the visual representation of
    the aura is properly updated for all nearby players. The method operates on an
    AuraApplication object which represents the application state of an aura on a
    specific unit. It ensures that the aura's visual effects are no longer displayed
    to observers and updates internal tracking structures accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura to be
      removed from visible updates. This parameter must not be null and should point
      to a valid aura application that has been previously added to the unit's aura
      list.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing a visible aura application
    code: "AuraApplication* auraApp = unit->GetAuraApplication(12345);\nif (auraApp)\n\
      {\n    unit->RemoveVisibleAuraUpdate(auraApp);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing multiple visible auras in a loop
    code: "std::list<AuraApplication*> auraApps = unit->GetVisibleAuras();\nfor (auto&\
      \ app : auraApps)\n{\n    if (app && app->GetAura()->GetSpellInfo()->Id == 67890)\n\
      \    {\n        unit->RemoveVisibleAuraUpdate(app);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the aura management system in TrinityCore and works
    in conjunction with other aura-related methods like AddVisibleAuraUpdate. It's
    important to ensure that the AuraApplication pointer passed to this method is
    valid and corresponds to an actual aura currently applied to the unit, otherwise
    undefined behavior may occur. The method updates the unit's visible aura list
    and notifies observers of the change.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer or an invalid AuraApplication object to this method
    can lead to crashes or memory corruption. Always verify that the aura application
    exists and is valid before calling this method. Additionally, ensure that you're
    not removing an aura application that's still actively being used elsewhere in
    the system.
