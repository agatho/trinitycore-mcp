  signature: void InteractionManager::HandleVendorList(Player * bot, const WorldPacket
    & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the vendor list request from a bot player, retrieving and sending
    available items for purchase.
  description: The HandleVendorList method processes a vendor list request initiated
    by a bot player in the World of Warcraft environment. It retrieves the items available
    for purchase from a specified vendor and sends them to the client as a packet.
    This method is part of the InteractionManager's functionality, which handles various
    interactions between players (especially bots) and NPCs such as vendors. The method
    typically gets invoked when a bot approaches a vendor NPC and requests to see
    what items are available for sale. It ensures that the player receives an updated
    list of vendor items, including pricing, item quality, and availability status.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot requesting the
      vendor list. This parameter is essential for identifying which character is
      making the request and ensuring proper interaction with the vendor.
  - name: packet
    description: The WorldPacket received from the client containing the vendor list
      request. This packet typically includes information such as the vendor's GUID
      or other identifying data needed to retrieve the correct item list.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot AI
    code: "void MyBotAI::OnVendorRequest(Player* bot)\n{\n    WorldPacket packet(CMSG_SELL_ITEM);\n\
      \    // Assume packet is properly initialized with vendor GUID\n    interactionManager->HandleVendorList(bot,\
      \ packet);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing Vendor List Response
    code: "void InteractionManager::HandleVendorList(Player* bot, const WorldPacket&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    if (!bot || !packet.size())\n        return;\n\n    uint64\
      \ vendorGuid = 0;\n    packet >> vendorGuid;\n\n    if (Creature* vendor = bot->GetMap()->GetCreature(vendorGuid))\n\
      \    {\n        // Send vendor items to player\n        vendor->SendVendorList(bot);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the packet contains valid vendor identification
    data. It's important to ensure that the bot has proper access rights and is within
    range of the vendor NPC before calling this method. The method may involve asynchronous
    operations depending on how the vendor list is cached or retrieved from the server.
  warnings: Improper handling of the packet or invalid vendor GUIDs can lead to client-side
    errors or disconnects. Always validate input parameters and ensure that the vendor
    exists in the current map before attempting to send a vendor list.
