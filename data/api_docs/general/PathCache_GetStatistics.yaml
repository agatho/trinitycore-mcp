  class: PathCache
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: Statistics PathCache::GetStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves pathfinding statistics from the PathCache instance.
  description: The GetStatistics method returns a Statistics object containing various
    metrics and performance data related to pathfinding operations within the PathCache.
    This includes information such as cache hit rates, memory usage, number of paths
    computed, and other diagnostic data that can be used for monitoring and optimizing
    pathfinding behavior in World of Warcraft's navigation system. The returned statistics
    are useful for developers and administrators to understand how efficiently the
    pathfinding system is operating and identify potential performance bottlenecks.
  parameters: []
  returns: A Statistics object containing detailed metrics about pathfinding operations,
    including cache performance data, memory usage statistics, and computational metrics
    that reflect the current state of the PathCache.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PathCache* cache = sMapMgr->GetPathCache();

      Statistics stats = cache->GetStatistics();

      TC_LOG_INFO("pathfinding", "Cache hits: %u, Misses: %u", stats.cacheHits, stats.cacheMisses);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for debugging and performance monitoring purposes.
    The Statistics object returned may contain volatile data that changes with each
    pathfinding operation, so repeated calls may yield different results. The implementation
    should be thread-safe as it's expected to be called from various game threads.
