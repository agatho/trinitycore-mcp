  method: DoImmediateBoundaryCheck
  signature: void Creature::DoImmediateBoundaryCheck()
documentation:
  brief: Checks creature boundaries immediately to ensure valid positioning within
    the world.
  description: This method performs an immediate boundary check on the creature to
    verify its current position is within valid limits of the game world. It ensures
    that the creature's coordinates remain within acceptable range and prevents potential
    issues such as falling through the world or being placed outside of the intended
    area. The method typically executes during movement updates or when the creature's
    position changes, helping maintain game stability and preventing exploits related
    to invalid positioning.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->DoImmediateBoundaryCheck();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine during movement
    updates. Developers should be aware that this check may trigger additional validation
    logic if the creature's position is found to be invalid, potentially leading to
    further processing or correction actions.
