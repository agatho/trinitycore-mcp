  class: TargetAssistAction
  method: EngageTarget
  signature: bool TargetAssistAction::EngageTarget(Player * bot, Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Engages a target unit for combat assistance.
  description: The EngageTarget method attempts to initiate combat engagement with
    the specified target unit on behalf of the player bot. This method is typically
    used in AI behavior trees to determine whether the bot should engage an enemy
    unit, considering factors such as target validity, distance, and combat readiness.
    The method returns true if the engagement was successfully initiated, or false
    if the engagement failed due to invalid parameters, target unavailability, or
    other constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will engage
      the target.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that represents the target to be engaged
      in combat.
  returns: Returns true if the bot successfully begins engaging the target, false
    otherwise. Failure may occur due to invalid input parameters, target being out
    of range, or target already being engaged.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Target Engagement
    code: "if (action->EngageTarget(bot, target)) {\n    // Bot has started engaging\
      \ the target\n    bot->Say(\"Engaging target!\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Failed to engage target\n    bot->Say(\"Cannot engage target.\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Target Engagement
    code: "if (target && target->IsAlive() && !bot->IsInCombat()) {\n    if (action->EngageTarget(bot,\
      \ target)) {\n        // Proceed with combat actions\n        bot->SetTarget(target->GetGUID());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TargetAssistAction class and is commonly used
    in TrinityCore's AI system to control bot behavior during combat. It assumes that
    the target unit is valid and within engagement range. The method does not perform
    any movement or attack actions directly; it merely initiates the engagement state.
  warnings: Ensure that both the bot and target pointers are valid before calling
    this method, as passing null pointers may lead to undefined behavior. Also, be
    aware that engaging a target may trigger combat-related events and AI state changes
    in the bot's behavior tree.
