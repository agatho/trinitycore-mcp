documentation:
  brief: Initializes the resource manager with a bot reference
  description: The ResourceManager constructor initializes the resource management
    system and associates it with a specific bot instance. This method sets up internal
    data structures and configurations needed for tracking and managing resources
    within the context of the provided bot. The initialization process typically involves
    allocating memory, setting default values, and establishing necessary links to
    the bot's resource requirements. This is a critical setup method that must be
    called before any resource operations can be performed on the bot.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot instance that this resource manager will manage
      resources for. Must not be null and should point to a valid bot object with
      proper initialization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic ResourceManager Initialization
    code: 'Bot* myBot = new Bot();

      ResourceManager resourceManager;

      resourceManager.ResourceManager((int*)myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per ResourceManager instance. The
    bot parameter must remain valid for the lifetime of the ResourceManager. Memory
    management considerations apply when dealing with the bot pointer.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the bot parameter will likely cause undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the bot object is properly initialized before
    passing it to this constructor.
