documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the CraftedItemAuctionConfig class with default
    values.
  description: The CraftedItemAuctionConfig constructor initializes a new instance
    of the CraftedItemAuctionConfig class. This method sets up the internal state
    of the auction configuration object, preparing it for use in crafting item auctions
    within the TrinityCore framework. The constructor typically handles memory allocation
    and initialization of member variables to their default states. In the context
    of World of Warcraft's auction house system, this class likely manages configuration
    settings related to crafted items being auctioned by players or NPCs. This method
    is called automatically when a new CraftedItemAuctionConfig object is created,
    ensuring that all necessary data structures are properly initialized before any
    auction-related operations begin.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic instantiation of CraftedItemAuctionConfig
    code: 'CraftedItemAuctionConfig config;

      // The config object is now ready for use with default settings'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating multiple auction configurations
    code: 'CraftedItemAuctionConfig config1;

      CraftedItemAuctionConfig config2;

      CraftedItemAuctionConfig config3;

      // Each configuration object is independently initialized with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization logic. It simply
    ensures that all member variables are set to their appropriate default states.
    Developers should be aware that this class likely requires additional configuration
    through setter methods or other initialization routines before it can be used
    in actual auction scenarios.
