  signature: void Unit::RemoveChannelObject(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a channel object from the unit's channel list
  description: This method removes a specific channel object from the Unit's internal
    channel list. It is used to manage channeling spells and their associated objects,
    typically when a channel spell ends or is interrupted. The method handles cleanup
    of channel-related data structures and ensures proper removal of the channel object
    from the unit's channel list. This operation is crucial for maintaining accurate
    channel state information during gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the channel object to be removed.
      This represents the object ID of the channel being removed, typically associated
      with a specific channel spell or object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Channel Removal Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->RemoveChannelObject(12345);

      // Removes channel object with GUID 12345 from the unit''s channel list'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during channel spell interruption or completion.
    The implementation involves removing the channel object from internal lists and
    updating channel-related state information. Performance considerations include
    avoiding unnecessary operations when channel objects are already removed.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to incorrect channel state tracking,
    potentially causing issues with spell mechanics or object removal. Care should
    be taken when calling this method during active channeling spells.
