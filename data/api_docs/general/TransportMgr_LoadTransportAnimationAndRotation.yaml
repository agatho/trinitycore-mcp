documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes transport animation and rotation data for all transports
    in the game world.
  description: The LoadTransportAnimationAndRotation method is responsible for loading
    and setting up animation and rotation data for all transport entities within the
    TrinityCore instance. This method typically executes during server startup or
    map loading phases to ensure that transport objects such as boats, zeppelins,
    and other moving platforms have their proper movement behaviors and visual animations
    configured. It reads from database tables containing transport-related animation
    and rotation information, processes this data, and applies it to the corresponding
    transport objects in memory. The method ensures that transports behave correctly
    according to their defined paths and timing, which is crucial for player movement
    and quest completion involving transportation mechanics.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeTransportSystem()\n{\n    sTransportMgr->LoadTransportAnimationAndRotation();\n\
      \    // Other transport initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup and map loading. It's
    important to note that this method doesn't directly handle runtime movement updates
    - it only loads the initial configuration data. The actual animation playback
    and rotation calculations are handled by other systems like the transport update
    loop.
