  class: BeastMasteryHunterRefactored
  method: ExecuteSingleTargetRotation
  signature: void BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(int *
    target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the single-target rotation logic for a Beast Mastery Hunter AI.
  description: The ExecuteSingleTargetRotation method implements the core decision-making
    logic for a Beast Mastery Hunter's single-target combat rotation. It evaluates
    the current state of the hunter, including available abilities, cooldowns, resource
    levels (focus), and target conditions to determine the optimal ability to cast
    next. This method is typically called during the AI's update cycle when targeting
    a single enemy. The implementation considers factors such as pet behavior, ability
    priority, and tactical positioning to maximize damage output or survivability
    depending on the configured playstyle.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's unique identifier
      (GUID) for the current single-target rotation. This parameter is used to identify
      which enemy unit the hunter should focus its abilities on.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MyHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        m_hunter->ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(&target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the hunter's pet is active and properly controlled.
    The target parameter must point to a valid unit GUID; otherwise, undefined behavior
    may occur. Performance is optimized for frequent calls during AI update cycles.
  warnings: Do not call this method without ensuring the hunter has a valid target
    or pet state. Incorrectly handling the target pointer can lead to crashes or incorrect
    AI behavior.
