  class: Map
  method: setGridObjectDataLoaded
  signature: void Map::setGridObjectDataLoaded(bool pLoaded, uint32 x, uint32 y)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the grid object data loaded state for a specific grid position on the
    map.
  description: This method updates the internal tracking state of whether object data
    has been loaded for a given grid coordinate (x, y) on the map. It is used internally
    by the TrinityCore server to manage memory and loading of map objects such as
    creatures, game objects, and dynamic objects within specific grid boundaries.
    The loaded state affects how the server handles queries and updates for objects
    in that grid region. This method typically gets called during map loading, unloading,
    or when object data is explicitly requested or released.
  parameters:
  - name: pLoaded
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the grid object data is considered
      loaded (true) or unloaded (false).
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the grid position, typically representing a grid
      column index within the map.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the grid position, typically representing a grid
      row index within the map.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Marking a Grid as Loaded
    code: 'Map* map = ...; // Assume valid map instance

      map->setGridObjectDataLoaded(true, 5, 10); // Mark grid (5,10) as loaded'
    language: cpp
  - title: Marking a Grid as Unloaded
    code: 'Map* map = ...; // Assume valid map instance

      map->setGridObjectDataLoaded(false, 3, 7); // Mark grid (3,7) as unloaded'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal map management system and should not
    be called directly by most game logic. It's primarily used by the core map loading/unloading
    subsystems to maintain consistency in object data state tracking across grid boundaries.
