documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the ArenaAI class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the ArenaAI
    class, providing global access to a single instance of the arena AI manager. This
    method ensures that only one ArenaAI object exists throughout the game session,
    allowing consistent management of arena-related AI behaviors and logic. The returned
    pointer can be used to access all public methods and properties of the ArenaAI
    singleton. This is commonly used in arena battlegrounds where specific AI behaviors
    need to be managed for player versus player combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single ArenaAI instance, or nullptr if the instance has
    not been initialized yet
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ArenaAI* arenaAI = ArenaAI::instance();\nif (arenaAI)\n{\n    // Use the\
      \ arena AI instance\n    arenaAI->Update();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Instance Validity
    code: "ArenaAI* ai = ArenaAI::instance();\nif (ai != nullptr)\n{\n    // Safe\
      \ to use the AI instance\n    ai->HandlePlayerEnter(player);\n}\nelse\n{\n \
      \   // Handle case where instance is not yet created\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      ArenaAI instance not initialized\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses the singleton pattern which means that all calls to instance()
    will return the same object reference. The implementation likely uses a static
    variable or similar mechanism to maintain the single instance. This is thread-safe
    in most TrinityCore implementations, but developers should be aware of potential
    race conditions during initialization if multiple threads attempt to access it
    simultaneously.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in scenarios where the arena AI system
    might not be initialized yet, as it could return nullptr. Also, since this is
    a singleton, modifying state through one reference affects all other references
    to the same instance, which can lead to unexpected behavior if not properly managed.
