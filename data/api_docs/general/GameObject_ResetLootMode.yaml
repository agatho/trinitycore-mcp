documentation:
  brief: Resets the loot mode of the GameObject to its default state.
  description: The ResetLootMode method clears any custom loot modes that have been
    set on the GameObject, restoring it to the default loot behavior. This method
    is typically used when the GameObject's loot state needs to be reset after a specific
    loot operation or when the game mechanics require resetting the loot mode for
    proper gameplay handling. It ensures that the GameObject follows standard loot
    rules and does not retain any temporary or custom loot mode settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'GameObject* go = ...;

      go->ResetLootMode();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called when resetting the loot mode is required, such
    as after a loot operation or when the GameObject needs to be reset to default
    state. It does not affect the actual loot data but only resets the internal loot
    mode state.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect loot behavior if the
    GameObject's loot mode was intentionally modified for specific gameplay purposes.
    Always ensure that resetting the loot mode aligns with game design requirements.
