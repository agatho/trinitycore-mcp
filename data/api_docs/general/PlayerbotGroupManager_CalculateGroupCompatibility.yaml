  class: PlayerbotGroupManager
  method: CalculateGroupCompatibility
  signature: float PlayerbotGroupManager::CalculateGroupCompatibility(const int &
    players)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the compatibility score for a group of players based
    on various factors such as level differences, class roles, and gear levels.
  description: The CalculateGroupCompatibility method evaluates how well a group of
    players can work together in a coordinated scenario, such as a dungeon or raid.
    It considers multiple attributes including player levels, class specializations,
    role assignments (tank, healer, damage dealer), and item level differences to
    determine a compatibility score. This score is typically used by the AI system
    to make decisions about grouping players for optimal performance. The method does
    not modify any internal state and is designed to be called frequently during group
    formation or evaluation processes. It assumes that player data has been properly
    initialized and that valid player information is available within the context
    of the group manager.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the compatibility score of the group, where
    higher values indicate better compatibility. The exact scale and interpretation
    may depend on internal implementation details but generally ranges from 0.0 (incompatible)
    to 1.0 (highly compatible).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float compatibility = playerbotGroupManager->CalculateGroupCompatibility();\n\
      if (compatibility > 0.7f)\n{\n    // Proceed with forming a group\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Highly compatible group detected.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely performance-sensitive and may involve multiple calculations
    across player attributes. It should not be called excessively in time-critical
    sections of code. The compatibility score is computed based on static player data
    and does not account for dynamic factors such as current health, mana, or temporary
    buffs.
  warnings: The method might return unexpected values if player data is incomplete
    or corrupted. Ensure that all players in the group have valid and up-to-date information
    before calling this function. Avoid using this method in scenarios where real-time
    player status changes are critical.
