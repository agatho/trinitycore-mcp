documentation:
  brief: Invoked when the boss creature engages with a target entity, initiating combat
    behavior.
  description: The _JustEngagedWith method is a virtual callback function in the BossAI
    class that is automatically called by the TrinityCore AI system when a boss creature
    begins combat with a target. This method serves as the primary entry point for
    customizing boss engagement behaviors, such as initializing combat-specific variables,
    starting combat animations, or triggering special abilities. It is typically overridden
    by derived boss AI classes to implement unique combat logic. The method does not
    take any parameters and is intended to be used for setting up initial combat state
    rather than handling specific target data.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "class MyBossAI : public BossAI\n{\npublic:\n    void _JustEngagedWith(int*\
      \ who) override\n    {\n        // Initialize combat variables\n        me->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n\
      \        // Start combat abilities\n        DoZoneInCombat();\n        // Call\
      \ parent implementation if needed\n        BossAI::_JustEngagedWith(who);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called by the core AI system during combat initiation, so
    it should not be invoked manually. It's important to call the parent implementation
    if custom logic needs to coexist with base class behavior.
