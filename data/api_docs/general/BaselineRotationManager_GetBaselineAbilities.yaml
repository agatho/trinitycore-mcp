  signature: const int * BaselineRotationManager::GetBaselineAbilities(int classId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the baseline ability IDs for a specified class.
  description: The GetBaselineAbilities method returns a constant integer array containing
    the baseline abilities associated with a given class ID. This method is typically
    used in the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation to
    fetch predefined ability sets for character classes during rotation management
    or AI decision-making processes. The returned array is managed internally and
    should not be modified by the caller. The method does not perform any validation
    on the input parameter, assuming that classId is a valid identifier within the
    game's class system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to an integer array containing baseline ability IDs
    for the specified class. The array is null-terminated and owned by the BaselineRotationManager
    instance. Returns nullptr if no abilities are defined for the given class ID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve baseline abilities for a warrior class
    code: "BaselineRotationManager rotationManager;\nint classId = 1; // Warrior\n\
      const int* abilities = rotationManager.GetBaselineAbilities(classId);\nif (abilities\
      \ != nullptr) {\n    for (int i = 0; abilities[i] != 0; ++i) {\n        std::cout\
      \ << \"Ability ID: \" << abilities[i] << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned array is static and should not be freed by the caller. The method
    assumes that classId corresponds to a valid class in the game's database and may
    return nullptr for invalid or unhandled class IDs.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid class ID may result in a null pointer
    being returned. Ensure that the class ID is validated before calling this method
    to avoid unexpected behavior.
