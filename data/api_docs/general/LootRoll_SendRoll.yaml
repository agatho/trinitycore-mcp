  signature: void LootRoll::SendRoll(const int & targetGuid, int32 rollNumber, RollVote
    rollType, const int & rollWinner)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a loot roll message to players in the group for a specific item.
  description: The SendRoll method broadcasts a loot roll notification to all group
    members who are eligible to participate in the rolling process. It informs players
    of the roll number, type of vote (need, greed, or disenchant), and optionally
    identifies the player who won the roll. This method is typically invoked during
    the loot distribution phase when an item is rolled for among group members. The
    method ensures that all relevant players receive the appropriate roll information
    in a timely manner.
  parameters:
  - name: targetGuid
    description: The GUID of the player who initiated or is associated with this roll.
      This identifies the specific player involved in the rolling process.
  - name: rollNumber
    description: A unique identifier for this particular roll, typically incrementing
      for each new item rolled on. Used to distinguish between multiple rolls during
      a single loot session.
  - name: rollType
    description: The type of roll vote being conducted. Valid values are RollVote::NEED,
      RollVote::GREED, or RollVote::DISENCHANT indicating the player's voting preference
      for the item.
  - name: rollWinner
    description: The GUID of the player who won the roll, if applicable. Set to 0
      or invalid GUID if no one has won yet or if the roll is still in progress.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LootRoll* lootRoll = new LootRoll();

      lootRoll->SendRoll(playerGuid, 12345, RollVote::NEED, 0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending Roll Winner Information
    code: 'LootRoll* lootRoll = new LootRoll();

      lootRoll->SendRoll(playerGuid, 12346, RollVote::GREED, winnerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core loot system and should only be called when
    a player's roll is being processed or announced. It does not perform any validation
    on the input parameters beyond basic type checking. The method assumes that all
    group members have already been notified about the item being rolled for.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context may result in incorrect loot
    distribution behavior. Ensure that the roll number is unique across a single loot
    session to avoid confusion. Avoid calling this method multiple times with the
    same parameters as it could cause client-side issues or duplicate notifications.
