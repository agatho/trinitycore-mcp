  class: Unit
  method: SetSpellEmpowerStage
  signature: void Unit::SetSpellEmpowerStage(int8 stage)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the spell empower stage for a unit, controlling the progression of spell
    casting.
  description: This method sets the spell empower stage for a Unit, which determines
    how far along the spell casting process the unit is. The stage parameter controls
    the progress of spell empowerment, typically used in conjunction with spell casting
    mechanics to manage the timing and progression of spells. This method is commonly
    used in custom scripts or game mechanics where precise control over spell casting
    behavior is required. It affects the unit's ability to cast spells and can influence
    the sequence of events during spell execution.
  parameters:
  - name: stage
    description: The stage value indicating the progress of spell empowerment, ranging
      from -1 to 127. Negative values typically indicate no empowerment, while positive
      values represent stages of empowerment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* target = GetUnit();\n target->SetSpellEmpowerStage(5);"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with conditional logic
    code: "Unit* target = GetUnit();\n if (target->GetSpellEmpowerStage() < 0)\n {\n\
      \     target->SetSpellEmpowerStage(10);\n }\n else\n {\n     target->SetSpellEmpowerStage(-1);\n\
      \ }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly affects spell casting
    behavior. It is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    to control the progression of spells. The stage value must be within valid range
    (-128 to 127) to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect spell casting behavior
    or even crashes if values are out of bounds. It should not be used without understanding
    of the underlying spell casting mechanics.
