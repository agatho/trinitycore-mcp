    oldCount, uint32 newCount)
documentation:
  brief: Notifies all subscribers of a change in bot population within a specific
    zone
  description: 'The PublishPopulationChanged method broadcasts an event to inform
    all registered listeners about a modification in the number of bots present in
    a given zone. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining synchronization between
    various systems that depend on current bot counts, such as dynamic quest systems,
    AI behavior adjustments, or zone-based resource management. The method takes three
    parameters: the zone identifier, the previous count of bots, and the new count
    of bots. It does not return any value but ensures that all subscribed components
    receive the updated information in a timely manner.'
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: Unique identifier for the game zone where the bot population has
      changed. This value corresponds to the ZoneDBC or similar internal zone database
      entry.
  - name: oldCount
    description: The previous number of bots present in the specified zone before
      the change occurred.
  - name: newCount
    description: The updated number of bots currently present in the specified zone
      after the change occurred.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: BotSpawnEventBus::instance().PublishPopulationChanged(1234, 5, 7);
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Population Update
    code: "void OnBotSpawned(uint32 zoneId) {\n    uint32 currentCount = GetBotCountInZone(zoneId);\n\
      \    BotSpawnEventBus::instance().PublishPopulationChanged(zoneId, currentCount\
      \ - 1, currentCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the bot spawning or despawning
    logic to ensure that other systems are aware of changes in population. It's designed
    to be efficient and non-blocking, relying on an event-driven architecture for
    communication.
