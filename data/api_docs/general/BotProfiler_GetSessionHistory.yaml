  method: GetSessionHistory
  signature: int BotProfiler::GetSessionHistory() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the session history count for the bot profiler.
  description: The GetSessionHistory method returns an integer value representing
    the number of recorded sessions in the bot profiler's history. This method is
    typically used to determine how many historical profiling entries are available
    for analysis or reporting purposes. The returned value indicates the total count
    of session records that have been tracked by the profiler, which can be useful
    for monitoring bot behavior over time and identifying patterns in gameplay. This
    method does not modify any internal state and is read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of session history entries stored in
    the bot profiler. A value of zero indicates no sessions have been recorded, while
    positive values indicate the count of available historical sessions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int sessionCount = botProfiler.GetSessionHistory();\nif (sessionCount >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Found \" << sessionCount << \" recorded sessions.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not cause any side effects
    when called. It provides a quick way to assess the profiling data volume without
    retrieving the actual session details, which could be memory-intensive for large
    datasets.
