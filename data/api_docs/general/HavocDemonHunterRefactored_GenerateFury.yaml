  class: HavocDemonHunterRefactored
  method: GenerateFury
  signature: void HavocDemonHunterRefactored::GenerateFury(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates fury for the havoc demon hunter based on the provided amount.
  description: The GenerateFury method increases the fury resource of a havoc demon
    hunter by the specified amount. This method is typically used within the context
    of combat actions or abilities that generate fury, such as melee attacks or certain
    spells. Fury is a core resource in the havoc demon hunter's gameplay loop, influencing
    ability usage and damage output. The method does not validate the input amount,
    so it's expected that callers provide appropriate values based on game mechanics
    and balance requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of fury to be generated. This value is added directly
      to the demon hunter's current fury resource. Valid values are non-negative integers,
      typically ranging from small amounts (e.g., 5-10) for basic attacks to larger
      values (e.g., 20-30) for special abilities.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Fury Generation
    code: 'HavocDemonHunterRefactored* hunter = ...;

      hunter->GenerateFury(15); // Adds 15 fury to the hunter''s resource'
    language: cpp
  - title: Fury Generation from Melee Attack
    code: 'HavocDemonHunterRefactored* hunter = ...;

      uint32 furyGain = 8;

      hunter->GenerateFury(furyGain); // Adds fury based on melee attack damage'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the fury resource without any checks or limits.
    It is assumed that the calling code handles validation and ensures that fury values
    do not exceed maximum thresholds. The implementation likely interacts with internal
    fury tracking mechanisms within the demon hunter's AI state.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'amount' parameter does not cause overflow of the fury
    resource, as this could lead to unexpected behavior or game-breaking exploits.
    This method should only be called during appropriate gameplay states where fury
    generation is valid.
