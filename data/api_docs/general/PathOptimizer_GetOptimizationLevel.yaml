  class: PathOptimizer
  method: GetOptimizationLevel
  signature: OptimizationLevel PathOptimizer::GetOptimizationLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current optimization level setting of the path optimizer.
  description: The GetOptimizationLevel method returns the OptimizationLevel enum
    value that represents the current configuration setting for how aggressively the
    path optimizer will attempt to optimize paths. This setting influences the balance
    between path quality and processing time during navigation calculations. The returned
    value indicates whether optimizations are disabled, minimally applied, or fully
    enabled based on the internal configuration of the PathOptimizer instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: An OptimizationLevel enum value indicating the current optimization level.
    Possible values typically include DISABLED, MINIMAL, and FULL, representing different
    degrees of path optimization applied by the system.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Current Optimization Level
    code: "PathOptimizer optimizer;\nOptimizationLevel level = optimizer.GetOptimizationLevel();\n\
      if (level == OptimizationLevel::FULL)\n{\n    // Full optimization is enabled\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used to query the current settings before making
    decisions about pathfinding behavior or to debug path optimization issues. The
    optimization level affects performance and path quality, with higher levels generally
    providing better paths at the cost of increased computation time.
