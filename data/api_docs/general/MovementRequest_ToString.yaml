  signature: std::string MovementRequest::ToString() const
documentation:
  brief: Converts a MovementRequest object into a human-readable string representation
    for debugging and logging purposes.
  description: The ToString method provides a formatted string output of the MovementRequest
    object's current state, including relevant movement data such as position coordinates,
    orientation, and movement flags. This method is primarily used for debugging,
    logging, or displaying movement information in development environments. It does
    not alter the internal state of the object and can be called at any time during
    the object's lifetime. The output format is designed to be consistent and informative,
    making it easier for developers to inspect movement requests without needing to
    manually access individual fields.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing a formatted representation of the MovementRequest
    object's data, including position, orientation, and movement flags in a readable
    format.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Debug Logging
    code: 'MovementRequest request;

      // ... populate request with movement data ...

      std::string logMessage = request.ToString();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("movement", "Current movement request: %s", logMessage.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: The implementation of this method typically uses standard C++ string formatting
    techniques to ensure consistent output. It is recommended to use this method only
    in debug or logging contexts, as it may have performance implications if called
    excessively in high-frequency scenarios.
