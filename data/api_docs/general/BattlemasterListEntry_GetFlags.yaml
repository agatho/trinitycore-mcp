  signature: int BattlemasterListEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flags associated with a battleground entry.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitmask
    of flags configured for a specific battleground entry in the BattlemasterListEntry.
    These flags typically define various properties and restrictions of the battleground,
    such as whether it is enabled, if it requires a minimum level, or if it supports
    specific game modes. The returned value can be used to evaluate conditions or
    determine eligibility for participation in the battleground.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the bitmask of flags associated with the battleground
    entry. Each bit in the integer corresponds to a specific flag that defines properties
    such as enabled status, level requirements, or game mode restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a battleground is enabled
    code: "BattlemasterListEntry* bgEntry = sBattlemasterListStore.LookupEntry(123);\n\
      if (bgEntry && (bgEntry->GetFlags() & 0x1)) {\n    // The battleground is enabled\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Evaluate battleground restrictions
    code: "BattlemasterListEntry* bgEntry = sBattlemasterListStore.LookupEntry(456);\n\
      int flags = bgEntry->GetFlags();\nif (flags & 0x2) {\n    // Requires a minimum\
      \ level\n}\nif (flags & 0x4) {\n    // Supports rated battlegrounds only\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flags returned by this method are typically defined in the game's database
    or configuration files. Developers should be aware that flag values may vary between
    different versions of TrinityCore and should consult the relevant documentation
    or source code for accurate flag definitions.
