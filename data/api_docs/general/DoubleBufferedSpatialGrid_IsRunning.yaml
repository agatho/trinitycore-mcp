  class: DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid
  method: IsRunning
  signature: bool DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::IsRunning() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the double-buffered spatial grid is currently running or active.
  description: The IsRunning method determines if the DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid instance
    is currently in an active state, meaning it is processing or updating its internal
    data structures. This method is typically used to verify the operational status
    of the grid before performing actions that depend on it being fully initialized
    and functional. In the context of TrinityCore's spatial indexing system, this
    can be crucial for ensuring that object tracking and visibility calculations are
    performed correctly during world updates.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid is currently running or active;
    otherwise returns false. This indicates whether the grid has been started and
    is actively processing updates.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check grid status
    code: "if (spatialGrid.IsRunning()) {\n    // Grid is active, safe to perform\
      \ operations\n    DoSomethingWithGrid();\n} else {\n    // Grid is not running,\
      \ handle accordingly\n    LogError(\"Spatial grid is not running\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a quick way to verify the operational state of the grid
    without triggering any side effects. It's commonly used in game loop logic where
    you need to ensure that spatial systems are ready before performing visibility
    or collision checks.
