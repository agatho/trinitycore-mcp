  signature: int CharacterCache::GetCharacterGuildIdByGuid(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the guild identifier associated with a character given their GUID.
  description: The GetCharacterGuildIdByGuid method is used to fetch the unique identifier
    of the guild that a specific character belongs to. This method operates on the
    character's globally unique identifier (GUID) and returns the corresponding guild
    ID if the character is part of a guild. If the character is not in any guild,
    it typically returns 0 or a special invalid value. The method is commonly used
    in game logic where guild-related operations are required, such as checking permissions,
    retrieving guild information, or managing guild activities. This operation involves
    looking up cached character data for efficiency and assumes that the character
    cache has been properly initialized with valid character data.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the guild ID of the character. A return
    value of 0 typically indicates that the character is not a member of any guild,
    or the lookup failed due to invalid GUID or missing cache data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int guildId = CharacterCache::GetCharacterGuildIdByGuid(12345);\nif (guildId\
      \ != 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Character belongs to guild with ID: \" << guildId\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"Character is not in a guild.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on cached character data, so it's important that the CharacterCache
    is properly populated before calling this function. The method is likely thread-safe
    if used with appropriate locking mechanisms in place, but performance may be impacted
    by cache misses or large datasets.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method corresponds to an existing
    character; otherwise, the behavior is undefined. Also, be aware that cached data
    might not reflect real-time changes in guild membership unless the cache is explicitly
    updated.
