documentation:
  brief: Starts a performance timer for group coordination activities.
  description: The StartPerformanceTimer method initializes a timer used to measure
    and log performance metrics related to group coordination operations within the
    TrinityCore framework. This method is typically invoked when beginning timed operations
    such as raid instance creation, loot distribution, or group member synchronization.
    It sets up internal tracking mechanisms that allow for monitoring of execution
    times and resource usage during group-related activities. The timer may be used
    in conjunction with other performance measurement methods to provide detailed
    profiling data for optimization purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GroupCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.StartPerformanceTimer();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely initializes internal timing structures and may be called
    before other group coordination operations that require performance monitoring.
    The timer's precision and resolution depend on the underlying system clock implementation
    used by TrinityCore.
