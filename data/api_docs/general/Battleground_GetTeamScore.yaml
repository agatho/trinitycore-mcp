documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the score of a specified team within the battleground.
  description: The GetTeamScore method returns the current score for a given team
    in the battleground. This method is typically used to determine the progress or
    standing of teams during active battleground matches. The teamId parameter specifies
    which team's score should be retrieved, with common values being TEAM_ALLIANCE
    (0) and TEAM_HORDE (1). The returned integer represents the number of captures
    or objectives achieved by that team, depending on the specific battleground type.
    This method is essential for UI updates, scoring displays, and determining match
    outcomes.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the score for the specified team. A positive value
    indicates the number of objectives captured or points earned by the team. The
    exact meaning of the score depends on the battleground type (e.g., capture the
    flag, arena points, etc.).
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Alliance Score
    code: 'int allianceScore = bg->GetTeamScore(TEAM_ALLIANCE);

      printf("Alliance Score: %d\n", allianceScore);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Compare Team Scores
    code: "int allianceScore = bg->GetTeamScore(TEAM_ALLIANCE);\nint hordeScore =\
      \ bg->GetTeamScore(TEAM_HORDE);\nif (allianceScore > hordeScore)\n    printf(\"\
      Alliance is winning!\\n\");\nelse if (hordeScore > allianceScore)\n    printf(\"\
      Horde is winning!\\n\");\nelse\n    printf(\"Scores are tied!\\n\");"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active battleground sessions. The
    score values may vary depending on the battleground type and game rules. For battlegrounds
    like Warsong Gulch or Arathi Basin, this represents flag captures or bases controlled,
    while for arenas it might represent points earned.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of an active battleground context as it
    may return invalid or undefined values. Ensure that the teamId parameter is valid
    (TEAM_ALLIANCE or TEAM_HORDE) to avoid unexpected behavior.
