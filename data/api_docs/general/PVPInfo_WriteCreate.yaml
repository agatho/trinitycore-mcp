  class: PVPInfo
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void PVPInfo::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player * owner, const
    Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Serializes PvP information for a player to a network packet buffer during
    creation.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the PvP-related data of a player
    into a ByteBuffer for transmission to clients. This method is typically invoked
    when a player object is initially created and sent to a client, ensuring that
    all relevant PvP statistics and flags are properly included in the packet. The
    serialized data includes information such as faction, honor points, arena points,
    and other PvP-specific attributes that define a player's current competitive status
    within the game world. This method directly influences how PvP data appears to
    players in their character sheets and combat interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: The ByteBuffer where the serialized PvP information will be written.
      This buffer is typically used for constructing network packets sent to clients.
  - name: owner
    description: The Player object whose PvP data is being serialized. This represents
      the player who owns the PvP information being written.
  - name: receiver
    description: The Player object who will receive this PvP data. Used to determine
      appropriate serialization based on viewing perspective and visibility rules.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet construction
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = ...; // some player object

      Player* receiver = ...; // another player object

      PVPInfo pvpInfo;

      pvpInfo.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);

      // ''data'' now contains serialized PvP information for network transmission'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the packet serialization system and should only be
    called during object creation or when sending updates to clients. The data written
    by this method directly affects client-side PvP displays and may influence combat
    behavior based on faction status.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of proper network packet construction
    contexts, as it may lead to malformed packets or incorrect PvP state synchronization
    between server and client.
