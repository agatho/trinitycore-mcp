documentation:
  brief: Assigns a raid role to a player within the group coordinator system
  description: The AssignRaidRole method assigns a specific GroupRole to a target
    player in the group coordinator. This method is used to manage player roles within
    a raid environment, such as designating tanks, healers, or damage dealers. The
    assignment process validates that the target player is part of the current group
    and that the role being assigned is valid for the group's configuration. The method
    returns true upon successful assignment, or false if the assignment fails due
    to invalid parameters, group membership issues, or role conflicts.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Player object that will receive the raid role assignment.
      Must be a valid player who is currently a member of the group.
  - name: role
    description: The GroupRole enum value specifying the role to assign to the target
      player. Valid roles typically include TANK, HEALER, DAMAGE, and others depending
      on the group's raid configuration.
  returns: Returns true if the raid role was successfully assigned to the target player,
    false otherwise. Failure conditions may include invalid player pointer, player
    not in group, or invalid role value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Raid Role Assignment
    code: "Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Get a valid player reference\nGroupRole\
      \ role = GroupRole::TANK;\nbool success = groupCoordinator->AssignRaidRole(targetPlayer,\
      \ role);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Role assignment successful\n    targetPlayer->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"\
      Assigned as Tank\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Role Assignment with Validation
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player reference\nif (player && player->GetGroup()\
      \ == groupCoordinator->GetGroup())\n{\n    GroupRole role = GroupRole::HEALER;\n\
      \    if (groupCoordinator->AssignRaidRole(player, role))\n    {\n        //\
      \ Successfully assigned healer role\n        LOG_INFO(\"server\", \"Player {}\
      \ assigned as healer\", player->GetName());\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      \
      \  // Assignment failed\n        LOG_ERROR(\"server\", \"Failed to assign healer\
      \ role to player {}\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal group management systems and may
    trigger UI updates or notifications to other players in the group. The method
    should only be called when the group coordinator has proper authority over the
    target player's group.
  warnings: Ensure that the target player is actually part of the group before calling
    this method, as attempting to assign roles to non-group members may result in
    undefined behavior or failure. Also verify that the GroupRole enum value is valid
    for the current raid configuration.
