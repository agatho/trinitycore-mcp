documentation:
  brief: Activates the frost rime proc effect for the associated spell or ability.
  description: The ActivateProc method triggers the activation of a frost rime proc,
    which typically applies a temporary buff or debuff related to ice-based effects.
    This method is generally called when a spell or ability that has a chance to trigger
    frost rime is successfully cast or hit. The proc may apply effects such as slowing
    movement speed, increasing damage taken, or granting immunity to certain conditions.
    It is commonly used in conjunction with aura systems and spell effect handlers
    within the TrinityCore framework.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Proc Activation
    code: 'FrostRimeTracker tracker;

      tracker.ActivateProc();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after verifying that the proc chance has
    been successfully rolled. The actual effects of the proc are handled by the underlying
    aura system and should not be manually applied.
  warnings: Calling ActivateProc without proper preconditions may result in unexpected
    behavior or errors. Ensure that all required conditions for the proc to activate
    have been met before invoking this method.
