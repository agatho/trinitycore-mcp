documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the creature can penetrate water or not.
  description: This method controls whether a creature can penetrate water during
    movement. When set to true, the creature will be unable to move through water,
    effectively preventing it from crossing water bodies. When set to false, the creature
    can freely penetrate water. This functionality is commonly used for creatures
    that should remain on land or for specific game mechanics involving water-based
    movement restrictions.
  parameters:
  - name: cannotPenetrateWater
    description: A boolean value indicating whether the creature should be prevented
      from penetrating water. True prevents penetration, false allows it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetCannotPenetrateWater(true);

      // Now creature cannot penetrate water'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the creature's movement behavior and may impact pathfinding
    calculations. The setting should be applied before movement begins to ensure proper
    effect.
