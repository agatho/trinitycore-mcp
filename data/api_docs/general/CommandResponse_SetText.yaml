documentation:
  brief: Sets the text content of the command response object
  description: The SetText method assigns a string value to the internal text storage
    of a CommandResponse object. This method is typically used in TrinityCore's command
    system to populate the response message that will be sent back to the player or
    client who executed a console or chat command. The method returns a reference
    to the same CommandResponse object, enabling method chaining for fluent interface
    patterns. This allows developers to construct command responses programmatically
    and efficiently without requiring multiple object instances.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the CommandResponse object itself, allowing for method chaining
    operations such as response.SetText("message").SetType(CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CommandResponse response;

      response.SetText("Hello, World!");

      // The response now contains the text "Hello, World!"'
    language: cpp
  - title: Method Chaining
    code: "CommandResponse response;\nresponse.SetText(\"Player not found.\")\n  \
      \  .SetType(CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM)\n    .SetColor(ChatColor::RED);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a deep copy of the input string, so modifications to
    the original string after calling SetText will not affect the stored text in the
    CommandResponse object. The method is designed to be thread-safe when used with
    proper synchronization mechanisms if multiple threads access the same CommandResponse
    instance.
  warnings: Be cautious when using large strings as input, as this may impact memory
    usage and performance. Avoid passing null or invalid string references that could
    cause undefined behavior in debug builds.
