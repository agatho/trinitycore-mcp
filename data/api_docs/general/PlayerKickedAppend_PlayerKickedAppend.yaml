  class: PlayerKickedAppend
  method: PlayerKickedAppend
  signature: void PlayerKickedAppend::PlayerKickedAppend(const int & kicker, const
    int & kickee)
documentation:
  brief: Appends a player kick event to the player's kick history with kicker and
    kickee identifiers.
  description: The PlayerKickedAppend method records a player kick event by storing
    the unique identifiers of both the player who initiated the kick (kicker) and
    the player who was kicked (kickee). This method is typically used within the TrinityCore
    framework to maintain audit logs or track player moderation actions. The method
    does not return any value but modifies internal state related to player kick history.
    It is generally invoked during server-side kick operations to ensure proper logging
    of administrative actions.
  parameters:
  - name: kicker
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who initiated the kick
      action. This should be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  - name: kickee
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who was kicked. This should
      also be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of PlayerKickedAppend
    code: 'PlayerKickedAppend kickAppender;

      uint32 kickerGUID = 12345;

      uint32 kickeeGUID = 67890;

      kickAppender.PlayerKickedAppend(kickerGUID, kickeeGUID);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger moderation or logging system. It may
    be used in conjunction with other player-related systems such as ban lists or
    warning mechanisms. The implementation should ensure thread safety if called from
    multiple threads simultaneously.
  warnings: Ensure that both kicker and kickee GUIDs are valid before calling this
    method to avoid invalid data in the kick history. Improper usage could lead to
    inconsistencies in moderation logs.
