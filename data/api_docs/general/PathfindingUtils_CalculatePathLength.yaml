  class: PathfindingUtils
  method: CalculatePathLength
  signature: float PathfindingUtils::CalculatePathLength(const int & waypoints)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total length of a path defined by waypoints.
  description: The CalculatePathLength method computes the cumulative Euclidean distance
    between a series of waypoints that define a path. This utility is commonly used
    in pathfinding systems to determine travel distances for NPCs, players, or game
    objects. The method assumes that waypoints are provided in sequential order and
    calculates the total linear distance from the first to the last point. It does
    not account for terrain elevation changes or obstacles; it only computes straight-line
    distances between consecutive points.
  parameters: []
  returns: A floating-point value representing the total length of the path in game
    units. Returns 0.0 if no waypoints are defined or if the path contains fewer than
    two points.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Length Calculation
    code: 'float pathLength = PathfindingUtils::CalculatePathLength(waypoints);

      // Assumes ''waypoints'' is a valid array of points

      std::cout << "Total path length: " << pathLength << " units" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs basic distance calculations without considering the
    actual movement constraints or terrain. For accurate navigation, consider using
    more advanced pathfinding algorithms that factor in movement costs and environmental
    obstacles.
  warnings: Ensure that waypoints are properly initialized before calling this function
    to avoid undefined behavior. The method does not validate input parameters, so
    passing invalid waypoint data may result in incorrect results.
