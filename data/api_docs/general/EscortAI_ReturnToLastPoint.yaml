  method: ReturnToLastPoint
  signature: void EscortAI::ReturnToLastPoint()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the escort AI to the last known point in the patrol path.
  description: The ReturnToLastPoint method instructs the EscortAI instance to navigate
    back to the most recently recorded position in its patrol path. This functionality
    is typically used when an escort quest or NPC movement needs to resume from a
    previous location, often after an interruption such as combat engagement or player
    interaction. The method updates the AI's internal state and initiates movement
    back towards the last saved point, ensuring continuity of the escort sequence.
    It does not require any parameters and performs no direct return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Escort Quest
    code: "void OnPlayerInteract(Player* player)\n{\n    // Assume escort has been\
      \ interrupted\n    if (escortAI)\n        escortAI->ReturnToLastPoint();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the EscortAI has previously recorded movement points
    during its patrol. If no prior points exist, behavior may be undefined or cause
    unexpected movement patterns.
  warnings: Calling ReturnToLastPoint without ensuring that a valid patrol path exists
    can lead to erratic AI behavior or potential crashes. Always verify that the escort
    AI is in a valid state before invoking this method.
