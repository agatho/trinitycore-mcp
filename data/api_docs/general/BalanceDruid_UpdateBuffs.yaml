  method: UpdateBuffs
  signature: void BalanceDruid::UpdateBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the buff states and effects for the Balance Druid character.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing all
    active buffs, debuffs, and aura effects that are currently applied to a Balance
    Druid character. This method typically iterates through the player's active auras,
    checks their durations, updates their visual states, and applies any necessary
    gameplay mechanics such as stat modifications or special abilities. It ensures
    that the druid's buff status remains synchronized with the game state and handles
    cleanup of expired effects. The method is commonly invoked during combat updates,
    periodic tick events, or when new buffs are applied to maintain accurate character
    state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void CombatUpdate()\n{\n    // Called periodically during combat\n    m_druid.UpdateBuffs();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Aura Management System
    code: "void BalanceDruid::OnAuraApply(Aura* aura)\n{\n    // Apply the aura and\
      \ then update all buffs\n    Unit::AddAura(aura);\n    UpdateBuffs();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during gameplay to ensure accurate
    buff state tracking. It may involve performance considerations when many auras
    are active, so it's recommended to optimize aura application and removal logic.
    The method is typically invoked by the core game loop or through event-driven
    systems rather than being called directly.
  warnings: Direct calls to UpdateBuffs during critical combat sequences might cause
    unexpected behavior if not properly synchronized with the game state. Avoid calling
    this method from within aura application/removal callbacks to prevent potential
    stack overflow or inconsistent state updates.
