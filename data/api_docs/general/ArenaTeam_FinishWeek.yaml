  class: ArenaTeam
  method: FinishWeek
  signature: bool ArenaTeam::FinishWeek()
documentation:
  brief: Completes the weekly arena team statistics cycle, updating ratings and resetting
    weekly data.
  description: The FinishWeek method finalizes the current weekly cycle for an arena
    team by updating player ratings based on their performance during the week, resetting
    weekly win/loss counters, and potentially adjusting the team's overall rating.
    This method is typically invoked at the end of each weekly period in World of
    Warcraft's arena system to ensure accurate ranking and statistics tracking. It
    handles internal data synchronization and may trigger updates to the database
    or in-memory structures representing the arena team's state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the weekly cycle was successfully completed and all data
    was properly updated; returns false if an error occurred during the process, such
    as failure to write to the database or invalid team state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sObjectAccessor->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\nif (team)\n\
      {\n    bool success = team->FinishWeek();\n    if (success)\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Weekly cycle completed successfully for arena team %u.\", team->GetId());\n\
      \    else\n        sLog->outError(\"Failed to complete weekly cycle for arena\
      \ team %u.\", team->GetId());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the weekly cycle is officially ending.
    It modifies internal team data structures and may involve database writes, so
    it's recommended to call this method during a safe point in the game loop or from
    a dedicated maintenance thread.
  warnings: Calling FinishWeek() outside of the proper weekly cycle context may lead
    to inconsistent arena statistics or corrupted data. Ensure that all players have
    had their weekly matches accounted for before invoking this method.
