  method: LoadConfiguration
  signature: void BotChatCommandHandler::LoadConfiguration()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads the bot chat command handler's configuration settings
    from the database or file storage.
  description: The LoadConfiguration method is responsible for initializing the internal
    configuration state of the BotChatCommandHandler class. This method typically
    reads configuration data such as command permissions, cooldown settings, response
    templates, and other behavioral parameters required for the bot to function correctly
    within the TrinityCore environment. It ensures that all necessary settings are
    loaded before the chat command handler begins processing incoming messages. The
    method may interact with the database or configuration files to retrieve stored
    settings, and it's usually called during system initialization or when configuration
    changes need to be reloaded.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Configuration Loading
    code: 'BotChatCommandHandler handler;

      handler.LoadConfiguration();

      // Configuration is now loaded and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization phase of
    the bot system. Repeated calls may cause configuration conflicts or redundant
    database reads. The method assumes that database connections are already established
    and functional.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper database connectivity will result in
    failed configuration loading, potentially causing the bot to behave unexpectedly
    or fail to respond to commands. Ensure all required database tables and fields
    exist before invoking this method.
