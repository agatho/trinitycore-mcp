documentation:
  brief: Loads reputation spillover template data from the database into memory for
    use in game mechanics.
  description: The LoadReputationSpilloverTemplate method initializes and loads reputation
    spillover configuration data from the database into memory. This data defines
    how reputation gains from one faction can spill over to other factions, which
    is a core gameplay mechanic in World of Warcraft. The method typically runs during
    server startup or reload operations to ensure that all faction spillover rules
    are properly loaded and available for runtime use. It processes entries from the
    reputation_spillover_template table in the database and stores them in internal
    data structures for fast lookup during player interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadDatabase() {\n    // Other initialization code...\n   \
      \ ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadReputationSpilloverTemplate();\n    // Continue\
      \ with other loading operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or database reload
    operations. The loaded data is used by the reputation system to determine spillover
    effects when players gain reputation with factions. It's important that this method
    completes successfully before player interactions involving reputation are allowed.
