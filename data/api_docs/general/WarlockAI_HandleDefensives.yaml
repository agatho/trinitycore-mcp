documentation:
  brief: Handles defensive spell casting for the warlock AI during combat.
  description: The HandleDefensives method is responsible for managing the automatic
    casting of defensive spells and abilities by a warlock's AI during combat situations.
    This method evaluates the current threat level, available mana, and player health
    to determine appropriate defensive actions such as casting protective buffs or
    defensive spells. It typically integrates with the overall AI decision-making
    system to ensure optimal use of defensive capabilities while maintaining offensive
    efficiency.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a defensive spell was successfully cast or queued; false
    if no suitable defensive action was available or executed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void WarlockAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (HandleDefensives())\n\
      \        return;\n    // Continue with other AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the AI's update loop and should be
    invoked before or after offensive actions to maintain proper defensive balance.
    The implementation may vary based on specific warlock specialization (Affliction,
    Demonology, Destruction) and current combat state.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called too frequently as it may cause performance
    issues due to spell checking and mana calculations. Also, avoid calling it when
    the AI unit is not in combat as it might trigger unintended defensive actions.
