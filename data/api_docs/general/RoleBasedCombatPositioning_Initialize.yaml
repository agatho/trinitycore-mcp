  class: RoleBasedCombatPositioning
  method: Initialize
  signature: void RoleBasedCombatPositioning::Initialize(PositionManager * positionMgr,
    BotThreatManager * threatMgr, FormationManager * formationMgr)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the role-based combat positioning system with required managers.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the RoleBasedCombatPositioning class
    by assigning the necessary manager objects required for combat positioning logic.
    It configures internal references to PositionManager, BotThreatManager, and FormationManager
    which are essential for determining optimal bot positioning based on role, threat
    levels, and group formation. This method must be called before any other positioning
    calculations can be performed. The initialization process ensures that all dependent
    systems are properly linked and ready for use in combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: positionMgr
    description: Pointer to the PositionManager instance that handles position-related
      calculations and updates
  - name: threatMgr
    description: Pointer to the BotThreatManager instance that manages threat levels
      and target selection for bots
  - name: formationMgr
    description: Pointer to the FormationManager instance that controls group formation
      and positioning strategies
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'RoleBasedCombatPositioning positioningSystem;

      positioningSystem.Initialize(&positionManager, &threatManager, &formationManager);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization with Null Checks
    code: "RoleBasedCombatPositioning positioningSystem;\nif (positionManager && threatManager\
      \ && formationManager)\n{\n    positioningSystem.Initialize(positionManager,\
      \ threatManager, formationManager);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle error case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs no validation on the input parameters - it is assumed
    that all pointers are valid and properly initialized. The method should only be
    called once during system setup, as subsequent calls may lead to undefined behavior
    or memory leaks. All managers must be fully functional before calling this method.
  warnings: Do not call Initialize multiple times without proper cleanup. Passing
    null pointers will likely cause crashes or undefined behavior. Ensure that all
    manager objects remain valid throughout the lifetime of the RoleBasedCombatPositioning
    instance.
