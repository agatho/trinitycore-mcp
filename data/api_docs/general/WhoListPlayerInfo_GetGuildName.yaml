documentation:
  brief: Returns the guild name of the player in the who list entry
  description: The GetGuildName method retrieves the name of the guild that the player
    belongs to, as stored in the WhoListPlayerInfo object. This method is typically
    used when processing or displaying information from the 'who' command results
    in TrinityCore. The returned string represents the full guild name, including
    any special characters or spaces. The method does not perform any validation on
    the guild name and will return an empty string if the player is not part of a
    guild. This is a constant getter method that does not modify the object state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const reference to a std::string containing the guild name of the player.
    Returns an empty string if the player is not in a guild.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "WhoListPlayerInfo playerInfo;\n// Assume playerInfo has been populated\
      \ with data\nconst std::string& guildName = playerInfo.GetGuildName();\nif (!guildName.empty())\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"Player belongs to guild: \" << guildName << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    std::cout << \"Player is not in a guild\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Who Command Output
    code: "void DisplayWhoList(const std::vector<WhoListPlayerInfo>& players) {\n\
      \    for (const auto& player : players) {\n        const std::string& guild\
      \ = player.GetGuildName();\n        std::cout << \"Name: \" << player.GetName()\
      \ \n                  << \", Guild: \" << (guild.empty() ? \"None\" : guild)\
      \ \n                  << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a const reference to avoid unnecessary copying of the
    string data. The underlying data is managed by the WhoListPlayerInfo class and
    should not be modified through this accessor. Performance is optimal as it simply
    returns a stored reference without computation.
