documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BotNpcLocationService instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotNpcLocationService class is responsible for
    releasing all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This
    includes cleaning up internal data structures, freeing dynamically allocated memory,
    and ensuring no dangling pointers remain. In the context of TrinityCore's bot
    system, this service manages NPC location data for AI-controlled characters, so
    its destruction ensures proper cleanup of bot-related NPC positioning information.
    The destructor is automatically invoked when an instance goes out of scope or
    is explicitly deleted.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    BotNpcLocationService service;\n    // ...\
      \ use service ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when service goes\
      \ out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit Deletion
    code: 'BotNpcLocationService* service = new BotNpcLocationService();

      // ... use service ...

      delete service; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is typically called automatically by the C++ runtime when
    objects go out of scope or are deleted. Developers should not manually invoke
    destructors unless implementing custom memory management patterns. The cleanup
    performed by this destructor is essential for preventing memory leaks in long-running
    applications like World of Warcraft servers.
