documentation:
  brief: Destroys a QuestTurnIn object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the QuestTurnIn class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the quest
    turn-in process. This method ensures proper resource deallocation when a QuestTurnIn
    instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, this typically occurs after a player has completed
    a quest and the associated quest turn-in data has been processed. The destructor
    may handle cleanup of internal data structures such as quest requirements, rewards,
    or temporary state information related to the quest completion.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of QuestTurnIn object
    code: "void HandleQuestComplete(Player* player, uint32 questId)\n{\n    QuestTurnIn\
      \ turnIn;\n    // ... process quest turn-in logic ...\n    // turnIn is automatically\
      \ destroyed here when it goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing object
    lifetime. In most cases, objects are destroyed automatically when they go out
    of scope or via smart pointers. TrinityCore's memory management handles most cleanup
    internally, but developers should ensure proper object lifecycle management to
    avoid resource leaks.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke this destructor in normal gameplay code as it will
    lead to undefined behavior. The destructor is automatically called by the C++
    runtime when objects are destroyed, and manual invocation can cause double-free
    errors or memory corruption.
