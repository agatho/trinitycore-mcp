  class: GuildBankRightsAndSlots
  method: GetSlots
  signature: int32 GuildBankRightsAndSlots::GetSlots() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of slots available in the guild bank for the current
    player's rights level.
  description: The GetSlots method returns the total number of slots that the player
    has access to within the guild bank based on their current guild bank rights.
    This value determines how many items can be stored in the guild bank by the player,
    considering their rank and permissions. The returned slot count is typically used
    to determine inventory capacity or to validate item placement operations. This
    method does not perform any validation or modification of the guild bank state;
    it simply reports the current access level's slot allowance.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int32 value representing the number of available guild bank slots for
    the player's current rights level. A negative value may indicate an error condition
    or invalid rights configuration, while zero typically means no access to the guild
    bank.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int32 slots = guildBankRightsAndSlots->GetSlots();\nif (slots > 0)\n{\n\
      \    printf(\"Player has %d guild bank slots available\\n\", slots);\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    printf(\"No access or error in retrieving slot count\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during player login or when accessing the
    guild bank interface to determine available capacity. It reflects the player's
    current rank and permissions within the guild, which may change dynamically. The
    value returned should be cached appropriately to avoid repeated calls in performance-sensitive
    contexts.
  warnings: Ensure that the GuildBankRightsAndSlots object is properly initialized
    before calling this method, as an uninitialized or invalid object could lead to
    undefined behavior or incorrect slot counts. Avoid relying on this value for critical
    game logic without checking for valid return states.
