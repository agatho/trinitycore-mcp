  class: LootAnalysis
  method: GetAffectedSlots
  signature: int LootAnalysis::GetAffectedSlots(const LootItem & item)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the inventory slots affected by a loot item.
  description: The GetAffectedSlots method calculates and returns the inventory slot
    indices that are impacted when a specific loot item is processed. This method
    is primarily used in the context of loot distribution systems within TrinityCore,
    where it helps determine which player inventory slots may be modified or occupied
    by the item being looted. The returned value typically represents a bitmask or
    integer identifier indicating the affected slot(s). This functionality is crucial
    for proper loot handling and inventory management during player looting events.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the affected inventory slots. The exact meaning
    of this value depends on the internal implementation, but it generally indicates
    which slots in a player's inventory are modified by the loot item. A return value
    of 0 typically means no slots are affected or an error occurred.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "LootItem item;\n// Assume item is initialized with valid loot data\nint\
      \ slots = lootAnalysis.GetAffectedSlots(item);\nif (slots > 0) {\n    // Process\
      \ affected slots\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates within the context of TrinityCore's loot system
    and interacts with player inventory management. The return value may represent
    a bitmask where each bit corresponds to a specific inventory slot, allowing multiple
    slots to be indicated in a single integer result.
  warnings: The exact meaning of the returned integer value should be verified through
    source code inspection or documentation, as it may vary depending on how TrinityCore
    implements its internal loot and inventory systems. Incorrect interpretation of
    the return value could lead to improper inventory handling.
