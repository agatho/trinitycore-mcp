  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: RecordMetric
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::RecordMetric(MetricType type, uint64_t value,
    uint32_t botGuid, const std::string & context)
documentation:
  brief: Records a performance metric for a bot with specified type, value, and contextual
    information.
  description: The RecordMetric method is used to log performance-related data for
    individual bots within the TrinityCore framework. It captures metrics such as
    processing time, memory usage, or other relevant statistics associated with bot
    behavior. The method stores this data using a combination of metric type, numerical
    value, bot identifier (GUID), and an optional context string that provides additional
    details about when or why the metric was recorded. This functionality supports
    performance monitoring and debugging capabilities for AI-driven bots in World
    of Warcraft environments.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: Specifies the type of metric being recorded, such as processing time
      or memory consumption. The value should be one of the predefined MetricType
      enumeration values.
  - name: value
    description: The numerical value associated with the metric. This is typically
      a timestamp difference, byte count, or other measurable quantity related to
      bot performance.
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which the metric is being
      recorded. This allows tracking metrics per individual bot instance.
  - name: context
    description: Optional string providing additional context about the metric, such
      as the action or function that triggered its recording. Can be empty if no extra
      information is needed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of RecordMetric
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      uint64_t startTime = getTickCount();

      // ... bot processing logic ...

      uint64_t endTime = getTickCount();

      monitor.RecordMetric(MetricType::PROCESSING_TIME, endTime - startTime, 12345,
      "Movement AI");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording memory usage metric
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      size_t memoryUsed = getCurrentMemoryUsage();

      monitor.RecordMetric(MetricType::MEMORY_USAGE, static_cast<uint64_t>(memoryUsed),
      botGuid, "Combat Routine");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger performance monitoring system designed
    to track and analyze AI behavior in TrinityCore. It may internally store metrics
    in a database or log file for later analysis. The context parameter allows developers
    to tag metrics with meaningful labels that aid in debugging and optimization.
  warnings: Ensure that the MetricType enum values are properly defined and consistent
    across all calls to avoid misinterpretation of recorded data. Avoid calling this
    method too frequently in performance-critical sections to prevent overhead from
    logging operations.
