  method: AreaTriggerEntityScript
  signature: void AreaTriggerEntityScript::AreaTriggerEntityScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an AreaTriggerEntityScript with a specified name for use in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore.
  description: The AreaTriggerEntityScript constructor initializes a new area trigger
    entity script instance with the provided name. This method is used to register
    and configure area trigger behaviors within the TrinityCore framework. The name
    parameter serves as a unique identifier for the script, allowing the game engine
    to associate specific logic with area triggers in the world. During initialization,
    the script prepares internal structures necessary for handling area trigger events
    such as player entry, exit, and activation. This constructor is typically called
    during server startup or when dynamically loading scripts into memory.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated character string that serves as the unique identifier
      for this area trigger script. The name must be unique within the scope of registered
      scripts and should follow naming conventions appropriate for TrinityCore scripting
      systems.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AreaTriggerEntityScript Initialization
    code: "class MyAreaTriggerScript : public AreaTriggerEntityScript\n{\npublic:\n\
      \    MyAreaTriggerScript() : AreaTriggerEntityScript(\"my_custom_area_trigger\"\
      )\n    {\n        // Script initialization logic here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering a Custom Area Trigger Script
    code: "#include \"ScriptMgr.h\"\n#include \"AreaTriggerEntityScript.h\"\n\nclass\
      \ ExampleAreaTriggerScript : public AreaTriggerEntityScript\n{\npublic:\n  \
      \  ExampleAreaTriggerScript() : AreaTriggerEntityScript(\"example_area_trigger\"\
      )\n    {\n        // Register area trigger event handlers here\n    }\n};\n\n\
      // In your script registration code\nvoid AddSC_example_area_trigger()\n{\n\
      \    new ExampleAreaTriggerScript();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the base class initialization sequence and should
    not be overridden unless implementing custom behavior. The name parameter is used
    internally by TrinityCore's script manager to identify and dispatch events to
    the correct script instance. Ensure that all area trigger script names are unique
    to prevent conflicts in event handling.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly from game logic or event handlers;
    it should only be invoked during class construction. Improper use of the name
    parameter may lead to script registration failures or unexpected behavior during
    area trigger activation.
