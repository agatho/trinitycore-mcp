documentation:
  brief: Deactivates the emergency mode in the obstacle avoidance manager.
  description: The DeactivateEmergencyMode method disables the emergency avoidance
    behavior within the ObstacleAvoidanceManager. This function is typically invoked
    when an AI unit or player has successfully navigated through a previously hazardous
    environment or when the system determines that emergency avoidance is no longer
    necessary. The method resets internal flags and state variables related to emergency
    mode, allowing normal movement behaviors to resume. It does not take any parameters
    and performs no return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MyAIUnit::UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (m_obstacleAvoidanceManager->IsInEmergencyMode())\n\
      \    {\n        // Perform emergency avoidance logic\n        m_obstacleAvoidanceManager->DeactivateEmergencyMode();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the system is certain that emergency
    avoidance is no longer required. Improper usage may lead to inconsistent AI behavior
    or navigation issues.
