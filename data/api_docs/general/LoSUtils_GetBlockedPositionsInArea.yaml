  class: LoSUtils
  method: GetBlockedPositionsInArea
  signature: int LoSUtils::GetBlockedPositionsInArea(const int & center, float radius,
    Map * map)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the number of blocked positions within a specified
    area radius from a given center point on a map.
  description: The GetBlockedPositionsInArea method determines how many grid positions
    are obstructed by terrain, objects, or other barriers within a circular area defined
    by a center coordinate and radius. This utility is commonly used in pathfinding
    algorithms, line-of-sight calculations, and AI behavior decisions to assess navigability
    of an area. The method operates on the provided Map instance and evaluates each
    position within the specified radius against blocking criteria such as solid terrain
    or impassable objects. It returns the count of blocked positions which can be
    used for strategic decision-making in game logic.
  parameters:
  - name: center
    description: The center point of the area to check, represented as an integer
      value (typically a grid coordinate). This parameter defines where the circular
      search area is centered.
  - name: radius
    description: The radius of the circular area to evaluate for blocked positions.
      Must be a positive floating-point number representing distance units in the
      game world.
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object on which to perform the blocking position
      check. This parameter is required and must not be null.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the total count of blocked positions
    found within the specified area. A return value of zero indicates no obstructions
    were detected in the area, while a positive number indicates the number of blocked
    grid positions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for blocked positions
    code: "int blockedCount = LoSUtils::GetBlockedPositionsInArea(100, 5.0f, mapInstance);\n\
      if (blockedCount > 0) {\n    // Handle area with obstructions\n    printf(\"\
      Found %d blocked positions in area\\n\", blockedCount);\n} else {\n    // Area\
      \ is fully navigable\n    printf(\"No obstructions found in area\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using result to determine pathfinding feasibility
    code: "const int centerPoint = 250;\nconst float searchRadius = 10.0f;\nint blockedPositions\
      \ = LoSUtils::GetBlockedPositionsInArea(centerPoint, searchRadius, playerMap);\n\
      \nif (blockedPositions > 10) {\n    // Area too obstructed for efficient pathfinding\n\
      \    printf(\"Area is highly obstructed, avoiding this region\\n\");\n} else\
      \ if (blockedPositions == 0) {\n    // Clear path available\n    printf(\"Clear\
      \ path available for movement\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Partially obstructed,\
      \ proceed with caution\n    printf(\"Area partially blocked, %d positions obstructed\\\
      n\", blockedPositions);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a grid-based evaluation of the specified area and may
    have performance implications when used in high-frequency scenarios. The center
    parameter is interpreted as a grid coordinate system, not world coordinates. For
    optimal performance, consider caching results or limiting calls to this function
    during critical pathfinding operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the map pointer passed is valid and initialized before calling
    this method, as passing a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior.
    The center parameter should be within valid grid bounds for the given map to avoid
    unexpected results.
