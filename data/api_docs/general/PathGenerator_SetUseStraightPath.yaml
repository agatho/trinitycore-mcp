  class: PathGenerator
  method: SetUseStraightPath
  signature: void PathGenerator::SetUseStraightPath(bool useStraightPath)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether to use a straight path for navigation calculations in the PathGenerator.
  description: The SetUseStraightPath method configures the PathGenerator to either
    calculate a straight-line path between two points or a more complex path that
    accounts for obstacles and terrain. When enabled, the path generator will attempt
    to create a direct route from the start position to the destination, bypassing
    any potential navigation mesh considerations. This setting affects how the pathfinding
    algorithm behaves during subsequent path calculations. The method does not validate
    the input parameter and immediately applies the setting to the internal state
    of the PathGenerator instance.
  parameters:
  - name: useStraightPath
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to use straight path calculation.
      If true, the generator will attempt to create a direct path between points.
      If false, it will consider obstacles and terrain for more accurate navigation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Straight Path Calculation
    code: 'PathGenerator pathGen;

      pathGen.SetUseStraightPath(true);

      // Subsequent path calculations will use straight paths'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Straight Path Calculation
    code: 'PathGenerator pathGen;

      pathGen.SetUseStraightPath(false);

      // Subsequent path calculations will consider obstacles and terrain'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the PathGenerator. Changes
    take effect immediately for subsequent path calculations. The setting persists
    until explicitly changed again, so it's important to manage this state appropriately
    in multi-threaded environments or when reusing PathGenerator instances.
