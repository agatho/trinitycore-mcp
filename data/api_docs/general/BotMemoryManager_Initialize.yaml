  class: BotMemoryManager
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool BotMemoryManager::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot memory manager system, setting up internal data structures
    and allocating required resources for bot memory operations.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the BotMemoryManager class for use by
    establishing necessary internal state, allocating memory pools, and configuring
    memory management parameters. This method should be called once during the initialization
    phase of the bot system before any other memory management operations are performed.
    The method performs validation checks to ensure that required dependencies are
    available and that the system has sufficient resources to operate correctly. It
    returns true upon successful initialization and false if any critical errors occur
    during setup, such as memory allocation failures or invalid configuration parameters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot memory manager was successfully initialized with
    all required resources and configurations; returns false if initialization failed
    due to resource constraints, missing dependencies, or configuration errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "BotMemoryManager memoryManager;\nbool success = memoryManager.Initialize();\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Memory manager is ready for use\n    LOG_INFO(\"server\"\
      , \"Bot memory manager initialized successfully\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ initialization failure\n    LOG_ERROR(\"server\", \"Failed to initialize bot\
      \ memory manager\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or when a new bot instance
    is created. The initialization process may involve allocating large memory blocks
    and setting up internal data structures that could impact performance during the
    first call. It's recommended to call this method early in the application lifecycle
    to avoid potential runtime errors.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to resource
    leaks or undefined behavior. This method should only be called once per BotMemoryManager
    instance, and subsequent calls may result in unexpected behavior or memory corruption.
