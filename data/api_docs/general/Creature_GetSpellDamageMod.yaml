  method: GetSpellDamageMod
  signature: float Creature::GetSpellDamageMod(int classification) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the spell damage modifier value for a creature based on its classification.
  description: This method retrieves the spell damage modifier applied to a creature's
    spell damage based on its classification. The classification parameter determines
    how the creature's spell damage is modified, typically affecting the strength
    of spells cast by the creature. This method is used in the context of World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore core to adjust spell power calculations for different creature
    types. It is commonly used in AI behavior implementations where creatures need
    to modify their spell damage based on their classification level.
  parameters:
  - name: classification
    description: The classification type of the creature, which determines how spell
      damage is modified. Valid values include normal, elite, rare, rare_elite, world_boss,
      and others depending on the game's classification system.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the spell damage modifier factor. This
    value typically ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 means no modification, and values
    less than 1.0 indicate reduced spell damage while values greater than 1.0 indicate
    increased spell damage.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "float modifier = creature->GetSpellDamageMod(CREATURE_CLASSIFICATION_NORMAL);\n\
      if (modifier > 1.0f)\n{\n    // Creature has increased spell damage\n}\nelse\
      \ if (modifier < 1.0f)\n{\n    // Creature has decreased spell damage\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other creature AI methods
    to determine how spells are modified based on classification. The method may be
    overridden or implemented differently depending on the specific creature's behavior
    and AI configuration.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it may affect spell power
    calculations for creatures, potentially leading to incorrect spell damage values
    if used improperly. This method should not be used in isolation but rather as
    part of a larger set of AI methods.
