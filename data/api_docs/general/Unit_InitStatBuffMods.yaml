documentation:
  brief: Initializes stat buff modifiers for the unit, setting up default values for
    all stats.
  description: This method initializes the stat buff modifiers for a Unit object,
    establishing baseline values for all stat-related attributes including strength,
    agility, stamina, intellect, and spirit. It ensures that the unit's stat modifiers
    are properly configured before any gameplay calculations occur. The method typically
    runs during initialization phase when the unit is first created or loaded, setting
    up default stat buff values that can be modified later through various game mechanics
    such as buffs, debuffs, or equipment changes. This initialization process is crucial
    for maintaining proper stat calculations throughout the game session.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->InitStatBuffMods();

      // This initializes all stat buff modifiers for the unit'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during unit initialization to ensure proper
    stat calculation. It typically runs once per unit instance, and subsequent modifications
    may require explicit recalculation of stat values.
