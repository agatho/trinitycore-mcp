  class: TimerTrigger
  method: SetInterval
  signature: void TimerTrigger::SetInterval(uint32 intervalMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the interval in milliseconds for the timer trigger.
  description: The SetInterval method configures the time interval at which the TimerTrigger
    will execute its associated callback or action. This interval is specified in
    milliseconds and determines how frequently the timer will fire. The timer must
    be started after setting the interval using the appropriate start method. This
    functionality is commonly used in game AI, event scheduling, and periodic task
    execution within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: intervalMs
    description: The time interval in milliseconds between timer executions. Must
      be a positive integer value. A value of zero will typically disable the timer
      or cause undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Timer Interval Setup
    code: 'TimerTrigger* trigger = new TimerTrigger();

      trigger->SetInterval(5000); // Set to fire every 5 seconds

      trigger->Start();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Timer Interval Change
    code: "void UpdateTimerInterval(Player* player, uint32 newInterval) {\n    if\
      \ (player->GetTimerTrigger()) {\n        player->GetTimerTrigger()->SetInterval(newInterval);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The timer interval is set in milliseconds and affects the frequency of execution.
    If a timer is already running when SetInterval is called, the change will take
    effect on the next cycle. The method does not validate that the interval is within
    reasonable bounds for game performance.
  warnings: Setting an interval of zero or a very small value (e.g., less than 10ms)
    may cause performance issues or unexpected behavior in the game loop. Ensure that
    timer intervals are appropriate for the intended use case to avoid overloading
    the server.
