  class: Corpse
  method: SetCorpseDynamicFlag
  signature: void Corpse::SetCorpseDynamicFlag(int dynamicFlags)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the dynamic flags of the corpse object to the specified value.
  description: The SetCorpseDynamicFlag method is used to modify the dynamic flags
    associated with a Corpse object in the TrinityCore framework. Dynamic flags are
    used to control various runtime behaviors and visual states of the corpse, such
    as whether it is visible to players, if it can be looted, or if it's subject to
    decay. This method directly updates the internal flag state of the corpse, which
    may affect how the game client renders the corpse and what actions players can
    perform on it. The method does not validate the input flags, so developers must
    ensure that only valid dynamic flag values are passed to avoid undefined behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: dynamicFlags
    description: An integer value representing the new set of dynamic flags to apply
      to the corpse. These flags control runtime behaviors such as visibility, lootability,
      and decay state. Valid values are typically defined by the game's flag constants
      (e.g., CORPSE_DYNFLAG_LOOTABLE, CORPSE_DYNFLAG_DECAYING).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set corpse as lootable
    code: 'Corpse* corpse = ...; // Assume corpse is initialized

      const int LOOTABLE_FLAG = 1;

      corpse->SetCorpseDynamicFlag(LOOTABLE_FLAG);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clear all dynamic flags
    code: 'Corpse* corpse = ...;

      corpse->SetCorpseDynamicFlag(0); // Removes all dynamic flags'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the Corpse object directly. Changes
    made via this method may not be immediately reflected in the game world until
    the next update cycle or if the corpse is explicitly sent to clients. It's recommended
    to use this method only when necessary and after verifying that flag values are
    valid for the intended behavior.
  warnings: Passing invalid or unexpected flag values may lead to undefined behavior
    or client-side rendering issues. Always ensure that dynamic flags align with expected
    game mechanics. Modifying corpse flags during active gameplay without proper synchronization
    can cause inconsistencies between server and client states.
