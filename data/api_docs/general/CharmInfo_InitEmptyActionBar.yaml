  class: CharmInfo
  method: InitEmptyActionBar
  signature: void CharmInfo::InitEmptyActionBar(bool withAttack)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an empty action bar for a charm with optional attack button.
  description: The InitEmptyActionBar method sets up a new, empty action bar for a
    charm creature. This method is typically used when creating or resetting the action
    bar state of a summoned or charmed creature. The 'withAttack' parameter determines
    whether to include a default attack button on the action bar. This functionality
    is essential for proper UI behavior in World of Warcraft's pet and minion systems,
    ensuring that creatures have a valid action bar layout even before any spells
    or abilities are assigned to it.
  parameters:
  - name: withAttack
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to initialize the action bar with
      an attack button. If true, the first slot will be reserved for the default attack
      ability; if false, only empty slots will be created.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize charm action bar with attack
    code: 'CharmInfo* charmInfo = player->GetCharmInfo();

      charmInfo->InitEmptyActionBar(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialize charm action bar without attack
    code: "CharmInfo* charmInfo = unit->GetCharmInfo();\nif (charmInfo)\n{\n    charmInfo->InitEmptyActionBar(false);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during initialization or reset of a charm's
    action bar state. It directly manipulates the internal action bar data structure
    and may affect how the client renders the charm's UI. The method does not validate
    if the charm is actually valid or active, so callers should ensure proper context
    before invoking.
  warnings: Calling this method on an invalid or uninitialized CharmInfo object will
    likely result in undefined behavior. Always verify that the CharmInfo pointer
    is valid before calling InitEmptyActionBar. Additionally, calling this method
    frequently may cause performance overhead due to UI updates.
