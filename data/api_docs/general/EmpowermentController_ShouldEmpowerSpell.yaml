  class: EmpowermentController
  method: ShouldEmpowerSpell
  signature: bool EmpowermentController::ShouldEmpowerSpell(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell should be empowered based on current player state
    and game mechanics.
  description: The ShouldEmpowerSpell method evaluates if a given spell ID qualifies
    for empowerment effects within the game's current context. This typically involves
    checking against active buffs, debuffs, player class restrictions, spell school
    restrictions, or other gameplay conditions that determine when a spell can benefit
    from empowerment mechanics. The method is commonly used in conjunction with spell
    casting logic to modify spell behavior or apply additional effects. It returns
    true if the spell meets all criteria for empowerment and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell ID should be empowered according to
    current game state and rules; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Casting Logic
    code: "if (empowermentController->ShouldEmpowerSpell(spellId)) {\n    // Apply\
      \ empowerment effects\n    ApplyEmpowermentEffects(player, spellId);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Cast normal spell\n    CastNormalSpell(player, spellId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal state tracking systems such as
    aura application, cooldown management, and class-specific spell restrictions.
    Developers should ensure that the spell ID being passed is valid and corresponds
    to an actual spell in the game database.
  warnings: Incorrect implementation of this method could lead to inconsistent empowerment
    behavior or exploits where spells are empowered when they shouldn't be. Ensure
    all conditions are properly validated before returning true.
