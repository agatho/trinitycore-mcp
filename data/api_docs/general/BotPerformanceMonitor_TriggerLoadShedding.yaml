  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: TriggerLoadShedding
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::TriggerLoadShedding(uint32 targetReduction)
documentation:
  brief: Triggers load shedding to reduce bot performance overhead by targeting a
    specified reduction percentage.
  description: The TriggerLoadShedding method is designed to dynamically adjust the
    number of active bots in a TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft server to manage
    system load. When invoked, it reduces the total number of active bots by approximately
    the specified targetReduction percentage. This mechanism helps maintain server
    performance and stability during high-load scenarios such as peak player activity
    or when bot systems are under heavy strain. The method is typically called internally
    by the BotPerformanceMonitor class based on performance metrics or system conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: targetReduction
    description: The desired percentage reduction in active bots. Valid values range
      from 0 to 100, where 0 means no reduction and 100 means all bots should be deactivated.
  returns: No return value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      monitor.TriggerLoadShedding(25); // Reduce active bots by 25%'
    language: cpp
  - title: Full Load Shedding
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      monitor.TriggerLoadShedding(100); // Deactivate all bots'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may cause temporary disruption in bot behavior as active bots
    are deactivated. It is recommended to call this method during low-activity periods
    or when system performance drops below acceptable thresholds. The actual reduction
    percentage might vary based on internal bot state tracking and system constraints.
  warnings: Calling this method with a high targetReduction value (e.g., 90%) may
    result in significant disruption of automated gameplay features. Ensure that the
    reduction is appropriate for your server's needs to avoid negatively impacting
    player experience.
