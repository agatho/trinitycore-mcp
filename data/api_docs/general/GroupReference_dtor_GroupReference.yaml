  signature: void GroupReference::~GroupReference()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a GroupReference object and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ~GroupReference destructor is called when a GroupReference object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper cleanup
    of any internal data structures or references held by the GroupReference instance.
    In the context of TrinityCore's group management system, this typically involves
    removing the reference from any internal tracking mechanisms and releasing associated
    memory or resources. The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime
    and should not be called manually.

  - title: Automatic destruction of GroupReference
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    GroupReference ref;\n    // ... use ref ...\n\
      \    // ref is automatically destroyed here when going out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime during object destruction.
    Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless implementing custom
    memory management patterns. The GroupReference class likely maintains internal
    links to group data structures, and proper cleanup ensures no dangling references
    remain.
