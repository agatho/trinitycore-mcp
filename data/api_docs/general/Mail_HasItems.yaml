  method: HasItems
  signature: bool Mail::HasItems() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the mail object contains any items.
  description: The HasItems method determines if the mail object currently has any
    items attached to it. This is a utility function commonly used in the TrinityCore
    WoW emulator to verify the presence of item attachments before processing or sending
    mail. The method returns true if at least one item is present in the mail's item
    list, and false otherwise. In World of Warcraft's context, this would typically
    be used when checking mail before allowing players to retrieve items or when validating
    mail content during transmission.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the mail object contains one or more items; returns false
    if no items are attached to the mail.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Mail* mail = new Mail();\n// ... populate mail with items ...\nif (mail->HasItems())\
      \ {\n    // Process items\n    printf(\"Mail contains items\\n\");\n} else {\n\
      \    printf(\"Mail is empty\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Mail Sending Logic
    code: "void SendMailWithItems(Player* player, MailTemplate* template) {\n    Mail*\
      \ mail = new Mail();\n    // ... populate mail ...\n    if (mail->HasItems())\
      \ {\n        // Proceed with sending mail that has items\n        player->SendMailResult(mail);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Handle case where no items are attached\n        player->SendMailResult(nullptr);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple check on the internal item list of the mail
    object and is generally fast. It's commonly used in conjunction with other mail-related
    methods like GetItems() or AddItem(). The implementation likely checks if the
    item container is empty or not, making it an O(1) operation.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only checks for the presence of items, not their
    validity or quantity. If you need to validate item data or count items, additional
    methods should be used in conjunction with HasItems().
