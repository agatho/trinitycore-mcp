  signature: void WarriorAI::ManageThreatInGroup()
documentation:
  brief: Manages threat distribution among group members for the warrior AI.
  description: The ManageThreatInGroup method is responsible for handling threat management
    within a group context for warrior AI units. This method ensures that threat is
    properly distributed among group members, preventing individual players from accumulating
    excessive threat that could disrupt group dynamics or lead to aggro issues during
    combat. It typically involves checking the current threat levels of nearby group
    members and adjusting the AI's behavior accordingly to maintain balanced threat
    distribution. The method operates within the framework of TrinityCore's AI system
    and integrates with the overall group management and combat logic.

  - title: Basic Usage in Warrior AI Context
    code: "void ExampleUsage()\n{\n    // Called internally by the warrior AI system\n\
      \    warriorAI->ManageThreatInGroup();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically as part of the warrior AI's
    update cycle. It relies on the group's threat management system and may interact
    with other AI components such as target selection and threat calculation modules.
    Developers should be aware that this method modifies internal AI state related
    to threat distribution.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by external code unless specifically
    required for custom AI behavior modifications. Improper use could lead to unexpected
    threat distribution patterns or group combat disruptions.
