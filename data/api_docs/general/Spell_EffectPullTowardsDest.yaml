  brief: Pulls target object towards the caster's position using spell effect.
  description: This method implements the spell effect that pulls a target object
    toward the caster's location, typically used in conjunction with pull spells such
    as 'Pull' or 'Grappling Hook'. It modifies the target's position to move it closer
    to the caster's current location. The effect is commonly applied during spell
    casting and can be used for various game mechanics including combat movement,
    area of effect targeting, or special abilities that require object movement towards
    the caster.
