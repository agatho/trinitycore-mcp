  signature: void QuestCompletion::HandleGameObjectObjective(Player * bot, QuestObjectiveData
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and updates quest objectives related to game object interactions
    for a player bot.
  description: The HandleGameObjectObjective method is responsible for managing quest
    progress when a player bot interacts with game objects that are part of a quest
    objective. It typically checks if the required game object has been interacted
    with, updates the quest log accordingly, and may trigger further quest events
    or rewards. This method is commonly used in automated quest completion systems
    where bots need to simulate player actions to advance quests. The method operates
    within the context of a QuestCompletion class that manages various aspects of
    quest handling for AI-controlled characters.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is performing
      the quest objective. This parameter must not be null and should represent an
      active player character with valid quest data.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing information
      about the specific game object quest objective that needs to be processed. This
      includes details such as the required game object ID, interaction type, and
      current progress state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest completion system
    code: "void QuestCompletion::ProcessQuestObjective(Player* bot, QuestObjectiveData&\
      \ objective)\n{\n    if (objective.type == QUEST_OBJECTIVE_GAMEOBJECT)\n   \
      \ {\n        HandleGameObjectObjective(bot, objective);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with bot quest handling logic
    code: "void BotQuestHandler::CompleteGameObjectQuest(Player* bot, uint32 questId)\n\
      {\n    Quest const* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(questId);\n    if (!quest)\
      \ return;\n\n    for (uint8 i = 0; i < QUEST_OBJECTIVES_COUNT; ++i)\n    {\n\
      \        if (quest->ObjectiveType[i] == QUEST_OBJECTIVE_GAMEOBJECT)\n      \
      \  {\n            QuestObjectiveData objective;\n            objective.type\
      \ = QUEST_OBJECTIVE_GAMEOBJECT;\n            objective.data = quest->ObjectiveData[i];\n\
      \            HandleGameObjectObjective(bot, objective);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot player has already been initialized with
    proper quest data and that the game object referenced in the objective exists
    in the world. The method may modify the bot's quest log and progress state directly,
    so it should be called only when appropriate for the current quest context.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring that the bot has the relevant quest
    loaded or that the game object exists can lead to undefined behavior. Always validate
    that the objective data is valid before calling this method.
