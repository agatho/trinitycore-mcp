  brief: Initializes and loads diminishing return information for spells into the
    SpellMgr system.
  description: The LoadSpellInfoDiminishing method is responsible for loading and
    initializing the diminishing return data for spells within the TrinityCore spell
    management system. This method ensures that all applicable spells have their correct
    diminishing return groups and parameters loaded from the database or configuration
    files. It typically runs during server startup or spell data initialization phases
    to prepare the system for handling spell interactions that are subject to diminishing
    returns, such as crowd control effects. The method does not require any input
    parameters and performs its operations internally within the SpellMgr class.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeSpellSystem()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->LoadSpellInfoDiminishing();\n\
      \    // Other spell initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or when reloading spell
    data. It's important to ensure that the underlying database tables containing
    diminishing return information are properly populated before calling this method.
    The method may perform database queries and should be considered as part of the
    initialization sequence.
  warnings: Calling this method after spell data has already been processed may lead
    to inconsistent behavior or data corruption. It should only be invoked during
    appropriate initialization phases, not during runtime when spells are actively
    being cast.
