documentation:
  brief: Destroys an OutdoorPvPScript instance and releases its resources.
  description: The destructor for the OutdoorPvPScript class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the script instance.
    This method is automatically invoked when an OutdoorPvPScript object goes out
    of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's Outdoor PvP
    system, this ensures that any event handlers, callbacks, or internal data structures
    associated with the script are properly disposed of to prevent memory leaks and
    maintain system stability. The destructor typically does not require explicit
    calls from user code as it is managed by the C++ runtime.

  - title: Automatic destruction of OutdoorPvPScript
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    OutdoorPvPScript* script = new OutdoorPvPScript();\n\
      \    // ... use the script ...\n    delete script; // Destructor is called here\
      \ automatically\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not perform any operations that might throw exceptions,
    as destructors are expected to be noexcept in C++. It's important to ensure that
    all derived classes properly handle their own cleanup in their destructors to
    avoid resource leaks.
