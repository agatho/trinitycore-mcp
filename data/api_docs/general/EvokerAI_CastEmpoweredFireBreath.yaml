  class: EvokerAI
  method: CastEmpoweredFireBreath
  signature: void EvokerAI::CastEmpoweredFireBreath(int * target, EmpowermentLevel
    level)
documentation:
  brief: Casts an empowered fire breath ability with the specified empowerment level
    at the given target.
  description: The CastEmpoweredFireBreath method is a core AI function for Evoker
    NPCs that executes a fire-based breath attack with enhanced damage and effects
    based on the empowerment level. This method takes a pointer to a target unit and
    an empowerment level enum to determine the strength and visual effects of the
    spell cast. The ability is typically used during combat scenarios where the evoker
    needs to unleash a powerful fire attack against enemies. The method handles targeting
    logic internally, ensuring that the spell is cast at the designated target with
    appropriate cooldowns and resource management.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target unit at which the empowered fire breath will
      be cast. Must point to a valid GameObject or Unit object. Can be null, in which
      case the AI will select a target automatically.
  - name: level
    description: EmpowermentLevel enum value that determines the power and effects
      of the fire breath spell. Valid values typically include EmpowermentLevel::None,
      EmpowermentLevel::Minor, EmpowermentLevel::Major, and EmpowermentLevel::Critical,
      each providing different damage multipliers and visual effects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with target and empowerment level
    code: "Unit* target = ai->GetVictim();\nif (target)\n{\n    ai->CastEmpoweredFireBreath(&target,\
      \ EmpowermentLevel::Major);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with automatic target selection
    code: 'Unit* target = nullptr;

      ai->CastEmpoweredFireBreath(&target, EmpowermentLevel::Critical);

      // AI will automatically select a valid target if none provided'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the EvokerAI instance has proper access to spell
    casting capabilities and that the target unit is within range. The empowerment
    level directly affects damage calculation, with higher levels providing increased
    damage and potentially additional effects such as area of effect or duration.
    Ensure that the AI's current state allows for spell casting before invoking this
    method.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for target may cause undefined behavior if the
    AI does not have proper fallback logic. The method should only be called when
    the evoker is in combat and has sufficient mana/resources to cast the spell. Calling
    this method outside of combat or during cooldown periods may result in silent
    failures.
