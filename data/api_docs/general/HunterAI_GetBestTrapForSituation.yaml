  class: HunterAI
  method: GetBestTrapForSituation
  signature: int HunterAI::GetBestTrapForSituation() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the optimal trap type for the hunter's current combat
    situation.
  description: The GetBestTrapForSituation method evaluates the hunter's current environment,
    target conditions, and available trap abilities to select the most effective trap
    type. This method considers factors such as target distance, threat level, and
    the hunter's resource availability to make an informed decision. It is typically
    used by the HunterAI class to automate trap placement decisions during combat.
    The returned value corresponds to a specific trap spell ID or type constant that
    represents the best available option for the given situation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the trap type or spell ID that is considered
    optimal for the current situation. Possible values may include constants like
    TRAP_TYPE_SNAKE, TRAP_TYPE_FREEZING, TRAP_TYPE_WOUND, etc., depending on the implementation
    and available traps in the game.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "int trapType = hunterAI->GetBestTrapForSituation();\nif (trapType > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Cast the selected trap\n    caster->CastSpell(target, trapType, true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the automated AI decision-making process for hunters.
    It should be called regularly during combat to ensure optimal trap placement decisions.
    The implementation may vary based on the specific version of TrinityCore and any
    custom modifications made to the AI system.
  warnings: The method assumes that the hunter has valid target information and sufficient
    resources (ammo, mana) to cast the selected trap. Calling this method without
    proper context or in inappropriate situations might lead to incorrect trap selection
    or failed spell casts.
