  class: AdaptiveSpawnThrottler
  method: RecordSpawnSuccess
  signature: void AdaptiveSpawnThrottler::RecordSpawnSuccess()
documentation:
  brief: Records a successful spawn event in the adaptive spawn throttling system.
  description: The RecordSpawnSuccess method is used to notify the AdaptiveSpawnThrottler
    that a spawn operation has completed successfully. This method updates internal
    tracking mechanisms to adjust future spawn rates based on historical success data.
    It plays a crucial role in TrinityCore's dynamic spawn management, helping to
    balance server performance and content availability by preventing excessive or
    rapid spawning of creatures and game objects. The method does not require any
    parameters and performs no direct return operations, but it influences the throttler's
    internal state for subsequent spawn decisions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spawn Handler
    code: "void MySpawnHandler::HandleCreatureSpawn(Creature* creature)\n{\n    //\
      \ ... spawn logic ...\n    if (creature && creature->IsAlive())\n    {\n   \
      \     sAdaptiveSpawnThrottler->RecordSpawnSuccess();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called immediately after a successful spawn operation
    to ensure accurate tracking. The throttler uses this information to adjust its
    internal counters and may influence future spawn timing decisions. It is designed
    to be thread-safe as it's typically called from various game threads during world
    updates.
  warnings: Calling this method without a preceding successful spawn operation may
    lead to incorrect throttling behavior. Ensure that the spawn was actually completed
    successfully before invoking this method, otherwise the adaptive system will misinterpret
    the spawn success rate.
