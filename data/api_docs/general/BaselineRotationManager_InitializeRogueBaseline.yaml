documentation:
  brief: Initializes the baseline rotation manager for rogue players with default
    combat behavior settings.
  description: The InitializeRogueBaseline method sets up the internal state and configuration
    for managing rogue player rotations within the TrinityCore AI system. This method
    configures default abilities, cooldowns, and priority sequences specific to rogue
    gameplay mechanics such as combo point generation, finisher usage, and utility
    abilities. It prepares the rotation manager to handle combat decisions for rogue
    characters by establishing baseline behavior patterns that can be overridden or
    modified during runtime. The initialization process ensures all necessary data
    structures are populated with default values required for proper rotation execution.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'BaselineRotationManager rotationManager;

      rotationManager.InitializeRogueBaseline();

      // Rotation manager is now ready to handle rogue combat decisions'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called once during the initialization phase of a rogue
    AI controller. The method does not perform any validation or error checking, so
    it assumes that the underlying system state is properly initialized. It's recommended
    to call this method before any combat-related rotation decisions are made.
