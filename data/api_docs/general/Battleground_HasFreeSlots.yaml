documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the battleground has available slots for new players to join.
  description: The HasFreeSlots method determines if there are still open player slots
    available in the battleground. This is used primarily during the battleground
    queue process and when attempting to add new players to an existing battleground.
    The method evaluates the current number of players against the maximum allowed
    for that specific battleground type and returns true if there is at least one
    free slot, false otherwise. This check is essential for preventing overpopulation
    in battlegrounds and maintaining game balance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if there are available slots for players to join the battleground;
    returns false if the battleground is full or if no more players can be added.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a battleground has free slots before joining
    code: "if (bg->HasFreeSlots()) {\n    // Allow player to join the battleground\n\
      \    player->AddToWorld();\n} else {\n    // Inform player that the battleground\
      \ is full\n    player->SendNotification(\"Battleground is full.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not account for reserved or queued players; it only checks
    against the current active player count. The implementation relies on internal
    tracking of player counts and maximum allowed players per battleground type.
