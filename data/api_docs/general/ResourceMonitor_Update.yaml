  class: ResourceMonitor
  method: Update
  signature: void ResourceMonitor::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the resource monitor with the specified time difference to track
    system resources.
  description: The Update method in the ResourceMonitor class is responsible for processing
    and recording system resource usage statistics based on the elapsed time since
    the last update. This method typically handles memory consumption, CPU usage,
    and other performance metrics within the TrinityCore server environment. It is
    designed to be called regularly by the game loop to maintain accurate resource
    monitoring data for performance analysis and optimization purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      value determines how much time has passed and affects the calculation of resource
      usage rates and averages.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Monitor Update Call
    code: 'ResourceMonitor* monitor = sWorld->GetResourceMonitor();

      monitor->Update(100); // Update with 100ms elapsed time'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop Update
    code: "void World::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other world updates ...\n\
      \    sWorld->GetResourceMonitor()->Update(diff);\n    // ... rest of update\
      \ logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently by the main game loop to ensure accurate
    resource tracking. The implementation likely uses internal timers and accumulators
    to compute averages over time intervals rather than instantaneous measurements.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid time values (e.g., negative numbers)
    as it may cause incorrect resource calculations or unexpected behavior in performance
    monitoring.
