  signature: void OutlawRogueRefactored::GenerateComboPoints(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates combo points for the outlaw rogue player character.
  description: The GenerateComboPoints method is responsible for adding a specified
    number of combo points to an outlaw rogue's current combo point counter. This
    method directly influences the rogue's ability to use high-damage finisher abilities
    such as Rupture, Eviscerate, or Slice and Dice. The generated combo points are
    typically awarded through specific rogue abilities, auto-attacks, or game mechanics
    that reward successful combat actions. This method does not validate the input
    amount and assumes the caller has already determined the appropriate number of
    combo points to generate based on game rules and player state.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The number of combo points to generate and add to the rogue's current
      combo point counter. Valid values are positive integers representing the quantity
      of combo points to be added.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'OutlawRogueRefactored rogue;

      rogue.GenerateComboPoints(1); // Adds one combo point'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Combo Points
    code: 'OutlawRogueRefactored rogue;

      rogue.GenerateComboPoints(5); // Adds five combo points'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the rogue's internal combo point counter. It
    is typically called from within combat-related functions or ability execution
    logic. The method does not perform any validation on the input amount, so calling
    code should ensure that the value passed is appropriate for the current game state
    and rogue class mechanics.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context may result in invalid combo
    point states. Ensure that combo points are only generated when the rogue is in
    a valid combat state or when specific game mechanics allow for their generation.
    Improper use can lead to combo point overflow or incorrect ability usage.
