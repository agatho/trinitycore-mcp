documentation:
  brief: Checks if the priest's target has a dispellable debuff
  description: The HasDispellableDebuff method evaluates whether the current target
    of the PriestAI has any debuffs that can be removed through dispel effects. This
    is commonly used in priest AI behavior to determine when to cast dispel spells
    like Abolish Disease or Mass Dispel. The method typically examines the target's
    aura state and checks for specific debuff types that are marked as dispellable
    by the game mechanics. It returns true if at least one dispellable debuff is found,
    false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current target has at least one dispellable debuff;
    otherwise returns false
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in priest AI logic
    code: "if (priestAI->HasDispellableDebuff())\n{\n    // Cast dispel spell\n  \
      \  priestAI->CastSpell(target, SPELL_ABOLISH_DISEASE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal target tracking and aura state management
    within the TrinityCore framework. It may cache results or perform quick checks
    against the target's current auras to avoid expensive computations during combat.
