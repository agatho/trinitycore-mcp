  signature: void SpellMgr::LoadSpellEnchantProcData()
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes spell enchant proc data from database entries for use
    in combat mechanics.
  description: The LoadSpellEnchantProcData method is responsible for loading spell
    enchant proc information from the database into memory. This data defines how
    certain enchantments on items can trigger spell effects when specific conditions
    are met during combat. The method typically runs during server startup or reload
    operations to ensure all enchantment proc definitions are available for active
    gameplay. It processes entries related to item enchantments and their associated
    spell triggers, making them ready for evaluation during player actions such as
    attacks or abilities. This functionality is critical for maintaining accurate
    game mechanics involving enchanted weapons and gear that have conditional spell
    effects.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeSpellManager()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->LoadSpellEnchantProcData();\n\
      \    // Spell enchant proc data is now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    reloading spell data. It's typically invoked by the core loading system and not
    meant to be called manually in gameplay code. The method may perform database
    queries and memory allocations, so it's best suited for startup or reload scenarios.
