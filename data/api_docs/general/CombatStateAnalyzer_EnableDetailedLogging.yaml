  class: CombatStateAnalyzer
  method: EnableDetailedLogging
  signature: void CombatStateAnalyzer::EnableDetailedLogging(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables detailed logging for combat state analysis within the
    CombatStateAnalyzer class.
  description: The EnableDetailedLogging method controls whether detailed logging
    is active for the CombatStateAnalyzer. When enabled, this method likely triggers
    more verbose output during combat events, which can be useful for debugging or
    monitoring player behavior in combat scenarios. This functionality is typically
    used in development or testing environments to gather additional data about combat
    interactions. The method does not require any specific preconditions and affects
    the internal logging state of the analyzer instance.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: A boolean value that determines whether detailed logging should be
      enabled (true) or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Detailed Logging
    code: 'CombatStateAnalyzer analyzer;

      analyzer.EnableDetailedLogging(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Detailed Logging
    code: 'CombatStateAnalyzer analyzer;

      analyzer.EnableDetailedLogging(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies an internal flag within the CombatStateAnalyzer
    class that controls logging verbosity. It may have performance implications if
    used excessively in production environments due to increased log output. The change
    takes effect immediately upon calling the method.
