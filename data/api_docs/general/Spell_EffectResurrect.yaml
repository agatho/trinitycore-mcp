documentation:
  brief: Resurrects the target player, restoring them to life with full health and
    mana.
  description: The EffectResurrect method handles the resurrection process for a target
    player, typically triggered by spells like 'Resurrection' or 'Redemption'. It
    restores the player to life with full health and mana, and removes any death state
    effects. This method is commonly used in spell effects that restore players to
    life after death, such as those found in priest class abilities or other resurrection-based
    spells. The method operates within the context of World of Warcraft's game mechanics
    where players can be resurrected from death by various means including direct
    resurrection spells, soulstone recovery, or other healing spells.

  - title: Basic Resurrection Usage
    code: "void Spell::EffectResurrect()\n{\n    // Implementation for resurrection\
      \ effect\n    // This method is called when a spell effect triggers resurrection\n\
      \    // It restores the target player to life with full health and mana\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called only when the spell effect is properly initialized
    and the target player is in a state that allows for resurrection. Implementation
    details include checking if the target is dead, ensuring proper mana/health restoration,
    and handling any death-related effects that need to be removed.
  warnings: The method should not be called directly without proper spell initialization.
    Care must be taken to ensure that the target player is actually dead before calling
    this method, as calling it on living players may cause unexpected behavior or
    errors in game mechanics.
