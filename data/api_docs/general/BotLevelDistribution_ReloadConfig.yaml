documentation:
  brief: Reloads the bot level distribution configuration from the database or file
    sources.
  description: The ReloadConfig method refreshes the internal configuration settings
    used by the BotLevelDistribution class. This function typically retrieves updated
    level distribution data from the game's configuration files or database tables,
    ensuring that bot behavior aligns with current server settings. It is commonly
    invoked during runtime when configuration changes are detected or manually triggered
    by administrators. The method does not require any parameters and performs no
    direct return operations; instead, it updates internal state variables that affect
    how bots are assigned levels within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: BotLevelDistribution::instance()->ReloadConfig();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully during active server operation as
    it may temporarily affect bot behavior until the new configuration is fully loaded.
    It's recommended to execute this only when no bots are actively engaged in gameplay
    to prevent unexpected level adjustments.
