  brief: Moves ownership of a BehaviorPriorityManager object to another, transferring
    all managed resources.
  description: The move assignment operator for BehaviorPriorityManager transfers
    the contents of the source object to the current object, leaving the source in
    a valid but unspecified state. This operation is typically used to efficiently
    transfer ownership of dynamically allocated resources or internal data structures
    without performing deep copies. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this
    method allows for efficient management of behavior priority lists and their associated
    data during object lifecycle operations. The operation ensures that any resources
    previously owned by the current object are properly released before acquiring
    those from the source.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current BehaviorPriorityManager object after the move
    assignment has completed, enabling method chaining.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'BehaviorPriorityManager manager1;

      // ... populate manager1 ...

      BehaviorPriorityManager manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Uses move assignment

      // manager1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Function Context
    code: "BehaviorPriorityManager createManager() {\n    BehaviorPriorityManager\
      \ mgr;\n    // ... initialize mgr ...\n    return mgr; // Move semantics enabled\n\
      }\n\nvoid useManager() {\n    auto manager = createManager(); // Move assignment\
      \ used here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented using standard move semantics, where
    resources are transferred rather than copied. It's important to note that after
    a move operation, the source object should not be used in a way that would access
    its former contents, as those resources have been moved. The implementation likely
    involves swapping internal pointers or handles and resetting the source object's
    state.
  warnings: Using the move assignment operator on an already moved-from object can
    lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that objects are not used after being moved
    from, especially in scenarios where they might be destructed or accessed again.
    This is particularly important in AI systems where resource management is critical
    for performance and stability.
