documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a score value for a given item template based on quest
    relevance and item properties.
  description: The CalculateItemScore method evaluates how relevant or valuable a
    specific item template is within the context of quest progression. It considers
    various item attributes such as item level, quality, type, and potential quest
    rewards to determine a normalized float score. This score can be used by the quest
    system to prioritize item selection for quest objectives, reward distribution,
    or NPC interaction decisions. The method does not modify any internal state and
    is designed to be a pure calculation function that provides consistent results
    given the same input parameters.
  parameters: []
  returns: A floating-point value representing the calculated relevance score of the
    item template. Higher scores typically indicate greater relevance or desirability
    for quest-related purposes, with values generally ranging from 0.0 (least relevant)
    to 1.0 (most relevant), though exact ranges may vary based on internal scoring
    logic.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "ItemTemplate const* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (itemTemplate)\n{\n    float score = questManager.CalculateItemScore(itemTemplate);\n\
      \    // Use the score for quest-related logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the quest system to evaluate item
    relevance, particularly when determining which items should be considered as potential
    quest rewards or objectives. The exact scoring algorithm may be influenced by
    factors such as item class, subclass, inventory type, and quest-specific requirements.
