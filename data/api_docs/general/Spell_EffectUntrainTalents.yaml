  brief: Untrains all talents from the player's character.
  description: This method removes all talent points from the player's character,
    effectively resetting their talent tree. It is typically used in scenarios where
    players need to retrain their talents or when a custom system requires resetting
    talent points. The method operates on the player's current talent state and clears
    all learned talents, allowing them to relearn new talents. This operation is commonly
    associated with the 'Untrain Talents' spell effect in World of Warcraft.

    receive talent resets. It may be used in conjunction with other methods like Spell::EffectResetTalents
    or Spell::EffectLearnTalents to manage talent points effectively.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can result in loss of talent points, which
    may lead to unintended gameplay consequences. Ensure that the player is not in
    combat before calling this method.
