  class: SmartAI
  method: StopFollow
  signature: void SmartAI::StopFollow(bool complete)
documentation:
  brief: Stops the current follow behavior of a SmartAI unit.
  description: The StopFollow method terminates any active follow behavior initiated
    by the SmartAI unit. This method is typically called when a creature or NPC should
    cease following a target, either because the follow has been completed or interrupted.
    The optional 'complete' parameter determines whether the follow action should
    be marked as complete, which may trigger additional events or quest progress updates
    in the game logic. When called, this method will reset internal follow state variables
    and stop any ongoing movement or tracking behavior associated with the follow
    command.
  parameters:
  - name: complete
    description: If true, marks the follow action as completed and may trigger related
      events or quest updates. If false, stops the follow without marking it as complete.
  returns: No return value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to stop following
    code: smartAI->StopFollow(false);
    language: cpp
  - title: Stop following and mark as complete
    code: smartAI->StopFollow(true);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SmartAI system used in TrinityCore for advanced
    AI behavior scripting. The implementation internally handles cleanup of follow-related
    data structures and may interact with movement handlers to stop any active pathfinding
    or movement.
  warnings: Calling StopFollow without proper context may leave the AI in an inconsistent
    state if other systems depend on the follow behavior being active. Ensure that
    this method is called only when appropriate for the current AI state.
