  signature: const QualityDistribution * BotGearFactory::GetQualityDistribution(uint32
    level) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the quality distribution data for a specified player level.
  description: The GetQualityDistribution method returns a pointer to a QualityDistribution
    object that defines how item qualities are distributed for a given player level.
    This is used internally by the bot gear factory to determine what types of items
    (common, uncommon, rare, etc.) should be generated for bots at different levels.
    The returned pointer is valid for the lifetime of the BotGearFactory instance
    and should not be freed by the caller. This method is typically called during
    bot initialization or when generating new gear to ensure that the quality distribution
    matches the appropriate level range.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to a QualityDistribution object which contains information
    about item quality probabilities for the specified level, or nullptr if no distribution
    data exists for the requested level.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const QualityDistribution* dist = factory.GetQualityDistribution(60);\n\
      if (dist)\n{\n    // Use the quality distribution data\n    uint32 commonChance\
      \ = dist->GetChanceForQuality(Quality::COMMON);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Access with Null Check
    code: "const QualityDistribution* dist = factory.GetQualityDistribution(playerLevel);\n\
      if (dist != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process quality distribution\n    for (uint32\
      \ i = 0; i < MAX_QUALITY; ++i)\n    {\n        uint32 chance = dist->GetChanceForQuality(static_cast<Quality>(i));\n\
      \        // Use chance value\n    }\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case where no\
      \ distribution is available for this level\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs a lookup based on the provided level, and may return
    nullptr if no quality distribution data exists for that specific level. The QualityDistribution
    objects are typically precomputed and cached during initialization of the BotGearFactory
    to improve performance. This method is thread-safe as long as the underlying data
    structures are not modified concurrently.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify or free the returned QualityDistribution object,
    as it is managed by the BotGearFactory instance. Accessing the returned pointer
    after the factory has been destroyed results in undefined behavior.
