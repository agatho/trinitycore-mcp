  class: RoleAssignment
  method: CalculateFlexibilityBonus
  signature: float RoleAssignment::CalculateFlexibilityBonus(Player * player, Group
    * group)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the flexibility bonus for a player based on their
    role assignment within a group.
  description: The CalculateFlexibilityBonus method determines a numerical flexibility
    bonus value for a given player within a group context. This bonus typically reflects
    how adaptable or versatile a player's role is in the group, which may influence
    gameplay mechanics such as loot distribution, experience gains, or special rewards.
    The calculation considers factors like the player's assigned role, group composition,
    and possibly other dynamic game state variables. The method requires valid Player
    and Group pointers to perform its calculations, and will return 0.0 if either
    parameter is invalid or if no flexibility bonus applies.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which the flexibility bonus is being
      calculated. Must be a valid player instance; null pointer will result in undefined
      behavior.
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the player. This parameter
      defines the group context for role assignment and flexibility calculations.
      Must be a valid group instance; null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated flexibility bonus. A positive
    value indicates an applied bonus, while zero or negative values may indicate no
    bonus or invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get a player's flexibility bonus
    code: "Player* myPlayer = ...; // Assume valid player\nGroup* myGroup = ...; //\
      \ Assume valid group\nfloat bonus = RoleAssignment::CalculateFlexibilityBonus(myPlayer,\
      \ myGroup);\nif (bonus > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Apply bonus logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using flexibility bonus in a loot distribution system
    code: "void DistributeLoot(Player* player, Group* group)\n{\n    float flexBonus\
      \ = RoleAssignment::CalculateFlexibilityBonus(player, group);\n    // Adjust\
      \ loot multiplier based on flexibility bonus\n    float lootMultiplier = 1.0f\
      \ + (flexBonus / 100.0f);\n    // Apply loot logic with adjusted multiplier\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with role assignment systems and
    may be called frequently during group activities such as raids or dungeons. It's
    important to ensure that both player and group pointers are valid before calling
    this method to prevent crashes or undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with null player or group pointers will likely cause
    a crash or undefined behavior. Always validate input parameters before invoking
    this function in production code.
