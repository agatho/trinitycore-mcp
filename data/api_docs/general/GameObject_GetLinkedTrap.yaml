  signature: GameObject * GameObject::GetLinkedTrap()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the trap GameObject linked to this game object.
  description: The GetLinkedTrap method retrieves the GameObject that is linked to
    the current GameObject as a trap. This is commonly used in the context of game
    objects that are set up to function as traps, such as those associated with quest
    objectives or trigger events. The method returns a pointer to the trap GameObject,
    which may be nullptr if no trap is linked. This functionality is essential for
    managing game object interactions and ensuring proper execution of trap-related
    mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the GameObject that represents the linked trap. If
    no trap is linked, it returns nullptr. The returned pointer can be used to access
    trap properties or trigger its activation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "GameObject* trap = go->GetLinkedTrap();\nif (trap != nullptr)\n{\n    //\
      \ Process the trap\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other GameObject methods
    that handle linked objects. It may require checking for valid pointers before
    use, as the returned GameObject might be null if no trap exists.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method on GameObjects that are not explicitly
    set up as traps; it may lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if accessed without
    proper validation.
