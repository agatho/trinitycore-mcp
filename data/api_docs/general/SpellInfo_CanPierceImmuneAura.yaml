documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell can pierce through immune aura effects
  description: This method checks if a spell can bypass or penetrate immune aura effects,
    which are typically applied by spells that prevent certain types of damage or
    effects. The function evaluates the spell's ability to ignore immunity conditions,
    particularly those related to magical effects or status ailments. It is commonly
    used in spell mechanics to determine if a spell can break through protective barriers
    or if it will be affected by immune status effects.
  parameters:
  - name: auraSpellInfo
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure of the aura that may be immune.
      This parameter defines the specific spell whose immunity status is being evaluated.
  returns: Returns true if the spell can pierce through the immune aura, false otherwise.
    The method evaluates whether the current spell's effects can bypass the immunity
    provided by the auraSpellInfo.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (spellInfo->CanPierceImmuneAura(auraSpellInfo)) {\n    // Spell can\
      \ pierce through immune\n    // Proceed with normal processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "bool result = spellInfo->CanPierceImmuneAura(&auraSpellInfo);\nif (result)\
      \ {\n    // Handle special case where spell bypasses immunity\n}\nelse {\n \
      \   // Spell is affected by immunity\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related functions
    to determine whether a spell can override immunity conditions. It may be used
    for determining if a spell can bypass protective effects such as divine immunity,
    magic immunity, or status effect immunity. Performance considerations include
    checking against the aura's spell attributes and flags.
  warnings: This method should not be used in isolation without proper context of
    the spell being evaluated. The result depends on the specific spell attributes
    and may vary based on the type of immunity being checked. Improper use can lead
    to incorrect spell behavior or game mechanics issues.
