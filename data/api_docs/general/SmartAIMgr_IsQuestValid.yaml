  signature: bool SmartAIMgr::IsQuestValid(const SmartScriptHolder & e, uint32 entry)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a quest entry is valid within the SmartAI system
  description: The IsQuestValid method checks if a given quest entry ID is recognized
    and valid within the SmartAI framework. This validation ensures that quest-related
    actions and conditions in smart scripts are properly configured before execution.
    The method typically verifies that the quest exists in the database and meets
    certain criteria for use within AI behaviors. It's commonly used during script
    initialization or when processing quest-related events to prevent runtime errors
    from invalid quest references.
  parameters:
  - name: e
    description: Reference to a SmartScriptHolder structure containing the smart script
      data being validated
  - name: entry
    description: The quest entry ID to validate against the SmartAI system's known
      quests
  returns: Returns true if the quest entry is valid and recognized by the SmartAI
    system, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that the quest does
    not exist in the database or fails validation checks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Validation
    code: "SmartScriptHolder script;\nuint32 questId = 12345;\nif (sSmartAIMgr->IsQuestValid(script,\
      \ questId)) {\n    // Proceed with quest-related AI logic\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Quest %u is valid for SmartAI processing\", questId);\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ invalid quest case\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid quest ID %u encountered in\
      \ SmartAI script\", questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in Script Processing
    code: "void ProcessSmartScript(SmartScriptHolder& holder) {\n    if (holder.questEnd\
      \ && !sSmartAIMgr->IsQuestValid(holder, holder.questEnd)) {\n        sLog->outError(\"\
      Invalid questEnd %u in smart script for entry %u\", holder.questEnd, holder.entry);\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n    // Continue with normal processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database lookups or cached validation checks
    to determine quest validity. It may be called frequently during AI script initialization
    and execution, so performance considerations should be taken into account for
    high-frequency operations.
  warnings: Using invalid quest IDs in SmartAI scripts can lead to unexpected behavior
    or runtime errors. This method should be used as a preventive measure before executing
    quest-related actions in smart scripts.
