documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and profiles AI decision-making patterns for a specified class within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The AnalyzeClassDecisionPatterns method is designed to evaluate and
    profile how AI entities make decisions based on their class type in the TrinityCore
    environment. This function likely processes behavioral data, decision trees, or
    pattern recognition algorithms to understand AI decision-making tendencies specific
    to each class. It may be used for debugging, optimization, or balancing purposes
    within the game's AI system. The method operates on a per-class basis and could
    potentially generate reports or logs detailing these patterns. No preconditions
    are known, but it likely requires valid class identifiers and an active AI subsystem.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Analyze Warrior AI Decision Patterns
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      profiler.AnalyzeClassDecisionPatterns(CLASS_WARRIOR);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger profiling system for AI behavior in
    TrinityCore. It may be used during development or debugging phases to understand
    how different class types behave under various AI decision-making scenarios. The
    implementation details are not available, so the exact profiling mechanisms remain
    speculative.
  warnings: Since this is a profiling tool, it may have performance implications when
    called frequently or on large datasets. Ensure that usage is limited to appropriate
    contexts such as development or testing environments rather than production gameplay.
