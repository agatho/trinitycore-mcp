documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown states for all abilities and talents of the feral druid
    character.
  description: The UpdateCooldownStates method is responsible for managing and updating
    the internal cooldown tracking system for a feral druid class instance. This method
    ensures that all applicable abilities, spells, and talents are properly checked
    against their current cooldown timers, resetting or updating their availability
    status as needed. It typically runs during each game tick or update cycle to maintain
    accurate state information for player actions. The method may also handle interactions
    between different cooldowns, such as those affected by haste effects or shared
    cooldown mechanics specific to feral druid gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    FeralDruidRefactored druid;\n    // ... other initialization\
      \ code ...\n    druid.UpdateCooldownStates();\n    // ... continue with game\
      \ logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat update system
    code: "class CombatSystem\n{\npublic:\n    void Update()\n    {\n        playerDruid.UpdateCooldownStates();\n\
      \        // ... process other combat events ...\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the character's update cycle and
    should not be invoked manually unless implementing custom game logic. The implementation
    may involve checking internal cooldown timers, applying haste modifiers, and updating
    spell availability flags. Performance considerations are minimal since this is
    a routine update operation.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the intended update cycle context as
    it may cause inconsistent state tracking or unexpected behavior in ability usage.
    Avoid calling it during combat processing unless specifically required for custom
    logic.
