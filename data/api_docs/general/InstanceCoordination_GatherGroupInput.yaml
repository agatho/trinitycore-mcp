  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: GatherGroupInput
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::GatherGroupInput(Group * group, const std::string
    & question)
documentation:
  brief: Gathers input from all members of a group for a specified question in an
    instance coordination context.
  description: The GatherGroupInput method collects responses or inputs from all players
    within a given group for a specific question, typically used in instance coordination
    scenarios such as raid encounters or dungeon events. This method ensures that
    all group members are queried consistently and that their responses are gathered
    for further processing. It is commonly employed in TrinityCore's instance management
    systems where player cooperation and synchronization are required for successful
    completion of content. The method operates synchronously within the group context,
    ensuring that no player's input is missed or duplicated during the gathering process.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players whose input will
      be gathered. Must not be null and must represent a valid group with active members.
  - name: question
    description: String representing the question or prompt to be presented to all
      group members. This defines what type of input is being collected from each
      player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Group* raidGroup = player->GetGroup();

      InstanceCoordination* instanceCoord = sObjectMgr->GetInstanceCoordination();

      instanceCoord->GatherGroupInput(raidGroup, "Do you accept the challenge?");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with response handling
    code: "void HandleInstanceQuestion(Player* player, const std::string& question)\n\
      {\n    Group* group = player->GetGroup();\n    if (!group || group->GetMembersCount()\
      \ < 1)\n        return;\n    \n    InstanceCoordination* coord = sObjectMgr->GetInstanceCoordination();\n\
      \    coord->GatherGroupInput(group, question);\n    // Further processing of\
      \ gathered inputs would occur here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group is valid and contains active players.
    It should only be called when instance coordination is active and appropriate
    for the current game context. The method does not handle player disconnections
    or timeouts during input gathering, which may require additional error handling
    in production code.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed to this method is valid before calling,
    as passing a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior. Also, be aware
    that this method may block execution until all group members have provided their
    input, potentially causing performance issues in large groups or high-frequency
    scenarios.
