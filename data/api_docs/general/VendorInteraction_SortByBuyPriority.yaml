documentation:
  brief: Sorts vendor items by their buy priority order for display in the player's
    vendor interface.
  description: The SortByBuyPriority method organizes the items available for purchase
    from a vendor based on their defined buy priority. This sorting ensures that items
    are presented to the player in an order that reflects their intended purchasing
    sequence, which may be influenced by factors such as item rarity, vendor stock
    limits, or custom configuration settings. The method modifies the internal ordering
    of items within the vendor interaction context without returning a value. It is
    typically invoked automatically when preparing the vendor's item list for display
    to ensure proper presentation order.

  - title: Sorting Vendor Items Before Display
    code: 'VendorInteraction vendor;

      int items = 10; // Example number of items

      vendor.SortByBuyPriority(items); // Sorts items by buy priority

      // The vendor''s item list is now ordered for display'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the internal state of the VendorInteraction class
    and modifies item ordering in-place. It does not return a new list but rather
    reorders existing data. The actual priority logic may depend on vendor configuration
    or item properties defined within the TrinityCore database.
