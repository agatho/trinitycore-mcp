api:
  class: AuctionHouse
  method: MatchesSearchCriteria
  signature: bool AuctionHouse::MatchesSearchCriteria(const AuctionItem & auction,
    const AuctionSearchQuery & query)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an auction item matches the specified search criteria.
  description: The MatchesSearchCriteria method evaluates if a given auction item
    satisfies all conditions defined in the provided search query. This function is
    used by the auction house system to filter and display relevant items based on
    user-defined filters such as item type, quality, level range, or other search
    parameters. It performs a comprehensive check against multiple criteria including
    item class, subclass, inventory type, item level, and quality to ensure accurate
    filtering. The method returns true if all specified criteria are met by the auction
    item, otherwise false.
  parameters:
  - name: auction
    description: Reference to the AuctionItem object that is being evaluated against
      the search criteria
  - name: query
    description: Reference to the AuctionSearchQuery object containing the search
      parameters and filters to match against
  returns: True if the auction item matches all criteria specified in the query, false
    otherwise. Returns false if any criterion fails to match.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "AuctionItem item;\nAuctionSearchQuery query;\n// Populate item and query\
      \ with data\nbool matches = auctionHouse->MatchesSearchCriteria(item, query);\n\
      if (matches)\n{\n    // Process matching auction item\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Filtering by Item Quality
    code: 'AuctionItem item;

      AuctionSearchQuery query;

      query.quality = 4; // Epic items only

      // Populate item with various qualities

      bool isEpic = auctionHouse->MatchesSearchCriteria(item, query);

      // Returns true only for items with quality 4 (epic)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during auction house browsing operations
    to dynamically filter results. It's performance-critical as it may be invoked
    multiple times per user interaction. The implementation likely uses early termination
    logic for efficiency, returning false immediately when any criterion fails to
    match.
  warnings: Ensure that both the auction item and search query are properly initialized
    before calling this method. Improperly configured search queries may lead to unexpected
    filtering behavior or false matches. This method does not validate input parameters,
    so callers should ensure data integrity.
