  class: BattlefieldControlZoneHandler
  method: BattlefieldControlZoneHandler
  signature: void BattlefieldControlZoneHandler::BattlefieldControlZoneHandler(Battlefield
    * bf)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a BattlefieldControlZoneHandler with a specified battlefield
    instance.
  description: The BattlefieldControlZoneHandler constructor initializes the handler
    with a given Battlefield pointer. This method sets up internal references and
    configurations necessary for managing control zones within the specified battlefield.
    It is typically called during battlefield initialization or when a new control
    zone needs to be registered with the battlefield system. The handler uses this
    reference to monitor and manage zone-related events, player interactions, and
    control state changes within the battlefield environment.
  parameters:
  - name: bf
    description: Pointer to the Battlefield instance that this handler will manage
      control zones for. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Battlefield* battlefield = sBattleFieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(12345);

      BattlefieldControlZoneHandler handler(battlefield);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any asynchronous operations. It directly
    initializes internal data structures and registers the handler with the battlefield's
    control zone management system. The Battlefield pointer must remain valid for
    the lifetime of this handler.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this constructor will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the Battlefield instance is properly initialized
    before creating a handler.
