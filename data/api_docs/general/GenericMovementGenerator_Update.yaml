  class: GenericMovementGenerator
  method: Update
  signature: bool GenericMovementGenerator::Update(Unit * param0, int param1)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the movement generator with the current unit and time delta, returning
    true if movement is still active.
  description: The Update method is responsible for advancing the state of a GenericMovementGenerator.
    It takes a pointer to a Unit object (representing the entity being moved) and
    an integer representing the time delta in milliseconds since the last update.
    This method typically handles pathfinding, position updates, and checks whether
    the movement should continue or has completed. The return value indicates if the
    generator is still actively managing movement; returning false usually means the
    movement has finished or been interrupted. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework, this method integrates with the AI system to control NPC and player
    movement behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Unit object whose movement is being updated. This
      represents the entity (player or creature) that is currently moving.
  - name: param1
    description: Time delta in milliseconds since the last update call. Used to calculate
      movement speed and timing for smooth animation.
  returns: Returns true if the movement generator is still active and should continue
    updating; false if the movement has completed or been interrupted.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement Update
    code: bool result = movementGenerator->Update(playerUnit, 100); // Update with
      100ms delta
    language: cpp
  - title: Movement Generator Loop
    code: "while (movementGenerator->Update(unit, deltaTime)) {\n    // Continue updating\
      \ until movement completes\n    processMovement();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the AI update loop or movement
    system. Developers should ensure that the Unit pointer passed in is valid and
    not null, as dereferencing an invalid pointer will cause a crash. The time delta
    parameter must be accurately calculated for smooth movement behavior.
  warnings: Never call Update with a null Unit pointer; this will lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Also, be cautious when modifying the movement state within
    this method, as it may interfere with other systems that depend on consistent
    movement updates.
