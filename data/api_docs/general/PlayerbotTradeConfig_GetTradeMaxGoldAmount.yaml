documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum gold amount allowed for trading in player bot trades
  description: The GetTradeMaxGoldAmount method retrieves the configured maximum gold
    limit that a player bot can trade during automated trading sessions. This value
    is typically defined in the TrinityCore configuration files or database settings
    and controls the upper bound of gold transactions to prevent excessive in-game
    currency manipulation. The returned value represents the maximum amount of gold
    (in copper) that can be traded in a single transaction by player bots, ensuring
    game balance and preventing exploits related to unlimited gold transfers.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the maximum gold amount (in copper) allowed
    for trading. This value is typically configured through TrinityCore's configuration
    system or database entries and defines the upper limit for automated player bot
    gold transactions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint64 maxGold = playerbotTradeConfig->GetTradeMaxGoldAmount();\nif (maxGold\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with trade logic using the maximum gold limit\n  \
      \  LOG_DEBUG(\"playerbot\", \"Maximum trade gold amount: {} copper\", maxGold);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely reads from configuration tables or cached settings within
    the TrinityCore playerbot system. The returned value should be treated as a constant
    during a session and may be overridden by specific bot behavior configurations.
