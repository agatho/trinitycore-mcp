  class: AzeriteItem
  method: SetSelectedAzeriteEssences
  signature: void AzeriteItem::SetSelectedAzeriteEssences(int specializationId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the selected Azerite essences for the specified specialization.
  description: The SetSelectedAzeriteEssences method configures the active Azerite
    essences associated with a given specialization ID. This method is typically used
    within the context of World of Warcraft's Azerite system, where players can select
    different essence combinations to enhance their character's abilities. The method
    updates internal data structures to reflect the new selection and may trigger
    UI updates or gameplay mechanics adjustments related to the chosen essences. It
    is important to note that this method does not validate the specialization ID
    or ensure the essences are valid for the given specialization; such validation
    is typically handled by other systems within TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: specializationId
    description: The unique identifier of the player's specialization. This value
      corresponds to the ID used in the game's specialization system and determines
      which set of Azerite essences should be applied.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Azerite Essences for a Warrior Specialization
    code: 'AzeriteItem* azeriteItem = player->GetAzeriteItem();

      azeriteItem->SetSelectedAzeriteEssences(73); // Arms specialization ID for Warriors'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Azerite Essence Selection Based on Player Class
    code: "uint32 specId = player->GetSpecializationId();\nAzeriteItem* azeriteItem\
      \ = player->GetAzeriteItem();\nif (azeriteItem)\n{\n    azeriteItem->SetSelectedAzeriteEssences(specId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state related to Azerite item selections and
    should be called only when the player's specialization or essence configuration
    is intended to change. It does not directly update the database or send packets
    to clients; other systems are responsible for synchronizing these changes across
    the game world.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the specialization ID
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect gameplay effects. Ensure that the
    provided specialization ID corresponds to a valid and active specialization before
    invoking this method.
