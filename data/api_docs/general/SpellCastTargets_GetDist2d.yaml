documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the 2D distance from the caster to the target of a
    spell cast.
  description: The GetDist2d method computes the horizontal (2D) distance between
    the caster and the target of a spell cast. This is typically used in spell validation,
    targeting logic, and range checks within the TrinityCore framework. The calculation
    excludes vertical distance (Z-coordinate), focusing only on the X and Y coordinates.
    This method is commonly invoked during spell preparation and execution to ensure
    targets are within valid casting ranges. It assumes that the SpellCastTargets
    object has been properly initialized with valid caster and target information.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the 2D distance in yards between the caster
    and the target. Returns 0.0f if either the caster or target is invalid, or if
    no target has been set.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check spell range
    code: "SpellCastTargets targets;\n// ... initialize targets with caster and target\
      \ ...\nfloat distance = targets.GetDist2d();\nif (distance > 30.0f) {\n    //\
      \ Target too far\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using distance in spell effect logic
    code: "void ApplySpellEffect(Unit* caster, Unit* target) {\n    SpellCastTargets\
      \ targets;\n    targets.SetUnitTarget(target);\n    float distance = targets.GetDist2d();\n\
      \    if (distance < 5.0f) {\n        // Apply close-range effect\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple Euclidean distance calculation in the X-Y plane
    only, ignoring height differences. It's optimized for frequent use in game logic
    and should be called with valid SpellCastTargets objects to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or invalid SpellCastTargets object
    may return unexpected values. Always verify that both caster and target are valid
    before using the result.
