  class: PvPCombatAI
  method: TrackCCUsed
  signature: void PvPCombatAI::TrackCCUsed(int * target, CCType ccType)
documentation:
  brief: Tracks when a crowd control effect is used on a target.
  description: The TrackCCUsed method records information about a crowd control (CC)
    ability that has been applied to a target within the PvPCombatAI system. This
    method is typically invoked when a player or creature successfully applies a CC
    effect, such as fear, charm, or root, to another unit during PvP combat. It updates
    internal tracking mechanisms to monitor CC usage statistics and potentially influence
    AI decision-making based on recent CC activity. The method accepts a pointer to
    the target unit and the type of CC applied, allowing the AI to maintain awareness
    of which effects have been used and when.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the target unit that has been affected by the crowd
      control effect. This parameter must be a valid pointer to a Unit object or null
      if no target is specified.
  - name: ccType
    description: An enumeration value representing the type of crowd control effect
      used. This typically corresponds to predefined CC types such as ROOT, SILENCE,
      FEAR, CHARM, etc., defined in the CCType enum.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void ApplyFear(Unit* target)\n{\n    // Apply fear effect\n    target->AddAura(SPELL_FEAR,\
      \ target);\n    \n    // Track the CC usage\n    PvPCombatAI* ai = reinterpret_cast<PvPCombatAI*>(target->GetAI());\n\
      \    if (ai)\n        ai->TrackCCUsed(&target, CCType::FEAR);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with AI State Update
    code: "void HandleCCApplication(Unit* target, CCType ccType)\n{\n    // Apply\
      \ the CC effect\n    target->AddAura(GetCCSpellId(ccType), target);\n    \n\
      \    // Track it in PvP AI\n    if (PvPCombatAI* ai = dynamic_cast<PvPCombatAI*>(target->GetAI()))\n\
      \    {\n        ai->TrackCCUsed(&target, ccType);\n        \n        // Optionally\
      \ update AI behavior based on CC usage\n        ai->UpdateCombatState();\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PvP combat AI system and should only be called
    when a legitimate CC effect is applied. The target parameter must be a valid unit
    pointer to avoid undefined behavior. Internal tracking may include timestamps
    or counters for each CC type, which can affect AI decision-making logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer passed into this method is valid before
    calling to prevent crashes or memory corruption. Incorrectly setting the ccType
    enum value could lead to improper tracking and unexpected AI behavior.
