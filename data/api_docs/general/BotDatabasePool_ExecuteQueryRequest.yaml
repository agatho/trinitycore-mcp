documentation:
  brief: Submits a database query request to the bot database connection pool for
    asynchronous execution.
  description: The ExecuteQueryRequest method is responsible for processing and dispatching
    database query requests within the BotDatabasePool. It handles the queuing and
    execution of SQL queries against the bot-related database tables, ensuring that
    database operations are performed asynchronously without blocking the main game
    thread. This method is typically used by bot management systems to perform read
    or write operations on bot data stored in the database. The method does not return
    a result directly but rather schedules the query for execution within the connection
    pool's thread pool.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Submitting a simple SELECT query
    code: "QueryRequest request;\nrequest.query = \"SELECT * FROM bot_ai_agents WHERE\
      \ owner_guid = 12345\";\nrequest.callback = [](QueryResult result) {\n    if\
      \ (result)\n        while (Field* fields = result->Fetch())\n            std::cout\
      \ << \"Bot ID: \" << fields[0].Get<uint32>() << std::endl;\n};\nbotDatabasePool.ExecuteQueryRequest(request);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates asynchronously and does not block the calling thread.
    The actual database query execution happens in a separate thread pool managed
    by the BotDatabasePool. The callback function provided in the QueryRequest will
    be executed when the query completes, potentially on a different thread.
