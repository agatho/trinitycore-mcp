  method: EnableEmergencyMode
  signature: void TargetSelector::EnableEmergencyMode()
documentation:
  brief: Enables emergency mode in the target selector, prioritizing threat management
    and defensive actions.
  description: The EnableEmergencyMode method activates a special state within the
    TargetSelector class that shifts the AI's behavior towards prioritizing threat
    management and defensive actions. When emergency mode is enabled, the target selector
    will focus on maintaining aggro, avoiding high-damage targets, and ensuring the
    health of the unit is preserved over aggressive targeting. This method typically
    modifies internal flags or states within the AI system to alter how targets are
    evaluated and selected during combat scenarios. The activation of this mode may
    also trigger specific animations or visual effects in the game client to indicate
    the emergency state.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "void OnCombatStart(Unit* target)\n{\n    // Enable emergency mode when\
      \ entering combat\n    targetSelector->EnableEmergencyMode();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Emergency Mode with Health Check
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->GetHealthPct() < 30.0f)\n  \
      \  {\n        targetSelector->EnableEmergencyMode();\n        // Additional\
      \ defensive logic here\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal state flags that affect how the AI evaluates
    potential targets. It should be called before combat begins or when the unit's
    health drops below a certain threshold to ensure proper emergency response behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context may cause unexpected behavior
    in target selection logic. Ensure that emergency mode is only enabled when appropriate
    for the current combat situation to avoid unnecessary defensive actions.
