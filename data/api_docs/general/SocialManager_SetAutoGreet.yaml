api:
  class: SocialManager
  method: SetAutoGreet
  signature: void SocialManager::SetAutoGreet(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the auto-greeting feature for the player's social list
    entries.
  description: The SetAutoGreet method controls whether the player will automatically
    send a greeting message to friends and contacts when they come online. When enabled,
    the client will automatically send a predefined greeting message to all online
    friends in the player's social list. This feature is commonly used for automated
    social interactions within the game. The setting persists across sessions and
    affects all social interactions for the player. This method does not validate
    whether the player has any friends or contacts; it simply sets the flag that determines
    if greetings are sent.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Auto-Greeting
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();

      socialMgr->SetAutoGreet(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Auto-Greeting
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();

      socialMgr->SetAutoGreet(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies an internal flag within the SocialManager class that
    controls client-side behavior. The actual greeting message sent is determined
    by the game's default settings and cannot be customized through this API. This
    functionality is typically used in conjunction with other social manager methods
    to fully control player social interactions.
