  brief: Loads a chat line from the database into the complaint ticket object.
  description: The LoadChatLineFromDB method retrieves chat line data associated with
    a complaint ticket from the database and populates the internal fields of the
    ComplaintTicket object. This method is typically invoked during the initialization
    or loading phase of a complaint ticket, ensuring that all relevant chat history
    is available for display or processing. It expects a valid Field pointer containing
    the database row data, which usually includes information such as timestamp, sender,
    and message content. The method does not return any value but updates the internal
    state of the object based on the provided database fields.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:

    code: 'Field* fields = ...; // Assume this is populated with DB row data

      ComplaintTicket ticket;

      ticket.LoadChatLineFromDB(fields);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Field parameter contains valid data from a properly
    structured database query. It should only be called after verifying that the database
    connection is active and the row data is correctly formatted.
