documentation:
  brief: Processes teleport timeouts for LFG group members
  description: The ProcessTeleportTimeouts method handles cleanup and timeout management
    for players who have been teleported as part of a Looking For Group (LFG) activity.
    It checks if any players in the LFG group have exceeded their teleportation timeout
    duration, and if so, removes them from the group or performs necessary cleanup
    operations to maintain group integrity. This method is typically invoked periodically
    by the LFG system to ensure that inactive or stuck players do not remain in groups
    indefinitely.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within LFG system
    code: "void LFGGroupCoordinator::Update()\n{\n    // Other update logic\n    ProcessTeleportTimeouts();\n\
      \    // Other update logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal LFG group management system and should
    only be called from within the LFG coordinator's update loop. It does not directly
    handle player disconnections or manual group exits, but rather manages timeout-based
    cleanup for teleportation-related states.
