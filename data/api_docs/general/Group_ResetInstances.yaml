  class: Group
  method: ResetInstances
  signature: void Group::ResetInstances(InstanceResetMethod method, Player * notifyPlayer)
documentation:
  brief: Resets all instance data for the group based on the specified reset method.
  description: The ResetInstances method clears or resets all instance-related data
    for a group, typically used when players leave an instance or when a new instance
    is about to be entered. The behavior of this method depends on the provided InstanceResetMethod
    parameter which determines how the instances are reset. It may notify a specific
    player about the reset if one is provided. This method is crucial in managing
    group instance tracking and ensuring proper cleanup of instance-related data in
    TrinityCore's world management system.
  parameters:
  - name: method
    description: Specifies the reset method to use. Determines how instances are cleared
      or reset for the group. Valid values include methods like RESET_METHOD_ALL,
      RESET_METHOD_SAME_DIFFICULTY, etc., depending on the implementation in TrinityCore.
  - name: notifyPlayer
    description: Optional pointer to a Player object that will be notified about the
      instance reset. If null, no individual notification is sent. This allows for
      targeted communication to specific players regarding instance changes.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Reset all instances in a group with full reset method
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->ResetInstances(InstanceResetMethod::RESET_METHOD_ALL,\
      \ nullptr);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset instances and notify a specific player
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->ResetInstances(InstanceResetMethod::RESET_METHOD_SAME_DIFFICULTY,\
      \ player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method interacts with the instance management system of TrinityCore
    and should be called carefully to avoid unintended resets. The notifyPlayer parameter
    allows for targeted notifications, but it's not required. The actual reset behavior
    is determined by the InstanceResetMethod enum values defined in the codebase.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper group context or player references
    can lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the group exists and that the player
    pointer (if provided) is valid before calling this method.
