  class: PlayerAchievementMgr
  method: PlayerAchievementMgr
  signature: void PlayerAchievementMgr::PlayerAchievementMgr(Player * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new PlayerAchievementMgr instance with the specified player
    owner.
  description: The PlayerAchievementMgr constructor initializes a new achievement
    manager instance for a given player. This method sets up internal data structures
    and references needed to track and manage player achievements within the TrinityCore
    framework. The manager is responsible for handling achievement progress, rewards,
    and synchronization with the player's database records. It is typically called
    during player login or when creating a new player object to ensure proper achievement
    tracking functionality.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object that this achievement manager will manage.
      Must be a valid player instance, cannot be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating an Achievement Manager for a Player
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is already initialized

      PlayerAchievementMgr* achievementMgr = new PlayerAchievementMgr(player);

      // The manager is now ready to track achievements for this player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    during player object initialization. Developers should not manually instantiate
    PlayerAchievementMgr objects unless implementing custom player management logic.
    The manager relies on the player's GUID and database records for persistent achievement
    tracking.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly with a null player pointer as it
    will likely cause crashes or undefined behavior. The PlayerAchievementMgr is designed
    to be managed by the core TrinityCore systems, not created manually by external
    code.
