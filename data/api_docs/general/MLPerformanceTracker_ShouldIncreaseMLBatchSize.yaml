  method: ShouldIncreaseMLBatchSize
  signature: bool MLPerformanceTracker::ShouldIncreaseMLBatchSize() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the machine learning batch size should be increased based
    on performance metrics.
  description: The ShouldIncreaseMLBatchSize method evaluates current performance
    data to decide if increasing the batch size for machine learning operations would
    improve efficiency or throughput. This method is typically used in AI-driven systems
    within TrinityCore to dynamically adjust processing parameters. It analyzes metrics
    such as execution time, resource utilization, and accuracy improvements to make
    this determination. The decision-making process considers whether larger batches
    yield better performance without sacrificing quality or introducing bottlenecks.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current performance metrics indicate that increasing
    the ML batch size would be beneficial; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Processing Loop
    code: "if (tracker.ShouldIncreaseMLBatchSize()) {\n    // Increase batch size\
      \ for next iteration\n    mlEngine.SetBatchSize(mlEngine.GetBatchSize() * 2);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal performance tracking data that may be updated
    periodically. The decision to increase batch size should consider memory constraints
    and potential diminishing returns from larger batches.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without sufficient performance monitoring
    can lead to suboptimal ML processing. Always validate that increased batch sizes
    do not cause memory overflow or degrade model accuracy.
