  class: BotWorldPositioner
  method: CalculateSuitability
  signature: float BotWorldPositioner::CalculateSuitability(const ZonePlacement *
    zone, uint32 level) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a suitability score for a bot's placement within a
    specified zone based on level and zone characteristics.
  description: The CalculateSuitability method evaluates how appropriate a given zone
    is for placing a bot, taking into account both the bot's level and the properties
    of the target zone. This suitability score is used to determine optimal spawn
    locations or movement targets for bots in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
    The method considers various factors such as zone difficulty, player density,
    and level variance to compute a normalized float value that represents the desirability
    of placing a bot in that specific zone. It is typically invoked during bot initialization
    or when repositioning bots to ensure they are placed in zones appropriate for
    their level.
  parameters:
  - name: zone
    description: Pointer to a ZonePlacement object that defines the characteristics
      and properties of the target zone where suitability is being calculated.
  - name: level
    description: The level of the bot for which suitability is being evaluated. This
      value influences how well the zone matches the bot's capabilities and progression.
  returns: A float value representing the suitability score of placing a bot in the
    specified zone. Higher scores indicate better suitability, with values typically
    ranging from 0.0 (unsuitable) to 1.0 (highly suitable).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: float suitability = botWorldPositioner.CalculateSuitability(&zonePlacement,
      60);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Suitability for Decision Making
    code: "if (botWorldPositioner.CalculateSuitability(&zonePlacement, playerLevel)\
      \ > 0.7f)\n{\n    // Proceed with bot placement in this zone\n    bot->SetPosition(zonePlacement.GetCenterX(),\
      \ zonePlacement.GetCenterY(), zonePlacement.GetCenterZ());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is integral to the bot AI's positioning logic and may be called
    frequently during runtime. It relies on internal zone data structures and should
    not be used with invalid or uninitialized ZonePlacement objects. The implementation
    likely includes heuristics for balancing player experience and bot distribution
    across zones.
  warnings: Ensure that the ZonePlacement pointer passed is valid and initialized
    before calling this method, as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined
    behavior. Also, the returned suitability score should not be treated as an absolute
    value but rather as a relative measure compared to other zones.
