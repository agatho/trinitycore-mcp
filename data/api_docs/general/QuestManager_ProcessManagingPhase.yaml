  signature: void QuestManager::ProcessManagingPhase()
documentation:
  brief: Processes the current quest managing phase for a player, updating quest states
    and handling quest-related events.
  description: The ProcessManagingPhase method is responsible for executing the core
    logic of quest management within the TrinityCore framework. It evaluates the current
    state of active quests for a player, checks completion conditions, handles quest
    progression, and manages any associated rewards or objectives. This method typically
    runs during the player's update cycle to ensure that quest data remains synchronized
    with in-game events and player actions. The method does not require explicit parameters
    as it operates on the internal state of the QuestManager instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Update Loop
    code: "void Player::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    _questManager->ProcessManagingPhase();\n    // ... more update logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically during the player's update
    cycle and should not be called manually unless specifically required for custom
    quest handling. It relies on internal quest data structures and may perform database
    operations to persist quest progress.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of the normal update cycle can lead to inconsistent
    quest states or unexpected behavior. Ensure that all quest-related modifications
    are thread-safe if invoked from multiple contexts.
