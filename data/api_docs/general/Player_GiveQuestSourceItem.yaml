  brief: Gives a quest source item to the player
  description: This method attempts to give a quest source item to the player, which
    is typically a quest-giving item that allows players to start quests. The method
    checks if the item exists in the player's inventory and returns true if successful
    or false if the item cannot be given due to inventory constraints or other conditions.
    This method is commonly used when a player starts a quest that requires an item
    to be given as a source item.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest source item was successfully given to the player,
    false otherwise. The return value indicates whether the operation succeeded or
    failed based on inventory constraints and item availability.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nQuest* quest = GetQuest();\nbool success\
      \ = player->GiveQuestSourceItem(quest);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Quest source\
      \ item was successfully given\n    // Continue with quest progression\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with quest start procedures
    and may involve checking inventory space before attempting to give items. The
    method may fail if the player's inventory is full or if the item cannot be given
    due to game mechanics constraints.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly from scripts without proper
    validation. It may cause issues if used in incorrect contexts, such as when the
    quest does not have a source item defined or when the player has no space in their
    inventory.
