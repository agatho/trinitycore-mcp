  signature: bool GroupIntegration::IsFullBotGroup(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a group has reached its maximum bot player capacity.
  description: The IsFullBotGroup method checks if a given group has achieved its
    maximum allowed number of bot players. This functionality is typically used in
    TrinityCore's bot system to manage group composition and prevent exceeding configured
    limits for automated player characters. The method evaluates the current member
    count against predefined thresholds and returns true if the group is at or above
    capacity, false otherwise. This check is essential for maintaining game balance
    and preventing abuse of bot systems in group-based content.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group has reached its maximum bot player limit; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a group is full of bots
    code: "Group* myGroup = sObjectAccessor->GetGroupByLeader(playerGuid);\nif (myGroup\
      \ && groupIntegration->IsFullBotGroup(myGroup)) {\n    // Handle case where\
      \ group is at maximum bot capacity\n    sLog->outString(\"Group is full with\
      \ bots.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on configuration settings that define the maximum
    number of bots allowed per group. It may also consider group type (raid vs party)
    when determining capacity limits. The implementation should be thread-safe as
    it's expected to be called from various game systems.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed to this method is valid and not null,
    otherwise behavior is undefined. This method does not account for temporary group
    members or pending invitations that might affect actual group size.
