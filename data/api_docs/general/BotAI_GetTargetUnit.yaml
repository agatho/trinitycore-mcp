  class: BotAI
  method: GetTargetUnit
  signature: ::Unit * BotAI::GetTargetUnit() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current target unit of the bot AI.
  description: The GetTargetUnit method retrieves the Unit object that represents
    the current target of the bot's AI behavior. This target is typically set by the
    AI logic when the bot engages in combat or follows specific targeting rules. The
    returned pointer may be null if no valid target is currently assigned to the bot.
    This method is commonly used within the bot's decision-making process to determine
    which unit to attack, follow, or interact with next.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Unit object that represents the current target of the
    bot AI. Returns nullptr if no valid target is assigned.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check current target
    code: "Unit* target = botAI->GetTargetUnit();\nif (target != nullptr)\n{\n   \
      \ // Bot has a target, proceed with actions\n    std::cout << \"Bot is targeting:\
      \ \" << target->GetName() << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No target assigned\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Bot has no target.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation on the returned Unit pointer.
    It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the target unit is still valid
    and alive before using it in operations. The target may change frequently during
    AI execution, especially in combat scenarios.
