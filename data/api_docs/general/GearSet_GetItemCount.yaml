  signature: uint32 GearSet::GetItemCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of items in the gear set
  description: The GetItemCount method calculates and returns the total number of
    items contained within the GearSet object. This method is typically used to determine
    how many items are currently equipped or stored in a specific gear set configuration.
    The count includes all item slots regardless of whether they contain valid items
    or are empty. This functionality is essential for gear management systems, character
    equipment validation, and UI display purposes where the number of items in a set
    needs to be known.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total count of items in the gear set. Returns
    0 if the gear set contains no items or is empty.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GearSet* myGearSet = player->GetGearSet(0);

      uint32 itemCount = myGearSet->GetItemCount();

      TC_LOG_INFO("player", "Gear set contains %u items", itemCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation Check
    code: "GearSet* gearSet = player->GetGearSet(1);\nif (gearSet && gearSet->GetItemCount()\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"player\", \"Valid gear set with %u items found\"\
      , gearSet->GetItemCount());\n}\nelse\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"player\", \"Empty\
      \ or invalid gear set\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple count operation and should have minimal performance
    impact. The implementation likely iterates through all item slots in the gear
    set to tally the total number of items present, including empty slots that contribute
    to the overall count.
  warnings: Be aware that this method counts all slots in the gear set, not just those
    with valid items. If you need to count only non-empty slots, additional filtering
    logic would be required. Also ensure the GearSet object is valid before calling
    this method to avoid potential crashes.
