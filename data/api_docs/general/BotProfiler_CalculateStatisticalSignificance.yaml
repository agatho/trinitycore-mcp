  class: BotProfiler
  method: CalculateStatisticalSignificance
  signature: double BotProfiler::CalculateStatisticalSignificance(const int & baseline,
    const int & current)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the statistical significance of a change between a baseline value
    and a current value.
  description: 'The CalculateStatisticalSignificance method computes a double-precision
    floating-point value representing how statistically significant a difference is
    between a baseline measurement and a current measurement. This method is typically
    used in performance profiling or data analysis within the TrinityCore framework
    to determine whether observed changes are meaningful or could be attributed to
    random variation. The calculation likely involves statistical measures such as
    standard deviation, variance, or z-scores, though the exact implementation details
    are not provided. The method takes two integer parameters: baseline and current,
    which represent the reference value and the measured value respectively. It is
    commonly used in bot profiling or performance monitoring systems where consistent
    data evaluation is required.'
  parameters:
  - name: baseline
    description: The reference or historical value against which the current value
      is compared. Must be a valid integer representing a measurable metric.
  - name: current
    description: The current measured value to evaluate for statistical significance
      against the baseline. Must be a valid integer.
  returns: A double-precision floating-point number representing the calculated statistical
    significance. Higher values typically indicate more significant differences between
    the baseline and current measurements. A return value of 0.0 may indicate no difference
    or an invalid calculation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'int baseline = 100;

      int current = 120;

      BotProfiler profiler;

      double significance = profiler.CalculateStatisticalSignificance(baseline, current);

      // Returns a value indicating how significant the change from 100 to 120 is.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring
    code: "int oldFps = 60;\nint newFps = 58;\nBotProfiler profiler;\ndouble significance\
      \ = profiler.CalculateStatisticalSignificance(oldFps, newFps);\nif (significance\
      \ > 2.0) {\n    // Log significant performance degradation\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that both baseline and current values are valid integers
    and may not handle edge cases such as zero or negative values gracefully without
    additional context. The actual statistical formula used is not specified, but
    it likely involves standard deviation calculations or similar statistical techniques.
  warnings: Ensure that both baseline and current values are meaningful and non-zero
    to avoid misleading results. The method does not validate input parameters, so
    invalid inputs may lead to unexpected behavior.
