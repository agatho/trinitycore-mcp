  signature: bool MongooseBiteTracker::IsWindowActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the mongoose bite window is currently active.
  description: The IsWindowActive method determines if the mongoose bite window, which
    typically appears during certain quest interactions or combat scenarios in World
    of Warcraft, is currently visible and active. This method is commonly used to
    manage UI state and interaction flow within the game's quest system. The window's
    activation status can affect player actions and quest progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the mongoose bite window is currently active and visible;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Mongoose Bite Window is Active
    code: "if (tracker.IsWindowActive()) {\n    // Handle case when window is active\n\
      \    player->SendNotification(\"Mongoose Bite window is open\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle case when window is not active\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Mongoose Bite window is closed\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks internal state flags or UI component visibility
    rather than querying the actual game window directly. It may be used in conjunction
    with other tracker methods to manage quest state transitions.
