  method: GetQuestSlotObjectiveData
  signature: int32 Player::GetQuestSlotObjectiveData(uint16 slot, const int & objective)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the objective data for a specified quest slot.
  description: This method returns the objective data associated with a specific quest
    slot and objective index. It is used to access quest progress information, such
    as the number of kills or items needed for a quest. The method allows players
    to query quest objectives without directly modifying them, making it useful for
    quest tracking and progression. This functionality is essential for maintaining
    proper quest state in World of Warcraft's quest system.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The quest slot index (0-25) where the quest objective data is stored.
      This represents the position of the quest in the player's quest log.
  - name: objective
    description: The objective index within the quest slot (0-9). This corresponds
      to a specific objective within the quest, such as a kill count or item collection.
  returns: Returns the current objective data value for the specified quest slot and
    objective. If no valid data exists, it returns 0 or -1 depending on the context.
    The return value represents the progress toward completing the objective.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Objective Retrieval
    code: 'int32 objectiveData = player->GetQuestSlotObjectiveData(0, 0);

      // Retrieves the first objective data from the first quest slot'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Quest Progress Tracking
    code: "uint16 questSlot = 5;\nint32 objectiveData = player->GetQuestSlotObjectiveData(questSlot,\
      \ 2);\nif (objectiveData > 0) {\n    // Process the quest progress\n}\nelse\
      \ {\n    // Handle missing or invalid data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest tracking system and should be used
    carefully when modifying quest progress. The method does not modify the actual
    quest data but only retrieves it, making it safe for read operations.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with invalid slot or objective indices
    as it may return unexpected values or cause undefined behavior if the quest slot
    is empty or not properly initialized.
