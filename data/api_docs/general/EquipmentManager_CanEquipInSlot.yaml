  signature: bool EquipmentManager::CanEquipInSlot(int * player, int * item, uint8
    slot)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can equip a specified item in a given equipment
    slot
  description: The CanEquipInSlot method evaluates whether a player is capable of
    equipping a specific item in a designated equipment slot. It checks various conditions
    such as item type compatibility, required level, class restrictions, and inventory
    constraints. This method is typically used during equipment change operations
    to validate if an equip action should be allowed. The function considers both
    the player's current state and the properties of the item being equipped.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object that attempts to equip the item. Must
      not be null.
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to the item object that is being considered for equipping.
      Must not be null.
  - name: slot
    description: The equipment slot index where the item should be equipped. Valid
      range typically corresponds to the player's inventory slot IDs.
  returns: Returns true if the player can successfully equip the item in the specified
    slot, false otherwise. The method returns false when item type is incompatible
    with the slot, player level is insufficient, class restrictions are violated,
    or other game logic prevents the equip operation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if an item can be equipped
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nItem* item = ...;\nuint8 slot = EQUIPMENT_SLOT_HEAD;\n\
      bool canEquip = EquipmentManager::CanEquipInSlot(player, item, slot);\nif (canEquip)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with equipping the item\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking multiple slots for an item
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nItem* item = ...;\nbool canEquipInAnySlot = false;\n\
      for (uint8 slot = EQUIPMENT_SLOT_START; slot < EQUIPMENT_SLOT_END; ++slot)\n\
      {\n    if (EquipmentManager::CanEquipInSlot(player, item, slot))\n    {\n  \
      \      canEquipInAnySlot = true;\n        break;\n    }\n}\nif (canEquipInAnySlot)\n\
      {\n    // Item can be equipped in at least one valid slot\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs multiple checks internally including item class validation,
    level requirements, and class-specific restrictions. It does not modify any game
    state but only evaluates conditions. The function may involve database lookups
    or cached data depending on the implementation details of the EquipmentManager.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and item pointers are valid before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior. The slot parameter must be within valid equipment
    slot bounds, otherwise results are unpredictable.
