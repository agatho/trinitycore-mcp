  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: KillBoss
  signature: bool BattlegroundAI::KillBoss(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Kills a boss unit in the battleground and handles associated AI logic.
  description: The KillBoss method is used to simulate or trigger the death of a boss
    unit within a battleground environment. This method typically manages the cleanup
    of boss-related AI states, updates the battleground's internal tracking of boss
    status, and may handle rewards or victory conditions. It is commonly invoked when
    a boss is defeated by players or through scripted events. The method may also
    perform necessary synchronization with the game server to ensure all clients are
    updated about the boss's death.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player ID who triggered or
      is associated with the boss kill. May be NULL if no specific player is involved.
  returns: Returns true if the boss was successfully killed and all related AI logic
    completed without error; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of KillBoss
    code: "if (bgAI->KillBoss(&playerId)) {\n    // Boss has been killed, handle victory\
      \ conditions\n    bg->EndBattleground(bg->GetWinner());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: KillBoss with null player pointer
    code: "int* nullPlayer = nullptr;\nif (bgAI->KillBoss(nullPlayer)) {\n    // Boss\
      \ killed without specific player involvement\n    sWorld->SendGlobalText(\"\
      A boss has been defeated!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground AI system and should only be called
    from within a valid battleground context. Ensure that the boss object referenced
    by the AI is still active before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling KillBoss on a non-existent or already dead boss may lead to inconsistent
    game state or crashes. Always verify the boss's existence and alive status before
    invoking this function.
