  method: GetActiveBotsCount
  signature: uint32_t BotPerformanceMonitor::GetActiveBotsCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total count of active bot instances currently managed by the
    performance monitor.
  description: The GetActiveBotsCount method returns the number of bot instances that
    are currently marked as active within the BotPerformanceMonitor system. This count
    is typically used for monitoring and performance analysis purposes, allowing administrators
    or systems to track how many bots are actively engaged in gameplay activities.
    The method does not perform any operations on the bots themselves but simply reports
    the current state of active bot tracking. It is a read-only operation that provides
    insight into system resource utilization and bot activity levels.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32_t value representing the total number of active bots currently
    tracked by the BotPerformanceMonitor. Returns zero if no bots are active or if
    the monitor has not been initialized with any active bot data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Active Bot Count
    code: "uint32_t activeBots = sBotPerformanceMonitor->GetActiveBotsCount();\nif\
      \ (activeBots > 0)\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"Currently managing {} active\
      \ bots.\", activeBots);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Bot Performance Thresholds
    code: "uint32_t currentCount = sBotPerformanceMonitor->GetActiveBotsCount();\n\
      if (currentCount > 100)\n{\n    TC_LOG_WARN(\"bot\", \"High bot activity detected:\
      \ {} active bots.\", currentCount);\n    // Trigger performance optimization\
      \ or alerting\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during performance monitoring
    cycles. It's important to note that the returned count reflects only those bots
    explicitly marked as 'active' by the system, which may differ from all bots created
    or registered with the monitor. The implementation likely uses atomic operations
    or thread-safe counters to ensure accuracy in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: This method should not be used for real-time bot management decisions
    as it only provides a snapshot of current active state. If performance is critical,
    consider caching this value rather than calling it repeatedly in tight loops.
