  class: ConversationLine
  method: operator!=
  signature: bool ConversationLine::operator!=(const ConversationLine & right) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two ConversationLine objects for inequality.
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this ConversationLine
    object and another ConversationLine object to determine if they are not equal.
    This comparison is typically based on the unique identifiers or internal data
    members that define the conversation line's identity. In the context of World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this operator is used to check whether two conversation
    lines represent different entries, which is essential for managing dialogue trees
    and ensuring correct branching logic during NPC conversations.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The ConversationLine object to compare against this instance. This
      parameter represents another conversation line that will be compared for inequality.
  returns: Returns true if the two ConversationLine objects are not equal; otherwise,
    returns false. The comparison is based on internal properties such as GUIDs or
    other unique identifiers that distinguish one conversation line from another.
  examples:
  - title: Basic inequality check between two conversation lines
    code: 'ConversationLine line1;

      ConversationLine line2;

      bool areNotEqual = (line1 != line2); // Returns true if line1 and line2 are
      different

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Using inequality operator in conditional logic for dialogue management
    code: "void ProcessConversation(ConversationLine& currentLine, ConversationLine&\
      \ nextLine) {\n    if (currentLine != nextLine) {\n        // Proceed with different\
      \ dialogue path\n        HandleNewDialoguePath();\n    } else {\n        //\
      \ Continue same dialogue path\n        ContinueCurrentDialogue();\n    }\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is commonly used in STL containers and algorithms where equality
    comparisons are needed. It's important to note that the comparison logic depends
    on how ConversationLine defines its equality and inequality operators internally,
    typically comparing key identifiers or data fields.
