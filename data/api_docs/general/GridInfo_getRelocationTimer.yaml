  method: getRelocationTimer
  signature: int & GridInfo::getRelocationTimer()
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the grid relocation timer value used for managing
    grid object updates.
  description: The getRelocationTimer method provides access to an internal timer
    value that controls when grid objects should be relocated or updated within the
    game world. This timer is typically used in conjunction with grid management systems
    to determine when it's time to process object repositioning, visibility updates,
    or other grid-related operations. The returned reference allows direct modification
    of this timer value, which can affect how frequently grid events are processed.
    This method is commonly used in the context of dynamic grid loading/unloading
    and object tracking within TrinityCore's world management system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to an integer representing the current grid relocation timer
    value in milliseconds. This value determines when the next grid relocation operation
    should occur.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing and modifying grid relocation timer
    code: 'GridInfo* gridInfo = ...;

      int& timerRef = gridInfo->getRelocationTimer();

      timerRef = 5000; // Set timer to 5 seconds

      int currentTimer = gridInfo->getRelocationTimer(); // Get current value'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points directly to an internal member variable, so
    modifications affect the actual grid state. This method is typically called during
    world update cycles and should be used carefully to avoid disrupting grid management
    logic. The timer value is usually managed automatically by the core system but
    can be manually adjusted for specific scenarios.
  warnings: Modifying the returned reference directly affects the grid's relocation
    behavior. Be cautious when changing this value as it may cause unexpected grid
    loading/unloading patterns or performance issues if set to inappropriate values.
    Avoid frequent modifications during active gameplay as this could lead to inconsistent
    grid states.
