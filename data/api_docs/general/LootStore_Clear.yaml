documentation:
  brief: Clears all loot entries from the LootStore, removing all associated loot
    templates and reseting internal state.
  description: The Clear method removes all loot entries from a LootStore instance,
    effectively resetting its internal data structures. This operation is typically
    used when reloading loot templates or during server shutdown to ensure clean state.
    The method invalidates any existing loot references and prepares the store for
    new loot definitions. It does not affect the underlying database records but clears
    the in-memory representation of loot templates. This method should be called carefully
    as it may invalidate active loot operations if invoked while loot is being processed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing a LootStore instance
    code: 'LootStore* store = sLootMgr->GetLootStore("creature_loot_template");

      store->Clear();

      // All loot entries for creature_loot_template are now removed'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a complete reset of the LootStore's internal state.
    It is recommended to call this only during server initialization or reload operations
    when no active loot processes are running. The method does not interact with the
    database directly but clears the in-memory cache of loot templates.
  warnings: Calling Clear() while loot is actively being generated or processed may
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always ensure that no active loot operations
    are in progress before invoking this method.
