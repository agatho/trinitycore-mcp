documentation:
  brief: Returns the race unlock requirements for the specified race
  description: Retrieves the unlock requirements associated with a specific race in
    the game. This method is typically used to determine what conditions must be met
    before a player can select or unlock a particular race. The returned value represents
    the requirement ID that defines the criteria for race unlocking, such as quest
    completion, level thresholds, or other in-game prerequisites. This functionality
    is integral to the character creation and race selection system in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the unlock requirement
    ID for the race. This ID corresponds to a specific set of conditions defined in
    the game's database that must be satisfied to unlock the race.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Race Unlock Requirements
    code: 'int requirementId = sObjectMgr->GetRaceUnlockRequirements();

      // Use requirementId to check if player meets unlock criteria'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method returns a reference to an internal data structure, so modifications
    to the returned value will not affect the original data. This method is likely
    part of a larger system that manages race unlocking conditions and should be used
    in conjunction with other ObjectMgr methods for complete character creation logic.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called after the ObjectMgr has been properly
    initialized with race data. Calling this method before database loading may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect return values.
