  class: InterruptRotationManager
  method: RecordInterruptAttempt
  signature: void InterruptRotationManager::RecordInterruptAttempt(uint32 spellId,
    bool success)
documentation:
  brief: Records an interrupt attempt with associated spell ID and success status
    for rotation management.
  description: The RecordInterruptAttempt method logs interrupt attempts within the
    InterruptRotationManager class, tracking which spell was used to attempt an interrupt
    and whether the attempt succeeded. This functionality is crucial for managing
    combat rotations, particularly in scenarios where interrupt mechanics are involved
    such as against enemy casters or during PvP encounters. The method stores this
    data for potential analysis or decision-making in subsequent rotation calculations.
    It does not perform any validation on the input parameters but assumes valid spell
    IDs and boolean values.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell being used to attempt an interrupt.
      This should correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's database.
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the interrupt attempt was successful
      (true) or failed (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupt Recording
    code: 'InterruptRotationManager rotationManager;

      rotationManager.RecordInterruptAttempt(12345, true); // Record successful interrupt
      with spell ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Failed Interrupt Logging
    code: 'InterruptRotationManager rotationManager;

      rotationManager.RecordInterruptAttempt(67890, false); // Record failed interrupt
      attempt'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat events when an interrupt action
    occurs. The data recorded may be used later for rotation optimization or performance
    analysis. It's important to note that this method does not validate the spell
    ID against existing spells, so calling it with invalid IDs might lead to inconsistent
    tracking.
