documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the auction house has any active auctions currently listed.
  description: The HasActiveAuctions method determines if there are any auctions currently
    active in the auction house system. This method is typically used to verify the
    presence of ongoing auction listings before performing operations such as retrieving
    auction data, processing bids, or updating auction states. The check is performed
    against the internal auction listing database and returns true if at least one
    auction exists with an active status, false otherwise. This functionality is crucial
    for managing auction house interactions and ensuring proper game state handling.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if there are any active auctions currently listed in the auction
    house; returns false if no auctions are active or if the auction house is empty.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (auctionMgr->HasActiveAuctions()) {\n    // Proceed with auction-related\
      \ operations\n    LOG_INFO(\"auction\", \"Active auctions found in auction house\"\
      );\n} else {\n    LOG_INFO(\"auction\", \"No active auctions in auction house\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple check against the internal auction listing
    state and should be efficient for regular use. It does not account for expired
    or completed auctions, only those currently marked as active.
