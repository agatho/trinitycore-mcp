documentation:
  brief: Retrieves and sends calendar data to the player's client for display in the
    calendar interface.
  description: The HandleCalendarGetCalendar method is responsible for processing
    a client request to fetch calendar information. When invoked, it retrieves the
    current calendar data from the server and packages it into a packet that is sent
    back to the requesting player's client. This allows players to view events, invitations,
    and other calendar-related information within the World of Warcraft interface.
    The method typically handles synchronization of calendar state between the server
    and client, ensuring that players see accurate event details and can interact
    with their calendar as expected. It is part of the broader calendar system implementation
    in TrinityCore.

  - title: Basic usage within WorldSession context
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleCalendarGetCalendar(WorldPackets::Calendar::CalendarGetCalendar&\
      \ calendarGetCalendar)\n{\n    // Process the request to get calendar data\n\
      \    SendCalendarData();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically when a player opens their calendar
    interface in the game client. It's part of the asynchronous communication pattern
    used by TrinityCore for handling UI-related requests from players.
