  class: PlayerPatternRecognition
  method: RecordTargetChange
  signature: void PlayerPatternRecognition::RecordTargetChange(Player * player, Unit
    * oldTarget, Unit * newTarget)
documentation:
  brief: Records a change in target for a player, updating internal pattern recognition
    data structures.
  description: The RecordTargetChange method is used to log and process changes in
    a player's current target unit. This functionality is typically employed within
    the context of player behavior analysis or combat pattern recognition systems.
    The method accepts a pointer to the player who changed targets, along with pointers
    to both the old and new target units. It updates internal tracking mechanisms
    that may be used for AI behavior modification, quest progression, or performance
    monitoring. This method does not directly affect gameplay mechanics but serves
    as an important data collection point for higher-level systems.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose target has changed. Must be a
      valid player instance; null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
  - name: oldTarget
    description: Pointer to the Unit that was previously targeted by the player. May
      be nullptr if no previous target existed.
  - name: newTarget
    description: Pointer to the Unit that is now being targeted by the player. May
      be nullptr if the player has cleared their target.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Target Change Recording
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      Unit* oldTarget = player->GetVictim();

      Unit* newTarget = ...; // Some other unit

      player->GetPatternRecognition()->RecordTargetChange(player, oldTarget, newTarget);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Target Change with Null Safety Check
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nUnit* oldTarget = player->GetVictim();\nUnit* newTarget\
      \ = ...; // Some other unit\nif (player && oldTarget && newTarget)\n{\n    player->GetPatternRecognition()->RecordTargetChange(player,\
      \ oldTarget, newTarget);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger pattern recognition system that tracks
    player behavior for various purposes including AI enhancement, quest tracking,
    or combat analytics. The implementation may involve internal data structures such
    as target change logs or behavioral state machines. It's important to ensure that
    the player and unit pointers are valid before calling this method to prevent memory
    corruption.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid (null) pointers will likely cause undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always validate input parameters before invoking this function.
    Additionally, frequent calls to this method may have performance implications
    if internal data structures are complex or require synchronization.
