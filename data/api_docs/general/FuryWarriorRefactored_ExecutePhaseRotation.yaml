  class: FuryWarriorRefactored
  method: ExecutePhaseRotation
  signature: void FuryWarriorRefactored::ExecutePhaseRotation(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the current phase rotation logic for a Fury Warrior AI, determining
    and applying the appropriate combat actions based on the target and current game
    state.
  description: The ExecutePhaseRotation method is responsible for running the core
    decision-making logic of a Fury Warrior's AI behavior during combat. This method
    evaluates the current combat situation, including the target's health, the warrior's
    own resources (such as rage and combo points), and the phase of the rotation being
    executed. It then selects and applies the most appropriate abilities from the
    Fury Warrior's rotation sequence, such as executing auto-attacks, using abilities
    like Slam, Bloodthirst, or Whirlwind, and managing resource generation and consumption.
    The method ensures that the warrior follows a strategic combat pattern optimized
    for damage output while respecting game mechanics like cooldowns, resource thresholds,
    and ability prerequisites. This function is typically called during the AI's update
    cycle to make real-time tactical decisions.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the current combat target.
      This parameter is essential for determining which actions to execute and how
      to prioritize them based on the target's state (health, buffs, debuffs). The
      method assumes that this pointer is valid and points to a living unit.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void FuryWarriorAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    ExecutePhaseRotation(mVictim);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom combat logic
    code: "void FuryWarriorRefactored::ExecutePhaseRotation(Unit* target)\n{\n   \
      \ if (!target || !target->IsAlive())\n        return;\n\n    // Check for specific\
      \ conditions before executing rotation\n    if (me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // Execute the phase rotation logic\n    DoExecuteRotation(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger AI framework and relies on other internal
    methods for resource management, ability selection, and state tracking. It should
    only be called when the AI unit is in combat and has a valid target. The method
    may modify the AI's internal state variables and should not be interrupted by
    external modifications to the unit's state during execution.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly without ensuring that the target is valid
    and alive, as it will likely cause undefined behavior or crashes. Avoid calling
    this method outside of combat situations where it may attempt to execute abilities
    that are not appropriate for the current context.
