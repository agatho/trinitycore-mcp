  method: CalculateItemValue
  signature: float GroupCoordinator::CalculateItemValue(uint32 itemId) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the relative value of a specified item within the
    group coordination system.
  description: The CalculateItemValue method computes a float-based value representing
    the relative worth or priority of a given item in the context of group loot distribution.
    This calculation typically considers factors such as item level, quality, enchantments,
    and potential utility to the group members. The returned value is used by the
    GroupCoordinator to determine optimal loot assignment strategies, ensuring that
    items are distributed fairly and efficiently among group members based on their
    needs and roles. This method does not modify any internal state and is purely
    a computational function.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated item value. Higher values indicate
    higher priority or worth of the item within the group coordination system. The
    specific scale and interpretation may vary based on internal algorithms and game
    mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float itemValue = groupCoordinator->CalculateItemValue(12345);

      // itemValue now contains the calculated value for item ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Loot Distribution Logic
    code: "uint32 itemId = 67890;\nfloat value = groupCoordinator->CalculateItemValue(itemId);\n\
      if (value > 10.0f) {\n    // Prioritize this item for high-value group members\n\
      \    // or assign it to specific roles\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs lookups in internal databases or caches to retrieve
    item information. It's designed to be efficient and thread-safe as part of the
    group coordination system. The exact algorithm for value calculation may depend
    on current game rules, expansion content, and server configurations.
  warnings: The returned value is not guaranteed to be unique across different items,
    and multiple items might return similar values. Ensure that this method is called
    with valid item IDs to avoid undefined behavior or incorrect calculations.
