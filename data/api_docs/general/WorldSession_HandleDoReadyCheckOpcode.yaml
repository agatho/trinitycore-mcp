documentation:
  brief: Initiates a ready check for the player's party members
  description: The HandleDoReadyCheckOpcode method processes incoming packets from
    players to initiate a ready check within their party. When a player sends this
    opcode, it triggers a broadcast message to all party members notifying them that
    a ready check has been initiated. Each party member must then respond with their
    readiness status. This mechanism is commonly used in group content such as raids
    or dungeons to ensure all participants are prepared before proceeding with an
    activity. The method does not directly handle the response from party members;
    instead, it initiates the process that leads to a subsequent ready check response
    handling.

  - title: Basic usage in packet handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleDoReadyCheckOpcode(WorldPackets::Party::DoReadyCheck&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    if (Player* player = GetPlayer())\n    {\n        if (Group*\
      \ group = player->GetGroup())\n        {\n            group->SendReadyCheck(player);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is typically called as part of the party management system in
    TrinityCore. It relies on the underlying Group class to manage party member states
    and broadcasting. The actual ready check responses are handled by a separate opcode
    handler (likely HandleReadyCheckResponseOpcode). This method assumes the player
    has an active group membership.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player is actually in a group,
    otherwise it will have no effect. It's important to ensure proper group state
    validation before calling this function to avoid potential errors or unexpected
    behavior.
