  signature: void ThreatManager::UpdateRedirectInfo()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the threat redirection information for the current unit's threat
    manager.
  description: The UpdateRedirectInfo method is responsible for refreshing or recalculating
    the threat redirection state within a ThreatManager instance. This typically occurs
    when a unit's threat redirection target changes, such as when a mob switches its
    aggro from one player to another, or when a spell or ability modifies the threat
    distribution. The method ensures that the internal threat redirection data is
    consistent with the current state of the unit and its targets. It may involve
    updating cached references to redirected targets, recalculating threat values,
    or notifying other systems about changes in threat management. This method is
    generally called internally by the core game loop or triggered by specific combat
    events rather than being invoked directly by external code.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within combat system
    code: "void SomeCombatHandler(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (target->GetThreatManager())\n\
      \    {\n        target->GetThreatManager()->UpdateRedirectInfo();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during threat recalculations or when a unit's
    target changes. It should not be called excessively as it may involve performance-sensitive
    operations like iterating through threat lists and updating internal state caches.
