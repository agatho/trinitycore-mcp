  signature: int Player::GetCompletedAchievementIds() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of completed achievements for the player.
  description: This method retrieves the count of achievements that have been completed
    by the player. It provides a way to determine how many achievements the player
    has earned, which is useful for various game mechanics including progress tracking,
    reward calculations, and achievement-related quests. The method returns an integer
    representing the total number of completed achievements, not the IDs themselves.
    This value can be used to check if a player has reached certain achievement milestones
    or to calculate rewards based on achievement completion status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the count of completed achievements for
    the player. The value is typically positive and indicates how many achievements
    have been earned by the player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int completedCount = player->GetCompletedAchievementIds();\nif (completedCount\
      \ > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Player has \" << completedCount << \" completed\
      \ achievements.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other achievement-related
    methods to track player progress. It's important to note that this returns the
    count of achievements, not their IDs. Performance considerations are minimal as
    this method simply accesses internal data structures.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when checking achievement completion
    status, as it only provides the count and not the actual achievement IDs. Be aware
    that this method may return 0 if no achievements have been completed yet.
