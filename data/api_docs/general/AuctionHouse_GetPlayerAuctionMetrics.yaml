api:
  class: AuctionHouse
  method: GetPlayerAuctionMetrics
  signature: AuctionMetrics AuctionHouse::GetPlayerAuctionMetrics(uint32 playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves auction metrics for a specified player from the auction house system.
  description: The GetPlayerAuctionMetrics method fetches comprehensive auction activity
    statistics for a given player identified by their GUID. This includes data such
    as the number of auctions created, items sold, gold earned, and other relevant
    trading metrics within the auction house system. The returned AuctionMetrics structure
    encapsulates these statistics to provide insights into a player's auction behavior
    and success rate. This method is typically used for player analytics, achievement
    tracking, or displaying personal auction history in-game interfaces.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose auction metrics
      are being retrieved. Must be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  returns: An AuctionMetrics object containing aggregated statistics about the player's
    auction activities, including total auctions created, items sold, gold earned,
    and other relevant performance indicators. Returns an empty or default-initialized
    structure if no metrics exist for the specified player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 playerId = 12345;

      AuctionMetrics metrics = auctionHouse->GetPlayerAuctionMetrics(playerId);

      TC_LOG_INFO("auction", "Player %u has created %u auctions and sold %u items.",
      playerId, metrics.totalAuctionsCreated, metrics.itemsSold);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "uint32 playerId = 12345;\nAuctionMetrics metrics = auctionHouse->GetPlayerAuctionMetrics(playerId);\n\
      if (metrics.totalAuctionsCreated > 0)\n{\n    float successRate = (float)metrics.itemsSold\
      \ / (float)metrics.totalAuctionsCreated * 100.0f;\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"auction\"\
      , \"Player %u has a %.2f%% auction success rate.\", playerId, successRate);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"auction\", \"Player %u has no auction activity\
      \ recorded.\", playerId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve database queries to retrieve player-specific auction
    data. It should be used judiciously in performance-critical code paths. The returned
    metrics are typically cached or updated periodically to avoid excessive database
    load.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided playerGuid is valid and corresponds to an actual
    player in the game world, as invalid GUIDs may result in undefined behavior or
    empty metric structures. This method does not validate the existence of the player
    itself, only that the GUID format is correct.
