documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the positional index of a group member within the
    formation.
  description: The CalculateMemberPosition method determines the specific position
    index of a given FormationMember within a group's formation layout. This method
    is typically used in group-based gameplay mechanics, such as raid positioning
    or battlefield formations, where members need to be assigned specific locations
    relative to each other. The returned index represents the member's place in an
    ordered sequence, which can be used for pathfinding, visual rendering, or strategic
    positioning calculations. The method operates on a const object, ensuring no modification
    of internal state during calculation.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the calculated position index of the member within
    the formation. A negative value may indicate an error or invalid member, while
    positive values correspond to valid indices starting from zero.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GroupFormation formation;\nFormationMember member;\nint position = formation.CalculateMemberPosition(member);\n\
      if (position >= 0) {\n    // Valid position found\n    std::cout << \"Member\
      \ position: \" << position << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Error or invalid\
      \ member\n    std::cout << \"Failed to calculate position\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the FormationMember parameter is valid and properly
    initialized. The internal formation data structure must be consistent for accurate
    results. Performance may vary depending on the complexity of the formation layout.
