  class: Scenario
  method: CompleteStep
  signature: void Scenario::CompleteStep(const ScenarioStepEntry * step)
documentation:
  brief: Completes a specified scenario step, updating the scenario progress and triggering
    associated events.
  description: The CompleteStep method marks a given scenario step as completed within
    the current scenario instance. This action typically updates internal tracking
    data structures, triggers any associated quest events or rewards, and may advance
    the overall scenario state. The method is commonly invoked when a player fulfills
    the requirements of a specific step in a scenario, such as defeating a boss or
    collecting items. It ensures that the scenario progression logic accurately reflects
    the completion of the designated step.
  parameters:
  - name: step
    description: Pointer to the ScenarioStepEntry structure defining the step to be
      completed. Must not be null; the entry must correspond to a valid step within
      the active scenario.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Completing a Scenario Step
    code: "Scenario* scenario = player->GetScenario();\nconst ScenarioStepEntry* step\
      \ = sScenarioStepStore.LookupEntry(12345);\nif (step)\n{\n    scenario->CompleteStep(step);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active scenario instances. It assumes
    that the provided step is valid and part of the current scenario's structure.
    The implementation may internally update player progress, send updates to the
    client, and handle any associated quest or reward logic.
  warnings: Calling CompleteStep with a null pointer or an invalid step entry can
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the step parameter refers to
    a valid scenario step within the active scenario context before invoking this
    method.
