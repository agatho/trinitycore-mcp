documentation:
  brief: Populates update block data for a player's creation state in the game world.
  description: The BuildCreateUpdateBlockForPlayer method constructs an update block
    containing all necessary data to initialize a player's presence in the game world.
    This method is typically invoked during player login or when a player enters a
    zone where other players are present. It prepares the player's update data structure
    that will be sent to clients to represent the player's initial state, including
    appearance, stats, and other relevant attributes. The method populates the provided
    data buffer with serialized player information according to the World of Warcraft
    packet format.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array that will be populated with the update
      block data. This buffer must be large enough to hold all required update fields
      for the player.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target Player object whose creation state is being
      built. This represents the player whose update data is being constructed for
      another player's view.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in player login context
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    int updateData[MAX_UPDATE_FIELDS];\n\
      \    player->BuildCreateUpdateBlockForPlayer(updateData, player);\n    // Send\
      \ updateData to client\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage when adding a new player to a zone
    code: "void AddPlayerToZone(Player* newPlayer, Player* existingPlayer)\n{\n  \
      \  int updateBlock[1024];\n    newPlayer->BuildCreateUpdateBlockForPlayer(updateBlock,\
      \ existingPlayer);\n    // Send update block to existingPlayer's client\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core update system in TrinityCore and directly
    affects network traffic. The data buffer size should be sufficient to accommodate
    all player fields. This method is usually called internally by the core update
    mechanism, but may be invoked manually during special circumstances like zone
    transitions or custom player creation logic.
  warnings: Incorrectly sized data buffers can lead to memory corruption or client-side
    crashes. This method modifies the provided data array directly and should not
    be called with null pointers for either parameter. Improper usage can cause synchronization
    issues between server and client states.
