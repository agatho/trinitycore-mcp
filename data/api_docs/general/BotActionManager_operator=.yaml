documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one BotActionManager object to another
  description: The assignment operator for the BotActionManager class performs a deep
    copy of all member variables from the source BotActionManager object to the destination
    object. This operator ensures that both objects maintain independent copies of
    their data, preventing shared references that could lead to unexpected behavior
    or memory corruption. In the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this operation
    is crucial for duplicating bot action configurations and state information between
    different bot instances or during bot initialization processes.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotActionManager object whose contents will be copied
      to this object
  returns: A reference to the current BotActionManager object (this) after the assignment
    has been completed, enabling chained assignment operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Example
    code: 'BotActionManager manager1;

      BotActionManager manager2 = manager1; // Uses copy constructor

      // or

      manager2 = manager1; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'BotActionManager manager1, manager2, manager3;

      manager1 = manager2 = manager3; // Chained assignment

      // This is equivalent to:

      // manager1 = manager2;

      // manager2 = manager3;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The implementation should handle deep copying of all internal data structures
    to prevent memory sharing issues. The operator likely performs a member-wise assignment
    followed by any necessary resource management operations such as freeing existing
    resources and allocating new ones for the copied data.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this operator with objects that contain pointers
    or references to external resources, as improper implementation could lead to
    double-free errors or memory leaks. Ensure that all internal data structures properly
    handle copy semantics.
