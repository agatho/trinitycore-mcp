  class: World
  method: IsFFAPvPRealm
  signature: bool World::IsFFAPvPRealm() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current realm is configured as an FFAPvP (Free For
    All Player vs Player) realm.
  description: The IsFFAPvPRealm method checks if the world server's current realm
    configuration enables Free For All Player vs Player combat. This setting typically
    affects how PvP mechanics are handled, such as whether players can attack each
    other without restrictions or if they must be in specific zones to engage in PvP.
    The method returns a boolean value indicating the realm's FFAPvP status. This
    is commonly used for gameplay logic that needs to differentiate between standard
    PvP realms and FFAPvP realms, which often have different rules for player engagement,
    loot distribution, and arena mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the realm is configured as an FFAPvP realm; otherwise returns
    false. This indicates whether Free For All Player vs Player combat is enabled
    on this server instance.
  examples:
  - title: Check if current realm supports FFAPvP
    code: "if (sWorld->IsFFAPvPRealm()) {\n    // Enable FFAPvP specific gameplay\
      \ features\n    sLog->outString(\"FFAPvP realm detected.\");\n} else {\n   \
      \ // Default PvP behavior\n    sLog->outString(\"Standard PvP realm.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the server's configuration settings and does not dynamically
    change during runtime unless the configuration is updated. It is typically checked
    at server startup or when loading realm-specific settings.
