  class: GameObject
  method: RelocateStationaryPosition
  signature: void GameObject::RelocateStationaryPosition(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Moves a stationary GameObject to a new position within the world.
  description: This method relocates a stationary GameObject to a specified position
    in the world, updating its coordinates and potentially affecting its interaction
    with surrounding objects. The method is typically used during object spawning
    or movement updates where the GameObject's position needs to be adjusted without
    changing its state. It ensures that the GameObject maintains its stationary nature
    while updating its location data.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The new position coordinates for the GameObject, represented as a
      const reference to an integer value. This parameter defines where the GameObject
      should be relocated to within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();


      // Relocate the GameObject to a new position

      go->RelocateStationaryPosition(12345);


      // The GameObject now has updated coordinates'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the GameObject is in a stationary
    state, meaning it's not actively moving or animating. It updates the internal
    position data but does not trigger any movement-related events or animations.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause GameObjects to become disconnected
    from their intended world positions, potentially leading to visual glitches or
    game mechanics issues. Care should be taken when calling this method during object
    creation or movement updates.
