  method: SelectTankTarget
  signature: SelectionResult TargetSelector::SelectTankTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns the most appropriate tank target for an AI-controlled
    unit based on threat and proximity.
  description: The SelectTankTarget method determines the optimal target for a unit
    that is designated as a tank within the TrinityCore framework. This method evaluates
    the current threat list, considering factors such as aggro levels, distance, and
    target priority to select a suitable tank target. It is typically used by AI-controlled
    creatures or NPCs that need to maintain a specific target for combat purposes.
    The method ensures that the returned target is valid and appropriate for the unit's
    role in the encounter, adhering to game mechanics related to threat management
    and targeting behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: A SelectionResult object containing the GUID of the selected tank target,
    or an invalid GUID if no suitable target could be found. The SelectionResult may
    also indicate failure conditions such as invalid target state or out-of-range
    targets.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override {\n        SelectionResult target = SelectTankTarget();\n       \
      \ if (target.IsValid()) {\n            AttackStart(target.GetUnit());\n    \
      \    }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal threat management system of TrinityCore.
    It may return different results depending on the current state of the unit's threat
    list and the presence of valid targets within range. The method does not perform
    any direct combat actions but rather provides a target for the calling code to
    act upon.
  warnings: Ensure that the AI unit has proper threat management enabled before calling
    this method. If used in a context where targets are frequently changing, consider
    caching results or implementing additional checks to avoid unnecessary recalculations.
