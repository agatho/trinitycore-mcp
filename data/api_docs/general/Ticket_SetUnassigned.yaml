documentation:
  brief: Marks a ticket as unassigned, clearing the assigned GM and updating its status.
  description: The SetUnassigned method clears the currently assigned Game Master
    (GM) from a ticket, effectively marking it as unassigned. This action typically
    updates the ticket's status in the database and may trigger notifications to the
    ticket system. The method is commonly used when a GM needs to relinquish responsibility
    for a ticket or when a ticket requires reassignment to another GM. It ensures
    that the ticket can be picked up by other available GMs in the system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SetUnassigned
    code: "Ticket* ticket = sTicketMgr->GetTicketById(12345);\nif (ticket)\n{\n  \
      \  ticket->SetUnassigned();\n    // Ticket is now unassigned and available for\
      \ other GMs\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates the ticket's database entry to set the assigned
    GM ID to zero or null. It may also update timestamps or status fields depending
    on the implementation. The method should be called carefully as it affects ticket
    availability and assignment tracking.
  warnings: Calling SetUnassigned on a ticket that is already unassigned may have
    no effect, but could potentially cause unexpected behavior if not properly checked.
    Ensure proper validation before calling this method to avoid unintended consequences
    in ticket management.
