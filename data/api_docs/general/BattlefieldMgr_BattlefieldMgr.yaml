  brief: Moves a BattlefieldMgr object to another BattlefieldMgr instance.
  description: The BattlefieldMgr move constructor initializes a new BattlefieldMgr
    instance by transferring ownership of resources from an existing BattlefieldMgr
    rvalue reference. This constructor is typically used when BattlefieldMgr objects
    need to be moved rather than copied, which can improve performance by avoiding
    unnecessary resource duplication. In the context of TrinityCore's battlefield
    system, this allows for efficient management of battlefield instances during object
    creation and destruction scenarios. The move constructor ensures that the source
    object is left in a valid but unspecified state after the operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Moving a BattlefieldMgr instance
    code: 'BattlefieldMgr&& sourceMgr = std::move(battlefieldMgr);

      BattlefieldMgr newMgr(std::move(sourceMgr));'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a copy constructor. It transfers ownership
    of resources rather than copying them. After the move operation, the source object
    should not be used in any way that assumes it's still valid.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after calling this constructor results in
    undefined behavior. The source BattlefieldMgr object will be left in a valid but
    unspecified state.
