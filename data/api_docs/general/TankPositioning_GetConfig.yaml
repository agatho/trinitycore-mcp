  class: TankPositioning
  method: GetConfig
  signature: const TankPositionConfig & TankPositioning::GetConfig() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the configuration settings for tank positioning behavior.
  description: The GetConfig method returns a constant reference to the internal TankPositionConfig
    object that holds all configuration parameters for the tank positioning system.
    This configuration includes settings such as positioning radius, angle thresholds,
    and movement constraints used during AI-driven tank positioning logic. The returned
    reference is guaranteed to be valid for the lifetime of the TankPositioning instance
    and should not be modified directly. This method is typically called by other
    components within the AI system to retrieve current positioning parameters without
    exposing internal state modification.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the TankPositionConfig object containing all current
    tank positioning configuration settings. The reference remains valid for the lifetime
    of the TankPositioning instance and provides read-only access to configuration
    data.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Tank Positioning Configuration
    code: 'TankPositioning* positioning = ...;

      const TankPositionConfig& config = positioning->GetConfig();

      float radius = config.GetPositioningRadius();

      bool useAngleConstraint = config.UseAngleConstraint();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Configuration in AI Decision Making
    code: "void TankAI::UpdatePositioning()\n{\n    const TankPositionConfig& config\
      \ = m_positioning->GetConfig();\n    if (config.GetMaxDistance() > 10.0f)\n\
      \    {\n        // Perform positioning logic based on configuration\n      \
      \  MoveToPosition(config.GetTargetPosition());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to an internal configuration object that should
    not be modified directly. Any changes to the configuration should be made through
    dedicated setter methods or configuration loading mechanisms. This method is thread-safe
    as it only provides read access to immutable configuration data.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the returned TankPositionConfig reference directly,
    as this will lead to undefined behavior. Always use appropriate setter methods
    or configuration update procedures for modifying positioning parameters.
