  class: GroupCoordination
  method: ValidateCommand
  signature: bool GroupCoordination::ValidateCommand(const CoordinationCommandData
    & command)
documentation:
  brief: Validates a coordination command for group activities in World of Warcraft.
  description: The ValidateCommand method checks whether a given CoordinationCommandData
    object contains valid parameters and data for processing within the GroupCoordination
    system. It ensures that all required fields are present, properly formatted, and
    within acceptable ranges or constraints. This validation is crucial for maintaining
    consistency and preventing errors during group-based activities such as raids,
    dungeons, or battlegrounds where coordinated actions are essential. The method
    performs checks on command type, target identifiers, timing data, and other relevant
    fields to ensure the command can be safely executed by the group coordination
    framework.
  parameters:
  - name: command
    description: The CoordinationCommandData object containing the command to validate.
      This includes fields such as command type, target player GUIDs, timing information,
      and any associated data needed for group coordination.
  returns: Returns true if the command is valid and can be processed by the GroupCoordination
    system; returns false if validation fails due to missing data, invalid formats,
    or out-of-range values.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Command Validation
    code: 'GroupCoordination coordination;

      CoordinationCommandData cmd;

      cmd.type = CoordinationCommandType::GROUP_JOIN;

      cmd.targetGuids.push_back(12345);

      bool isValid = coordination.ValidateCommand(cmd);

      // isValid will be true if command is properly formed'
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation with Invalid Data
    code: 'GroupCoordination coordination;

      CoordinationCommandData cmd;

      cmd.type = CoordinationCommandType::INVALID_COMMAND;

      // Missing target GUIDs and other required fields

      bool isValid = coordination.ValidateCommand(cmd);

      // isValid will be false due to invalid command type and missing data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before executing any group coordination commands
    to prevent runtime errors. It performs basic validation checks but does not verify
    player permissions or group membership status. The validation logic may be extended
    in future versions to include more complex checks such as cooldown restrictions
    or role-based access control.
  warnings: Calling this method with an uninitialized CoordinationCommandData object
    may lead to undefined behavior. Always ensure that all required fields are properly
    set before calling ValidateCommand. Additionally, this method does not validate
    the actual context or state of the group, so further checks might be needed in
    complex scenarios.
