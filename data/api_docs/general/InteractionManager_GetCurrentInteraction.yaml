    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current interaction type of the specified bot player.
  description: The GetCurrentInteraction method returns the InteractionType enum value
    representing the ongoing interaction state of the given Player object. This method
    is typically used in AI systems to determine what kind of interaction or activity
    the bot is currently engaged in, such as trading, gossip, questing, or combat.
    The returned value helps control bot behavior and decision-making logic based
    on the current interaction context. This method does not modify any state and
    is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: An InteractionType enum value indicating the current interaction state
    of the player. Possible values may include IN_NONE, IN_TRADE, IN_GOSSIP, IN_QUEST,
    IN_COMBAT, etc., depending on the implementation and current activity of the bot.
  examples:
  - title: Check Current Interaction State
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized\nInteractionType current\
      \ = interactionManager.GetCurrentInteraction(bot);\nif (current == IN_GOSSIP)\n\
      {\n    // Handle gossip interaction\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on valid Player objects that are bots.
    The returned InteractionType value is determined by internal state tracking within
    the InteractionManager and may change dynamically as the bot's activities evolve.
