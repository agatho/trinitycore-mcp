  signature: int * TempSummon::GetSummonerUnit() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the summoner unit's unique identifier (GUID) for this
    temporary summon.
  description: The GetSummonerUnit method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of
    the unit that summoned this TempSummon instance. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework, summons are created by various game entities such as players, NPCs,
    or spells, and this method allows access to the summoner's identity. The returned
    pointer typically points to a uint64 value representing the GUID of the summoner.
    This is useful for tracking relationships between summoned creatures and their
    creators, especially in combat scenarios or when determining ownership for spell
    effects and loot distribution. The method is const, meaning it does not modify
    the TempSummon object's state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer (typically uint64) representing the GUID of the
    summoner unit. Returns nullptr if no summoner exists or if the summoner has been
    destroyed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check summoner GUID
    code: "if (TempSummon* summon = dynamic_cast<TempSummon*>(unit))\n{\n    uint64*\
      \ summonerGuid = summon->GetSummonerUnit();\n    if (summonerGuid && *summonerGuid\
      \ != 0)\n    {\n        // Use the summoner GUID for further logic\n       \
      \ sLog->outString(\"Summoned by unit with GUID: %u\", *summonerGuid);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned pointer may be null if the summoner has been destroyed or is
    not properly initialized. The method assumes that the TempSummon was created through
    a valid summoning mechanism and that the summoner information is still accessible
    in memory.
  warnings: Be cautious when dereferencing the returned pointer without checking for
    null, as accessing invalid memory can cause crashes. Also, ensure that the summoner
    unit is still alive and valid before using the GUID to prevent unexpected behavior.
