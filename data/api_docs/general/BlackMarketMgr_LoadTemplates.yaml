  method: LoadTemplates
  signature: void BlackMarketMgr::LoadTemplates()
documentation:
  brief: Loads black market item templates from the database into memory for use in
    the black market system.
  description: The LoadTemplates method initializes and populates the internal data
    structures of the BlackMarketMgr class with item template information retrieved
    from the database. This method is typically called during server startup or when
    the black market system needs to refresh its item listings. It ensures that all
    black market auctions are based on valid item templates, which define the properties,
    stats, and appearance of items available for auction. The method performs database
    queries to fetch template data and processes this information into an in-memory
    cache structure for fast access during auction operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeBlackMarket()\n{\n    sBlackMarketMgr->LoadTemplates();\n\
      \    // Black market templates are now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    a template refresh is required. It's not thread-safe and should be executed in
    the main thread context. The method may cause performance overhead on server startup
    due to database queries and data processing.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate template entries. Never call this method from within
    a hot path or high-frequency code section as it may block other operations.
