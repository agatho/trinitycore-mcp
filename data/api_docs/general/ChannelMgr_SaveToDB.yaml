documentation:
  brief: Saves channel information to the database
  description: The SaveToDB method persists all current channel data and configurations
    to the TrinityCore database. This includes channel names, owners, passwords, and
    member lists. The method is typically invoked during server shutdown or periodic
    synchronization to ensure that channel state is maintained across sessions. It
    operates on the internal channel manager's data structures and writes them to
    the appropriate database tables using the core database connection.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Shutdown
    code: "void World::UpdateWorldState()\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n    sChannelMgr->SaveToDB();\n\
      \    // ... continue shutdown process ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the server is in a state where database
    writes are safe and consistent. It may block during database I/O operations, so
    calling it from time-critical threads could impact performance.
