  class: UpdateFieldHolder
  method: HasChanged
  signature: bool UpdateFieldHolder::HasChanged(uint32 index) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specific update field at the given index has been modified
    since the last reset.
  description: The HasChanged method determines if a particular update field within
    the UpdateFieldHolder has been altered from its previous state. This is commonly
    used in World of Warcraft's packet system to efficiently determine which fields
    need to be sent to clients during object updates. The method typically works in
    conjunction with other update field management functions and relies on internal
    change tracking mechanisms. It returns true if the specified field has been marked
    as changed, and false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for optimizing
    network traffic by only sending updated data rather than full object states.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the update field at the specified index has been modified
    since the last reset or initialization; returns false if no changes have occurred
    or if the index is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (updateFieldHolder.HasChanged(5)) {\n    // Handle changed field\n \
      \   std::cout << \"Field 5 has been modified\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Fields
    code: "for (uint32 i = 0; i < updateFieldHolder.GetFieldCount(); ++i) {\n    if\
      \ (updateFieldHolder.HasChanged(i)) {\n        // Process changed field\n  \
      \      std::cout << \"Field \" << i << \" changed\" << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with UpdateFieldHolder's SetChanged
    and ResetChanged methods. The internal tracking mechanism uses bit flags or similar
    structures to efficiently store change state information for each field. Performance-wise,
    this operation is generally O(1) as it usually involves a simple bit check.
  warnings: Ensure that the index parameter is within valid bounds (0 to field count
    - 1) before calling this method, otherwise behavior may be undefined or result
    in an access violation. This method should not be called on uninitialized UpdateFieldHolder
    objects.
