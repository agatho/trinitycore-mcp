  method: HasEnoughMana
  signature: bool DruidAI::HasEnoughMana(int amount) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the Druid has enough mana to cast a spell or ability.
  description: The HasEnoughMana method evaluates whether the current Druid AI character
    possesses sufficient mana to execute a specified spell or ability. This method
    is typically used within the AI decision-making process to determine if a mana-intensive
    spell can be safely cast without causing the character to run out of resources.
    It performs a simple comparison between the character's current mana pool and
    the required mana amount, returning true if enough mana is available, false otherwise.
    The method does not modify any state and is purely a query operation.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of mana required for the spell or ability to be cast.
      Must be a non-negative integer representing the mana cost.
  returns: Returns true if the Druid's current mana is greater than or equal to the
    specified amount; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Selection
    code: "if (druidAI->HasEnoughMana(50)) {\n    // Cast a spell that costs 50 mana\n\
      \    druidAI->CastSpell(SPELL_MOONFIRE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Mana Check Before Healing
    code: "if (druidAI->HasEnoughMana(100) && target->GetHealthPercent() < 30) {\n\
      \    // Cast Rejuvenation on low health target\n    druidAI->CastSpell(SPELL_REJUVENATION);\n\
      } else {\n    // Fall back to a lower-cost ability\n    druidAI->CastSpell(SPELL_SHRED);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Druid AI character's mana value is properly
    updated and reflects the current state of the character. It does not account for
    mana regeneration or any temporary mana bonuses that might affect casting decisions.
