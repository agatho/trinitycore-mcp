documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads all available movement strategies for bot AI behavior.
  description: The LoadMovementStrategies method is responsible for initializing and
    loading all registered movement strategies that are used by the BotAI system in
    TrinityCore. This method sets up the internal data structures required for bots
    to make intelligent movement decisions based on their assigned roles, target positions,
    and environmental conditions. It typically iterates through available strategy
    types and registers them with the AI manager, ensuring that each bot can select
    appropriate movement behaviors such as pursuit, evasion, formation following,
    or pathfinding. The method is usually called during the initialization phase of
    the AI system and may be invoked when new strategies are added or when the AI
    system needs to refresh its movement capabilities.

    code: 'BotAIInitializer initializer;

      initializer.LoadMovementStrategies();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called once during the initialization of the BotAI
    system. It's important to ensure that all required strategy plugins are loaded
    before calling this method, as it may rely on external modules or configuration
    files for strategy definitions.
