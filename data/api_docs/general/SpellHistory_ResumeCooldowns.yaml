documentation:
  brief: Resumes all cooldowns in the spell history, allowing spells to be cast again.
  description: The ResumeCooldowns method resets the internal cooldown tracking for
    all spells within the SpellHistory instance. This function is typically used when
    a player or unit needs to have their cooldowns re-enabled after being temporarily
    disabled (e.g., during certain game effects like silence or polymorph). It effectively
    clears any active cooldown timers and makes all previously on-cooldown spells
    available for casting immediately. The method does not take any parameters and
    performs no validation, assuming that the caller has appropriate context for when
    this operation should occur.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Context
    code: "void Player::OnPolymorphEnd()\n{\n    // Resume all cooldowns after polymorph\
      \ effect ends\n    m_spellHistory->ResumeCooldowns();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Spell Cooldown Management
    code: "class Unit\n{\npublic:\n    void ResetAllSpellCooldowns()\n    {\n    \
      \    if (m_spellHistory)\n            m_spellHistory->ResumeCooldowns();\n \
      \   }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly manipulates internal cooldown state and should only
    be called when the spell history is in a consistent state. It's commonly used
    during debuff removal or status effect transitions where cooldowns are expected
    to resume immediately.
  warnings: Calling ResumeCooldowns without proper context may lead to unexpected
    behavior, such as allowing spells to be cast before intended cooldown periods
    have expired. Ensure that this method is only invoked when cooldown resumption
    is explicitly allowed by game mechanics.
