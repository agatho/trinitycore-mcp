documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the GuardianThrashTracker class for tracking
    guardian thrash abilities.
  description: The GuardianThrashTracker constructor initializes a new instance of
    the GuardianThrashTracker class. This class is designed to track and manage the
    thrash ability usage of guardians in World of Warcraft, particularly within the
    TrinityCore framework. It likely maintains internal state related to cooldowns,
    damage application, and ability tracking for guardian pets or summoned creatures.
    The initialization process sets up necessary data structures and default values
    required for tracking thrash mechanics during combat scenarios.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new GuardianThrashTracker instance
    code: 'GuardianThrashTracker tracker;

      // This creates a new tracker instance ready to monitor guardian thrash abilities'
    language: cpp
  notes: This appears to be a constructor method, so it should only be called during
    object instantiation. The class likely requires additional setup or initialization
    methods to properly configure tracking behavior for specific guardians or combat
    situations.
