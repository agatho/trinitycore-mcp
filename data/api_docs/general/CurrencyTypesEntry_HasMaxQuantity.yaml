    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the currency type has a maximum quantity defined.
  description: The HasMaxQuantity method checks if a specific currency type in the
    TrinityCore database has a defined maximum quantity limit. This is typically used
    to determine if a currency can be accumulated beyond a certain point, which is
    important for game balance and quest progression mechanics. The method may consider
    different loading states or version updates when evaluating whether a maximum
    quantity is set. Currency types with maximum quantities are often used for reputation
    rewards, achievement currencies, or limited-time event items.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the currency type has a defined maximum quantity; otherwise
    returns false. This indicates whether the currency is subject to accumulation
    limits in the game system.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Currency Has Maximum Quantity
    code: "const CurrencyTypesEntry* currencyEntry = sCurrencyTypesStore.LookupEntry(1234);\n\
      if (currencyEntry && currencyEntry->HasMaxQuantity()) {\n    // Currency has\
      \ a maximum quantity limit\n    printf(\"Currency %d has max quantity\\n\",\
      \ currencyEntry->ID);\n} else {\n    // Currency can be accumulated without\
      \ limit\n    printf(\"Currency %d has no max quantity\\n\", currencyEntry->ID);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal data structures of the CurrencyTypesEntry
    class and may perform checks based on database values or cached state. The 'onLoad'
    and 'onUpdateVersion' parameters suggest this method might behave differently
    during initial loading versus version update scenarios, though their exact implementation
    details are not visible in the signature.
