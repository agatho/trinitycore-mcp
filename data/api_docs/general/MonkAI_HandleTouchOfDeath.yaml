documentation:
  brief: Executes the Touch of Death ability for a Monk AI, applying damage and effects
    to target.
  description: The HandleTouchOfDeath method implements the core logic for the Monk's
    Touch of Death ability within the AI system. This method is responsible for calculating
    damage based on the Monk's current stats, applying the ability's effects such
    as health reduction or debuffs, and managing cooldowns or resource consumption.
    It typically interacts with the target entity to determine valid combat conditions
    and applies the appropriate game mechanics associated with this ability. The method
    assumes that all preconditions for using Touch of Death have been met, including
    proper targeting, resource availability, and combat readiness.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Monk AI Context
    code: "void SomeMonkAI::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    // Trigger Touch of Death when\
      \ entering combat\n    HandleTouchOfDeath();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Monk AI subsystem and should only be called during
    active combat scenarios. The implementation may vary depending on the specific
    Monk specialization (Mistweaver, Windwalker, etc.) as different specializations
    might modify how Touch of Death behaves.
  warnings: Ensure that the target entity is valid and within range before calling
    this method to prevent potential crashes or undefined behavior. This method does
    not perform any validation checks for target eligibility or resource availability
    internally.
