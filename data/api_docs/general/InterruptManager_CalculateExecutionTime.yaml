  class: InterruptManager
  method: CalculateExecutionTime
  signature: float InterruptManager::CalculateExecutionTime(InterruptMethod method)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the execution time for a specified interrupt method.
  description: The CalculateExecutionTime method determines the duration required
    to execute a given interrupt method within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    is typically used in combat systems to manage timing of abilities, spells, or
    actions that can be interrupted. It takes an InterruptMethod parameter which defines
    the type of interruption being calculated and returns a float value representing
    the time in seconds. The calculation may involve various game mechanics such as
    player speed, spell casting times, or system latency. This method is essential
    for maintaining synchronization between client and server during interruptible
    actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the execution time in seconds required to complete
    the specified interrupt method. Returns 0.0f if the interrupt method is invalid
    or not supported.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InterruptManager manager;

      float executionTime = manager.CalculateExecutionTime(INTERRUPT_METHOD_SPELL);

      printf("Spell interrupt execution time: %.2f seconds\n", executionTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Conditional Logic
    code: "InterruptManager manager;\nInterruptMethod method = GetPlayerCurrentInterruptMethod();\n\
      float time = manager.CalculateExecutionTime(method);\nif (time > 0.0f) {\n \
      \   // Proceed with interrupt logic\n    ApplyInterruptEffect(time);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle invalid interrupt method\n    LogError(\"Invalid interrupt\
      \ method specified\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal calculations based on game state and
    configuration values. The returned time may be affected by player buffs, debuffs,
    or server settings. Ensure that the InterruptMethod parameter is valid before
    calling to avoid unexpected results.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid InterruptMethod enum value may result
    in undefined behavior or return values. Always validate input parameters before
    use. This method should not be called during critical sections of combat logic
    where timing precision is crucial.
