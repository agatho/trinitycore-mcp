  class: TempSummon
  method: InitStats
  signature: void TempSummon::InitStats(int * summoner, int duration)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the statistics and duration for a temporary summon.
  description: The InitStats method sets up the initial state and behavior of a temporary
    summon, including its duration and connection to a summoner. This method is typically
    called during the creation or activation of a temporary summoned creature, such
    as a pet or minion, to configure its lifetime and establish relationships with
    its summoner. The method ensures that the summon behaves correctly within the
    game's time-based systems and maintains proper references to its owner.
  parameters:
  - name: summoner
    description: Pointer to the summoner's identifier or object reference, used to
      establish the relationship between the summon and its creator. This parameter
      is typically a pointer to an int or similar identifier type.
  - name: duration
    description: The time duration (in milliseconds) for which the temporary summon
      will exist before being automatically removed from the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of InitStats for a temporary summon
    code: 'TempSummon* summon = new TempSummon();

      int summonerId = 12345;

      int duration = 30000; // 30 seconds

      summon->InitStats(&summonerId, duration);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    a temporary summon is created. Developers should ensure that the summoner parameter
    points to a valid object or identifier before calling this method. The duration
    value must be a positive integer representing milliseconds.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the summoner pointer can lead to dangling references
    or undefined behavior. The duration parameter should not be set to zero or negative
    values, as it may cause unexpected removal of the summon immediately upon creation.
