  signature: void Map::InsertGameObjectModel(const GameObjectModel & model)
documentation:
  brief: Inserts a GameObjectModel into the map's spatial structure for collision
    and interaction handling.
  description: The InsertGameObjectModel method adds a GameObjectModel instance to
    the Map's internal spatial data structures, enabling proper collision detection,
    line-of-sight calculations, and object interaction within the game world. This
    method is typically invoked during the initialization or loading of game objects
    to ensure they are correctly integrated into the map's physical environment. The
    method does not validate whether the model is already present; it simply inserts
    it into the appropriate spatial containers. It is essential for maintaining accurate
    spatial relationships between static and dynamic game objects in TrinityCore's
    world simulation.
  parameters:
  - name: model
    description: A const reference to the GameObjectModel object to be inserted into
      the map. This model represents the physical boundaries and collision shape of
      a game object within the world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Object Creation
    code: 'GameObjectModel model = GameObjectModel(...);

      map->InsertGameObjectModel(model);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Map Initialization Context
    code: "void Map::LoadMapAndObjects()\n{\n    // ... load game objects ...\n  \
      \  for (auto& go : gameObjects)\n    {\n        if (go->GetModel())\n      \
      \      InsertGameObjectModel(*go->GetModel());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spatial partitioning system used by TrinityCore.
    It should be called after the GameObjectModel has been properly initialized with
    its bounding box and collision data. The insertion process may involve updating
    internal octree or similar spatial structures, which can have performance implications
    during high-frequency object creation scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method with an uninitialized or invalid GameObjectModel may
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the model's bounding box
    is properly set before insertion. Repeatedly inserting the same model without
    removal can cause memory leaks or incorrect spatial queries.
