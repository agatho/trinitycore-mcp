documentation:
  brief: Returns the name of the group event handler
  description: The GetHandlerName method retrieves the human-readable name associated
    with a GroupEventHandler instance. This name typically represents the type or
    purpose of the event handler within the group management system. The returned
    string is used for identification, logging, and debugging purposes to distinguish
    between different types of group event handlers. The method is const, ensuring
    it does not modify the internal state of the handler object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the name of the group event handler. This string
    is typically set during object initialization and represents a descriptive label
    for the handler's functionality.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GroupEventHandler* handler = new GroupEventHandler();

      std::string name = handler->GetHandlerName();

      printf("Handler name: %s\n", name.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Debugging Group Event Handlers
    code: "for (auto& eventHandler : groupEventHandlers)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Event\
      \ Handler: \" << eventHandler->GetHandlerName() << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in debugging scenarios and logging to identify
    which specific handler is processing a group event. The returned name should be
    unique or descriptive enough to distinguish between different handler types within
    the system.
