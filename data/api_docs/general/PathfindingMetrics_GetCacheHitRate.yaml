  method: GetCacheHitRate
  signature: float PathfindingMetrics::GetCacheHitRate() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the cache hit rate percentage for pathfinding operations.
  description: The GetCacheHitRate method computes the ratio of successful cached
    path lookups to total pathfinding requests. This metric is crucial for evaluating
    the efficiency of the pathfinding system's caching mechanism in TrinityCore. The
    returned value represents a floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0
    indicates perfect cache hit rate (all requests resolved from cache) and 0.0 indicates
    no cached results. This method is typically used for performance monitoring and
    optimization of AI pathfinding behavior in World of Warcraft environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the cache hit rate, where
    1.0 means all path requests were served from cache and 0.0 means no cached results
    were utilized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Pathfinding Efficiency
    code: "PathfindingMetrics metrics;\nfloat hitRate = metrics.GetCacheHitRate();\n\
      if (hitRate < 0.5f) {\n    // Warn about poor cache performance\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Warning: Low pathfinding cache hit rate: %.2f%%\", hitRate * 100);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integrating Cache Hit Rate into Performance Logging
    code: "void LogPathfindingStats() {\n    PathfindingMetrics metrics = sMap->GetPathfindingMetrics();\n\
      \    float hitRate = metrics.GetCacheHitRate();\n    sLog->outString(\"Pathfinding\
      \ Cache Hit Rate: %.2f%%\", hitRate * 100);\n    // Additional logging for debugging\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    cache hit rate calculation includes all pathfinding requests processed by the
    system, including both direct and indirect path lookups. The value returned should
    be interpreted as a performance indicator rather than an absolute measure of system
    health.
  warnings: The cache hit rate may fluctuate based on map complexity and AI behavior
    patterns. Consistently low values might indicate that pathfinding caching needs
    optimization or that the system is under heavy load with few reusable paths.
