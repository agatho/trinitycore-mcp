  signature: bool DangerZone::IsPositionInDanger(const int & pos, uint32 currentTime)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a given position is within a danger zone at the specified time.
  description: The IsPositionInDanger method determines whether a specific position,
    represented by an integer identifier, falls within any active danger zone at the
    provided current time. This method is typically used in game AI or event systems
    to evaluate player safety or trigger danger-related mechanics. It evaluates the
    internal state of the DangerZone class and returns true if the position is considered
    dangerous at the given time, otherwise false. The method does not modify any internal
    state and is designed to be a read-only query operation.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer identifier representing a position in the game world.
      This value is typically used as a lookup key or coordinate reference within
      the danger zone system.
  - name: currentTime
    description: A uint32 value representing the current time in milliseconds. This
      timestamp is used to determine if any danger zones are active at this point
      in time.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is within an active danger zone
    at the given time, otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a position is dangerous
    code: "uint32 currentTime = WorldTimer::getMSTime();\nint playerPosition = 12345;\n\
      bool isDangerous = dangerZone->IsPositionInDanger(playerPosition, currentTime);\n\
      if (isDangerous)\n{\n    // Handle dangerous position\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player is in a danger zone!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with dynamic time and position values
    code: "uint32 currentTime = WorldTimer::getMSTime();\nfor (int i = 0; i < 100;\
      \ ++i)\n{\n    if (dangerZone->IsPositionInDanger(i, currentTime))\n    {\n\
      \        // Process dangerous positions\n        sLog->outString(\"Position\
      \ %d is dangerous at time %u\", i, currentTime);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state of the DangerZone class to determine
    active zones. It assumes that positions and time values are valid and within expected
    ranges. The method is thread-safe if the underlying data structures are properly
    synchronized.
  warnings: Ensure that the pos parameter represents a valid position identifier used
    by the danger zone system, otherwise behavior may be undefined. Also, currentTime
    should reflect actual game time to ensure accurate results.
