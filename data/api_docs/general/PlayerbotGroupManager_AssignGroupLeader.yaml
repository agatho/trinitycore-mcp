  class: PlayerbotGroupManager
  method: AssignGroupLeader
  signature: void PlayerbotGroupManager::AssignGroupLeader(uint32 groupId, uint32
    newLeaderGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns a new group leader for the specified player bot group
  description: The AssignGroupLeader method updates the leadership of a player bot
    group by setting the specified GUID as the new leader. This method is typically
    used in player bot systems to manage group dynamics and ensure proper command
    hierarchy within bot-controlled groups. The method modifies internal group data
    structures to reflect the new leader assignment, potentially triggering updates
    to group permissions, loot distribution settings, and communication protocols.
    It's important to note that this method should only be called with valid group
    IDs and player GUIDs that exist within the current player bot system context.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: The unique identifier of the player bot group that requires a new
      leader assignment
  - name: newLeaderGuid
    description: The globally unique identifier of the player bot that will become
      the new group leader
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Leader Assignment
    code: 'PlayerbotGroupManager* groupMgr = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetGroupManager();

      uint32 groupId = 12345;

      uint32 newLeaderGuid = 67890;

      groupMgr->AssignGroupLeader(groupId, newLeaderGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Leader Assignment with Validation
    code: "PlayerbotGroupManager* groupMgr = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetGroupManager();\n\
      uint32 groupId = playerBot->GetGroupId();\nuint32 newLeaderGuid = playerBot->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      \nif (groupId > 0 && newLeaderGuid > 0)\n{\n    groupMgr->AssignGroupLeader(groupId,\
      \ newLeaderGuid);\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"playerbots\", \"Successfully assigned new\
      \ leader {} to group {}\", newLeaderGuid, groupId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the player bot framework and assumes that both
    the group ID and player GUID are valid and exist in the current system state.
    The implementation likely updates internal data structures such as group leader
    references, permissions, and potentially triggers UI updates or communication
    protocol changes. Performance is generally minimal since this is a simple assignment
    operation.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid group IDs or non-existent player GUIDs
    may result in undefined behavior or system instability. Ensure that the target
    group exists and the new leader is actually part of the group before calling this
    method. This method should not be called during critical operations where group
    integrity must be maintained.
