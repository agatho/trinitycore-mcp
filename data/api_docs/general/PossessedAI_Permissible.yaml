  class: PossessedAI
  method: Permissible
  signature: int PossessedAI::Permissible(const int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the permissiveness level of the possessed AI for a given creature.
  description: The Permissible method in PossessedAI is used to determine how permissive
    the AI is towards handling a specific creature. This method is typically called
    during AI assignment or initialization to decide whether this AI type should be
    applied to a particular creature. It returns an integer value that indicates the
    level of permissiveness, with higher values indicating greater willingness to
    accept the creature for possession. The method takes a pointer to an integer parameter
    which likely represents the creature's entry ID or some identifier used in the
    decision process.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the creature identifier or entry
      ID used to determine AI permissiveness. This value is typically used to check
      if the possessed AI should be assigned to a specific type of creature.
  returns: Returns an integer indicating the permissiveness level. Positive values
    suggest willingness to handle the creature, while negative values indicate refusal.
    Zero typically means neutral or default behavior. The exact meaning of different
    values may depend on the implementation and game context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Assignment
    code: "int PossessedAI::Permissible(const int* param0)\n{\n    if (param0 && *param0\
      \ == 12345) // Example creature ID\n        return PERMIT_BASE_PROACTIVE;\n\
      \    else\n        return PERMIT_BASE_UNCONDITIONAL;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore AI system and follows standard AI
    permissiveness conventions used throughout the codebase. The exact values returned
    should be consistent with other AI implementations in the game engine.
  warnings: Ensure that param0 is not null before dereferencing it to avoid segmentation
    faults. The return value semantics may vary depending on how the AI system interprets
    different permissiveness levels.
