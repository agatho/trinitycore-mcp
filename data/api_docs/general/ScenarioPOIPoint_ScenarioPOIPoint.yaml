  class: ScenarioPOIPoint
  method: ScenarioPOIPoint
  signature: void ScenarioPOIPoint::ScenarioPOIPoint(int32 x, int32 y, int32 z)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a ScenarioPOIPoint object with specified x, y, and z coordinates.
  description: The ScenarioPOIPoint constructor initializes a point of interest within
    a scenario context using the provided x, y, and z coordinates. This class is typically
    used to define locations in world scenarios such as quest objectives or interactive
    points. The coordinates represent spatial positioning in the game world, with
    x and y being horizontal coordinates and z being vertical elevation. This initialization
    method sets up the internal state of the object for use in scenario-based gameplay
    mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: Horizontal X coordinate representing the point's position in the
      game world
  - name: y
    description: Horizontal Y coordinate representing the point's position in the
      game world
  - name: z
    description: Vertical Z coordinate representing the point's elevation in the game
      world
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic ScenarioPOIPoint Initialization
    code: 'ScenarioPOIPoint poi(100, 200, 50);

      // Creates a point of interest at coordinates (100, 200, 50)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Multiple ScenarioPOIPoints
    code: 'std::vector<ScenarioPOIPoint> points;

      points.emplace_back(100, 150, 75);

      points.emplace_back(200, 250, 80);

      points.emplace_back(300, 350, 90);

      // Creates a collection of scenario points for quest objectives'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when loading scenario point data from database or WDT files. The coordinates are
    expected to be in the game world's coordinate system and may require conversion
    depending on the specific scenario context.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided coordinates are within valid ranges for the current
    map to avoid unexpected behavior. Improper coordinate values can lead to points
    being placed outside of the playable area or causing rendering issues.
