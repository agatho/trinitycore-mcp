documentation:
  brief: Deactivates the voidform state for the player, reverting any associated effects
    or modifications.
  description: The DeactivateVoidform method is responsible for ending the voidform
    state that a player may be in. Voidform is a special game state typically associated
    with certain class abilities or spells, such as those used by Shadow Priests.
    When this method is called, it removes the voidform effect from the player, restoring
    normal gameplay behavior and reverting any temporary stat changes or mechanics
    that were active during the voidform state. This method does not take any parameters
    and performs no return value operations. It is typically invoked internally by
    the game engine when the voidform duration expires or when a specific condition
    causes the state to be terminated early.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void DeactivateVoidform()\n{\n    // This method is called internally by\
      \ the game engine\n    // when voidform state needs to be ended.\n    // No\
      \ direct call is expected from external code.\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal gameplay mechanics and should not be
    directly invoked by external modules or scripts. It is designed to be called automatically
    by the TrinityCore engine when appropriate game events occur, such as spell expiration
    or state transitions.
