  class: MoveSpline
  method: next_timestamp
  signature: int32 MoveSpline::next_timestamp() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the timestamp of the next spline point in the movement spline.
  description: The next_timestamp method retrieves the absolute timestamp (in milliseconds)
    corresponding to the next point in the movement spline. This is used internally
    by the TrinityCore movement system to determine when the next waypoint or spline
    point should be reached during creature or player movement. The returned value
    represents a monotonic time reference, typically derived from the server's game
    tick or world update cycle. This method is essential for synchronizing movement
    animations and ensuring smooth path traversal across the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int32 value representing the absolute timestamp (in milliseconds) of
    the next spline point. This timestamp is typically compared against the current
    server time to determine if a movement update should occur.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Next Spline Timestamp
    code: "MoveSpline* spline = player->movespline;\nint32 nextTime = spline->next_timestamp();\n\
      if (nextTime > WorldTimer::getMSTime()) {\n    // Movement is scheduled for\
      \ the future\n    sLog->outString(\"Next movement point at %u\", nextTime);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during movement updates and relies on the
    internal state of the MoveSpline object. The returned timestamp may be zero if
    there are no more points in the spline or if the spline has not yet been initialized
    with valid data.
  warnings: Do not use this value directly for time calculations without considering
    potential overflow or server time synchronization issues. The timestamp is relative
    to the server's internal timer and should be compared against WorldTimer::getMSTime()
    for accurate comparisons.
