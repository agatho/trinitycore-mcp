documentation:
  brief: Processes trainer services for a player interacting with a trainer NPC.
  description: The ProcessTrainerServices method handles the interaction logic when
    a player engages with a trainer NPC in World of Warcraft. It manages the display
    and processing of available training services, including skill learning, spell
    teaching, and other trainer-related functionalities. This method typically validates
    the player's eligibility for training, checks prerequisites, and updates the trainer's
    service list based on the player's current state and progress. The method is part
    of the VendorInteraction class and is invoked during trainer interaction events
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the interacting player
      character. Must be a valid player instance with proper initialization.
  - name: trainerGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the trainer NPC that the player is interacting
      with. This value identifies which specific trainer should provide services.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trainer Interaction
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      uint32 trainerGuid = 12345; // GUID of the trainer NPC

      VendorInteraction vendorInteraction;

      vendorInteraction.ProcessTrainerServices(player, trainerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Complete Trainer Service Handling
    code: "void HandlePlayerTrainerInteraction(Player* player, uint32 trainerGuid)\n\
      {\n    if (!player || !trainerGuid)\n        return;\n    \n    VendorInteraction\
      \ vendorInteraction;\n    vendorInteraction.ProcessTrainerServices(player, trainerGuid);\n\
      \    \n    // Additional logic for handling training completion\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    a player initiates interaction with a trainer NPC. Developers should ensure that
    the player and trainer GUID are valid before calling this method. The implementation
    may involve database lookups for trainer services and player skill data.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the player object or
    trainer GUID can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the player
    is properly initialized and that the trainer exists in the world before invoking
    this method.
