  method: UpdateStats
  signature: bool Guardian::UpdateStats(int stat)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the statistics for a guardian unit, recalculating its attributes
    based on current state and modifiers.
  description: The UpdateStats method is responsible for recalculating and applying
    all relevant statistical values for a Guardian unit within the TrinityCore framework.
    This includes updating health, mana, armor, damage output, and other combat-related
    attributes that may be influenced by buffs, debuffs, level changes, or equipment
    modifications. The method typically gets invoked during combat updates, status
    changes, or when new modifiers are applied to the guardian. It ensures that the
    guardian's stats accurately reflect its current condition and capabilities in
    the game world. This method is crucial for maintaining game balance and ensuring
    that guardians behave consistently with their intended role and level.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the stat update was successful and all calculations completed
    without error; returns false if an error occurred during the update process or
    if the guardian object is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guardian Stat Update
    code: "Guardian* guardian = player->GetGuardian();\nif (guardian)\n{\n    bool\
      \ success = guardian->UpdateStats();\n    if (success)\n        TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      entities.guardian\", \"Guardian stats updated successfully.\");\n    else\n\
      \        TC_LOG_ERROR(\"entities.guardian\", \"Failed to update guardian stats.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may trigger additional internal recalculations for dependent
    systems such as combat calculations, threat generation, and AI behavior updates.
    It should not be called excessively during high-frequency operations like combat
    loops without proper throttling to avoid performance degradation.
  warnings: Calling UpdateStats on a null or destroyed guardian object will likely
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate the guardian pointer
    before calling this method.
