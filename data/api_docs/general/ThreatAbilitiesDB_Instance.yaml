  signature: ThreatAbilitiesDB & ThreatAbilitiesDB::Instance()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the ThreatAbilitiesDB class for managing
    threat-related ability data.
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the ThreatAbilitiesDB
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the database exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is used to access the global threat abilities database
    which stores information about various threat-generating abilities in the game.
    The returned reference provides access to methods for querying and managing threat-related
    ability definitions, such as their IDs, threat values, and associated effects.
    This database is typically initialized during server startup and populated with
    data from configuration files or database tables.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the single global instance of the ThreatAbilitiesDB class.
    This reference can be used to access all methods and data within the threat abilities
    database.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the Threat Abilities Database
    code: "ThreatAbilitiesDB& threatDB = ThreatAbilitiesDB::Instance();\nuint32 threatValue\
      \ = threatDB.GetThreatForAbility(12345);\nif (threatValue > 0)\n{\n    // Process\
      \ threat value\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it's designed to be called from multiple threads
    during server operation. The singleton instance is created on first access and
    persists for the lifetime of the application. Developers should not attempt to
    create additional instances of ThreatAbilitiesDB directly.
