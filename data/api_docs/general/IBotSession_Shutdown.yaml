  method: Shutdown
  signature: void IBotSession::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the shutdown sequence for the bot session, cleaning up resources
    and terminating active operations.
  description: The Shutdown method is responsible for gracefully terminating a bot
    session by releasing all allocated resources, stopping ongoing activities, and
    ensuring proper cleanup of internal state. This method should be called when a
    bot session needs to be terminated, either due to user request, system shutdown,
    or error conditions. It typically handles deinitialization tasks such as disconnecting
    from the game server, saving any pending data, and notifying other components
    about the session termination. The method is designed to be idempotent, meaning
    it can safely be called multiple times without causing adverse effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: "IBotSession* session = GetBotSession();\nif (session)\n{\n    session->Shutdown();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Shutdown with Error Handling
    code: "IBotSession* session = GetBotSession();\nif (session)\n{\n    try\n   \
      \ {\n        session->Shutdown();\n    }\n    catch (const std::exception& e)\n\
      \    {\n        // Log error or handle exception\n        sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to shutdown bot session: %s\", e.what());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    a bot is removed or when the system is shutting down. Developers should not call
    this method directly unless implementing custom session management logic. The
    shutdown process may take some time to complete as it waits for ongoing operations
    to finish.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown on an already shut down session may result in undefined
    behavior if the implementation does not properly handle idempotent calls. Ensure
    that no references to the session remain after calling this method to prevent
    dangling pointer issues.
