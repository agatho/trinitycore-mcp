  class: CombatStateAnalyzer
  method: IsUnitDangerous
  signature: bool CombatStateAnalyzer::IsUnitDangerous(Unit * unit) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified unit poses a significant threat to the player
    or NPC in combat.
  description: The IsUnitDangerous method evaluates various factors to determine if
    a given unit is considered dangerous within the context of combat. This includes
    assessing the unit's health, attack power, threat level, and other relevant combat
    attributes. The method is typically used by AI systems to make decisions about
    engagement, avoidance, or targeting strategies. It considers both immediate physical
    threats and potential future actions that could impact the current combat state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is deemed dangerous based on combat analysis criteria;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "if (analyzer.IsUnitDangerous(targetUnit)) {\n    // Initiate defensive\
      \ measures or flee\n    player->SetReactState(REACT_DEFENSIVE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Threat Management System
    code: "void CombatManager::EvaluateThreat(Unit* unit) {\n    if (analyzer.IsUnitDangerous(unit))\
      \ {\n        // Add to high-priority threat list\n        highThreatUnits.push_back(unit);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Consider for low-priority handling\n        lowThreatUnits.push_back(unit);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs multiple checks including unit health percentage,
    damage output calculations, and threat metrics. It may also consider the unit's
    current combat stance, buffs/debuffs, and proximity to the player. The implementation
    is probably optimized for frequent calls during combat updates.
  warnings: The method should not be called with null pointers; ensure that the Unit
    pointer is valid before invoking this function. This method might have performance
    implications if used excessively in tight loops or without caching results.
