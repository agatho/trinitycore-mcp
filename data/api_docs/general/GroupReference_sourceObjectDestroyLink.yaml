documentation:
  brief: Destroys the link between a group reference and its source object.
  description: The GroupReference::sourceObjectDestroyLink method is responsible for
    breaking the association between a GroupReference instance and its underlying
    source object. This typically occurs when the source object (such as a player
    or creature) is being removed from a group, ensuring that the reference no longer
    points to invalid memory. The method is part of the internal management system
    for group references within TrinityCore's core architecture, helping maintain
    data integrity during group operations like member removal or group destruction.

  - title: Basic usage in group member removal
    code: "void RemoveGroupMember(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->GetGroup())\n\
      \    {\n        GroupReference* ref = player->GetGroup()->GetMemberRef(player->GetGUID());\n\
      \        if (ref)\n        {\n            ref->sourceObjectDestroyLink(); //\
      \ Breaks the reference link\n            player->SetGroup(NULL);\n        }\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the group management system
    when a group member is removed or when a group is being destroyed. It ensures
    that dangling references are not left behind, which could lead to memory access
    violations or undefined behavior.
