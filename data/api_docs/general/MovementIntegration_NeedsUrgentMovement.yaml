  signature: bool MovementIntegration::NeedsUrgentMovement()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether urgent movement is required for the current AI state
  description: This method evaluates the current movement state of an NPC or creature
    within the TrinityCore framework to determine if immediate, high-priority movement
    actions are necessary. It typically checks conditions such as combat readiness,
    threat level, pathfinding urgency, or player proximity that would require the
    entity to move immediately rather than following standard movement patterns. The
    result influences how the AI scheduler handles movement updates and can affect
    performance by prioritizing critical movement operations over routine ones.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if urgent movement is required based on current AI state conditions,
    false otherwise. This indicates that the entity's movement should be processed
    with higher priority in the next update cycle.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGeneratorType()\
      \ != IDLE_MOTION_TYPE)\n        return;\n\n    if (MovementIntegration::NeedsUrgentMovement())\n\
      \    {\n        // Initiate immediate movement behavior\n        me->GetMotionMaster()->MovePoint(0,\
      \ targetPosition);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often used internally by the AI system to optimize movement
    scheduling. It may be called frequently during AI updates and should ideally have
    minimal computational overhead to avoid performance bottlenecks in high-density
    areas.
