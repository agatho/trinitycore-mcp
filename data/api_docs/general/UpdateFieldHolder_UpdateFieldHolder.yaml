  signature: void UpdateFieldHolder::UpdateFieldHolder()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new UpdateFieldHolder instance with default values and prepares
    it for use in object update operations.
  description: The UpdateFieldHolder constructor initializes a new instance of the
    UpdateFieldHolder class, which is responsible for managing and organizing update
    fields used in World of Warcraft's packet-based object updates. This class typically
    holds information about which fields of an object have changed and need to be
    sent to clients. The constructor sets up internal data structures necessary for
    tracking field changes, ensuring that subsequent operations like building update
    packets or applying updates can function correctly. It prepares the holder for
    use in TrinityCore's update system without requiring additional initialization
    steps.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic instantiation of UpdateFieldHolder
    code: 'UpdateFieldHolder holder;

      // The holder is now ready to be used for tracking object field updates

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any expensive operations or network I/O.
    It simply initializes internal state structures. The actual update field data
    management happens through other methods in the class, such as SetField(), GetField(),
    and BuildUpdateData().
