  brief: Gives the player a specified level and updates their experience accordingly
  description: The GiveLevel method sets the player's level to the specified value,
    automatically adjusting their experience points to match the new level. This method
    is commonly used in development and testing scenarios where players need to be
    quickly leveled up or down. It ensures that the player's experience and level
    are properly synchronized, maintaining game balance and progression. The method
    also handles updating the player's stats and abilities based on the new level.

  - name: level
    description: The target level to set for the player. Must be between 1 and 255,
      with values outside this range causing undefined behavior or errors.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Level Setting Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->GiveLevel(60);

    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Level Setting with Experience Adjustment
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->GiveLevel(70);

      // Player is now level 70 with adjusted experience points'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be used in controlled development environments as
    it bypasses normal game progression rules. It may cause issues if used during
    gameplay without proper consideration of experience requirements and stat adjustments.
  warnings: Using this method outside of development scenarios can lead to game balance
    issues and unexpected behavior. It should not be used for regular gameplay unless
    explicitly intended by game design.
