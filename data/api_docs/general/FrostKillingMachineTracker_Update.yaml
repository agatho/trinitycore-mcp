  class: FrostKillingMachineTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void FrostKillingMachineTracker::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the frost killing machine tracker state for the specified player
    bot.
  description: The Update method in the FrostKillingMachineTracker class is responsible
    for refreshing and maintaining the tracking state of frost-related killing machines
    or effects associated with a given player bot. This method likely evaluates the
    current status of the bot's environment, checks for active frost mechanics, and
    updates internal data structures to reflect any changes in the game state. It
    may be invoked during AI decision-making cycles or when specific events occur
    that affect frost-based gameplay elements such as frost traps, ice barriers, or
    frost damage applications.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose frost killing
      machine state needs to be updated. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void AIUpdate()\n{\n    FrostKillingMachineTracker tracker;\n    Player*\
      \ myBot = GetPlayerBot();\n    tracker.Update(myBot);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called frequently during bot AI processing, so performance
    considerations should be taken into account. The implementation may involve checking
    multiple game states and could potentially have side effects on other systems
    if not properly synchronized.
