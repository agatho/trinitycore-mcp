  brief: Resets a door or button GameObject to its original state after being activated.
  description: The ResetDoorOrButton method restores a GameObject that represents
    a door or button to its initial state, typically resetting it to the 'closed'
    state and clearing any active timers or states that were set during activation.
    This method is commonly used in game mechanics where doors or buttons need to
    be reset after being triggered, such as in dungeon encounters or quest events.
    It ensures that the GameObject's state is properly reset for subsequent interactions.

    method may not be called directly in most cases, as it is usually invoked through
    internal game mechanics or by the TrinityCore framework itself.
