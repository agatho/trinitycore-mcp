documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified item ID corresponds to an Azerite item.
  description: The IsAzeriteItem method checks if a given item ID represents an Azerite
    item in the World of Warcraft database. Azerite items are special gear items introduced
    in the Legion expansion that can be upgraded with Azerite powers. This method
    queries internal DB2 data structures to determine if the provided item ID is associated
    with an Azerite-based item, such as weapons or armor that can be enhanced through
    the Azerite system. The method is commonly used during item processing, validation,
    and UI display logic where special handling for Azerite items is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified item ID corresponds to an Azerite item; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (sDB2Manager->IsAzeriteItem(12345)) {\n    // Handle Azerite item\n\
      \    printf(\"Item is an Azerite item\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Item Processing
    code: "void ProcessPlayerItem(uint32 itemId) {\n    if (sDB2Manager->IsAzeriteItem(itemId))\
      \ {\n        // Apply Azerite-specific logic\n        HandleAzeriteItem(itemId);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Standard item processing\n        HandleRegularItem(itemId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal DB2 database lookups and should be used judiciously
    in performance-critical code paths. The implementation likely caches results for
    frequently accessed item IDs to improve performance.
  warnings: Ensure that the itemId parameter is valid before calling this method,
    as invalid item IDs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. This
    method should not be called with item IDs that are not present in the game's item
    database.
