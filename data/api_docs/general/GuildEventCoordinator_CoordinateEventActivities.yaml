  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: CoordinateEventActivities
  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::CoordinateEventActivities(int * leader, uint32
    eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates guild event activities by managing leader assignments and event
    execution based on provided event ID.
  description: The CoordinateEventActivities method is responsible for orchestrating
    the execution of guild events within the TrinityCore framework. It takes a pointer
    to an integer representing the current event leader and a unique event identifier,
    then processes the necessary logic to ensure proper coordination of activities
    such as quest assignments, rewards distribution, or event participation tracking.
    This method likely interacts with internal guild systems to maintain synchronization
    between players, event states, and leadership roles. The function operates within
    the context of World of Warcraft's guild management system and is designed to
    handle concurrent event processing while ensuring data consistency.
  parameters:
  - name: leader
    description: Pointer to an integer that represents the current leader of the guild
      event. This value may be modified during execution to reflect updated leadership
      status or may remain unchanged if no leadership change is required.
  - name: eventId
    description: A unique 32-bit unsigned integer identifier for the specific guild
      event being coordinated. This ID determines which event-specific logic will
      be executed and ensures proper handling of different types of guild activities.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int currentLeader = 1001;

      uint32 eventId = 5001;

      GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.CoordinateEventActivities(&currentLeader, eventId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Leadership
    code: "int leaderId = 0;\nuint32 eventTypeId = 5005;\nGuildEventCoordinator coordinator;\n\
      coordinator.CoordinateEventActivities(&leaderId, eventTypeId);\n// After execution,\
      \ leaderId may have been updated to reflect new event leadership\nif (leaderId\
      \ != 0) {\n    // Proceed with event-specific logic using updated leader\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger guild event management system and
    may involve internal state tracking. It should be called from within a thread-safe
    context when dealing with concurrent guild operations. The leader parameter is
    passed by reference, meaning the actual value stored at that memory location can
    be modified during execution.
  warnings: Ensure that the eventId parameter corresponds to a valid registered event
    type; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. The leader pointer must not be
    null or point to invalid memory. Improper handling of the leader reference could
    lead to incorrect leadership assignments or crashes.
