  class: FlightMasterManager
  method: CalculateDistance
  signature: float FlightMasterManager::CalculateDistance(const TaxiNodesEntry * from,
    const TaxiNodesEntry * to) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the Euclidean distance between two taxi nodes in the game world.
  description: The CalculateDistance method computes the straight-line distance between
    two TaxiNodesEntry objects, which represent flight path nodes in World of Warcraft.
    This calculation is used internally by the FlightMasterManager to determine travel
    distances for taxi services. The method takes into account the X, Y, and Z coordinates
    of both nodes to compute a 3D Euclidean distance. It's primarily utilized when
    calculating flight times, costs, or validating taxi routes within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters:
  - name: from
    description: Pointer to the TaxiNodesEntry representing the starting node of the
      flight path.
  - name: to
    description: Pointer to the TaxiNodesEntry representing the destination node of
      the flight path.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the Euclidean distance between the two
    taxi nodes in game units. A return value of 0.0 indicates that both nodes are
    at the same location.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to calculate flight distance
    code: 'const TaxiNodesEntry* startNode = sTaxiNodesStore.LookupEntry(1234);

      const TaxiNodesEntry* endNode = sTaxiNodesStore.LookupEntry(5678);

      float distance = flightMaster->CalculateDistance(startNode, endNode);

      // distance now contains the calculated 3D distance between nodes'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using distance for flight time calculation
    code: 'const TaxiNodesEntry* fromNode = sTaxiNodesStore.LookupEntry(1001);

      const TaxiNodesEntry* toNode = sTaxiNodesStore.LookupEntry(1002);

      float distance = flightMaster->CalculateDistance(fromNode, toNode);

      // Assuming average flight speed of 1400 units/sec

      float flightTime = distance / 1400.0f;

      // flightTime represents estimated travel time in seconds'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple 3D Euclidean distance calculation using the
    formula sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 + (z2-z1)^2). The coordinates are assumed to
    be in the same coordinate system. The method does not account for terrain height
    differences or actual flight paths, only straight-line distances. It's designed
    to be fast and efficient for frequent use during taxi route calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that both TaxiNodesEntry pointers are valid and non-null before
    calling this method, as passing null pointers will result in undefined behavior.
    The method assumes the nodes exist in the same map/zone; cross-zone distances
    may not be accurately represented without additional processing.
