  signature: int PathfindingManager::AdjustPathForGroupAvoidance(const int & intended,
    const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts a path to avoid group members during movement calculations
  description: The AdjustPathForGroupAvoidance method modifies an intended path to
    prevent collision with group members in the game world. This method is typically
    used by the pathfinding system to ensure that units moving as part of a group
    do not obstruct each other's movement. It evaluates the current path and adjusts
    it based on the positions and movement patterns of nearby group members, taking
    into account their avoidance zones and movement priorities. The method returns
    an adjustment value that indicates how much the path should be modified to maintain
    group cohesion while avoiding collisions.
  parameters:
  - name: intended
    description: The intended path index or identifier that represents the original
      planned route for movement
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier that specifies which group members should be
      considered when calculating avoidance paths
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the adjusted path index or offset.
    A positive value indicates a forward adjustment, a negative value indicates a
    backward adjustment, and zero indicates no adjustment was needed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Adjustment
    code: "int adjustedPath = pathfinder->AdjustPathForGroupAvoidance(5, 12345);\n\
      if (adjustedPath != 5) {\n    // Path was modified to avoid group members\n\
      \    printf(\"Adjusted path from %d to %d\\n\", 5, adjustedPath);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Group Avoidance in Movement Logic
    code: "void Unit::MoveAlongPath() {\n    int currentPath = GetIntendedPath();\n\
      \    int groupId = GetGroup()->GetId();\n    int adjustedPath = pathfinder->AdjustPathForGroupAvoidance(currentPath,\
      \ groupId);\n    if (adjustedPath != currentPath) {\n        SetCurrentPath(adjustedPath);\n\
      \        MoveToPath(adjustedPath);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's advanced pathfinding system and
    is typically called during movement updates. It requires that both the intended
    path and group data are valid. The implementation may involve complex collision
    detection algorithms and could impact performance if called frequently on large
    groups.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid path or group identifiers can lead to
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the path indices are within valid bounds and that
    group members exist before calling this method.
