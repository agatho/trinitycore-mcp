documentation:
  brief: Updates the frost death knight's buffs and aura states based on current combat
    conditions and spell effects.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing all
    active buff states and auras specific to the frost death knight class. This includes
    checking for ongoing effects such as Frost Presence, Howling Blast procs, Icy
    Talons, and other frost-related enhancements that modify the player's stats or
    abilities. The method evaluates the current state of the character's buffs and
    applies necessary updates to ensure accurate representation of their combat capabilities.
    It typically runs during each AI update cycle or when specific conditions are
    met, such as after casting spells or taking damage.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void FrostDeathKnight::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    UpdateBuffs();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system and should not
    be invoked manually in most cases. The implementation likely checks for spell
    cooldowns, aura durations, and combat state changes to determine which buffs need
    updating or refreshing.
