  class: RoleAssignment
  method: SetRoleAssignmentStrategy
  signature: void RoleAssignment::SetRoleAssignmentStrategy(Group * group, RoleAssignmentStrategy
    strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the role assignment strategy for a specified group in TrinityCore.
  description: The SetRoleAssignmentStrategy method configures how roles are assigned
    within a group, determining the algorithm or system used to distribute roles such
    as tank, healer, and damage dealer among group members. This is essential for
    maintaining proper group composition during dungeon, raid, or battleground encounters
    where role distribution affects gameplay balance and efficiency. The method operates
    on a Group object and applies the specified strategy immediately without requiring
    additional actions from the caller.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object for which the role assignment strategy
      will be set. Must not be null.
  - name: strategy
    description: The RoleAssignmentStrategy enum value specifying the desired role
      assignment algorithm. Valid values include strategies like ROUND_ROBIN, LEADER_CHOICE,
      or RANDOM depending on implementation.
  returns: None. This method does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Setting Round Robin Role Assignment
    code: 'Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();

      RoleAssignmentStrategy strategy = ROLE_ASSIGNMENT_ROUND_ROBIN;

      RoleAssignment::SetRoleAssignmentStrategy(myGroup, strategy);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Leader Choice Strategy for Raid Group
    code: "if (player->GetGroup() && player->GetGroup()->isRaidGroup()) {\n    RoleAssignment::SetRoleAssignmentStrategy(player->GetGroup(),\
      \ ROLE_ASSIGNMENT_LEADER_CHOICE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the Group object and affects all
    subsequent role assignments within that group. It is typically called during group
    creation or configuration, but can also be invoked dynamically if needed. Ensure
    that the provided Group pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Passing a null Group pointer will result in undefined behavior or crash.
    Always verify that the group exists and is properly initialized before invoking
    this function. Changing strategies mid-encounter may lead to inconsistent role
    states among players.
