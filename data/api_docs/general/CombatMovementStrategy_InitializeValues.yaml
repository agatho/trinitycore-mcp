documentation:
  brief: Initializes combat movement strategy values for AI behavior.
  description: The InitializeValues method sets up default configuration parameters
    and internal state variables for the CombatMovementStrategy class. This method
    is typically called during the initialization phase of an AI-controlled unit's
    combat behavior, establishing baseline values for movement patterns, distance
    thresholds, and positioning logic. It ensures that all necessary variables are
    properly configured before the strategy begins influencing the unit's movement
    decisions in combat situations.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'CombatMovementStrategy strategy;

      strategy.InitializeValues();

      // Strategy is now ready for use in combat AI'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the object's initialization
    lifecycle. Repeated calls may result in undefined behavior or reset important
    state variables. The method does not perform any runtime calculations but rather
    sets up static configuration values.
