  method: Update

documentation:
  brief: Updates the terrain manager's internal state based on the elapsed game time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and maintaining the
    terrain data within the TerrainMgr class. It typically handles tasks such as updating
    terrain-based game objects, managing terrain loading/unloading, and synchronizing
    terrain-related systems with the game loop. This method is called regularly by
    the core game loop to ensure terrain state remains consistent with the current
    game time and world conditions. The implementation likely processes queued terrain
    operations, updates dynamic terrain elements, and may handle LOD (Level of Detail)
    calculations for terrain rendering.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = getMSTime();\n    sTerrainMgr->Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game loop and should not be
    called directly by other systems unless specifically required. The 'diff' parameter
    represents milliseconds since last update, which is crucial for time-based terrain
    calculations.
