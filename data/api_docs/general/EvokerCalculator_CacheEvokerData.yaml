  method: CacheEvokerData
  signature: void EvokerCalculator::CacheEvokerData()
documentation:
  brief: Caches evoker-specific data for performance optimization and future calculations.
  description: The CacheEvokerData method prepares and stores essential evoker-related
    information in memory for efficient access during gameplay. This typically involves
    gathering spell data, cooldowns, resource levels, and other relevant statistics
    that are frequently referenced by the evoker's AI or gameplay logic. The caching
    mechanism helps reduce redundant database queries or complex calculations during
    active combat or spell casting sequences. This method is usually invoked when
    an evoker object is initialized or when significant state changes occur that require
    updated data to be stored for quick retrieval.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Evoker Initialization
    code: 'EvokerCalculator calculator;

      calculator.CacheEvokerData(); // Caches all necessary evoker data upon initialization'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after an evoker's initial state is set but before
    gameplay begins. It may perform expensive operations such as database lookups
    or complex calculations, so it's recommended to call this only when necessary
    rather than on every game tick.
  warnings: Do not call this method during active combat or spell casting sequences
    unless absolutely required, as it may cause performance hiccups or unexpected
    behavior if the evoker state changes mid-calculation.
