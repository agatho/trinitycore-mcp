  signature: bool LootStore::HaveQuestLootFor(uint32 loot_id) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specific loot entry has quest-related loot items associated
    with it.
  description: The HaveQuestLootFor method determines if a given loot ID in the LootStore
    contains any items that are flagged as quest loot. This is used internally by
    the TrinityCore server to manage quest item drops and ensure proper quest progression
    mechanics. The method performs a lookup within the loot store's internal data
    structures to verify the presence of quest-specific loot entries for the provided
    loot identifier.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified loot ID has associated quest loot items;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check for Quest Loot
    code: "LootStore* lootStore = sLootMgr->GetLootStore(LOOT_TYPE_CREATURE);\nif\
      \ (lootStore->HaveQuestLootFor(12345)) {\n    // Process quest loot logic\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Loot ID 12345 contains quest loot.\");\n} else {\n  \
      \  sLog->outString(\"Loot ID 12345 does not contain quest loot.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during loot generation and quest item validation
    processes. It relies on internal loot store data structures that are populated
    at server startup from database entries.
