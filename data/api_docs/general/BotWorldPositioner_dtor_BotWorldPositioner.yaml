  method: ~BotWorldPositioner
  signature: void BotWorldPositioner::~BotWorldPositioner()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BotWorldPositioner instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotWorldPositioner class is responsible for
    releasing any memory or system resources that were allocated during the object's
    lifetime. This method ensures proper cleanup of internal data structures and prevents
    memory leaks when a BotWorldPositioner instance is destroyed. In the context of
    TrinityCore's AI bot system, this destructor may handle cleanup of position tracking
    data, pathfinding caches, or other bot-specific world interaction state. The method
    is automatically invoked when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of BotWorldPositioner instance
    code: 'BotWorldPositioner* positioner = new BotWorldPositioner();

      // ... use the positioner ...

      delete positioner; // Triggers ~BotWorldPositioner()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime when an object
    is destroyed. Developers should not manually invoke this method unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. The destructor should be noexcept to prevent
    exceptions during stack unwinding.
