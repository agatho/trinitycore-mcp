documentation:
  brief: Records a grid scan duration for spatial query performance monitoring.
  description: The RecordGridScan method logs the time taken to perform a grid scan
    operation within the spatial query system. This method is typically used for performance
    profiling and optimization of spatial queries in the TrinityCore server. It records
    the duration in microseconds and contributes to overall metrics tracking for grid-based
    spatial operations. The method does not affect gameplay mechanics directly but
    provides valuable data for developers to analyze and improve query efficiency.

  - title: Basic Usage in Performance Monitoring
    code: 'SpatialQueryMetrics metrics;

      metrics.RecordGridScan(1500); // Records a 1500 microsecond grid scan duration'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spatial query metrics system and should be called
    after completing a grid scan operation. The recorded time values contribute to
    aggregate statistics used for performance analysis and optimization decisions.
