  class: InteractionManager
  method: GetInteractionTarget
  signature: int * InteractionManager::GetInteractionTarget(Player * bot) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the interaction target identifier for a specified bot player.
  description: The GetInteractionTarget method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID)
    of the current interaction target associated with the provided bot player. This
    method is typically used in AI-driven bot behavior to determine which object or
    entity the bot is currently interacting with, such as a questgiver, vendor, or
    NPC. The returned value represents the GUID of the target entity, which can be
    used to fetch detailed information about the interaction target from the game
    world. The method assumes that an interaction has been established and may return
    null if no valid interaction target exists.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the current interaction
    target. Returns nullptr if no interaction target is set or available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized\nint* targetGuid = interactionManager->GetInteractionTarget(bot);\n\
      if (targetGuid != nullptr) {\n    uint64 guid = *targetGuid;\n    // Use the\
      \ GUID to retrieve the actual target object\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the InteractionManager class and is typically used
    in conjunction with other AI-related systems to manage bot interactions. The returned
    pointer should be checked for null before dereferencing to avoid runtime errors.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player object passed to this method is valid and initialized.
    Accessing a null or invalid interaction target can lead to undefined behavior.
    This method may return nullptr if no interaction has been established with an
    entity.
