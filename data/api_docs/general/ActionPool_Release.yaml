  class: ActionPool
  method: Release
  signature: void ActionPool::Release(int action)
documentation:
  brief: Releases a previously acquired action from the action pool, making it available
    for reuse by other components.
  description: The Release method is used to return an action back to the ActionPool
    after it has been acquired via the Acquire method. This allows for efficient resource
    management by reusing action objects instead of constantly creating and destroying
    them. The released action becomes available for subsequent calls to Acquire, enabling
    a pool-based pattern that reduces memory allocation overhead and improves performance
    in scenarios where actions are frequently created and destroyed. This method is
    typically used within AI systems or game logic where actions need to be dynamically
    allocated and deallocated based on runtime conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: action
    description: The identifier of the action to be released back into the pool. This
      should correspond to a valid action that was previously acquired from this ActionPool
      instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Action Release
    code: 'ActionPool* pool = new ActionPool();

      int acquiredAction = pool->Acquire();

      // ... perform action operations ...

      pool->Release(acquiredAction);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Action Pool Usage in AI Context
    code: "class AIComponent {\npublic:\n    void ExecuteNextAction() {\n        int\
      \ action = actionPool->Acquire();\n        if (action != -1) {\n           \
      \ // Execute the acquired action\n            PerformAction(action);\n     \
      \       actionPool->Release(action);\n        }\n    }\nprivate:\n    ActionPool*\
      \ actionPool;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided action identifier is valid and was
    previously acquired from the same ActionPool instance. Improper use of invalid
    identifiers may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. The implementation
    likely uses internal tracking mechanisms to maintain pool state, so calling Release
    on an already-released action should be avoided.
  warnings: Calling Release with an invalid action identifier (e.g., one that was
    never acquired or has already been released) can cause memory corruption or other
    unpredictable behavior. Always ensure that actions are properly tracked and only
    released once per acquisition.
