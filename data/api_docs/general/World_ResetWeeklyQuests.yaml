  brief: Resets all weekly quest progress for all players in the world.
  description: The ResetWeeklyQuests method clears the completion status and reset
    timers for all weekly quests across the entire game world. This function is typically
    invoked during weekly reset events to ensure all players start fresh with their
    weekly quest availability. The method iterates through all active weekly quests
    and updates player quest data accordingly, removing any completed flags and restoring
    quest availability. It's commonly called during server maintenance windows or
    automated reset cycles to maintain game balance and progression integrity.

  notes: This method should only be called during appropriate reset periods to avoid
    disrupting active player progress. The operation may involve significant database
    I/O and could impact server performance during execution.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of scheduled reset windows may cause unexpected
    behavior for players who are actively engaged in weekly quests. Ensure proper
    synchronization with other reset operations to prevent data inconsistency.
