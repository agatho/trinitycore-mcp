documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player has a corpse available for resurrection.
  description: The HasCorpse method checks if a player currently has a corpse that
    can be resurrected. This is typically used in conjunction with the Resurrection
    system to determine if a player is eligible for resurrection or if they need to
    wait for their corpse to be available. The method returns true when the player
    has a corpse, false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for game mechanics
    involving player death and resurrection, particularly during combat situations
    where players may die and need to be resurrected at specific locations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has a corpse available for resurrection, false
    otherwise. The method will return false when the player has no corpse or when
    the corpse is not yet available for resurrection.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->HasCorpse()) {\n    // Player has a corpse available\n    //\
      \ Proceed with resurrection logic\n}\nelse {\n    // No corpse available\n \
      \   // Handle accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other resurrection-related
    methods such as GetCorpse() or ResurrectPlayer(). It's important to note that
    this method does not necessarily mean the player will be able to resurrect immediately,
    but rather that a corpse exists. The method may return false if the player has
    died but their corpse has been removed by game mechanics (e.g., through teleportation
    or other events).
  warnings: This method should not be used as the sole determinant for resurrection
    eligibility. It's recommended to also check for valid resurrection locations and
    other conditions before proceeding with resurrection logic.
