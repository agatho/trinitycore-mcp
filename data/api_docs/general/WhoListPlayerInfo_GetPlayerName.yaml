  signature: const std::string & WhoListPlayerInfo::GetPlayerName() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the player name associated with the WhoListPlayerInfo object.
  description: The GetPlayerName method returns a constant reference to a std::string
    containing the display name of the player represented by this WhoListPlayerInfo
    instance. This method is typically used in conjunction with the /who command or
    similar player listing functionality within TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server
    implementation. The returned string represents the character's name as it would
    appear in game chat and player lists. The method does not perform any validation
    or modification of the stored name; it simply provides access to the internally
    maintained player name data. This is a read-only accessor that ensures thread-safe
    retrieval of the player's name without exposing internal data structures directly.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the player's name. The
    string will be empty if no valid name has been set for this player info object,
    or if the object was initialized without player data.

  - title: Basic Usage in Who Command Handler
    code: "void HandleWhoCommand(ChatHandler* handler, const std::string& args)\n\
      {\n    for (auto const& playerInfo : sWorld->GetWhoList())\n    {\n        std::string\
      \ playerName = playerInfo.GetPlayerName();\n        if (!playerName.empty())\n\
      \        {\n            handler->PSendSysMessage(\"Player: %s\", playerName.c_str());\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Player Name in Custom Player List
    code: "std::vector<std::string> GetOnlinePlayersList()\n{\n    std::vector<std::string>\
      \ playerNames;\n    for (auto const& info : sWorld->GetWhoList())\n    {\n \
      \       const std::string& name = info.GetPlayerName();\n        if (!name.empty())\n\
      \        {\n            playerNames.push_back(name);\n        }\n    }\n   \
      \ return playerNames;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a const reference to avoid unnecessary string copying
    and to maintain data integrity. The underlying string is managed internally by
    the WhoListPlayerInfo class, so modifications to the returned reference will not
    affect the stored value. This implementation assumes that player names are properly
    initialized when the WhoListPlayerInfo object is created, though empty strings
    may be returned if no valid name exists.
  warnings: While this method is safe to call from multiple threads due to its const
    nature and return of a const reference, it's important to ensure that the WhoListPlayerInfo
    object itself remains valid during the lifetime of the returned reference. Accessing
    the returned reference after the parent object has been destroyed or invalidated
    may result in undefined behavior.
