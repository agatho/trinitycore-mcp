  method: SetClosedBy
  signature: void Ticket::SetClosedBy(int value)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the closed by value for a ticket, indicating which user or system closed
    the ticket.
  description: The SetClosedBy method assigns a value to indicate which entity (player
    or GM) closed the ticket. This value is typically used in conjunction with the
    ticket's status to track closure history. The method updates an internal member
    variable that represents the identifier of the user who closed the ticket. It
    does not perform any validation on the input value, so it should be used with
    appropriate checks to ensure valid identifiers are passed. This method is part
    of the ticket management system in TrinityCore and is generally called when a
    ticket is resolved or manually closed by a game master.
  parameters:
  - name: value
    description: An integer identifier representing the user who closed the ticket.
      Typically corresponds to a player's GUID or a GM account ID.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Closed By Value for a Ticket
    code: 'Ticket* ticket = new Ticket();

      ticket->SetClosedBy(12345); // Set to player with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Closing a Ticket via GM Action
    code: "Player* gm = ...; // Assume GM player object\nTicket* ticket = sTicketMgr->GetTicketByGuid(ticketGuid);\n\
      if (ticket)\n{\n    ticket->SetClosedBy(gm->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n    ticket->SetStatus(TicketStatus::CLOSED);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only updates the internal state of the ticket object and does
    not persist changes to the database. To ensure data consistency, it should be
    paired with a database update operation if persistence is required.
  warnings: Ensure that the value passed to this method corresponds to a valid user
    identifier. Passing invalid or non-existent GUIDs may lead to incorrect tracking
    of ticket closures.
