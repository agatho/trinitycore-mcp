  signature: void ConditionMgr::addToPhases(const ConditionId & id, int conditions)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Adds a condition identifier to specified phases within the condition manager.
  description: The addToPhases method is used to associate a given condition identifier
    with specific phases in the TrinityCore condition system. This allows for conditional
    logic to be evaluated based on phase states, which is commonly used in quest systems,
    creature AI, and other game mechanics that require contextual conditions. The
    method operates on a const object, suggesting it modifies internal state through
    mutable members or external references rather than changing the object itself.
    It's typically invoked during initialization or configuration phases of game objects.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The ConditionId identifier that represents a specific condition to
      be added to phases. This is usually a unique key referencing a defined condition
      in the game's condition system.
  - name: conditions
    description: An integer value representing the phase or set of phases to which
      the condition should be associated. The interpretation of this value depends
      on how phases are defined and managed within the condition system, potentially
      representing bit flags or a direct phase index.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Condition to Multiple Phases
    code: 'ConditionId myCondition = 12345;

      int phaseMask = 0x07; // Binary: 111, representing phases 0, 1, and 2

      ConditionMgr::getInstance().addToPhases(myCondition, phaseMask);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Associating a Condition with a Single Phase
    code: 'ConditionId questComplete = 98765;

      int singlePhase = 1 << 3; // Binary: 1000, representing phase 3

      ConditionMgr::getInstance().addToPhases(questComplete, singlePhase);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the condition management system and should be called
    during object initialization or when modifying phase associations. The internal
    implementation likely uses bit manipulation to manage multiple phases efficiently.
    It's important to ensure that the ConditionId exists and is valid before calling
    this method.
  warnings: Incorrect phase values may lead to conditions not being evaluated properly.
    Ensure that phase masks are correctly constructed using appropriate bit flags
    or indices. Calling this method after the system has been fully initialized might
    have unintended side effects depending on how the internal state is managed.
