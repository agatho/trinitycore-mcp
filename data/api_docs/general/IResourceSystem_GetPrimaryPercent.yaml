documentation:
  brief: Returns the current percentage of primary resource for the unit.
  description: The GetPrimaryPercent method retrieves the proportional value of the
    unit's primary resource, typically representing health or mana as a percentage.
    This value is commonly used in UI calculations, combat feedback, and resource
    management systems within the TrinityCore framework. The method does not take
    any parameters and returns a float value between 0.0 and 100.0, where 0.0 indicates
    no primary resource remaining and 100.0 indicates full resource capacity. This
    method is frequently called during combat updates, UI refreshes, and status checks
    to provide real-time resource information.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the percentage of primary resource remaining
    for the unit, ranging from 0.0 (no resource) to 100.0 (full resource).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Logic
    code: "float healthPercent = unit->GetPrimaryPercent();\nif (healthPercent < 25.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Trigger low health warning\n    SendLowHealthWarning(unit);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: UI Resource Bar Update
    code: "void UpdateResourceBar(Unit* player)\n{\n    float percent = player->GetPrimaryPercent();\n\
      \    resourceBar->SetFillPercentage(percent);\n    resourceBar->UpdateDisplay();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally calculates the ratio of current primary resource to
    maximum primary resource and multiplies by 100. It is optimized for frequent calls
    and should not be used in performance-critical sections without caching the result.
    The method assumes that the unit has a valid primary resource system initialized.
  warnings: Do not assume that this value will always be an integer; it may return
    fractional values. This method may return unexpected results if called on units
    that do not have a properly initialized resource system or if the resource system
    is in an invalid state.
