documentation:
  brief: Called when a player's money amount reaches a defined limit
  description: The OnMoneyLimit method is invoked by the TrinityCore server when a
    player's money balance hits a predetermined threshold. This script hook allows
    custom logic to be executed, such as preventing further monetary transactions,
    triggering in-game events, or modifying the player's currency state. The method
    is part of the PlayerScript system which enables developers to extend or override
    default player behavior without modifying core game code. It typically fires during
    money-related operations like deposits, transfers, or gains that push the total
    above the limit.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose money amount has reached the limit
  - name: amount
    description: The monetary amount that triggered the limit condition, represented
      as a signed 64-bit integer (gold pieces in game currency)
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Implementation to Prevent Excessive Money
    code: "class MyPlayerScript : public PlayerScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnMoneyLimit(Player*\
      \ player, int64 amount) override\n    {\n        // Log the event\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Player %s reached money limit of %\" PRIu64 \" copper.\", player->GetName().c_str(),\
      \ amount);\n        \n        // Optionally prevent further accumulation\n \
      \       // This would require additional custom logic or state tracking\n  \
      \  }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the core currency management
    system when a player's total money exceeds configured limits. Developers should
    be aware that this hook may fire frequently during high-value transactions, so
    performance-sensitive implementations should avoid heavy operations.
  warnings: Since this method can be invoked rapidly during monetary transactions,
    ensure that any logic implemented does not introduce lag or blocking behavior.
    Also, be cautious about modifying player state directly within this callback as
    it might cause recursion or unexpected side effects.
