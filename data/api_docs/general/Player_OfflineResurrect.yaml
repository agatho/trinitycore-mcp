  signature: void Player::OfflineResurrect(const int & guid, int trans)
documentation:
  brief: Resurrects a player from offline status using a GUID and transaction.
  description: This method facilitates the resurrection of a player who is currently
    in offline status, typically due to death or disconnect. It uses a GUID identifier
    to locate the player and applies a transaction to process the resurrection within
    the game world. The method is primarily used for handling offline resurrection
    scenarios where players are not actively connected but need to be brought back
    to life. This function operates within the context of TrinityCore's player management
    system and requires proper transaction handling to ensure successful execution.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player being resurrected. This
      is typically a 64-bit value representing the player's database ID or character
      GUID.
  - name: trans
    description: The transaction identifier used for processing the resurrection.
      This represents a specific transaction context within the game system that ensures
      proper handling of the resurrection process.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Offline Resurrection Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      int guid = 123456789;

      int trans = 987654321;

      player->OfflineResurrect(guid, trans);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is designed to handle offline player resurrection scenarios and
    requires proper transaction context. Implementation details involve ensuring that
    the GUID and transaction parameters are correctly processed within the game world.
    Performance considerations include potential delays in processing due to offline
    status handling.
  warnings: This method should only be used when a player is confirmed to be offline,
    as attempting to use it on active players may cause unexpected behavior or errors.
    The transaction parameter must be valid and properly initialized for successful
    execution.
