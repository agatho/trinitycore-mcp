documentation:
  brief: Dismounts the unit from its current mount
  description: The Dismount method removes the unit from its mounted state, effectively
    ending any active mount. This method is typically used to cancel a player's or
    creature's mount when they are no longer riding. It performs the necessary cleanup
    to ensure that the unit's movement state is properly reset and that any visual
    effects associated with the mount are removed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Dismount Usage
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetUnit();

      unit->Dismount();'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method internally handles the removal of mount effects and resets movement
    state. It should be called carefully as it may affect the unit's current state
    during combat or movement.
  warnings: Calling Dismount on a unit that is not mounted can cause undefined behavior
    or errors in some cases. Ensure that the unit is actually mounted before calling
    this method.
