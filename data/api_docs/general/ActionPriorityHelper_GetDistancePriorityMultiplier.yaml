  method: GetDistancePriorityMultiplier
  signature: float ActionPriorityHelper::GetDistancePriorityMultiplier(float distance)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a priority multiplier based on the distance to a target
    for action evaluation.
  description: The GetDistancePriorityMultiplier method computes a floating-point
    value that represents how distance affects the priority of an action in the AI
    decision-making process. This multiplier is typically used to penalize or reward
    actions based on proximity to targets, with closer targets generally receiving
    higher priority multipliers. The method likely implements a distance-based curve
    or threshold to determine how much distance should influence action selection
    within the TrinityCore AI framework. It serves as part of the broader action priority
    calculation system that helps NPCs make intelligent decisions about which actions
    to perform.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the distance-based priority multiplier. Values
    are typically between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 indicates maximum priority (closest
    target) and values closer to 0.0 indicate reduced priority due to increased distance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "float distance = unit->GetDistance(target);\nfloat priorityMultiplier =\
      \ ActionPriorityHelper::GetDistancePriorityMultiplier(distance);\n// Use priorityMultiplier\
      \ to adjust action priority\nif (priorityMultiplier > 0.5f) {\n    // Perform\
      \ high-priority action\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI system that evaluates multiple
    factors such as distance, threat level, and available resources to determine optimal
    actions. The exact formula or curve used for calculating the multiplier may be
    configurable or hardcoded based on game mechanics.
