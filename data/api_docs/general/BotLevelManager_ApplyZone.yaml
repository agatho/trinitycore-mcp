  class: BotLevelManager
  method: ApplyZone
  signature: bool BotLevelManager::ApplyZone(Player * bot, BotCreationTask * task)
documentation:
  brief: Applies zone-specific level adjustments to a bot based on the provided creation
    task.
  description: The ApplyZone method adjusts the level of a specified bot player according
    to zone-specific rules defined in the BotCreationTask. This method ensures that
    bots are appropriately leveled for their current zone, taking into account factors
    such as zone difficulty, player level ranges, and any custom configurations set
    during bot creation. It typically checks if the bot's current level is within
    acceptable bounds for the zone and modifies it accordingly. The method returns
    true if the adjustment was successfully applied, or false if the operation failed
    due to invalid parameters or other issues.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose level will
      be adjusted. Must not be null.
  - name: task
    description: Pointer to the BotCreationTask object containing zone-specific configuration
      and level adjustment rules for the bot. Must not be null.
  returns: True if the zone-based level adjustment was successfully applied to the
    bot; false otherwise, which may occur due to invalid input parameters or failed
    internal operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume initialized bot\nBotCreationTask* task =\
      \ ...; // Assume initialized task\nbool success = BotLevelManager::ApplyZone(myBot,\
      \ task);\nif (success) {\n    // Level adjustment applied successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during bot initialization or when a bot
    enters a new zone to ensure proper level scaling. It relies on the BotCreationTask's
    configuration to determine how levels should be adjusted for different zones.
  warnings: Ensure that both 'bot' and 'task' parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method, as passing null values may lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes.
