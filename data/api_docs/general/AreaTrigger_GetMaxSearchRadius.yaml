  class: AreaTrigger
  method: GetMaxSearchRadius
  signature: float AreaTrigger::GetMaxSearchRadius() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the maximum search radius for the area trigger.
  description: The GetMaxSearchRadius method returns the maximum distance within which
    entities can be detected by this area trigger. This value determines how far players
    or objects must be from the trigger's center to activate its effects. The returned
    float value represents the radius in yards, and is typically used during collision
    detection and event triggering logic for area-based spells, quests, or environmental
    effects. This method is read-only and does not modify any internal state of the
    area trigger.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the maximum search radius in yards. This defines
    the effective range within which the area trigger will detect and respond to nearby
    entities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float maxRadius = areaTrigger->GetMaxSearchRadius();\nif (maxRadius > 0.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Use maxRadius for further processing\n    std::cout << \"Area trigger\
      \ max search radius: \" << maxRadius << \" yards\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Radius in Trigger Logic
    code: "float radius = areaTrigger->GetMaxSearchRadius();\nPlayer* player = ...;\
      \ // Assume player is obtained\nfloat distance = player->GetDistance(areaTrigger);\n\
      if (distance <= radius)\n{\n    // Trigger effect activation logic here\n  \
      \  areaTrigger->HandleTrigger(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other area trigger functions
    such as GetPosition() and GetTypeId(). The value returned may be influenced by
    the area trigger's template or database configuration. Ensure that any calculations
    using this radius account for potential floating-point precision issues.
  warnings: Do not assume that all entities within the returned radius will necessarily
    activate the trigger; additional conditions like line-of-sight, target type, or
    spell restrictions may apply. The value returned is in yards and should be converted
    appropriately if working with other units.
