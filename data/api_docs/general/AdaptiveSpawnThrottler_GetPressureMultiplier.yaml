  method: GetPressureMultiplier
  signature: float AdaptiveSpawnThrottler::GetPressureMultiplier() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current pressure multiplier used for adaptive
    spawn throttling in the game world.
  description: The GetPressureMultiplier method retrieves a floating-point value that
    represents the current adaptive spawn pressure multiplier. This multiplier is
    used by the AdaptiveSpawnThrottler to dynamically adjust spawn rates based on
    server load, player density, and other environmental factors. The returned value
    typically ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 indicates normal spawning conditions
    and values below 1.0 indicate reduced spawn rates due to increased pressure. This
    method is part of the adaptive spawning system that helps maintain game performance
    and balance by reducing NPC spawns during high-load periods.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current pressure multiplier, typically between
    0.0 (minimum) and 1.0 (maximum). Values below 1.0 indicate reduced spawn rates
    due to system pressure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "AdaptiveSpawnThrottler throttler;\nfloat multiplier = throttler.GetPressureMultiplier();\n\
      if (multiplier < 0.5f)\n{\n    // Handle low spawn rate conditions\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      High pressure detected: spawning reduced by %.2f%%\", (1.0f - multiplier) *\
      \ 100.0f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spawn point evaluation to determine
    whether a given NPC should be spawned based on current system pressure. The value
    returned may change dynamically as server conditions fluctuate, making it important
    to check this value at appropriate intervals rather than caching it for extended
    periods.
