documentation:
  brief: Returns a formatted string describing the current interrupt coordinator status
  description: The GetStatusString method provides a human-readable representation
    of the interrupt coordinator's current state. This includes information about
    active interrupts, pending actions, and overall system health. The returned string
    is typically used for debugging, logging, or displaying status information in
    game interfaces. The method performs no side effects and is safe to call from
    any thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing a formatted status report that describes the current
    state of the interrupt coordinator, including active interrupts, pending operations,
    and system metrics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Status Retrieval
    code: 'InterruptCoordinatorFixed coordinator;

      std::string status = coordinator.GetStatusString();

      TC_LOG_INFO("server", "Interrupt Coordinator Status: %s", status.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for debugging and monitoring purposes.
    The format of the returned string may change between different versions of TrinityCore.
    The implementation does not perform any locking operations, so concurrent access
    should be handled by the caller if needed.
