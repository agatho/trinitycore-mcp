  class: QuestValidation
  method: CheckRequiredClass
  signature: bool QuestValidation::CheckRequiredClass(const Quest * quest, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player meets the required class restrictions for a given quest.
  description: The CheckRequiredClass method evaluates whether a player character
    has the appropriate class to accept and complete a specific quest. It verifies
    that the player's class aligns with any class-specific requirements defined in
    the quest template. This validation is crucial for maintaining game balance and
    ensuring players only take quests relevant to their character's class. The method
    typically checks against the Quest::RequiredClass field which defines class restrictions.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object being validated. Must not be null.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose class is being checked against
      the quest requirements. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the player's class meets the quest's required class restrictions,
    or if no class restrictions are defined. Returns false if the player's class does
    not meet the required class restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Class Validation
    code: "Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\nPlayer* player = ...;\
      \ // valid player object\nbool isValid = QuestValidation::CheckRequiredClass(quest,\
      \ player);\nif (isValid)\n{\n    // Player can accept and complete this quest\n\
      \    // Proceed with quest acceptance logic\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player cannot\
      \ take this quest due to class restrictions\n    // Send appropriate message\
      \ to player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during quest acceptance checks and may be called
    before allowing a player to start a quest. The implementation relies on the Quest::RequiredClass
    field which stores class identifiers. Multiple classes can be required by setting
    appropriate bit flags in the RequiredClass field.
  warnings: Ensure that both parameters are valid non-null pointers before calling
    this method, as dereferencing null pointers will cause crashes. Be aware that
    some quests may have no class restrictions (RequiredClass = 0), in which case
    the method will always return true.
