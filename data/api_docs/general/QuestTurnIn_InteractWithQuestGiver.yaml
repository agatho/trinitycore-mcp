  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: InteractWithQuestGiver
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::InteractWithQuestGiver(Player * bot, uint32 questGiverGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates interaction with a quest giver to turn in quests for the specified
    player bot.
  description: The InteractWithQuestGiver method handles the process of a player bot
    interacting with a quest giver NPC to complete and turn in quests. This method
    is typically used within AI logic to automate quest completion for bots or automated
    characters. It manages the necessary communication with the quest giver, processes
    quest turn-in logic, and updates the player's quest state accordingly. The method
    requires a valid player instance and a valid quest giver GUID to function correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will interact
      with the quest giver. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: questGiverGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the quest giver NPC. Must correspond
      to a valid GameObject or Creature in the world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Turn-In Interaction
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized

      uint32 questGiverGuid = 12345;

      QuestTurnIn::InteractWithQuestGiver(myBot, questGiverGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal quest state updates and may involve
    communication with the server's quest handling system. It should only be called
    when the bot is in proximity to the quest giver and has the appropriate quest
    in progress.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid player or quest giver GUID can result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the quest giver exists in the world
    and that the bot has an active quest with the specified quest giver before calling
    this method.
