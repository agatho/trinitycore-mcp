documentation:
  brief: Sets the trainer ID for a creature, enabling it to function as a trainer
    with specific training capabilities.
  description: The SetTrainerId method assigns a specific trainer ID to a Creature
    object, which determines the training services and options available to players
    interacting with that creature. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft
    server-side scripting to configure NPC trainers for various professions or skills.
    The trainer ID directly influences the creature's behavior within the game mechanics,
    particularly when dealing with player interaction and training functionality.
    When set, this ID allows the creature to provide specific training services based
    on the trainer's configuration, such as skill points, spell learning, or profession
    training.
  parameters:
  - name: trainerId
    description: An integer value representing the unique identifier for a trainer
      within the game database. This ID corresponds to a specific trainer entry in
      the creature_trainer table and determines what training services are available
      to players.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trainer Configuration
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetTrainerId(12345);

      // This sets the trainer ID to 12345, enabling specific training services'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Trainer Setup with Multiple Trainers
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetTrainerId(12345);

      creature->SetTrainerId(54321);

      // This demonstrates how to set multiple trainer IDs for different training
      scenarios'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it affects the creature's behavior
    in game. The trainer ID must correspond to valid entries in the database tables,
    otherwise the creature will not provide proper training services. This method
    is typically used during creature creation or modification in server-side scripts.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to creatures that do not function
    properly as trainers, resulting in players being unable to access training services.
    Care should be taken when setting trainer IDs to ensure they match valid database
    entries.
