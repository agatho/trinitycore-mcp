  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: ShouldUseThreatAbility
  signature: bool ThreatCoordinator::ShouldUseThreatAbility(const BotThreatAssignment
    & assignment) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a threat ability should be used based on the provided
    bot threat assignment.
  description: The ShouldUseThreatAbility method evaluates whether a specific threat
    ability should be executed for a given bot threat assignment. This decision is
    typically made within the context of AI behavior, where the system assesses if
    using a particular threat ability (such as a spell or ability that increases threat)
    would be beneficial for the bot's current combat situation. The method considers
    factors such as the bot's current threat level, target status, and available abilities
    to make this determination. It is commonly used in conjunction with threat management
    systems to ensure proper engagement and control of enemy targets.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the threat ability should be used according to the assignment
    criteria; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (threatCoordinator.ShouldUseThreatAbility(assignment)) {\n    // Execute\
      \ threat ability\n    bot->CastSpell(target, THREAT_ABILITY_SPELL_ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Logic
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateThreatAbilities() {\n    if (threatCoordinator.ShouldUseThreatAbility(currentAssignment))\
      \ {\n        // Use threat ability only when conditions are met\n        if\
      \ (bot->CanCastSpell(THREAT_SPELL_ID)) {\n            bot->CastSpell(target,\
      \ THREAT_SPELL_ID);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the threat coordination system and relies on accurate
    assignment data to make decisions. The implementation likely involves checking
    current threat levels, target proximity, and bot resource availability before
    making a decision.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotThreatAssignment parameter contains valid and up-to-date
    information; otherwise, incorrect decisions may be made regarding ability usage.
