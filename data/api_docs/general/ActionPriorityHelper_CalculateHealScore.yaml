  signature: float ActionPriorityHelper::CalculateHealScore(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a priority score for healing actions based on target
    conditions and player state
  description: The CalculateHealScore method evaluates the urgency and effectiveness
    of potential healing targets within the current AI context. It analyzes various
    factors such as target health percentage, distance, threat level, and player resource
    availability to determine an optimal healing priority. This score is used by the
    action priority system to decide which healing target should be prioritized over
    others during combat situations. The method considers both immediate survival
    needs of targets and long-term tactical positioning for maximum damage mitigation.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit index or identifier.
      This parameter is used internally by the AI system to access target-specific
      data including health, distance, and threat status.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the calculated healing priority score.
    Higher scores indicate higher priority targets for healing actions. Scores typically
    range from 0.0 (lowest priority) to 1.0 (highest priority), though values may
    exceed 1.0 in certain high-priority scenarios.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "float score = helper.CalculateHealScore(&targetUnit);\nif (score > 0.7f)\
      \ {\n    // Execute high-priority healing\n    DoHealingAction(targetUnit);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing multiple targets for optimal healing
    code: "int bestTarget = -1;\nfloat bestScore = 0.0f;\nfor (int i = 0; i < targetCount;\
      \ ++i) {\n    float score = helper.CalculateHealScore(&targets[i]);\n    if\
      \ (score > bestScore) {\n        bestScore = score;\n        bestTarget = targets[i];\n\
      \    }\n}\n// Use bestTarget for healing action"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore AI system and relies on internal state
    tracking. The calculation may vary based on player class, specialization, and
    equipped gear. It should be called within a valid combat context where target
    information is accessible. Performance is optimized for frequent calls during
    AI decision cycles.
  warnings: The parameter 'target' must point to a valid unit index; passing null
    or invalid pointers will result in undefined behavior. The method assumes that
    all necessary target data (health, distance, threat) has been properly initialized
    before calling. Incorrect handling of the returned score may lead to suboptimal
    healing decisions in combat scenarios.
