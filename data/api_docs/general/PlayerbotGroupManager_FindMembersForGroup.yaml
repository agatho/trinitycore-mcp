  class: PlayerbotGroupManager
  method: FindMembersForGroup
  signature: int PlayerbotGroupManager::FindMembersForGroup(uint32 groupId, GroupRole
    role, uint32 minLevel, uint32 maxLevel)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the number of player bot group members matching specified
    criteria.
  description: The FindMembersForGroup method searches through all available player
    bots within a specified group to identify those that meet given role and level
    requirements. It is used primarily by the player bot system to manage group composition
    based on predefined roles such as tank, healer, or damage dealer. The method filters
    members by group ID, required role, and acceptable level range. This functionality
    supports dynamic group formation and balancing within the TrinityCore player bot
    framework.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: The unique identifier of the player bot group to search within. Must
      correspond to an existing group in the system.
  - name: role
    description: The required role that matching members must possess. Valid values
      are typically defined by GroupRole enum such as TANK, HEALER, or DAMAGE.
  - name: minLevel
    description: Minimum acceptable level for group members. Must be a positive integer
      representing the lowest level bot to include.
  - name: maxLevel
    description: Maximum acceptable level for group members. Must be greater than
      or equal to minLevel.
  returns: Returns an integer indicating the number of player bot group members that
    match the specified criteria. A return value of zero indicates no matching members
    were found, while a positive integer represents the count of qualifying bots.
  examples:
  - title: Find all damage dealer bots in group 1 between levels 10 and 30
    code: int count = botGroupManager->FindMembersForGroup(1, DAMAGE, 10, 30);
    language: cpp
  - title: Count all healers in group 5 with level between 20 and 40
    code: int numHealers = botGroupManager->FindMembersForGroup(5, HEALER, 20, 40);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player bot system is properly initialized and
    that groups have been created. It does not modify any group state but only performs
    a read operation to count members. Performance may be impacted if many bots exist
    in large groups, especially when filtering by role.
  warnings: Ensure that groupId corresponds to an actual existing group; otherwise
    the behavior is undefined. Also, make sure minLevel is less than or equal to maxLevel
    to avoid incorrect results.
