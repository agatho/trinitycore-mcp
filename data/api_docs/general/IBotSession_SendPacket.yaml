  class: IBotSession
  method: SendPacket
  signature: void IBotSession::SendPacket(const WorldPacket * packet)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a WorldPacket to the client associated with this bot session.
  description: The SendPacket method is used to transmit a WorldPacket object containing
    game data to the connected client. This method is essential for sending any form
    of network communication from the server to the player, including updates to player
    state, world events, or interactive game elements. The packet is queued for transmission
    and will be sent according to the session's network handling protocol. It is typically
    used by bot implementations to simulate or control player actions in the game
    world.
  parameters:
  - name: packet
    description: A pointer to a WorldPacket object containing the data to be sent
      to the client. The packet must be properly constructed with valid opcode and
      data before being passed to this method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending a basic packet
    code: 'WorldPacket packet(SMSG_LOGIN_VERIFY_WORLD, 4);

      packet << uint32(12345);

      session->SendPacket(&packet);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending a custom packet with multiple fields
    code: 'WorldPacket packet(CMSG_PLAYER_LOGIN, 8);

      packet << uint64(playerGuid);

      packet << uint32(mapId);

      packet << float(x);

      packet << float(y);

      packet << float(z);

      session->SendPacket(&packet);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates asynchronously and does not block execution. The actual
    sending of the packet occurs at a later time based on network scheduling. Ensure
    that the WorldPacket is properly initialized with a valid opcode before calling
    this method, otherwise undefined behavior may occur.
  warnings: Do not send packets without proper initialization or invalid opcodes as
    it can cause client-side crashes or disconnects. Always validate packet contents
    before sending to avoid protocol violations.
