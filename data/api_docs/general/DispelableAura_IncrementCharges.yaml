  signature: void DispelableAura::IncrementCharges()
documentation:
  brief: Increments the charge count of a dispelable aura by one.
  description: The IncrementCharges method increases the current charge count of a
    DispelableAura object by one unit. This method is typically used in the context
    of World of Warcraft spell mechanics where certain auras have limited uses before
    they expire or are removed. The increment operation usually occurs when an aura
    is applied, refreshed, or triggered by specific game events such as damage dealt
    or received. It's important to note that this method does not validate whether
    the charge count exceeds any maximum limit; it simply increases the current value.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "DispelableAura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    aura->IncrementCharges();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with aura application and refresh
    logic. The underlying charge system may be tied to spell properties or aura stacking
    rules defined in the game's spell database. Developers should ensure that this
    method is called only on valid DispelableAura instances to prevent undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling IncrementCharges on a null DispelableAura pointer will result
    in a crash. Always verify that the aura exists before calling this method. Additionally,
    if the aura has reached its maximum charge limit, further increments may not be
    meaningful unless the system is designed to handle overflow or reset behavior.
