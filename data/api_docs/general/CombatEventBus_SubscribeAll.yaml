documentation:
  brief: Subscribes a BotAI instance to all combat events in the CombatEventBus
  description: The SubscribeAll method registers a BotAI subscriber to receive notifications
    for all combat-related events managed by the CombatEventBus. This allows the bot
    to react to various combat situations such as attacks, damage dealt or received,
    spell casts, and other combat actions without needing to manually subscribe to
    individual event types. The method returns true if the subscription was successful,
    or false if the subscriber was already registered or if there were issues during
    the registration process. This functionality is crucial for bots that need comprehensive
    combat awareness to make informed decisions during battles.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the BotAI subscriber was successfully added to all combat
    event subscriptions, false if the subscription failed or if the subscriber was
    already registered.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Subscription
    code: "BotAI* myBot = new BotAI();\nbool success = combatEventBus.SubscribeAll(myBot);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Bot is now subscribed to all combat events\n    printf(\"\
      Bot successfully subscribed to all combat events\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ subscription failure\n    printf(\"Failed to subscribe bot to combat events\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely internally iterates through all available combat event
    types and registers the subscriber with each one. The implementation may involve
    thread-safe operations if the CombatEventBus is accessed from multiple threads.
    It's recommended to call this method early in the bot's initialization process
    to ensure full combat event coverage.
  warnings: Calling SubscribeAll on an already subscribed BotAI instance may result
    in duplicate subscriptions or unexpected behavior. Always verify subscription
    status before calling this method. Additionally, excessive use of this method
    without proper event handling can lead to performance degradation due to the high
    volume of events being processed.
