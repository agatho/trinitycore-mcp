api:
  class: Guild
  method: Disband
  signature: void Guild::Disband()
documentation:
  brief: Disbands the guild, removing all members and deleting the guild from the
    database.
  description: The Disband method completely destroys a guild by removing all its
    members from the guild roster, clearing the guild's data in the database, and
    sending appropriate notifications to all remaining guild members. This operation
    is irreversible and should only be performed when the guild leader intends to
    permanently dissolve the guild. The method ensures that all guild-related data
    structures are properly cleaned up and that players are notified of the guild's
    dissolution.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Disband a Guild
    code: "Guild* myGuild = sGuildMgr->GetGuildById(guildId);\nif (myGuild)\n{\n \
      \   myGuild->Disband();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called by the guild leader or an administrator
    with appropriate permissions. The disbanding process sends a broadcast message
    to all guild members and updates the database to remove all guild-related entries.
  warnings: Calling this method will permanently delete all guild data including member
    information, guild achievements, and any guild-specific settings. There is no
    undo functionality for this operation.
