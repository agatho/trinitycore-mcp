documentation:
  brief: Checks if a spell can be cast at the specified location
  description: The SpellInfo::CheckLocation method determines whether a spell can
    be cast within the given map, zone, and area context. It evaluates the spell's
    requirements against the player's current location and environment, ensuring that
    the spell is valid for the specific location where it is being attempted to be
    cast. This method is crucial for validating spell casting conditions in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, particularly when dealing with location-based
    spell restrictions such as those requiring specific zones or areas.
  parameters:
  - name: map_id
    description: The map identifier where the spell is being cast. This represents
      the game map context and must match the player's current map.
  - name: zone_id
    description: The zone identifier where the spell is being cast. This represents
      the specific zone context and must match the player's current zone.
  - name: area_id
    description: The area identifier where the spell is being cast. This represents
      the specific area context and must match the player's current area.
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object whose location is being checked against
      the spell requirements. This parameter is essential for determining if the spell
      can be cast in the player's current location.
  returns: Returns a SpellCastResult indicating whether the spell can be cast at the
    specified location. Possible return values include SPELL_CAST_OK, SPELL_FAILED,
    or other specific error codes depending on the spell's requirements and the player's
    location.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: SpellCastResult result = spellInfo->CheckLocation(mapId, zoneId, areaId,
      player);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example with error handling
    code: "if (spellInfo->CheckLocation(mapId, zoneId, areaId, player) == SPELL_CAST_OK)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with spell casting\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle the error appropriately\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during spell validation and should be called
    before attempting to cast a spell. It performs checks based on the spell's requirements
    and player's location, ensuring that the spell can be cast in the specified context
    without triggering any invalid location-related errors.
  warnings: The method requires that all parameters (map_id, zone_id, area_id) match
    the player's current location. If any of these do not match, the spell may fail
    to cast correctly. Additionally, this method should not be used for non-location-based
    spells, as it may lead to incorrect validation results.
