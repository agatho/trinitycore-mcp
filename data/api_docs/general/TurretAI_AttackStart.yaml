  class: TurretAI
  method: AttackStart
  signature: void TurretAI::AttackStart(int * who)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates attack behavior against a specified target for the turret AI.
  description: The AttackStart method in TurretAI is responsible for triggering the
    turret's attack sequence against a given target. It typically sets the turret's
    current target and begins the attack logic, which may include firing projectiles
    or initiating melee attacks depending on the turret's configuration. This method
    is commonly invoked when the turret detects an enemy within its detection range
    or when explicitly commanded to engage a specific unit. The method modifies the
    turret's AI state to reflect active combat behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: who
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target entity ID. This value
      identifies the unit that the turret should attack. If null or invalid, the method
      may not initiate any attack behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Attack Start
    code: "void BasicTurret::OnTargetAcquired(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (target)\n\
      \        me->GetAI()->AttackStart(&target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Attack Start with Validation
    code: "void TurretAI::AttackStart(int* who)\n{\n    if (!who || *who <= 0)\n \
      \       return;\n\n    Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*me, *who);\n\
      \    if (target && target->IsAlive())\n        me->Attack(target, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI framework for turrets in TrinityCore.
    The actual attack behavior depends on the turret's type and configuration. Ensure
    that the target entity exists and is valid before calling this method to avoid
    undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null pointer to 'who' can lead to crashes or unexpected
    behavior. Always validate the target before invoking AttackStart.
