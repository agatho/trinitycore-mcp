  class: InteractionManager
  method: SmartTrain
  signature: bool InteractionManager::SmartTrain(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Trains the bot's skills and abilities using smart learning algorithms based
    on player interaction.
  description: The SmartTrain method implements an intelligent skill training system
    for NPC bots within the TrinityCore framework. It analyzes the player's current
    skill levels, available training opportunities, and interaction patterns to determine
    optimal training paths for the bot. The method evaluates whether the bot can learn
    new skills or improve existing ones based on the player's actions and the game's
    training mechanics. It returns true if the training process was successful and
    false otherwise, indicating potential issues such as insufficient resources, invalid
    skill states, or training restrictions. This functionality is crucial for dynamic
    NPC behavior and adaptive gameplay experiences in World of Warcraft server environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot's skills were successfully trained or updated based
    on player interaction; returns false if training failed due to resource constraints,
    invalid skill states, or other training restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Training
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Get reference to bot player\nbool success = sInteractionManager->SmartTrain(bot);\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Bot successfully trained\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot\
      \ training completed successfully.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Training failed\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Bot training failed.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the interaction manager's internal logic for skill
    evaluation and training progression. It may have performance implications when
    processing multiple bots simultaneously, as it requires extensive skill state
    analysis and validation checks.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot player object is valid and properly initialized before
    calling this method. The method does not perform explicit null checking on the
    bot parameter, which could lead to undefined behavior if called with an invalid
    pointer.
