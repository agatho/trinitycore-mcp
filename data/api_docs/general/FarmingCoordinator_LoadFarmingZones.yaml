  brief: Initializes and loads all farming zone data for the FarmingCoordinator.
  description: The LoadFarmingZones method is responsible for initializing and loading
    all farming zone configurations into memory. This method typically reads data
    from database tables or configuration files that define which zones in the game
    world support farming activities, including crop types, growth times, and reward
    structures. It ensures that the FarmingCoordinator has access to all necessary
    zone-specific information required for farming mechanics to function correctly
    within the game world.

  notes: This method should typically be called during server startup or when the
    FarmingCoordinator is initialized. It may involve database queries and could have
    performance implications if there are many farming zones defined.
