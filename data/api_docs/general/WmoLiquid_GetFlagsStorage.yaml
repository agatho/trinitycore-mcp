  class: WmoLiquid
  method: GetFlagsStorage
  signature: const uint8 * WmoLiquid::GetFlagsStorage() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the internal flags storage array of the WmoLiquid object.
  description: The GetFlagsStorage method provides access to the raw byte array that
    stores flags associated with the WmoLiquid instance. This is typically used internally
    by the TrinityCore engine to manage liquid properties such as surface type, collision
    flags, or other metadata related to water or liquid surfaces in World of Warcraft's
    terrain system. The returned pointer points to an internal memory buffer and should
    not be modified directly. The size of the storage array depends on the dimensions
    of the liquid area represented by this WmoLiquid object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to a uint8 array containing the flags data for this WmoLiquid
    instance. The caller must not modify or free the memory pointed to by this return
    value. Returns nullptr if the WmoLiquid has no flags data or is in an invalid
    state.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing WmoLiquid flags for debugging
    code: "WmoLiquid* liquid = GetWmoLiquid();\nconst uint8* flags = liquid->GetFlagsStorage();\n\
      if (flags != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process or log the flags data\n    for (int\
      \ i = 0; i < liquid->GetWidth() * liquid->GetHeight(); ++i)\n    {\n       \
      \ printf(\"Flag[%d]: %u\\n\", i, flags[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned pointer is only valid while the WmoLiquid object remains alive
    and in a valid state. The flags data structure is tightly packed and may contain
    per-vertex or per-cell flags depending on how the liquid was loaded from the WMO
    file. This method is primarily intended for internal engine use and should not
    be relied upon by external modules unless absolutely necessary.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the memory pointed to by the returned pointer
    as it will corrupt the internal state of the WmoLiquid object. Also, ensure that
    the WmoLiquid instance is valid before calling this method, otherwise a null pointer
    may be returned or undefined behavior could occur.
