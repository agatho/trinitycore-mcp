  brief: Initializes a new PetTeam object with default values and empty pet list
  description: The PetTeam constructor initializes a new pet team instance, setting
    up internal data structures for managing a group of pets. This method prepares
    the object for use by initializing member variables to their default states and
    ensuring that the team has a valid starting configuration. The constructor does
    not take any parameters and is typically called automatically when creating a
    new PetTeam object. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this would
    be used to create pet teams for player characters, allowing them to manage multiple
    pets in a structured way. The initialization process ensures that all internal
    state variables are properly set before any operations are performed on the pet
    team.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new PetTeam instance
    code: 'PetTeam* team = new PetTeam();

      // The team is now initialized and ready for use

      // with pets to be added via other methods'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when creating a new PetTeam object.
    It's important to note that the PetTeam class likely manages pet data internally,
    so this constructor sets up the foundation for pet management operations. The
    implementation may include initialization of internal containers or lists that
    store pet references.
