  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the unit's transmogrification GUID
  description: The GetTransGUID method retrieves the transmogrification GUID associated
    with a Unit object, which is used to identify the specific transmogrification
    applied to the unit. This GUID is essential for tracking and managing transmogrification
    changes within the game mechanics. The method returns an integer value representing
    the GUID identifier, which can be used for various operations including checking
    if a unit has been transmogrified or retrieving specific transmogrification data.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the transmogrification GUID of the
    unit. This value is typically used to identify specific transmogrification data
    within the game system and can be used for checking if a unit has been transmogrified
    or retrieving transmogrification information.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: int transGUID = unit->GetTransGUID();
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the Unit class and is used primarily for transmogrification
    tracking. It's important to note that this GUID may be different from other GUIDs
    such as the main GUID or the GUID used for other game mechanics.
  warnings: This method should not be used in scenarios where transmogrification data
    is not properly initialized, as it may return invalid values or cause unexpected
    behavior.
