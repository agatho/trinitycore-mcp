  signature: void SoulShardResource::ConsumeSoulShards(float shards)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified number of soul shards from the player's resource pool
  description: The ConsumeSoulShards method reduces the current soul shard count by
    the specified amount. This method is typically used during spell casting or ability
    usage when soul shards are required as a resource. The method handles validation
    to ensure that sufficient soul shards are available before consumption, and will
    not allow negative values. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    this method integrates with the player's soul shard tracking system and may trigger
    updates to the UI or resource display.
  parameters:
  - name: shards
    description: The number of soul shards to consume from the resource pool. Must
      be a non-negative floating-point value representing the quantity of shards to
      deduct.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Soul Shard Consumption
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      SoulShardResource* soulShardResource = player->GetSoulShardResource();

      soulShardResource->ConsumeSoulShards(1.0f); // Consume 1 soul shard'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Soul Shard Consumption
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nSoulShardResource* soulShardResource = player->GetSoulShardResource();\n\
      if (soulShardResource->GetSoulShards() >= 2.0f)\n{\n    soulShardResource->ConsumeSoulShards(2.0f);\
      \ // Consume 2 soul shards if available\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by spell systems when a spell
    requires soul shards as a resource cost. It's important to ensure that sufficient
    soul shards are available before calling this method, as it does not perform any
    validation beyond basic type checking.
  warnings: Calling this method with a negative value may result in undefined behavior
    or unexpected resource accumulation. Always validate the available shard count
    before consumption to prevent errors.
