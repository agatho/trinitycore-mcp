documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current realm is configured as a PvP server.
  description: The IsPvPRealm method checks the realm's configuration to determine
    if it is set up for Player versus Player (PvP) gameplay. This setting affects
    various game mechanics such as faction interactions, combat rules, and server
    behavior. The method returns true if the realm is configured for PvP, and false
    otherwise. This check is typically used to modify game logic based on the realm
    type, such as enabling or disabling certain PvP-related features, adjusting player
    behavior, or modifying zone-specific rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether the current realm is configured
    for PvP gameplay. True indicates the realm supports PvP mechanics, while false
    indicates it is a PvE (Player versus Environment) realm.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check PvP Realm
    code: "if (World::instance()->IsPvPRealm()) {\n    // Enable PvP-specific features\n\
      \    SendPvPMessage(\"This server supports Player versus Player combat.\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Disable PvP features\n    SendPvEMessage(\"This server is PvE\
      \ only.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Combat Logic
    code: "void Player::HandleCombat() {\n    if (World::instance()->IsPvPRealm())\
      \ {\n        // Apply PvP combat rules\n        SetFactionStanding(Faction::HOSTILE);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Apply PvE combat rules\n        SetFactionStanding(Faction::NEUTRAL);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the realm configuration loaded at startup and does
    not dynamically change during runtime. The result is cached for performance reasons,
    so changes to realm settings require a server restart to take effect.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in frequently called functions as it
    may have performance implications if not properly cached. Also, ensure that any
    PvP-related logic is properly tested in both PvP and PvE realms to avoid unexpected
    behavior.
