documentation:
  brief: Estimates the time required for a bot to reach convergence based on learning
    analytics.
  description: The EstimateTimeToConvergence method calculates and returns an estimated
    time in seconds for a specific bot, identified by its GUID, to achieve convergence
    within the learning analytics framework. This estimation is typically used in
    AI-driven bot behavior systems where bots learn and adapt their actions over time.
    The method relies on historical data, training progress, and current performance
    metrics of the specified bot to compute this value. It assumes that the bot's
    learning process follows a predictable pattern and that sufficient data exists
    for accurate prediction.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the estimated time in seconds for the bot to
    reach convergence. Returns 0.0 if no valid estimation can be made due to insufficient
    data or invalid input.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of EstimateTimeToConvergence
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = 12345;\nfloat timeEstimate = learningAnalytics.EstimateTimeToConvergence(botGuid);\n\
      if (timeEstimate > 0.0f)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Estimated convergence time:\
      \ \" << timeEstimate << \" seconds\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely computationally intensive as it may involve statistical
    analysis or machine learning models to predict convergence. It should be called
    sparingly in performance-critical sections of code. The accuracy of the estimation
    depends heavily on the quality and quantity of historical data available for the
    specified bot.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid bot GUID may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect estimations. Ensure that the bot exists and has sufficient learning
    history before invoking this method.
