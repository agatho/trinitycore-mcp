documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of remaining dispel charges on a dispellable aura.
  description: The GetDispelCharges method returns the current number of charges remaining
    for a dispellable aura. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, auras
    can have multiple dispel charges which determine how many times they can be removed
    through dispel effects before disappearing permanently. This value is typically
    decremented each time the aura is successfully dispelled by an ability such as
    Dispel Magic or Abolish Magic. The method provides access to this internal counter
    for managing aura behavior and determining when an aura should be removed from
    a unit.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the number of remaining dispel charges. A value
    of 0 indicates that the aura has no more dispel charges and will be removed immediately
    upon any dispel attempt.
  examples:
  - title: Check dispel charges before attempting to dispel
    code: "Aura* aura = unit->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura && aura->IsDispellable())\
      \ {\n    uint8 charges = aura->GetDispelCharges();\n    if (charges > 0) {\n\
      \        // Proceed with dispel logic\n        // The aura has remaining charges\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Aura is already at zero charges, no further dispels\
      \ possible\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on auras that are confirmed to be dispellable.
    The returned value represents the internal state of the aura's dispel counter
    and may change dynamically during gameplay as the aura is dispelled or otherwise
    modified.
  warnings: Do not assume that all auras with dispel charges will have a value greater
    than zero. Auras can be removed entirely before their dispel charges are consumed,
    especially if they are removed by other means such as duration expiration or direct
    removal effects.
