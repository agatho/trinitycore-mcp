  brief: Initializes player stats for the current level, applying or reapplying stat
    modifiers based on character class and race.
  description: The InitStatsForLevel method sets up a player's base attributes and
    stat values according to their current level, class, and race. This method is
    typically called during character creation or level-up scenarios to ensure proper
    stat distribution. It handles the application of stat modifiers from class-specific
    bonuses and race-based attribute adjustments. The method ensures that players
    have appropriate starting stats for their level, including strength, agility,
    stamina, intellect, and spirit. This function is crucial for maintaining game
    balance and player progression throughout the leveling process.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->InitStatsForLevel(false);

      // Initializes stats for level 1 with no reapplication of modifiers'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during character creation or when leveling
    up. It's typically invoked by the core system when a player reaches a new level,
    ensuring proper stat distribution. The method may involve complex calculations
    based on class-specific stat multipliers and race-based attribute bonuses.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect stat distribution for
    players, potentially affecting gameplay balance. It should only be called at appropriate
    times during character progression, not during regular gameplay sessions.
