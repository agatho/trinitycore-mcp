documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new CommandContext object for handling in-game command execution.
  description: The CommandContext constructor initializes a new instance of the CommandContext
    class, which serves as a container for command-related data and state during the
    execution of World of Warcraft commands within the TrinityCore emulator. This
    context typically holds information about the player or entity issuing the command,
    the command string itself, and any relevant execution parameters. The initialization
    ensures that all internal members are properly set up before the command is processed
    by the command handler system. This constructor is usually invoked internally
    by the command system when a command is received from a client.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Command Context Initialization
    code: 'CommandContext context;

      // The context is now initialized and ready for command processing'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically not called directly by developers but rather
    invoked automatically by the TrinityCore command handling system when a command
    is received. The CommandContext object is usually temporary and destroyed after
    command execution completes.
