  method: GetPendingEventCount
  signature: uint32 LootEventBus::GetPendingEventCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of pending loot events in the event bus.
  description: The GetPendingEventCount method retrieves the current count of loot-related
    events that are queued for processing within the LootEventBus. This is useful
    for monitoring the backlog of loot operations, such as item drops, loot distribution,
    or event triggers that have not yet been executed. The method provides a snapshot
    of the event queue size at the time of invocation and does not modify any internal
    state. It is typically used for debugging, performance monitoring, or ensuring
    that the system is not overwhelmed with pending events.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of pending loot events currently
    queued in the LootEventBus. Returns zero if there are no pending events.
  examples:
  - title: Check Pending Loot Events
    code: "uint32 pendingCount = sLootEventBus->GetPendingEventCount();\nif (pendingCount\
      \ > 100)\n{\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Warning: %u pending loot\
      \ events detected.\", pendingCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. It provides
    a read-only view of the event queue size and does not perform any locking or synchronization
    internally beyond what's required for safe access.
