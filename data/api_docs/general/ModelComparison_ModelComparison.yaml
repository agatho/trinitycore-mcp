documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the ModelComparison class for comparing game
    object models.
  description: The ModelComparison constructor initializes a new instance of the ModelComparison
    class, which is used to compare and analyze different game object models within
    the TrinityCore framework. This class likely handles model data validation, resource
    loading, and comparison operations between various model formats or versions.
    The initialization process may set up internal data structures for storing model
    references, prepare comparison algorithms, and initialize necessary resources
    for model analysis. This constructor is typically called when creating a new model
    comparison context, often in scenarios involving model verification, asset management,
    or content validation within the game engine.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a ModelComparison Instance
    code: 'ModelComparison comparison;

      // The constructor is called automatically when declaring the object

      // This initializes the comparison context for model analysis'
    language: cpp
  notes: This appears to be a default constructor that performs basic initialization
    of the ModelComparison class. Developers should ensure proper cleanup of resources
    if this class manages memory or handles file I/O operations. The actual implementation
    details may vary based on how model comparison is integrated into TrinityCore's
    asset management system.
