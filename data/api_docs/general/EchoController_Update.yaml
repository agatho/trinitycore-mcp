  class: EchoController
  method: Update
  signature: void EchoController::Update(int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the echo controller state based on the time difference since last
    update
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing the echo controller's
    internal state changes over time. It typically handles periodic logic such as
    message propagation, timing calculations, or state transitions that depend on
    elapsed game time. This method is commonly called from the main game loop or AI
    update cycle to ensure timely execution of echo-related behaviors. The implementation
    likely uses the provided time difference parameter to calculate deltaTime-based
    operations and maintain synchronization with the game's frame rate.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the last update call. This
      value is used to calculate time-dependent behaviors and ensure consistent timing
      across different system performance conditions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Usage
    code: "void SomeAI::Update(int diff)\n{\n    m_echoController.Update(diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Update with Conditional Logic
    code: "void EchoController::Update(int diff)\n{\n    if (m_isActive)\n    {\n\
      \        m_elapsedTime += diff;\n        if (m_elapsedTime >= m_updateInterval)\n\
      \        {\n            ProcessEcho();\n            m_elapsedTime = 0;\n   \
      \     }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the game's main update loop to
    ensure proper timing. The diff parameter is crucial for maintaining consistent
    behavior across different frame rates and system performance conditions.
  warnings: Do not call this method without a valid time difference value, as it may
    cause incorrect timing calculations or unexpected behavior in echo-related systems.
