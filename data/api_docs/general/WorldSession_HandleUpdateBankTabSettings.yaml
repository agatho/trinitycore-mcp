documentation:
  brief: Updates the settings for a bank tab, including its name and icon.
  description: The HandleUpdateBankTabSettings method processes incoming client packets
    to update the configuration of a specific bank tab. This includes changes to the
    tab's name and icon, which are stored in the player's bank tab settings. The method
    validates that the player has access to the specified bank tab and ensures that
    the updated settings are persisted in the database. It is typically invoked when
    a player interacts with the bank tab configuration interface in the game client.
  parameters:
  - name: updateBankTabSettings
    description: A packet containing the updated bank tab settings, including the
      tab ID, new name, and icon index.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Bank Tab Settings
    code: 'WorldPackets::Bank::UpdateBankTabSettings updatePacket;

      updatePacket.TabId = 0;

      updatePacket.Name = "New Tab Name";

      updatePacket.Icon = 123;

      // This would be called internally by the session handler

      // session->HandleUpdateBankTabSettings(updatePacket);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the client has already validated the input data.
    The actual database update is deferred until the transaction is committed, ensuring
    consistency in case of errors.
  warnings: Improper handling of tab IDs or invalid icon indices can lead to visual
    glitches or data corruption in the bank tab interface.
