  class: ObjectGuidFactory
  method: CreateLFGList
  signature: ObjectGuid ObjectGuidFactory::CreateLFGList(uint8 arg1, uint64 counter)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new ObjectGuid for a LFGList entry using the provided
    arguments.
  description: The CreateLFGList method generates a unique ObjectGuid specifically
    designed for LFGList (Looking for Group List) entries within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method is typically used when creating new group listings in the game's Looking
    for Group system, ensuring each listing has a globally unique identifier. The
    generated GUID incorporates both the provided argument values and internal counter
    logic to guarantee uniqueness across all LFGList entries in the server instance.
    This method is part of the ObjectGuidFactory class which centralizes the creation
    of various types of ObjectGuids used throughout the game's object management system.
  parameters:
  - name: arg1
    description: First argument used to construct the GUID, typically representing
      a category or type identifier for the LFG list entry. Valid values are usually
      within the range of 0-255 as per standard uint8 conventions.
  - name: counter
    description: A 64-bit counter value used to ensure uniqueness of the generated
      GUID. This value is typically incremented for each new LFGList entry created,
      preventing collisions in GUID generation across multiple simultaneous operations.
  returns: Returns an ObjectGuid object that uniquely identifies a LFGList entry.
    The returned GUID follows the standard TrinityCore ObjectGuid format with appropriate
    type and counter values to distinguish it as an LFGList identifier.
  examples:
  - title: Basic LFGList GUID Creation
    code: 'ObjectGuidFactory guidFactory;

      ObjectGuid lfgGuid = guidFactory.CreateLFGList(5, 12345);

      // Creates a new LFGList GUID with category ID 5 and counter value 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Multiple LFGList Entries
    code: "ObjectGuidFactory guidFactory;\nstd::vector<ObjectGuid> lfgGuids;\nfor\
      \ (uint64 i = 0; i < 10; ++i)\n{\n    ObjectGuid guid = guidFactory.CreateLFGList(10,\
      \ i);\n    lfgGuids.push_back(guid);\n}\n// Generates 10 unique LFGList GUIDs\
      \ with incrementing counter values"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called within the context of LFGList operations.
    The ObjectGuidFactory instance must be properly initialized before calling this
    method. The counter parameter is crucial for maintaining uniqueness across multiple
    calls and should be managed carefully to avoid potential collisions.
  warnings: Do not reuse counter values for different LFGList entries as this will
    result in GUID collisions. Ensure that the arg1 parameter is within valid range
    for LFGList categories, otherwise the generated GUID may not behave correctly
    with the game's internal systems.
