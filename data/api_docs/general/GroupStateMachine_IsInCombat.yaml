documentation:
  brief: Checks if the group is currently in combat state
  description: The IsInCombat method determines whether the group represented by the
    GroupStateMachine is currently engaged in combat. This method evaluates the combat
    status of all members within the group and returns true if any group member is
    in combat, or false if none are engaged in combat. The method is typically used
    by AI systems and game logic to make decisions based on the group's current engagement
    state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if any member of the group is currently in combat, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check group combat status
    code: "if (groupStateMachine->IsInCombat()) {\n    // Handle group in combat\n\
      \    printf(\"Group is in combat\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle group not in\
      \ combat\n    printf(\"Group is not in combat\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve checking the combat status of multiple group members,
    which could have performance implications for large groups. The implementation
    likely caches combat state information to avoid repeated expensive operations.
