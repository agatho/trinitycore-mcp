    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the reputation value for a specified faction.
  description: The GetReputation method returns the current reputation level of the
    player towards a specific faction. This value is used in World of Warcraft to
    determine how friendly or hostile a player is toward a particular faction, which
    affects quest availability, vendor prices, and NPC interactions. The method takes
    a FactionEntry pointer as input, which represents the faction for which the reputation
    is being queried. Reputation values typically range from -42000 (worst) to 42000
    (best), with 0 being neutral. This method does not modify any internal state and
    is safe to call multiple times.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int32 value representing the player's current reputation level
    with the specified faction. Negative values indicate hostility, zero indicates
    neutrality, and positive values indicate friendship or favor. The exact range
    can vary depending on faction-specific reputation caps.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Reputation for a Specific Faction
    code: "const FactionEntry* faction = sFactionStore.LookupEntry(72); // Gnomeregan\n\
      int32 rep = player->GetReputationMgr().GetReputation(faction);\nif (rep > 0)\n\
      \    printf(\"Player is friendly with Gnomeregan (%d)\\n\", rep);\nelse if (rep\
      \ < 0)\n    printf(\"Player is hostile with Gnomeregan (%d)\\n\", rep);\nelse\n\
      \    printf(\"Player is neutral with Gnomeregan\\n\");"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses the player's reputation data stored in memory and returns
    a cached value. It does not perform any database lookups or calculations. The
    faction entry must be valid; passing an invalid pointer may result in undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the FactionEntry pointer passed to this method is valid and
    corresponds to a known faction in the game's database. Passing null or an invalid
    pointer will likely cause crashes or incorrect results.
