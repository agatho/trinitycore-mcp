documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the LFGBotSelector class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the LFGBotSelector
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the class exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is typically used to access the global LFGBotSelector object
    that manages LFG (Looking For Group) bot selection logic within the TrinityCore
    server. The method performs lazy initialization, creating the instance on first
    call if it does not already exist. This design allows for centralized management
    of LFG bot behavior and selection criteria across the entire server.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of LFGBotSelector. The returned pointer
    is never null as the method ensures instantiation on first access.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the LFG Bot Selector Singleton
    code: 'LFGBotSelector* selector = LFGBotSelector::instance();

      // Use the selector to manage LFG bot behavior

      selector->SelectBotForGroup(player, group);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe in TrinityCore's implementation as it uses a static
    local variable for singleton instantiation. The singleton instance is created
    during the first call and persists for the entire server runtime. Developers should
    not manually instantiate LFGBotSelector objects directly.
  warnings: Do not attempt to delete or destroy the returned pointer as it is managed
    by the singleton pattern. Calling this method from multiple threads simultaneously
    is safe, but modifying shared state through the returned instance requires proper
    synchronization.
