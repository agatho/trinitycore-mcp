documentation:
  brief: Executes idle behavior for a bot, performing actions when no active tasks
    are assigned.
  description: The PerformIdleAction method is responsible for handling the default
    behavior of a bot when it is not engaged in any specific task or activity. This
    method typically manages the bot's idle state by executing periodic actions such
    as looting nearby items, following a predefined patrol route, or performing basic
    AI routines. It ensures that bots remain active and useful even during periods
    of inactivity, contributing to a more immersive gameplay experience. The method
    is usually invoked automatically by the game loop when no other actions are queued
    for the bot.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotLifecycle* lifecycle = player->GetBotLifecycle();

      lifecycle->PerformIdleAction();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore AI system.
    Developers should not need to invoke this directly unless implementing custom
    bot behavior logic. The actual idle actions performed may vary depending on the
    bot's type, configuration, and current game state.
