  class: LFGMgr
  method: GetQueue
  signature: LFGQueue & LFGMgr::GetQueue(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the LFG queue associated with the specified GUID.
  description: The GetQueue method retrieves a reference to the LFG (Looking for Group)
    queue corresponding to the provided GUID. This method is used internally by the
    TrinityCore server to manage player group finding requests and queue states. The
    GUID typically represents a player's unique identifier within the game world.
    The returned LFGQueue reference allows access to all queue-related data such as
    players in the queue, dungeon information, and queue status. This method assumes
    that a valid queue exists for the given GUID; otherwise, behavior is undefined.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose LFG queue is to
      be retrieved. Must be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  returns: A reference to the LFGQueue associated with the specified GUID. The reference
    is guaranteed to be valid if the GUID corresponds to an active queue entry.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and modify LFG queue
    code: 'LFGQueue& queue = lfgMgr.GetQueue(playerGuid);

      queue.SetDungeonId(1234);

      queue.SetStatus(LFG_STATUS_WAITING);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if player is in LFG queue
    code: "uint64 playerGuid = player->GetGUID();\ntry {\n    LFGQueue& queue = lfgMgr.GetQueue(playerGuid);\n\
      \    // Player is in queue\n} catch (const std::exception&) {\n    // Player\
      \ not found in any queue\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation on an internal data structure, so
    repeated calls with the same GUID may have performance implications. The returned
    reference should be used carefully as it directly modifies the underlying queue
    state. Ensure that the GUID passed is valid and corresponds to an actual player
    in the game world.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always verify that a queue exists for the given GUID before
    calling this method, especially when dealing with dynamic player data.
