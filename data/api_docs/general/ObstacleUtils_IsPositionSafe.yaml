  class: ObstacleUtils
  method: IsPositionSafe
  signature: bool ObstacleUtils::IsPositionSafe(const int & pos, const int & obstacles,
    float safetyRadius)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given position is safe from obstacles within a specified
    safety radius.
  description: The IsPositionSafe method evaluates whether a specific position in
    the game world is free from obstructions or hazards based on the provided obstacle
    data and safety margin. It checks if the area around the given position is clear
    of defined obstacles, ensuring that the space is navigable and secure for units
    or objects to occupy. This utility function is commonly used in pathfinding, AI
    behavior decisions, and positioning logic where avoiding collisions or unsafe
    zones is critical. The method requires valid obstacle data and a positive safety
    radius to perform its evaluation.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position to evaluate for safety, represented as an integer identifier
      or coordinate value.
  - name: obstacles
    description: An integer representing the obstacle data or identifier used to determine
      which obstacles are relevant for the safety check.
  - name: safetyRadius
    description: A floating-point value defining the radius around the position that
      must be clear of obstacles. Must be a positive number.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is safe within the given safety
    radius, meaning no obstacles are present in that area. Returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: bool isSafe = ObstacleUtils::IsPositionSafe(12345, 67890, 2.5f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Movement
    code: "if (ObstacleUtils::IsPositionSafe(playerPos, obstacleData, 3.0f)) {\n \
      \   player->MoveTo(playerPos);\n} else {\n    player->Say(\"Position unsafe!\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other pathfinding or navigation
    utilities within TrinityCore. The accuracy of the safety check depends on the
    quality and completeness of the obstacle data provided. Performance may be impacted
    when evaluating large numbers of positions or using very small safety radii.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'pos' and 'obstacles' parameters are valid before calling
    this method, as invalid inputs may lead to undefined behavior. The safety radius
    should always be a positive value; otherwise, results are unpredictable.
