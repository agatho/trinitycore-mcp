api:
  class: Player
  method: GetBattlegroundTypeId
  signature: int Player::GetBattlegroundTypeId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the battleground type ID currently assigned to the player.
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier representing the type of
    battleground the player is currently participating in. The returned value corresponds
    to the battleground type ID as defined in the game's internal data structures,
    which determines the specific battleground mechanics and rules that apply to the
    player's current engagement. It is commonly used for checking whether a player
    is in a specific battleground type or for managing battleground-related logic
    within the game system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the battleground type ID. This value corresponds
    to the internal identifier used by the game to distinguish between different battleground
    types, such as 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, etc. A return value of zero indicates that the player
    is not currently in a battleground.
  examples:
  - title: Check current battleground type
    code: "int bgType = player->GetBattlegroundTypeId();\nif (bgType == 1) {\n   \
      \ // Player is in a 1v1 battleground\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other battleground-related
    functions to determine the current state of the player's participation in a battleground.
    It is important to note that this value may change during gameplay as players
    are assigned to different battlegrounds or when they leave a battleground.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in scenarios where the player might
    be transitioning between battlegrounds, as the return value may not reflect the
    actual current state if the player has just been teleported or moved to a new
    location.
