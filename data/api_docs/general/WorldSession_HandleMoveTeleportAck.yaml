documentation:
  brief: Processes a teleport acknowledgment packet from the client to confirm movement
    teleportation.
  description: The HandleMoveTeleportAck method is responsible for processing teleport
    acknowledgment messages sent by the client in response to a server-initiated teleportation.
    This method validates the teleportation request and ensures that the player's
    position has been correctly updated on the server side. It typically handles the
    final confirmation step after a teleport operation, ensuring synchronization between
    client and server states. The method is part of the movement handling system within
    WorldSession and plays a crucial role in maintaining game state consistency during
    player movement operations.

  - title: Basic usage in movement handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleMoveTeleportAck(WorldPackets::Movement::MoveTeleportAck&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Process teleport acknowledgment\n    if (GetPlayer())\n\
      \    {\n        GetPlayer()->UpdatePosition(packet.Pos, false);\n        GetPlayer()->SendHeartBeat();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the movement packet processing
    pipeline. It should be invoked only when a teleportation has been previously initiated
    by the server. The method assumes that the client's position data in the packet
    is valid and does not perform extensive validation beyond basic state checks.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to desynchronization between
    client and server positions, potentially causing players to appear in incorrect
    locations or experience movement-related bugs. Ensure proper player state validation
    before processing the teleport acknowledgment.
