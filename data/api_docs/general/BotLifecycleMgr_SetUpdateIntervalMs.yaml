  class: BotLifecycleMgr
  method: SetUpdateIntervalMs
  signature: void BotLifecycleMgr::SetUpdateIntervalMs(uint32 intervalMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the update interval for bot lifecycle management in milliseconds.
  description: The SetUpdateIntervalMs method configures how frequently the BotLifecycleMgr
    performs its periodic updates and maintenance tasks. This interval determines
    the frequency at which bots are processed for behavior updates, resource management,
    and state synchronization. The value is typically set during initialization or
    configuration of the bot system, and affects all managed bots within the lifecycle
    manager's scope. Changes to this interval take effect immediately for subsequent
    update cycles.
  parameters:
  - name: intervalMs
    description: The update interval in milliseconds. Must be a positive integer value.
      Lower values increase update frequency and responsiveness but may impact performance.
      Typical values range from 100ms to 5000ms depending on system requirements.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotLifecycleMgr* mgr = BotLifecycleMgr::Instance();

      mgr->SetUpdateIntervalMs(1000); // Set update interval to 1 second'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Tuning
    code: 'BotLifecycleMgr* mgr = BotLifecycleMgr::Instance();

      // For high-performance servers with many bots

      mgr->SetUpdateIntervalMs(500); // Update every 500ms

      // For low-resource environments

      mgr->SetUpdateIntervalMs(2000); // Update every 2 seconds'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the bot processing loop's frequency. Setting
    very low intervals (under 100ms) may cause performance degradation on servers
    with many active bots. The interval is used as a base for scheduling bot updates
    and should be chosen based on server load and desired responsiveness.
  warnings: Changing the update interval while bots are actively running may cause
    inconsistent behavior or missed updates. It's recommended to set this value before
    starting bot operations or during server maintenance windows.
