  class: Unit
  method: _EnterVehicle
  signature: void Unit::_EnterVehicle(Vehicle * vehicle, int8 seatId, const AuraApplication
    * aurApp)
documentation:
  brief: Enters a vehicle using the specified seat and aura application.
  description: This method facilitates the process of entering a vehicle for a unit,
    typically used in conjunction with vehicle seat mechanics. It handles the actual
    entry into the vehicle by setting up the necessary vehicle data structures and
    applying the appropriate aura application. The method is commonly invoked during
    player or creature vehicle entry operations, particularly when using specific
    seat IDs or when the vehicle has been set up with an aura application.
  parameters:
  - name: vehicle
    description: Pointer to the Vehicle object that the unit will enter. Must be a
      valid vehicle instance.
  - name: seatId
    description: The seat ID to enter, typically ranging from -1 to 7. A value of
      -1 indicates the default seat, while values 0-7 represent specific seat positions.
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication that will be applied upon entering
      the vehicle. Can be nullptr if no aura application is required.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vehicle Entry Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      Vehicle* vehicle = new Vehicle;

      AuraApplication* aurApp = new AuraApplication;

      unit->_EnterVehicle(vehicle, 0, aurApp);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Vehicle Entry with Null Aura
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      Vehicle* vehicle = new Vehicle;

      unit->_EnterVehicle(vehicle, -1, nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with vehicle-related mechanics
    and may involve complex interactions with the vehicle's seat data. It should be
    called only when the unit has already been set up for vehicle entry, and the vehicle
    must be valid.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to invalid vehicle entries or crashes
    if the vehicle is not properly initialized. Ensure that the vehicle object is
    valid before calling this method.
