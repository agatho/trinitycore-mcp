  signature: bool Spell::IsValidDeadOrAliveTarget(const Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a target unit is valid for spell casting based on alive/dead
    status.
  description: This method checks if a target unit is valid for spell casting by evaluating
    whether the target is either alive or dead, depending on the spell's requirements.
    It ensures that spells can only be cast on targets that meet the specified alive/dead
    criteria, preventing invalid targeting scenarios in World of Warcraft combat mechanics.
    The method typically returns true when the target meets the spell's alive/dead
    condition, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Unit object being evaluated for validity. This parameter
      must not be null, and represents the target unit that is being checked against
      the spell's alive/dead requirements.
  returns: Returns true if the target unit meets the spell's alive/dead criteria,
    false otherwise. The method may return false if the target is null or if the spell
    does not allow targeting of dead units when the target is alive, or vice versa.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spell->IsValidDeadOrAliveTarget(target)) {\n    // Proceed with spell\
      \ casting\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell validation
    methods to ensure proper targeting. It may be called during spell preparation
    or execution phases, and its performance impact is minimal as it only performs
    basic checks on target status.
  warnings: The method assumes that the target unit is valid and not null; calling
    this method with a null target can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Care
    should be taken when using this method in combination with other spell validation
    methods, as it may not cover all edge cases related to targeting.
