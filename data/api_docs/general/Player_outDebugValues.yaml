  brief: Outputs debug information about the player's current state and values to
    the console or log system
  description: The outDebugValues method is a diagnostic utility that prints detailed
    internal state information about a Player object to the system's debug output.
    This method typically outputs various player attributes, statistics, and configuration
    values that are useful for developers during debugging, testing, or troubleshooting.
    The output usually includes character data such as health, mana, experience points,
    level, position coordinates, and other relevant game state variables. This method
    is primarily used in development environments and debug builds to help identify
    issues with player data or game mechanics.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Output Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get a player reference

      player->outDebugValues(); // Outputs debug information to console/log'
    language: cpp
  - title: Debugging Player State in Game Logic
    code: "void SomeGameFunction(Player* player)\n{\n    // ... some game logic ...\n\
      \    if (player->GetLevel() < 10)\n    {\n        player->outDebugValues();\
      \ // Debug output when player level is low\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically only produces output in debug builds or when debug
    logging is enabled. The exact format and content of the debug output may vary
    depending on the TrinityCore version and compilation settings. It should not be
    called in performance-critical code paths as it may involve multiple string operations
    and log system calls.
  warnings: This method is intended for debugging purposes only and should not be
    used in production code or performance-sensitive areas. The output may contain
    sensitive player data and should be handled appropriately in secure environments.
    Calling this method excessively can impact performance due to logging overhead.
