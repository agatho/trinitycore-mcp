  method: UpdateMaxPower
  signature: void Creature::UpdateMaxPower(int power)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the maximum power value for the creature.
  description: The UpdateMaxPower method adjusts the maximum power (such as mana,
    rage, or energy) that a creature can have. This method is typically used when
    modifying a creature's power attributes during gameplay, such as in response to
    level changes, buffs, or debuffs. It ensures that the creature's power statistics
    are properly synchronized with its current state. The method does not directly
    modify the creature's current power value, but rather updates the maximum allowable
    power amount.
  parameters:
  - name: power
    description: The new maximum power value to set for the creature. This should
      be a non-negative integer representing the updated maximum power amount.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Power to 1000
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->UpdateMaxPower(1000);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Power Based on Creature Level
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      uint32 newMaxPower = creature->GetLevel() * 50;

      creature->UpdateMaxPower(newMaxPower);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it may trigger updates to the creature's
    power display and related systems. It is recommended to validate the input value
    before calling this method to prevent unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling UpdateMaxPower with a negative value may result in undefined behavior
    or client-side issues. Always ensure that the provided power value is valid and
    within acceptable ranges for the creature type.
