documentation:
  brief: Removes an enchantment from the specified enchantment slot of the item
  description: The ClearEnchantment method removes any active enchantment from the
    given enchantment slot on the item. This operation effectively deactivates the
    enchantment effect and updates the item's state accordingly. The method is typically
    used when enchantments need to be removed due to item modifications, player actions,
    or game events such as disenchanting or re-enchanting. It ensures that the enchantment
    data is properly cleared from the item's internal structure without leaving any
    residual effects.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The enchantment slot to clear. This parameter specifies which of
      the item's enchantment slots should have its enchantment removed. Valid values
      are typically defined by the EnchantmentSlot enumeration, which includes slots
      like ENCHANTMENT_SLOT_0, ENCHANTMENT_SLOT_1, etc., depending on the item type
      and number of available enchantment slots.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clear a specific enchantment slot
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0, SLOT_HEAD);\nif\
      \ (item)\n{\n    item->ClearEnchantment(ENCHANTMENT_SLOT_0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Clear all enchantments from an item
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0, SLOT_NECK);\nif\
      \ (item)\n{\n    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_ENCHANTMENT_SLOT; ++i)\n    {\n   \
      \     item->ClearEnchantment(EnchantmentSlot(i));\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not trigger any visual effects or notifications to the player.
    It only modifies the internal enchantment state of the item. The actual removal
    of enchantment effects from the player's stats should be handled separately by
    calling appropriate update methods or sending relevant packets to the client.
  warnings: Ensure that the slot parameter is valid and within the range of available
    enchantment slots for the item type. Passing an invalid slot index may result
    in undefined behavior or corruption of the item's data structure.
