  class: AuctionHouse

  signature: void AuctionHouse::TrackCompetitorBehavior(uint32 sellerGuid, const AuctionItem
    & auction)
documentation:
  brief: Tracks competitor behavior for a given auction item and seller GUID.
  description: The TrackCompetitorBehavior method monitors and records the bidding
    behavior of competitors in the auction house system. It takes the unique identifier
    of the seller and an auction item as inputs to analyze how other players are interacting
    with the auction. This functionality is typically used for game mechanics such
    as detecting price manipulation, identifying high-value bidders, or implementing
    anti-cheat measures. The method does not return any value but updates internal
    tracking structures within the AuctionHouse class. It assumes that the provided
    sellerGuid and auction item are valid and exist in the auction system.
  parameters:
  - name: sellerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the seller who listed the auction
      item. This value must correspond to a valid player in the game world.
  - name: auction
    description: A reference to the AuctionItem structure representing the auctioned
      item. This includes details such as item properties, starting bid, current bid,
      and time remaining.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 sellerGuid = 12345;

      AuctionItem auctionItem;

      // Assume auctionItem is populated with valid data

      auctionHouse->TrackCompetitorBehavior(sellerGuid, auctionItem);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal data structures used for monitoring and
    analytics. It may be called frequently during auction events, so performance considerations
    should be taken into account when implementing or extending this functionality.
