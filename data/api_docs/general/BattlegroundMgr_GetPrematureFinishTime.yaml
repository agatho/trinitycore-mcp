  class: BattlegroundMgr
  method: GetPrematureFinishTime
  signature: uint32 BattlegroundMgr::GetPrematureFinishTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the time in milliseconds after which a battleground is prematurely
    finished if no players remain.
  description: The GetPrematureFinishTime method retrieves the configured timeout
    value for how long a battleground will wait before automatically finishing when
    all players have left or been removed from the match. This mechanism prevents
    battlegrounds from remaining active indefinitely with no participants, ensuring
    efficient resource usage and preventing server lag. The returned value represents
    the number of milliseconds that must pass without any players in the battleground
    before it is considered prematurely finished. This timeout is typically set during
    battleground configuration and may vary based on the specific battleground type
    or server settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the time in milliseconds after which a battleground
    will be automatically finished if no players remain in the match. Returns 0 if
    premature finish is disabled for the battleground.
  examples:
  - title: Check Premature Finish Time
    code: "uint32 time = sBattlegroundMgr->GetPrematureFinishTime();\nif (time > 0)\n\
      {\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"bg\", \"Battleground will finish prematurely after %u ms\
      \ if no players remain.\", time);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the battleground system to determine
    when to clean up inactive battleground instances. The value returned should be
    consistent with server configuration settings related to battleground timeouts.
