documentation:
  brief: Manages the application and renewal of curses on the Warlock's target.
  description: The ManageCurseApplication method is responsible for handling the logic
    related to applying, refreshing, and maintaining curse effects on the Warlock's
    current target. This includes checking if a curse is already applied, determining
    whether it needs to be refreshed based on duration or debuff status, and ensuring
    that the most effective curse is maintained according to the Warlock's spell priority
    and combat strategy. The method typically integrates with the Warlock's AI decision-making
    process to optimize spell usage during combat.

    code: "void WarlockAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (UpdateVictim())\n   \
      \     return;\n\n    ManageCurseApplication();\n    // Other AI logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the Warlock's main UpdateAI loop,
    ensuring that curses are continuously applied or refreshed as needed. It may interact
    with internal state tracking variables such as target curse status and spell cooldowns.
