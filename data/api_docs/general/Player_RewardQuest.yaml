  brief: RewardQuest rewards a player with quest completion rewards based on provided
    quest and reward type
  description: The RewardQuest method handles the process of rewarding players with
    quest completion rewards when they complete a quest. It takes a quest object,
    reward type, and reward ID to determine what rewards should be given to the player.
    The method also supports optional parameters for quest giver and announcement
    flags to control how the reward is processed and announced. This method is typically
    used in conjunction with quest completion logic to ensure proper reward distribution
    when players finish quests.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that was completed by the player. This
      determines what rewards are given based on the quest's reward properties.
  - name: rewardType
    description: Integer specifying the type of reward being given. Valid values include
      0 (default), 1 (item), 2 (experience), 3 (money), 4 (skill), 5 (reputation).
  - name: rewardId
    description: Integer representing the specific reward ID to be given. This could
      be an item ID, skill ID, or other reward identifier depending on the reward
      type.
  - name: questGiver
    description: Pointer to integer value that controls the quest giver's behavior.
      If null, default behavior is used; otherwise, specifies how the quest giver
      should behave.
  - name: announce
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the reward should be announced to
      the player. True means announce, false means no announcement.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Reward Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      Quest* quest = GetQuest();

      player->RewardQuest(quest, 0, 12345, nullptr, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Quest Reward with Custom Parameters
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      Quest* quest = GetQuest();

      int questGiver = 0;

      player->RewardQuest(quest, 2, 10000, &questGiver, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally when a player completes a quest.
    It handles reward distribution based on the quest's reward properties and may
    be used in conjunction with other methods like QuestComplete or QuestReward. The
    method should be used carefully as it may affect player experience points, items,
    and reputation.
  warnings: The method should only be called after verifying that the player actually
    completed the quest. Calling this method without proper validation can result
    in incorrect reward distribution or game mechanics issues. Also note that this
    method does not handle quest completion itself - it only handles reward distribution.
