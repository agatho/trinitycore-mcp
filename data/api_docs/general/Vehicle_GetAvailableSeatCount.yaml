  signature: uint8 Vehicle::GetAvailableSeatCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of available seats on the vehicle.
  description: The GetAvailableSeatCount method retrieves the count of empty seats
    currently available on a vehicle. This value represents how many passengers can
    still board the vehicle before it reaches its maximum capacity. The method is
    commonly used in vehicle-related game mechanics such as determining if a player
    can mount a vehicle, or for UI displays showing seat availability. It's important
    to note that this count may change dynamically as players board or dismount the
    vehicle during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the number of empty seats currently available
    on the vehicle. Returns 0 if the vehicle is full or if the vehicle has no seats
    defined.
  examples:
  - title: Check if vehicle has available seats before mounting
    code: "if (vehicle->GetAvailableSeatCount() > 0)\n{\n    // Allow player to mount\
      \ the vehicle\n    player->EnterVehicle(vehicle);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Vehicle\
      \ is full, send message to player\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"This vehicle\
      \ is full.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method does not account for seat restrictions or passenger requirements
    that might prevent certain players from occupying a seat. It simply returns the
    raw count of empty seats. This method should be called frequently in performance-critical
    sections as it's a simple getter operation with no complex calculations.
