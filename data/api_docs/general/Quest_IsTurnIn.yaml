documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a quest is ready for turn-in
  description: The IsTurnIn method checks if a quest has been completed and is ready
    for submission to the quest giver. This method evaluates the quest's completion
    status, including whether all objectives have been met, items have been collected,
    and any required actions have been performed. It serves as a crucial validation
    step in the quest progression system, ensuring that players cannot turn in quests
    before they are fully completed. The method returns true when the quest is ready
    for turn-in, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest is ready for turn-in, false if not. This indicates
    whether all quest requirements have been met and the quest can be submitted to
    the NPC.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (quest->IsTurnIn()) {\n    // Quest is ready for turn-in\n    // Proceed\
      \ with quest submission\n}\nelse {\n    // Quest is not yet ready\n    // Continue\
      \ with quest progression\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest validation
    methods to determine the overall quest status. It may be called during quest completion
    checks or when checking if a player can turn in a quest. Performance considerations
    are minimal as this method only performs basic checks.
  warnings: The method should not be used to determine if a quest is complete, as
    it only indicates whether the quest is ready for submission. A quest may be complete
    but not yet ready for turn-in if certain conditions haven't been met.
