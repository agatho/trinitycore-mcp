  method: WorldObjectSpellLineTargetCheck
  signature: void WorldObjectSpellLineTargetCheck::WorldObjectSpellLineTargetCheck(const
    int * srcPosition, const int * dstPosition, float lineWidth, float range, WorldObject
    * caster, const SpellInfo * spellInfo, SpellTargetCheckTypes selectionType, const
    int * condList, SpellTargetObjectTypes objectType)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a spell line target check with specified parameters for validating
    spell targets along a line.
  description: The WorldObjectSpellLineTargetCheck constructor initializes a spell
    target validation mechanism that checks whether spell targets fall within a defined
    line from source to destination. This method is used in TrinityCore's spell system
    to enforce geometric constraints on spell targeting, such as ensuring targets
    are within a specific width and range of a straight line between two points. It
    supports various selection types for determining valid targets and can incorporate
    conditional lists for additional filtering. The implementation typically occurs
    during spell casting logic when validating potential spell targets against the
    defined line geometry.
  parameters:
  - name: srcPosition
    description: Pointer to an array of three integers representing the source position
      coordinates (x, y, z) in world space
  - name: dstPosition
    description: Pointer to an array of three integers representing the destination
      position coordinates (x, y, z) in world space
  - name: lineWidth
    description: Float value defining the width of the line segment used for target
      validation in world units
  - name: range
    description: Float value specifying the maximum distance from the line for a target
      to be considered valid
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that is casting the spell, used for context
      and targeting logic
  - name: spellInfo
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure containing information about the
      spell being cast
  - name: selectionType
    description: Enumeration value indicating how targets should be selected from
      the valid candidates (e.g., nearest, furthest, random)
  - name: condList
    description: Pointer to an array of integers representing conditional requirements
      for target validation
  - name: objectType
    description: Enumeration value specifying the type of WorldObject targets to consider
      (e.g., players, creatures, game objects)
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic spell line target check initialization
    code: 'int srcPos[3] = {100, 200, 300};

      int dstPos[3] = {150, 250, 350};

      WorldObject* caster = player;

      const SpellInfo* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(12345);

      WorldObjectSpellLineTargetCheck check(srcPos, dstPos, 5.0f, 30.0f, caster, spellInfo,
      TARGET_CHECK_TYPE_NEAREST, nullptr, TYPE_MASK_PLAYER);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore's spell system and
    should not be called directly in most cases. The parameters must be properly initialized
    before calling to avoid undefined behavior. Performance can be affected when using
    large range values or complex conditional lists.
  warnings: Incorrect initialization of srcPosition or dstPosition arrays may lead
    to invalid target checks. Ensure that the caster object is valid and not null.
    Using invalid spellInfo pointers will cause crashes during spell execution.
