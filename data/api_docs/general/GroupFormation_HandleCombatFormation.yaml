  class: GroupFormation
  method: HandleCombatFormation
  signature: void GroupFormation::HandleCombatFormation(const int & enemyPositions)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the group formation to combat mode based on enemy positions.
  description: The HandleCombatFormation method configures the group's tactical formation
    in response to enemy positioning. This method adjusts the player's group layout
    to optimize combat effectiveness by determining appropriate positioning strategies
    relative to enemy locations. It is typically invoked during combat scenarios where
    strategic positioning is critical for group performance. The method modifies internal
    group formation state and may influence AI behavior or player movement patterns.
  parameters:
  - name: enemyPositions
    description: An integer value representing the number of enemy positions or a
      bitmask indicating enemy distribution patterns. This parameter determines how
      the group should adjust its formation to best counter the enemy arrangement.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Scenario
    code: 'GroupFormation formation;

      formation.HandleCombatFormation(3); // Adjusts formation for 3 enemy positions'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Formation Adjustment Based on Enemy Count
    code: 'int enemyCount = GetEnemyCount();

      GroupFormation formation;

      formation.HandleCombatFormation(enemyCount); // Dynamically adjusts formation
      based on current enemies'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the group's AI system to reposition members.
    It may trigger visual updates or sound effects related to tactical formation changes.
    The enemyPositions parameter should be validated to prevent invalid formation
    states.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context may result in unexpected positioning
    behavior. Ensure that enemy positions are accurately calculated before invoking
    this function to avoid misalignment of group members.
