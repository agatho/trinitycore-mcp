documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown tracking for Druid AI abilities based on elapsed time
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method manages the internal cooldown state of a
    Druid AI character by processing the time elapsed since the last update. This
    method is typically called during the AI's update cycle to decrement active cooldown
    timers and make abilities available when their cooldown periods expire. It ensures
    that the Druid AI respects game mechanics such as spell cooldowns, ability recovery
    times, and resource management. The method operates on a per-instance basis and
    modifies internal state variables to reflect current cooldown statuses.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateCooldowns Call
    code: "void Update() {\n    // Called every AI update cycle\n    druidAI->UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void DruidAI::Update(const uint32 diff) {\n    // Update cooldowns first\n\
      \    UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n    \n    // Continue with other AI logic\n   \
      \ if (CanCastSpell()) {\n        CastSpell();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the AI update loop to maintain
    accurate cooldown tracking. The 'diff' parameter represents milliseconds since
    last update, which is crucial for precise timing of ability availability.
  warnings: Failure to call this method regularly may result in abilities appearing
    available when they are still on cooldown, or vice versa. The method assumes proper
    initialization of internal cooldown state variables.
