  brief: Updates the hunter's buff status and applies relevant combat enhancements.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method manages the application and maintenance of all
    active buffs for a Survival Hunter class character. This includes checking for
    buff expiration, applying new buffs based on current abilities and talents, and
    ensuring that the hunter maintains optimal combat performance through proper buff
    management. The method typically integrates with the game's combat system to ensure
    that buffs are refreshed or reapplied as needed during gameplay. It is called
    regularly by the AI system to maintain up-to-date buff states for the hunter.
