documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the QuestTurnIn class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the QuestTurnIn
    class, providing global access to a single, shared instance of the quest turn-in
    handler. This method ensures that only one QuestTurnIn object exists throughout
    the application lifecycle, which is essential for managing quest-related turn-in
    logic consistently across the game world. The returned instance can be used to
    access various quest turn-in functionalities such as validating quest completion,
    handling reward distribution, and updating player quest states.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton QuestTurnIn instance. The method should never
    return a null pointer under normal circumstances as it's designed to always provide
    a valid instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'QuestTurnIn* turnInHandler = QuestTurnIn::instance();

      // Use the handler to process quest turn-ins

      bool success = turnInHandler->ProcessQuestTurnIn(player, questId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Turn-In Logic
    code: "if (QuestTurnIn::instance()->CanTurnInQuest(player, questId))\n{\n    QuestTurnIn::instance()->CompleteQuest(player,\
      \ questId);\n    // Handle quest completion rewards\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the classic singleton pattern implementation. The QuestTurnIn
    instance is typically initialized during server startup and persists for the entire
    runtime of the TrinityCore server. Developers should be aware that accessing this
    singleton from multiple threads requires proper synchronization if thread safety
    is a concern.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, modifying the state through this instance affects
    all quest turn-in operations globally. Be cautious when testing or debugging quest
    turn-in logic as changes might impact other players and quests in the game world.
