  class: GridMap
  method: getHeight
  signature: float GridMap::getHeight(float x, float y) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the height value at the specified coordinates within the grid map.
  description: The getHeight method is used to obtain the elevation (Z-coordinate)
    of a given point on the grid map. This functionality is essential for determining
    terrain height at specific locations, which is crucial for character movement,
    collision detection, and proper positioning in the game world. The method takes
    x and y coordinates as input parameters and returns the corresponding height value.
    It's commonly used during pathfinding calculations, object placement, and ensuring
    that units are correctly positioned relative to the terrain. The method operates
    on a per-grid basis and may interpolate between known height points for more accurate
    results.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the point for which to retrieve the height value.
      This represents the horizontal position in the game world's coordinate system.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the point for which to retrieve the height value.
      This represents the vertical position in the game world's coordinate system.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the height (Z-coordinate) at the specified
    (x, y) coordinates. If the coordinates are outside the valid grid boundaries,
    the method may return an invalid or default height value, potentially causing
    undefined behavior if not properly validated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Height Retrieval
    code: "float height = gridMap.getHeight(100.5f, 200.3f);\nif (height > INVALID_HEIGHT)\n\
      {\n    // Use the height value for positioning or calculations\n    printf(\"\
      Height at (100.5, 200.3) is %.2f\\n\", height);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Height for Character Positioning
    code: 'float playerX = 1234.56f;

      float playerY = 7890.12f;

      float groundHeight = gridMap.getHeight(playerX, playerY);

      // Set character''s Z position to match the terrain

      player->SetPosition(playerX, playerY, groundHeight, player->GetOrientation());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented using bilinear interpolation between
    known height points for smoother terrain representation. The grid map data should
    be pre-loaded and valid before calling this method. Performance considerations
    include the fact that repeated calls to getHeight may involve coordinate conversion
    and lookup operations, so it's advisable to cache results when possible.
  warnings: The method assumes that the input coordinates are within valid grid boundaries.
    Calling this method with invalid coordinates (outside the loaded map area) can
    result in undefined behavior or incorrect height values. Always validate coordinates
    before calling getHeight if there's any uncertainty about their validity.
