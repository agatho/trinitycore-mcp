    const
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and returns the impact of various hyperparameters on learning model
    performance.
  description: The AnalyzeHyperparameterImpact method evaluates how different hyperparameters
    affect the performance of machine learning models within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method processes training data and computes statistical measures to determine
    which hyperparameters have the most significant influence on model accuracy, convergence
    speed, or other relevant metrics. The results are returned as a mapping of hyperparameter
    names to their respective impact scores, allowing developers to optimize model
    configurations for better performance. This functionality is particularly useful
    in AI-driven game systems where learning algorithms need to be fine-tuned for
    optimal behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::unordered_map containing string keys representing hyperparameter
    names and float values representing their calculated impact scores. Higher scores
    indicate greater influence on model performance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "LearningAnalytics analytics;\nstd::unordered_map<std::string, float> impact\
      \ = analytics.AnalyzeHyperparameterImpact();\nfor (const auto& pair : impact)\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"Parameter: \" << pair.first << \", Impact: \" << pair.second\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may require substantial computational resources depending on
    the complexity of the learning models being analyzed. It should be called asynchronously
    to avoid blocking the main game thread. The impact scores are normalized values
    between 0 and 1, where 1 represents maximum influence.
  warnings: Calling this method repeatedly without proper caching mechanisms may lead
    to performance degradation. Ensure that training data is properly prepared before
    invoking this method, as malformed data can produce unreliable results.
