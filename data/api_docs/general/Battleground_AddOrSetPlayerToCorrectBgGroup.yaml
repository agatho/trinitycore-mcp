  signature: void Battleground::AddOrSetPlayerToCorrectBgGroup(Player * player, int
    team)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns a player to the correct battleground group based on their team.
  description: The AddOrSetPlayerToCorrectBgGroup method is responsible for ensuring
    that a player is correctly assigned to their respective team's group within a
    battleground. This method handles the logic of placing players into the appropriate
    bggroup (typically based on their alliance or horde team) and manages the internal
    data structures that track player assignments. It ensures that players are properly
    grouped for gameplay mechanics such as scoring, rewards, and team-based objectives.
    The method is typically invoked during battleground initialization or when a player
    joins a battleground to ensure proper team distribution.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object that needs to be assigned to a battleground
      group. Must not be null.
  - name: team
    description: Integer value representing the player's team (0 for Alliance, 1 for
      Horde). Used to determine which bggroup the player should be placed in.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Player Assignment
    code: 'Battleground* bg = sObjectMgr->GetBattleground(123);

      Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      bg->AddOrSetPlayerToCorrectBgGroup(player, TEAM_ALLIANCE);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Assigning Player to Horde Group
    code: 'Battleground* bg = sObjectMgr->GetBattleground(456);

      Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      bg->AddOrSetPlayerToCorrectBgGroup(player, TEAM_HORDE);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal battleground management system and should
    only be called during appropriate battleground states. It modifies internal player
    group assignments and may affect gameplay balance if used incorrectly.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Incorrect team values may result in improper group assignment or undefined
    behavior.
