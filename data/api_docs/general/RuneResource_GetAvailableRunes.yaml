documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of available runes of the specified type for the player
  description: The GetAvailableRunes method retrieves the count of usable runes of
    a specific type (such as Blood, Frost, or Unholy) that are currently available
    to the player. This method is typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's
    Death Knight class, where runes are consumed when using abilities and must be
    regenerated over time. The returned value represents how many runes of the given
    type can be immediately used without waiting for regeneration.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of available runes of the specified
    type. Returns 0 if no runes of that type are currently available or if the rune
    type is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Check Available Blood Runes
    code: "uint32 bloodRunes = player->GetRuneResource()->GetAvailableRunes(RUNE_BLOOD);\n\
      if (bloodRunes > 0)\n{\n    // Player can use a Blood rune ability\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine Rune Availability for Ability Usage
    code: "RuneResource* runeResource = player->GetRuneResource();\nuint32 frostRunes\
      \ = runeResource->GetAvailableRunes(RUNE_FROST);\nuint32 unholyRunes = runeResource->GetAvailableRunes(RUNE_UNHOLY);\n\
      \nif (frostRunes > 0 && unholyRunes > 0)\n{\n    // Player can use a Frost-Unholy\
      \ ability\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not account for runes that are currently on cooldown or
    being regenerated. It only returns the count of fully available runes. The rune
    system in TrinityCore is designed to match Blizzard's implementation, where each
    rune type has its own cooldown and regeneration timer.
  warnings: Be aware that calling this method on a non-Death Knight player character
    will return meaningless values as other classes do not utilize the rune system.
    Also, this method should be used carefully in performance-critical code paths
    since it may involve internal state checks.
