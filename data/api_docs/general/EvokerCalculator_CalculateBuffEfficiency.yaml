  class: EvokerCalculator
  method: CalculateBuffEfficiency
  signature: int EvokerCalculator::CalculateBuffEfficiency(int spellId, int * caster,
    int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the efficiency of a buff based on spell ID and caster/target data
  description: The CalculateBuffEfficiency method determines how effectively a buff
    spell is applied or maintained in the game world. It evaluates the spell's performance
    by analyzing the provided caster and target information, returning an efficiency
    score that can be used for various game mechanics such as talent calculations,
    stat tracking, or performance optimization. The method takes into account factors
    like spell power, target resistance, and other relevant combat metrics to compute
    this value.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell being evaluated for buff efficiency
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the caster's data or stat values
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's data or stat values
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated buff efficiency. Higher
    values typically indicate better performance or effectiveness of the spell application.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'int spellId = 12345;

      int casterData = 100;

      int targetData = 80;

      int* casterPtr = &casterData;

      int* targetPtr = &targetData;

      int efficiency = calculator.CalculateBuffEfficiency(spellId, casterPtr, targetPtr);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal calculations involving spell modifiers,
    stat multipliers, and game balance factors. It may be used in conjunction with
    other utility methods for comprehensive spell analysis.
  warnings: Ensure that the caster and target pointers are valid and initialized before
    calling this method to prevent undefined behavior or crashes.
