  signature: BGRole BattlegroundAI::GetPlayerRole(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the role assigned to a player within the battleground context.
  description: The GetPlayerRole method is used to determine the specific role that
    a player has been assigned during a battleground match. This role typically defines
    the player's responsibilities and capabilities within the context of the battleground,
    such as being a healer, tank, or damage dealer. The method takes a pointer to
    an integer representing the player's identifier and returns a BGRole enum value
    indicating their assigned role. It is commonly used in battleground AI logic to
    tailor behavior and strategy based on player roles.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to an integer that represents the unique identifier (GUID)
      of the player whose role is being retrieved.
  returns: Returns a BGRole enum value indicating the assigned role of the specified
    player. Possible values may include roles like BG_ROLE_NONE, BG_ROLE_TANK, BG_ROLE_HEALER,
    or BG_ROLE_DAMAGE, depending on the battleground implementation and player assignment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "BGRole role = bgAI->GetPlayerRole(&playerGUID);\nif (role == BG_ROLE_TANK)\n\
      {\n    // Handle tank-specific logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Role-Based Strategy Implementation
    code: "void ApplyStrategy(BattlegroundAI* bgAI, int* playerGUID)\n{\n    BGRole\
      \ role = bgAI->GetPlayerRole(playerGUID);\n    switch (role)\n    {\n      \
      \  case BG_ROLE_TANK:\n            // Implement tank-specific behavior\n   \
      \         break;\n        case BG_ROLE_HEALER:\n            // Implement healer-specific\
      \ behavior\n            break;\n        default:\n            // Default behavior\
      \ for other roles\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the battleground AI framework to make
    decisions based on player roles. It assumes that the player GUID passed in is
    valid and corresponds to an active player in the battleground. The actual role
    assignment logic is usually handled by the battleground system itself during matchmaking
    or initialization.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID provided is valid and refers to a player currently
    participating in the battleground, as invalid pointers or non-participating players
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect role assignments.
