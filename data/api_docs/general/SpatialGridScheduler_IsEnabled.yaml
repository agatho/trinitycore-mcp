  class: SpatialGridScheduler
  method: IsEnabled
  signature: bool SpatialGridScheduler::IsEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the spatial grid scheduler is currently enabled.
  description: The IsEnabled method returns a boolean value indicating if the SpatialGridScheduler
    is active and processing scheduled events. This functionality is crucial for managing
    object updates and AI behaviors within specific grid cells in the game world.
    The scheduler may be disabled during certain operations such as map loading or
    when performance optimization is required. When disabled, scheduled tasks will
    not execute until the scheduler is re-enabled.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the spatial grid scheduler is currently enabled and processing
    events; false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if scheduler is enabled before scheduling a task
    code: "if (spatialGridScheduler.IsEnabled())\n{\n    spatialGridScheduler.AddEvent(1000,\
      \ []() {\n        // Scheduled task logic\n    });\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional execution based on scheduler state
    code: "void UpdateSchedulerState(bool enable)\n{\n    if (enable && !spatialGridScheduler.IsEnabled())\n\
      \    {\n        spatialGridScheduler.Enable();\n    }\n    else if (!enable\
      \ && spatialGridScheduler.IsEnabled())\n    {\n        spatialGridScheduler.Disable();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with Enable() and Disable()
    methods to control the lifecycle of scheduled events. The implementation likely
    uses a simple boolean flag for state tracking, making it very fast to check. This
    method should be thread-safe as it's commonly called from different threads during
    world updates.
  warnings: Be cautious when disabling the scheduler for extended periods as it may
    cause objects to miss important scheduled updates or AI behaviors. Ensure that
    any critical time-sensitive operations are properly handled before disabling the
    scheduler.
