  class: RiptideTracker
  method: ApplyRiptide
  signature: void RiptideTracker::ApplyRiptide(int guid, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a Riptide effect to the specified unit with the given duration.
  description: The ApplyRiptide method is used to apply the Riptide spell effect to
    a target unit identified by its GUID. This method typically manages the application
    of the healing-over-time effect associated with the Riptide spell in World of
    Warcraft's gameplay mechanics, particularly for shaman class abilities. The duration
    parameter controls how long the Riptide effect will persist on the target. This
    method is generally invoked during spell casting or aura application logic within
    the TrinityCore server implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the unit to apply the Riptide effect
      to. This should be a valid object GUID from the game world.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the Riptide effect will remain
      active on the target. Must be a positive integer value representing time.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'RiptideTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyRiptide(12345, 15000); // Applies Riptide to unit with GUID 12345
      for 15 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Spell Casting Context
    code: "void ShamanSpellHandler::CastRiptide(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (target)\n\
      \    {\n        RiptideTracker tracker;\n        tracker.ApplyRiptide(target->GetGUID().GetRawValue(),\
      \ 15000);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal aura tracking systems and may
    require proper initialization of the RiptideTracker object before use. The duration
    value should be validated to ensure it falls within acceptable ranges for gameplay
    balance.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed is valid and refers to an existing unit in
    the game world, otherwise behavior may be undefined or cause server errors. Avoid
    calling this method with zero or negative duration values as they could lead to
    unexpected aura behavior.
