  class: WorldSession

  signature: void WorldSession::HandleRandomizeCharNameOpcode(WorldPackets::Character::GenerateRandomCharacterName
    & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a client request to generate a random character name for use in
    character creation.
  description: The HandleRandomizeCharNameOpcode method handles the opcode sent by
    the client when a player requests a randomly generated character name during the
    character creation process. This method is part of the WorldSession class and
    is responsible for generating a valid, unique name based on the selected faction
    and character race. The generated name adheres to game naming rules and constraints
    such as length limits and character set restrictions. It typically responds by
    sending back a packet containing the new random name to the client for display
    in the character creation interface.
  parameters:
  - name: packet
    description: The incoming packet containing the request to generate a random character
      name. This packet includes information about the character's faction and race
      which are used to determine the appropriate naming convention.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Character Creation Flow
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleRandomizeCharNameOpcode(WorldPackets::Character::GenerateRandomCharacterName&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Generate a random name based on faction and race\n    std::string\
      \ randomName = sObjectMgr->GenerateRandomCharacterName(packet.faction, packet.race);\n\
      \    \n    // Send the generated name back to client\n    WorldPackets::Character::RandomizeCharNameResult\
      \ result;\n    result.Name = randomName;\n    SendPacket(result.Write());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during character creation when players click
    the 'Random Name' button. The implementation relies on internal name generation
    tables and logic that ensures names are valid within the game's naming conventions.
    It should be called only in contexts where a new character name is being generated
    for display purposes.
  warnings: Ensure that the generated names comply with all game naming policies to
    prevent invalid or inappropriate names from appearing in the character creation
    UI. This method must not be used outside of the character creation flow as it
    may cause unexpected behavior in other parts of the game.
