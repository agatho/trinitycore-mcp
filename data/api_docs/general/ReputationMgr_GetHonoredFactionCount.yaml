documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of factions that have reached Honored reputation level
    for the player
  description: The GetHonoredFactionCount method retrieves the total number of factions
    in a player's reputation list that have achieved at least Honored standing. This
    count is used internally by the game engine to determine various reputation-based
    benefits, such as access to certain vendor items or quest rewards. The method
    iterates through all known factions for the player and increments a counter each
    time a faction reaches Honored or higher status. This value is typically used
    in conjunction with other reputation-related methods to provide a complete picture
    of a player's standing with different organizations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the number of factions that have reached Honored
    reputation level or higher for the player
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint8 honoredCount = player->GetReputationMgr().GetHonoredFactionCount();\n\
      if (honoredCount > 0)\n{\n    // Player has at least one honored faction\n \
      \   ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"You have %u honored\
      \ factions.\", honoredCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Reputation-Based Reward Check
    code: "ReputationMgr& repMgr = player->GetReputationMgr();\nuint8 honoredFactions\
      \ = repMgr.GetHonoredFactionCount();\nif (honoredFactions >= 5)\n{\n    // Award\
      \ special reward for having multiple honored factions\n    player->AddItem(ITEM_ID_SPECIAL_REWARD,\
      \ 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear scan through all reputation entries for the
    player. In performance-critical contexts, caching this value may be beneficial.
    The method does not account for temporary reputation changes or faction resets
    that might occur during gameplay.
  warnings: The returned count includes all factions at Honored or higher standing,
    including Exalted and Revered. Be aware that faction standings can change dynamically
    through player actions, so the value should be re-evaluated when needed rather
    than cached indefinitely.
