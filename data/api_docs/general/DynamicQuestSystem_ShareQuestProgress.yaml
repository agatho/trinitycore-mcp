  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: ShareQuestProgress
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::ShareQuestProgress(Group * group, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Shares quest progress with all members of a group.
  description: The ShareQuestProgress method synchronizes the current quest progress
    for a specified quest ID among all players within a given group. This functionality
    is essential for maintaining consistent quest state across multiple players in
    cooperative gameplay scenarios, such as raids or dungeons. The method ensures
    that all group members have their quest tracking updated to reflect the same progress,
    preventing discrepancies in quest completion status. It typically operates by
    sending update packets to each group member's client, ensuring real-time synchronization
    of quest data.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players whose quest progress
      will be synchronized. Must not be null and must contain at least one valid player.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest for which progress is being shared.
      Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ShareQuestProgress
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (playerGroup && playerGroup->GetMembersCount()\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    sDynamicQuestSystem->ShareQuestProgress(playerGroup, 12345);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Sharing quest progress with error handling
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    uint32 questId =\
      \ player->GetQuestStatus(12345);\n    if (questId != 0 && player->GetQuestStatus(questId)\
      \ == QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE)\n    {\n        sDynamicQuestSystem->ShareQuestProgress(group,\
      \ questId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group is already valid and contains players.
    It does not perform any validation on whether players are in the same zone or
    instance. The synchronization happens immediately without delay, making it suitable
    for real-time quest progression updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid
    crashes. Also, be cautious when sharing progress for quests that might have different
    completion conditions per player, as this could lead to unexpected behavior in
    shared quest scenarios.
