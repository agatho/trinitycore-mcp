  class: RuneManager
  method: GetRuneCooldown
  signature: uint32 RuneManager::GetRuneCooldown(uint8 runeIndex) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the cooldown time remaining for a specified rune.
  description: The GetRuneCooldown method returns the current cooldown duration in
    milliseconds for a specific rune index. This method is typically used in the context
    of World of Warcraft's Death Knight class abilities, where runes have individual
    cooldown periods after being activated. The returned value represents how much
    time (in milliseconds) must pass before the rune becomes available again for use.
    The method does not modify any internal state and is safe to call multiple times.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the remaining cooldown time in milliseconds
    for the specified rune. Returns 0 if the rune is currently available (not on cooldown).
  examples:
  - title: Check rune cooldown before using ability
    code: "uint8 runeIndex = 0;\nuint32 cooldown = runeManager->GetRuneCooldown(runeIndex);\n\
      if (cooldown == 0)\n{\n    // Rune is available, can be used\n    UseRuneAbility(runeIndex);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Rune is on cooldown, wait for it to become available\n  \
      \  SendSystemMessage(\"Rune is still on cooldown.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the rune index is valid (0-5 for standard Death
    Knights). The implementation likely accesses internal rune state tracking data
    structures. It's recommended to check if the rune is available before attempting
    to use it, as using a rune on cooldown may result in game behavior or error conditions.
  warnings: Ensure that the runeIndex parameter is within valid range (typically 0-5)
    to avoid undefined behavior or memory access violations. Calling this method with
    an invalid index could lead to incorrect results or crashes.
