  class: InteractionValidator
  method: ShouldLearnSpell
  signature: bool InteractionValidator::ShouldLearnSpell(::Player * bot, const ::SpellInfo
    * spellInfo) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot player should learn a specified spell based on validation
    rules.
  description: The ShouldLearnSpell method evaluates if a given bot player is eligible
    to learn a specific spell. This validation typically considers factors such as
    the player's level, class restrictions, spell prerequisites, and other game mechanics
    that govern spell acquisition. The method acts as a gatekeeper for spell learning
    logic within the AI system, ensuring that only appropriate spells are taught to
    bots. It is commonly used in automated quest completion or skill advancement systems
    where the bot must determine what spells it can realistically learn.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is being evaluated
      for spell learning.
  - name: spellInfo
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure containing metadata about the
      spell being considered for learning.
  returns: Returns true if the bot meets all criteria to learn the specified spell;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (validator.ShouldLearnSpell(bot, spellInfo)) {\n    bot->LearnSpell(spellInfo->Id);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with spell learning logic
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateSpells() {\n    for (auto& spell : availableSpells) {\n\
      \        if (validator.ShouldLearnSpell(player, spell)) {\n            player->LearnSpell(spell->Id);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against the bot's current level, class
    specialization, and any prerequisite spells or skills required to learn the target
    spell. It may also consider faction-specific restrictions or quest-based access
    requirements.
  warnings: Ensure that both the bot and spellInfo parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. This method should
    not be used directly for spell casting without verifying that the spell is actually
    learned by the player.
