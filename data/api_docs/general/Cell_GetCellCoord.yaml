  method: GetCellCoord
  signature: int Cell::GetCellCoord() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the cell coordinate identifier for this Cell object.
  description: The GetCellCoord method retrieves the unique integer identifier that
    represents the cell's position within the game world grid. In TrinityCore, cells
    are used to organize and manage world objects efficiently by dividing the game
    world into a grid system. This method provides access to the cell's coordinate
    value which is typically used for spatial queries, object tracking, and maintaining
    world state. The returned value corresponds to the cell's index in the grid system,
    allowing for quick lookup and management of objects within specific areas of the
    world.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the cell's coordinate identifier within the game
    world grid. This value uniquely identifies the cell's position in the grid system
    and is used internally by the core for spatial indexing and object management.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Cell* cell = new Cell(x, y);

      int coord = cell->GetCellCoord();

      // coord now contains the cell''s grid coordinate'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Object Management
    code: "void UpdateCellObjects(Cell* cell) {\n    int cellCoord = cell->GetCellCoord();\n\
      \    // Use cellCoord to query objects in this specific cell\n    // Perform\
      \ spatial operations using the coordinate\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that returns cached or computed cell coordinates.
    The implementation likely uses internal grid calculations based on world coordinates
    and cell dimensions. Performance is optimal as it's a direct value retrieval without
    complex computations.
