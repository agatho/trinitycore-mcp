  class: InterruptOptimizer
  method: RecordInterruptAttempt
  signature: void InterruptOptimizer::RecordInterruptAttempt(uint32 spellId, bool
    success, float reactionTime)
documentation:
  brief: Records an interrupt attempt with associated spell ID, success status, and
    reaction time for performance analysis.
  description: The RecordInterruptAttempt method logs data about a spell interruption
    event within the TrinityCore framework. It captures the identifier of the spell
    that was interrupted, whether the interruption was successful, and the reaction
    time in seconds from when the interrupt occurred. This data is typically used
    for analyzing player behavior, optimizing AI decision-making, or debugging combat
    mechanics. The method does not return any value but updates internal tracking
    structures for performance monitoring or statistical analysis purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell being interrupted. This should
      correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's database.
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the interrupt attempt was successful
      (true) or failed (false).
  - name: reactionTime
    description: The time in seconds taken to react and perform the interrupt. Should
      be a non-negative floating-point value representing real-time elapsed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'InterruptOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.RecordInterruptAttempt(12345, true, 0.3f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "if (player->HasSpellCooldown(spellId)) {\n    optimizer.RecordInterruptAttempt(spellId,\
      \ false, reactionTime);\n} else {\n    optimizer.RecordInterruptAttempt(spellId,\
      \ true, reactionTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other performance tracking
    or combat analysis systems. It may store data in memory buffers or log files depending
    on the system configuration. The reaction time parameter is crucial for AI behavior
    tuning and player skill assessment.
  warnings: Ensure that spellId corresponds to a valid spell entry; invalid IDs could
    cause undefined behavior or data corruption. Also, be cautious about high-frequency
    calls as this may impact performance if not properly buffered or batched.
