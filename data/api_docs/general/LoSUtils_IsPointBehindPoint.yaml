  class: LoSUtils
  method: IsPointBehindPoint
  signature: bool LoSUtils::IsPointBehindPoint(const int & observer, const int & target,
    const int & reference)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a target point is behind an observer point relative to
    a reference point, using line-of-sight calculations.
  description: The IsPointBehindPoint method evaluates the spatial relationship between
    three points in 3D space to determine if the target point lies behind the observer
    point with respect to a given reference point. This functionality is commonly
    used in game mechanics such as determining if an object is obscured by another,
    calculating visibility for AI behavior, or assessing whether a spell's target
    is blocked by terrain or other entities. The method performs geometric calculations
    based on vector mathematics and assumes all points are defined within the same
    coordinate system. It does not account for height differences beyond basic positional
    comparisons unless explicitly handled by the calling code.
  parameters:
  - name: observer
    description: The identifier or index of the observer point in the system, typically
      representing a unit or object that is making the observation.
  - name: target
    description: The identifier or index of the target point being evaluated for its
      position relative to the observer and reference points.
  - name: reference
    description: The identifier or index of the reference point used as a baseline
      for determining positional relationships between the observer and target.
  returns: Returns true if the target point is considered to be behind the observer
    point relative to the reference point, otherwise returns false. This implies that
    when viewed from the observer's perspective along the line defined by the reference
    point, the target lies beyond the observer.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check visibility
    code: "bool isBehind = LoSUtils::IsPointBehindPoint(1001, 1002, 1003);\nif (isBehind)\
      \ {\n    // Target point 1002 is behind observer 1001 relative to reference\
      \ 1003\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with AI decision making
    code: "if (!LoSUtils::IsPointBehindPoint(playerGUID, enemyGUID, targetPosition))\
      \ {\n    // Enemy is visible and not obstructed by terrain or objects\n    DoAttack();\n\
      } else {\n    // Enemy is behind something; may need to find alternative path\n\
      \    FindAlternativeRoute();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates under the assumption that all parameters represent valid
    identifiers within a known coordinate system. It does not perform any validation
    or error checking on input values, so callers must ensure that observer, target,
    and reference are meaningful indices or positions. Performance is generally efficient
    for single evaluations but should be used judiciously in high-frequency contexts
    like AI loops.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter ordering can lead to misleading results. Ensure that
    the observer, target, and reference parameters align with expected spatial relationships.
    Since this function relies on positional data, it may not behave as expected if
    coordinates are inconsistent or updated asynchronously during gameplay.
