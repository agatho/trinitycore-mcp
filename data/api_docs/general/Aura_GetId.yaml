  class: Aura
  method: GetId
  signature: uint32 Aura::GetId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the aura instance.
  description: The GetId method retrieves the unique 32-bit identifier associated
    with an Aura object. In TrinityCore's implementation, this ID typically corresponds
    to the aura's entry in the database or its internal tracking mechanism. This identifier
    is used to distinguish one aura from another and is essential for managing aura
    states, applying effects, and handling aura-related events within the game engine.
    The method is read-only and does not modify any internal state of the Aura object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the unique identifier of the aura
    instance. This ID is typically used to reference the specific aura in various
    game systems such as spell effects, debuffs, buffs, and status tracking.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Aura ID
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    uint32 auraId =\
      \ aura->GetId();\n    // Use auraId for further processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Aura ID in Conditional Logic
    code: "Unit* target = ...;\nAura* aura = target->GetAura(98765);\nif (aura &&\
      \ aura->GetId() == 98765)\n{\n    // Perform specific action based on aura ID\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned ID may not be the same as the spell ID that created the aura.
    It's an internal identifier managed by the TrinityCore core for tracking purposes.
    The method is safe to call from any thread context, assuming proper locking mechanisms
    are in place for the Aura object itself.
  warnings: Ensure that the Aura pointer is valid before calling GetId() to avoid
    undefined behavior. Calling this method on a null pointer will result in a crash
    or unexpected behavior.
