  method: SpellInterrupted
  signature: void UnitAI::SpellInterrupted(uint32 param0, uint32 param1)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the interruption of a spell cast by the AI-controlled unit
  description: The SpellInterrupted method is invoked when a spell cast by an AI-controlled
    unit is interrupted, typically due to external factors such as being attacked,
    receiving damage, or other interruptible events. This method allows the AI to
    respond appropriately to spell interruptions, potentially resetting the spell
    state or initiating alternative behaviors. It is part of the core AI system that
    manages spell casting and interruption logic for NPC units within TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: First parameter, likely representing the spell ID or spell handle
      that was interrupted
  - name: param1
    description: Second parameter, possibly indicating the reason for interruption
      or interrupting source
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Interruption Handling
    code: "void MyAI::SpellInterrupted(uint32 spellId, uint32 interruptReason)\n{\n\
      \    // Log the interruption\n    sLog->outString(\"Spell %u interrupted by\
      \ reason %u\", spellId, interruptReason);\n    \n    // Reset spell casting\
      \ state\n    m_spellCastState = SPELL_CAST_STATE_NONE;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core AI system when a spell
    interruption event occurs. Developers should ensure that any custom logic implemented
    in this method does not cause performance bottlenecks, as it may be invoked frequently
    during combat scenarios.
  warnings: Improper handling of spell interruptions can lead to inconsistent AI behavior
    or spell state corruption. Ensure all spell-related state is properly reset when
    this method is called.
