  class: LootCoordination
  method: GetLootSession
  signature: LootSession LootCoordination::GetLootSession(uint32 sessionId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the loot session associated with the specified session ID.
  description: The GetLootSession method is used to fetch a LootSession object from
    the LootCoordination system by its unique session identifier. This method allows
    access to ongoing loot distribution processes within the game, enabling developers
    to query or manipulate active loot sessions. The returned LootSession object contains
    information about the current state of loot distribution, including items being
    distributed, participants, and their respective loot priorities. This functionality
    is essential for managing loot coordination in group scenarios such as raids or
    dungeons where multiple players are involved in loot distribution.
  parameters: []
  returns: A LootSession object representing the loot session associated with the
    given session ID. If no session exists with the specified ID, the method may return
    an invalid or empty LootSession object, depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Process Loot Session
    code: "LootSession session = lootCoordination.GetLootSession(12345);\nif (session.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Process the loot session\n    session.ProcessLoot();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates within a thread-safe context, as loot coordination
    typically involves multiple threads handling different aspects of loot distribution.
    The session ID should be validated before calling this method to avoid potential
    errors or undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid session ID may result in an empty
    or invalid LootSession object. Always validate the returned session before attempting
    to use it for further operations.
