  signature: void PathfindingAdapter::ConvertPath(const int & generator, MovementPath
    & path)
documentation:
  brief: Converts a path generated by the pathfinding system into a movement path
    for use in World of Warcraft.
  description: The ConvertPath method takes a path generated by the internal pathfinding
    generator and converts it into a MovementPath structure that can be used by the
    game engine to control NPC or player movement. This method is typically called
    after a path has been computed by the pathfinding system, and it ensures that
    the path data is properly formatted for execution within the TrinityCore framework.
    The conversion process may involve transforming coordinates, applying movement
    constraints, and preparing the path for subsequent navigation operations. This
    method does not perform any validation on the input generator ID or path data;
    it assumes valid inputs are provided.
  parameters:
  - name: generator
    description: An integer identifier representing the pathfinding generator that
      produced the path. This value is used to determine which specific pathfinding
      algorithm or configuration was used to generate the path.
  - name: path
    description: A reference to a MovementPath object where the converted path data
      will be stored. The method modifies this object in-place to contain the properly
      formatted movement path.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Conversion
    code: 'int generatorId = 1;

      MovementPath movementPath;

      pathfindingAdapter.ConvertPath(generatorId, movementPath);

      // movementPath now contains the converted path data'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Converted Path for NPC Movement
    code: "class MyNPC : public Creature\n{\npublic:\n    void MoveAlongPath()\n \
      \   {\n        int generatorId = GetPathfinderGenerator();\n        MovementPath\
      \ path;\n        pathfindingAdapter.ConvertPath(generatorId, path);\n      \
      \  // Use the converted path to move the NPC\n        SetMovementPath(path);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal pathfinding infrastructure in TrinityCore.
    It assumes that the provided generator ID corresponds to a valid pathfinding context
    and that the MovementPath object has been properly initialized. The conversion
    process may involve coordinate transformations depending on the pathfinding system's
    configuration.
  warnings: Ensure that the generator parameter refers to an active and valid pathfinding
    generator, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. This method modifies the provided
    MovementPath object in-place, so make sure any existing data is not needed after
    calling this function.
