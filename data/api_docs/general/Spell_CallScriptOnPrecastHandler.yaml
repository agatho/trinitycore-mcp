  signature: void Spell::CallScriptOnPrecastHandler()
documentation:
  brief: Invokes the script handler for precast events in spell casting.
  description: The CallScriptOnPrecastHandler method is responsible for executing
    any registered script handlers that are associated with the precast phase of a
    spell. This method is typically called during the initial stages of spell execution,
    before the spell's main effects are applied. It allows custom scripts to modify
    or cancel the spell cast based on specific conditions. The method ensures that
    all relevant precast logic defined in scripts is executed prior to the spell proceeding
    to its next stage.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Script
    code: "void MySpellScript::OnPrecast()\n{\n    // Custom logic before spell is\
      \ cast\n    if (IsPlayerCasting())\n        return;\n    // Execute precast\
      \ handler\n    spell->CallScriptOnPrecastHandler();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during the spell's initialization phase.
    It is typically invoked internally by the core spell system and should not be
    manually triggered outside of that context unless explicitly required by custom
    scripts.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to unexpected behavior or crashes
    if the spell object is not properly initialized. Ensure all script handlers are
    registered before calling this method.
