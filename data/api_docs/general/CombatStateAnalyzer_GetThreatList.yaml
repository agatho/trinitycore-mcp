  class: CombatStateAnalyzer
  method: GetThreatList
  signature: int CombatStateAnalyzer::GetThreatList() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current threat list size for the combat state analyzer.
  description: The GetThreatList method returns an integer representing the number
    of entries in the current threat list managed by the CombatStateAnalyzer instance.
    This value indicates how many units or players are currently on the creature's
    threat table, which is essential for determining aggro behavior and targeting
    decisions in World of Warcraft's combat system. The method provides a quick way
    to assess the combat state's complexity without needing to access individual threat
    entries directly.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the count of entries in the current threat
    list. A return value of zero indicates no units are on the threat table, while
    positive values indicate the number of entities with threat assigned to the creature.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat List Size Check
    code: "CombatStateAnalyzer analyzer;\nint threatCount = analyzer.GetThreatList();\n\
      if (threatCount > 0) {\n    // Creature has active threats\n    printf(\"Creature\
      \ has %d threats in the list\\n\", threatCount);\n} else {\n    // No threats\
      \ present\n    printf(\"Creature is not under threat\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a lightweight way to check the size of the threat list
    without iterating through all entries. It's commonly used in AI decision-making
    logic where knowing the number of aggro targets is sufficient for determining
    combat behavior.
