documentation:
  brief: Processes and evaluates performance metrics for bot behavior in the game
    environment
  description: The ProcessMetrics method collects and analyzes various performance
    indicators related to bot operations within the TrinityCore framework. This includes
    monitoring CPU usage, memory consumption, response times, and other relevant metrics
    that affect bot efficiency and overall server performance. The method is typically
    invoked during regular update cycles or when specific performance thresholds are
    reached. It aggregates data from multiple sources including AI decision-making
    processes, movement calculations, and interaction with game objects to provide
    comprehensive insights into bot behavior patterns.

  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\n    sBotPerformanceMonitor->ProcessMetrics();\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently during the game loop and
    should not block execution for extended periods. It uses internal counters and
    timers to track performance without introducing significant overhead. The implementation
    may vary based on configuration settings related to performance monitoring.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper throttling can introduce
    unnecessary overhead. Ensure that performance monitoring is enabled via appropriate
    server configuration flags before relying on its data collection capabilities.
