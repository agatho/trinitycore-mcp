  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: GenerateBacktrack
  signature: AvoidanceManeuver ObstacleAvoidanceManager::GenerateBacktrack(const CollisionPrediction
    & collision)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a backtrack avoidance maneuver to escape from a predicted collision.
  description: The GenerateBacktrack method computes and returns an AvoidanceManeuver
    that instructs the AI-controlled unit to backtrack or reverse direction in order
    to avoid an impending collision. This method is typically invoked during obstacle
    avoidance logic when a CollisionPrediction has been identified. The resulting
    maneuver includes directional and timing information to ensure safe navigation
    around obstacles. It is part of the ObstacleAvoidanceManager's core functionality
    for dynamic path adjustment.
  parameters: []
  returns: An AvoidanceManeuver object containing the backtrack instructions, including
    movement direction and duration required to safely avoid the predicted collision.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "void AIUnit::Update()\n{\n    if (auto collision = m_obstacleManager->PredictCollision())\n\
      \    {\n        AvoidanceManeuver maneuver = m_obstacleManager->GenerateBacktrack(*collision);\n\
      \        ApplyAvoidanceManeuver(maneuver);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that a valid collision prediction has already been computed
    and passed to it. The generated maneuver may be adjusted based on unit movement
    speed, turning radius, and other dynamic factors at runtime.
  warnings: Calling this method without prior collision detection may result in undefined
    behavior or invalid maneuvers. Ensure the CollisionPrediction parameter is valid
    before invoking this function.
