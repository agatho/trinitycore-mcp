  class: PreciseShotsTracker
  method: HasCharges
  signature: bool PreciseShotsTracker::HasCharges() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the Precise Shots tracker has any remaining charges available.
  description: The HasCharges method determines whether the Precise Shots ability
    currently possesses usable charges. This functionality is typically used in conjunction
    with the Hunter's Precise Shots talent, which allows hunters to fire multiple
    shots with a single ability activation. The method evaluates the internal charge
    state of the tracker and returns true if at least one charge remains, false otherwise.
    This check is essential for determining whether the hunter can proceed with using
    the ability or if it needs to be recharged.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Precise Shots tracker has one or more charges available;
    returns false if no charges remain.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (hunter->GetPreciseShotsTracker()->HasCharges()) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ firing a shot\n    hunter->CastSpell(target, SPELL_PRECISE_SHOTS, true);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle no charges case\n    SendSystemMessage(\"No charges\
      \ remaining.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before attempting to consume a charge from
    the Precise Shots tracker. It's important to note that this check should be performed
    in a thread-safe context, especially when dealing with player actions and spell
    casting.
