documentation:
  brief: Removes the player from a specified chat channel.
  description: The LeaveChannel method removes the current player from the specified
    chat channel. It handles the necessary cleanup of channel membership and updates
    the player's social list accordingly. The method returns true if the player was
    successfully removed from the channel, or false if the player was not a member
    of the specified channel. This operation affects the player's ability to send
    and receive messages on that channel until they rejoin it.
  parameters:
  - name: channelName
    description: The name of the chat channel to leave. Must be a valid channel name
      that the player has joined previously.
  returns: True if the player was successfully removed from the specified channel,
    false if the player was not a member of the channel or if an error occurred during
    the operation.
  examples:
  - title: Leave a General Chat Channel
    code: "if (socialManager->LeaveChannel(\"General\")) {\n    // Player successfully\
      \ left the General channel\n    sLog->outString(\"Player left General channel\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Player was not in the General channel\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player was not in General channel\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Leave a Guild Chat Channel
    code: "std::string guildChannel = \"Guild\";\nif (socialManager->LeaveChannel(guildChannel))\
      \ {\n    sLog->outString(\"Player left guild channel\");\n} else {\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Failed to leave guild channel\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the player is currently in the specified channel. It
    does not validate whether the channel exists or if the player has permission to
    leave it. The implementation may involve updating internal data structures and
    sending notifications to other players in the channel.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent channel name may result
    in undefined behavior. Ensure that the player is actually a member of the channel
    before calling this method to avoid unnecessary operations.
