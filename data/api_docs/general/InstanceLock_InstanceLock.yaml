  brief: Moves an InstanceLock object, transferring its resources to a new instance.
  description: The InstanceLock::InstanceLock constructor is a move constructor that
    transfers ownership of resources from a temporary InstanceLock object to the newly
    constructed instance. This allows for efficient resource management when creating
    new InstanceLock objects from temporary or rvalue instances. The move constructor
    ensures that the source object's resources are properly transferred while leaving
    the source in a valid but unspecified state. In the context of TrinityCore's instance
    management system, this constructor is used to efficiently handle InstanceLock
    objects during object creation and assignment operations, particularly when dealing
    with temporary lock objects created during instance entry or exit scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to an InstanceLock object whose resources will
      be moved to this new instance. The source object will be left in a valid but
      unspecified state after the move operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing an InstanceLock
    code: 'InstanceLock lock1 = InstanceLock();

      InstanceLock lock2 = std::move(lock1); // Moves resources from lock1 to lock2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Move Constructor in Instance Management
    code: "class InstanceManager {\npublic:\n    InstanceLock CreateLock() {\n   \
      \     return InstanceLock(); // Return temporary object\n    }\n    \n    void\
      \ ProcessInstance() {\n        InstanceLock lock = CreateLock(); // Move constructor\
      \ used here\n        // Use lock...\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a copy constructor. It's designed to avoid
    expensive deep copies by transferring ownership of resources. The source object
    after a move operation should not be used in any way that would access its previous
    state. In TrinityCore's context, this move semantics are particularly important
    for performance when handling instance locks during player entry/exit operations.
  warnings: After calling this move constructor, the source InstanceLock object should
    not be used as its state becomes undefined. Attempting to use the moved-from object
    may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Always ensure that the source object
    is not accessed after a move operation.
