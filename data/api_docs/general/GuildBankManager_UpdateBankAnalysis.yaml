  signature: void GuildBankManager::UpdateBankAnalysis(uint32 guildId)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the bank analysis data for a specified guild.
  description: The UpdateBankAnalysis method recalculates and refreshes the bank analysis
    information for the specified guild. This typically involves processing the current
    state of the guild's bank inventory, including item counts, values, and other
    relevant metrics. The method is generally invoked when changes occur in the guild
    bank, such as items being deposited, withdrawn, or moved. It ensures that all
    cached or computed data related to the guild's bank status is synchronized with
    the actual state of the database.
  parameters:
  - name: guildId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild whose bank analysis needs to be
      updated. Must correspond to a valid guild in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update Bank Analysis for Guild
    code: GuildBankManager::UpdateBankAnalysis(12345);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system that maintains real-time or
    near-real-time statistics for guild banks. It may involve database queries and
    could be performance-sensitive depending on the number of items in the guild bank.
