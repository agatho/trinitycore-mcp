  class: FrostKillingMachineTracker
  method: GetStacks
  signature: uint32 FrostKillingMachineTracker::GetStacks() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current stack count of the Frost Killing Machine buff.
  description: The GetStacks method returns the number of active stacks of the Frost
    Killing Machine aura applied to the target. This method is typically used in game
    mechanics related to tracking buff durations and effects for player characters
    or creatures. The returned value indicates how many times the Frost Killing Machine
    effect has been applied, which may influence damage dealt or other gameplay attributes
    depending on the implementation. This method does not modify any internal state
    and is safe to call during combat or non-combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current number of stacks of the Frost Killing
    Machine buff. Returns 0 if no stacks are active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 stacks = target->GetAura(12345)->GetStacks();\nif (stacks > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Apply logic based on stack count\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Active Buff Stacks
    code: "FrostKillingMachineTracker* tracker = dynamic_cast<FrostKillingMachineTracker*>(target->GetAura(98765));\n\
      if (tracker)\n{\n    uint32 currentStacks = tracker->GetStacks();\n    if (currentStacks\
      \ >= 5)\n    {\n        // Trigger special effect when at least 5 stacks\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the object it's called on is a valid instance of
    FrostKillingMachineTracker. The implementation likely relies on internal tracking
    mechanisms within TrinityCore's aura system to maintain and retrieve stack counts
    accurately.
  warnings: Ensure that the target object actually has the Frost Killing Machine aura
    applied before calling this method, as accessing an invalid or non-existent aura
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
