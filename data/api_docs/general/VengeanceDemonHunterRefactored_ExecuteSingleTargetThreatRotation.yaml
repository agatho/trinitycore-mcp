  class: VengeanceDemonHunterRefactored
  method: ExecuteSingleTargetThreatRotation
  signature: void VengeanceDemonHunterRefactored::ExecuteSingleTargetThreatRotation(int
    * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the vengeance demon hunter's single-target threat rotation logic
    against a specified target.
  description: This method implements the core combat behavior for a vengeance demon
    hunter class in single-target scenarios. It evaluates the current threat situation,
    selects appropriate abilities based on resource levels and cooldowns, and applies
    damage or utility spells to maintain optimal threat generation against the designated
    target. The method integrates with the AI framework to ensure proper targeting,
    spell selection, and execution timing within the context of a vengeance demon
    hunter's gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or index
      in the combat system. Must be a valid target within the current threat environment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int targetId = 12345;

      player->GetAI()->ExecuteSingleTargetThreatRotation(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AI context has been properly initialized with
    valid target information and that all necessary resources (such as rage, fury,
    or soul shards) are accessible. The implementation may include internal state
    tracking for cooldowns and ability prioritization.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid combatant; passing
    an invalid or null target reference can lead to undefined behavior or crashes
    within the AI subsystem.
