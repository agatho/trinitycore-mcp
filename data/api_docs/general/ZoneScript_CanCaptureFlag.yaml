  class: ZoneScript
  method: CanCaptureFlag
  signature: bool ZoneScript::CanCaptureFlag(AreaTrigger * areaTrigger, Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can capture a flag in the specified area trigger.
  description: The CanCaptureFlag method evaluates if a given player is allowed to
    capture a flag within the context of an area trigger. This method is typically
    used in battlegrounds or arena scenarios where flag capture mechanics are implemented.
    It checks various conditions such as player state, team affiliation, and game
    rules to determine if the capture action should be permitted. The method serves
    as a validation step before allowing the actual flag capture logic to proceed.
  parameters:
  - name: areaTrigger
    description: Pointer to the AreaTrigger object that defines the capture zone.
      This represents the physical area where the flag capture is attempted.
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object attempting to capture the flag. This
      represents the player character performing the action.
  returns: Returns true if the player can successfully capture the flag based on all
    validation checks, false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates
    that the player does not meet the requirements for capturing the flag at this
    time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Flag Capture Validation
    code: "bool result = zoneScript->CanCaptureFlag(areaTrigger, player);\nif (result)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with flag capture logic\n    player->CaptureFlag();\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Handle invalid capture attempt\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      You cannot capture the flag now.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Battleground Logic
    code: "bool ZoneScript::CanCaptureFlag(AreaTrigger* areaTrigger, Player* player)\n\
      {\n    // Check if player is in correct team\n    if (player->GetTeam() != GetActiveTeam())\n\
      \        return false;\n    \n    // Check if player has required buff or state\n\
      \    if (!player->HasAura(FLAG_AURA_ID))\n        return false;\n    \n    //\
      \ Check if area trigger is active\n    if (!areaTrigger || !areaTrigger->IsActive())\n\
      \        return false;\n    \n    return true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly overridden in custom ZoneScript implementations to
    add specific game logic for flag capture mechanics. The method should be lightweight
    and not perform heavy operations since it may be called frequently during gameplay.
    Consider caching relevant player state information if the check involves multiple
    complex conditions.
  warnings: Ensure that all conditions checked in this method are consistent with
    the overall battleground or arena rules. Incorrect implementation could lead to
    exploits where players capture flags outside of valid scenarios. The method should
    not modify player state directly; it should only validate whether an action is
    allowed.
