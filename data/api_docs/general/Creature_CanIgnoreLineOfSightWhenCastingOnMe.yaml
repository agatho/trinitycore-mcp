  signature: bool Creature::CanIgnoreLineOfSightWhenCastingOnMe() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature can ignore line of sight when casting on
    itself.
  description: This method checks if a creature is capable of ignoring line of sight
    constraints during spell casting, which is particularly relevant for NPCs that
    may have special abilities or behaviors related to casting. It typically returns
    true for creatures with specific AI flags or configurations that allow them to
    bypass normal line-of-sight restrictions when performing spells. The behavior
    is often used in conjunction with other AI-related methods to determine casting
    behavior and can affect how spells are executed in relation to environmental obstacles.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature can ignore line of sight during spell casting,
    false otherwise. This indicates whether the creature's casting behavior allows
    it to bypass normal line-of-sight restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->CanIgnoreLineOfSightWhenCastingOnMe()) {\n    // Creature\
      \ can cast without considering line of sight\n    // Perform spell casting behavior\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with AI scripting systems and
    may be related to specific creature AI flags or behaviors. It's important to note
    that this behavior may not apply to all creatures, and the implementation could
    vary depending on how the creature's AI is configured.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it can affect spell execution
    and potentially lead to unexpected behavior if not properly understood. It's recommended
    to check the creature's AI configuration before relying on this method.
