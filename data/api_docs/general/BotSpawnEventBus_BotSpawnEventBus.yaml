  class: BotSpawnEventBus
  method: BotSpawnEventBus
  signature: void BotSpawnEventBus::BotSpawnEventBus()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the BotSpawnEventBus class for managing bot
    spawn events in the TrinityCore server.
  description: The BotSpawnEventBus constructor initializes the event bus used to
    handle and dispatch notifications related to bot spawning within the TrinityCore
    World of Warcraft emulator. This class is responsible for maintaining subscriptions
    to bot spawn events, allowing various subsystems to react when bots are created
    or destroyed in the game world. The initialization process sets up internal data
    structures necessary for event handling, including registering default event handlers
    and preparing the system for incoming bot-related events. This constructor should
    typically be called during server startup or when a new bot management module
    is initialized.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'BotSpawnEventBus eventBus;

      // The event bus is now ready to handle bot spawn events'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Server Module
    code: "class BotManager\n{\npublic:\n    void Initialize()\n    {\n        m_botSpawnBus\
      \ = new BotSpawnEventBus();\n        // Register event handlers here\n    }\n\
      private:\n    BotSpawnEventBus* m_botSpawnBus;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any heavy initialization or resource allocation.
    The actual event handling mechanisms are set up through separate registration
    methods. Developers should ensure that the event bus is properly initialized before
    attempting to subscribe to events.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor multiple times on the same object instance
    as it may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure proper cleanup of event subscriptions
    before destroying the event bus instance.
