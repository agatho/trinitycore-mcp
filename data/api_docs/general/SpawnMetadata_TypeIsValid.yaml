  class: SpawnMetadata
  method: TypeIsValid
  signature: bool SpawnMetadata::TypeIsValid(SpawnObjectType type)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a given spawn object type is recognized and supported by
    the server.
  description: The TypeIsValid method checks if the provided SpawnObjectType enumeration
    value represents a valid and supported spawn object type within the TrinityCore
    framework. This validation ensures that only legitimate object types, such as
    creatures, game objects, or dynamic objects, are processed during world spawning
    operations. The method performs internal consistency checks against known valid
    types and returns true if the type is recognized, false otherwise. It's commonly
    used before attempting to spawn or manipulate objects to prevent invalid operations
    that could lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The SpawnObjectType enumeration value to validate. This represents
      the type of object being spawned, such as SPAWN_TYPE_CREATURE, SPAWN_TYPE_GAMEOBJECT,
      or SPAWN_TYPE_DYNAMICOBJECT.
  returns: Returns true if the provided SpawnObjectType is a recognized and valid
    type; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Type Validation
    code: "SpawnMetadata metadata;\nSpawnObjectType type = SPAWN_TYPE_CREATURE;\n\
      if (metadata.TypeIsValid(type)) {\n    // Proceed with spawning creature\n \
      \   printf(\"Valid spawn type\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"Invalid spawn type\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Spawn Logic
    code: "void HandleSpawnRequest(SpawnObjectType type) {\n    SpawnMetadata meta;\n\
      \    if (!meta.TypeIsValid(type)) {\n        sLog->outError(\"Attempted to spawn\
      \ invalid object type: %d\", static_cast<int>(type));\n        return;\n   \
      \ }\n    // Proceed with actual spawning logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple lookup or enumeration check against valid spawn
    types. It's designed to be fast and lightweight, making it suitable for frequent
    calls during world initialization or object creation processes.
  warnings: Do not use this method as a substitute for proper type checking in critical
    game logic paths. While it prevents invalid spawn operations, incorrect usage
    may still lead to unexpected behavior if the underlying SpawnObjectType values
    are manipulated directly without validation.
