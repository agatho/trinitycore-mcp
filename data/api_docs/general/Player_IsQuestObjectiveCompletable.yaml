  signature: bool Player::IsQuestObjectiveCompletable(uint32 questId, uint32 objectiveId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a quest objective is completable for the player.
  description: This method checks if a specific quest objective can be completed by
    the player, taking into account the player's current progress and requirements.
    It evaluates whether the objective has been met based on the player's current
    quest status and associated conditions. The method is commonly used in quest handling
    logic to validate if a quest objective is ready for completion or if additional
    conditions need to be satisfied before marking it as complete.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest being evaluated. This parameter
      specifies which quest's objective is being checked.
  - name: objectiveId
    description: The unique identifier of the specific quest objective being evaluated.
      This parameter identifies which objective within the quest is being checked
      for completion status.
  returns: Returns true if the specified quest objective can be completed by the player,
    false otherwise. The method may return false if the player has not yet met the
    requirements or if the objective is not yet ready for completion.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->IsQuestObjectiveCompletable(12345, 1))\n{\n    // Objective\
      \ can be completed\n    // Proceed with quest completion logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "uint32 questId = 12345;\nuint32 objectiveId = 2;\nif (player->IsQuestObjectiveCompletable(questId,\
      \ objectiveId))\n{\n    // Perform actions such as\n    // - reward quest completion\n\
      \    // - update quest progress\n    // - trigger quest completion event\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to determine if a quest can be completed. It's important to note that the method
    checks for specific objective completion status and may not account for all possible
    conditions that could prevent completion. Performance considerations include avoiding
    unnecessary calls when checking multiple objectives.
  warnings: The method may return false even if the player has met the necessary requirements,
    due to potential missing or incorrect quest data in the database. It's important
    to verify that the quest ID and objective ID are valid before calling this method.
