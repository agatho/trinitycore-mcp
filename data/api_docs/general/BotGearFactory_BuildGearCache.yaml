  signature: void BotGearFactory::BuildGearCache()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and populates the bot gear cache with available item data from
    the game database.
  description: The BuildGearCache method is responsible for constructing an internal
    cache of usable gear items for bot characters within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method typically iterates through the game's item database, filtering and
    organizing items based on criteria such as class, level, and equipment slot. The
    resulting cache improves performance by avoiding repeated database queries when
    bots need to evaluate or equip gear. It is commonly invoked during bot initialization
    or when the game environment changes significantly, ensuring that bots have access
    to up-to-date gear information.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotGearFactory factory;

      factory.BuildGearCache();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called once during bot startup or when gear data
    needs to be refreshed. The cache is usually thread-local and should not be accessed
    concurrently by multiple threads without proper synchronization.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently can cause performance degradation due to
    database queries and memory allocation. It should only be invoked when necessary,
    such as after major game updates or when new items are added to the database.
