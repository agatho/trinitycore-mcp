  class: BehaviorAdaptation
  method: SetExplorationRate
  signature: void BehaviorAdaptation::SetExplorationRate(float rate)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the exploration rate for behavior adaptation.
  description: The SetExplorationRate method configures the rate at which a behavior
    adaptation instance explores new states or actions. This is typically used in
    AI systems to control how aggressively an NPC or creature will explore different
    behaviors during decision-making processes. The rate value influences the probability
    or frequency of exploration events, affecting the adaptability and responsiveness
    of the AI to environmental changes. This method does not return any value and
    directly modifies internal state variables within the BehaviorAdaptation class.
  parameters:
  - name: rate
    description: A floating-point value representing the exploration rate. Higher
      values increase the likelihood of exploring new behaviors, while lower values
      favor exploitation of known good behaviors. Typical valid range is between 0.0
      (no exploration) and 1.0 (maximum exploration). Negative values may be clamped
      or result in undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BehaviorAdaptation adaptation;

      adaptation.SetExplorationRate(0.7f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Exploration Rate Adjustment
    code: "void AdjustExplorationRate(Unit* unit, float baseRate) {\n    float newRate\
      \ = baseRate * (1.0f + unit->GetHealthPct() / 100.0f);\n    adaptation.SetExplorationRate(newRate);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other behavior adaptation
    parameters such as exploitation rate and learning rate. The internal implementation
    may use this rate to influence random selection probabilities in decision trees
    or Q-learning algorithms.
  warnings: Setting the exploration rate too high may cause excessive behavior switching,
    leading to suboptimal performance or erratic AI behavior. Ensure that the rate
    is within reasonable bounds for your specific use case.
