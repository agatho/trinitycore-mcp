documentation:
  brief: Learns a blueprint for a specified building in the garrison.
  description: The LearnBlueprint method allows a player's garrison to learn and unlock
    a new building blueprint. This enables the player to construct buildings of that
    type within their garrison. The method takes a garrBuildingId parameter which
    identifies the specific building type for which the blueprint should be learned.
    This action typically occurs when a player completes prerequisites or purchases
    the blueprint through in-game mechanics such as quest completion or vendor interactions.
    The method modifies the garrison's blueprint data and may trigger updates to the
    UI or game state to reflect the newly available building option.
  parameters:
  - name: garrBuildingId
    description: The unique identifier for the building type whose blueprint is to
      be learned. This ID corresponds to a specific building in the garrison system,
      such as a farm, mine, or barracks. Valid values are defined within the game's
      building database and typically map to predefined building types.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Learn a Farm Blueprint
    code: 'Garrison* garr = player->GetGarrison();

      garr->LearnBlueprint(1234); // Learn the blueprint for a specific farm building
      type'
    language: cpp
  - title: Learn Multiple Blueprints in Loop
    code: "Garrison* garr = player->GetGarrison();\nstd::vector<uint32> blueprintIds\
      \ = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nfor (uint32 id : blueprintIds)\n{\n    garr->LearnBlueprint(id);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal garrison data structures and may trigger
    UI refreshes or database writes. It should only be called when the player has
    met all prerequisites for learning the blueprint, as attempting to learn an invalid
    or locked blueprint may result in no effect or potential errors.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of prerequisites or with
    invalid garrBuildingId values could lead to undefined behavior or silent failures.
    Ensure that the building ID exists and the player has the necessary conditions
    met before invoking this method.
