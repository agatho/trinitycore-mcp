documentation:
  brief: Initializes cooldowns for the Vengeance Demon Hunter class
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up and configures all cooldown
    timers for abilities specific to the Vengeance Demon Hunter specialization. This
    method is typically called during player initialization or when switching to this
    class specialization. It ensures that all abilities start with their correct base
    cooldown values, preventing any unexpected behavior during combat. The method
    handles internal state management for cooldown tracking and resets any previously
    set cooldowns to their default values.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'VengeanceDemonHunterRefactored* dh = new VengeanceDemonHunterRefactored();

      dh->InitializeCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during class initialization. Repeated
    calls may reset cooldown states unexpectedly. The method assumes that the player
    object has been properly constructed and initialized with necessary data structures.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of appropriate initialization contexts
    as it may interfere with existing cooldown tracking. Ensure all required player
    data is loaded before calling to avoid undefined behavior.
