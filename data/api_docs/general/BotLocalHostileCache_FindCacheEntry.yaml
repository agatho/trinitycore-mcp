  class: BotLocalHostileCache
  method: FindCacheEntry
  signature: CacheEntry * BotLocalHostileCache::FindCacheEntry(float range)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a cached hostile entry within the specified range from the local
    hostile cache.
  description: The FindCacheEntry method searches through the BotLocalHostileCache
    to locate and return a CacheEntry that represents a hostile target within the
    defined range. This method is typically used by AI bots to efficiently access
    previously identified hostile entities without repeatedly querying the game world.
    The cache is maintained per bot instance and updated based on detection events
    or periodic refreshes. The method returns a pointer to the CacheEntry if found,
    or nullptr if no suitable entry exists within the specified range.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a CacheEntry object representing the hostile target within
    range, or nullptr if no such entry is found in the cache.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "CacheEntry* entry = bot->GetHostileCache()->FindCacheEntry(30.0f);\nif\
      \ (entry)\n{\n    // Process hostile target\n    std::cout << \"Found hostile\
      \ at distance: \" << entry->GetDistance() << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on a pre-populated cache and does not perform real-time
    world queries. The cache must be updated periodically to reflect current hostile
    targets in the game world.
