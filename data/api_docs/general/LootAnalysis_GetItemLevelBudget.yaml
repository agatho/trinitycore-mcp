api:
  class: LootAnalysis
  method: GetItemLevelBudget
  signature: float LootAnalysis::GetItemLevelBudget(uint32 itemLevel, uint32 slot)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the item level budget for a specified item level and
    loot slot.
  description: The GetItemLevelBudget method computes the appropriate item level budget
    based on the provided item level and loot slot parameters. This function is typically
    used in loot analysis systems to determine the maximum item level that can be
    awarded for a specific loot slot, considering game mechanics such as player level,
    loot quality, and item rarity. The method likely factors in game balance requirements
    and ensures that players receive loot appropriate to their progression. It serves
    as a core component in determining loot eligibility and value within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters:
  - name: itemLevel
    description: The base item level of the item being evaluated for budget calculation.
      This represents the quality or power level of the item.
  - name: slot
    description: The loot slot identifier that determines how the item level budget
      is calculated. Different slots (e.g., head, chest, weapon) may have different
      budget constraints.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the calculated item level budget. This
    value indicates the maximum item level that should be considered for the given
    slot and item level combination.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: float budget = lootAnalysis->GetItemLevelBudget(800, LOOT_SLOT_HEAD);
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Budget Calculation
    code: 'uint32 playerLevel = player->GetLevel();

      uint32 itemLevel = 750;

      float budget = lootAnalysis->GetItemLevelBudget(itemLevel, LOOT_SLOT_WEAPON);

      // Use budget to determine if item is appropriate for player level'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger loot system that ensures balanced
    item distribution. The implementation may involve lookup tables or formulas based
    on game balance parameters. Developers should be aware that the returned value
    might vary depending on server configuration and expansion-specific rules.
  warnings: Ensure that both itemLevel and slot parameters are valid before calling
    this method, as invalid values could lead to unexpected budget calculations. The
    method should not be called outside of appropriate loot evaluation contexts.
