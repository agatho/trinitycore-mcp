documentation:
  brief: Resets all gathering statistics to their initial state.
  description: The Reset method clears all accumulated gathering statistics within
    the GatheringStatistics class, restoring internal counters and data structures
    to their default values. This method is typically used when starting a new gathering
    session or when statistics need to be cleared for reporting purposes. The operation
    is atomic and ensures that all related data is properly reset without leaving
    any residual information. No parameters are required as the method operates on
    the instance's internal state exclusively.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset Gathering Statistics
    code: 'GatheringStatistics stats;

      stats.Reset(); // Clears all gathering data

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before beginning a new gathering session to
    ensure accurate tracking. It's recommended to call Reset() at the start of each
    new session or when statistics are no longer needed to prevent data contamination.
