  class: LFGBotSelector
  method: FindBotsForRole
  signature: int LFGBotSelector::FindBotsForRole(uint8 minLevel, uint8 maxLevel, uint8
    desiredRole, uint32 count)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns a list of available bots matching specified level range
    and role requirements for use in LFG (Looking for Group) scenarios.
  description: The FindBotsForRole method searches through the bot database to locate
    bots that meet the specified criteria including minimum and maximum level thresholds,
    as well as a desired role. It is primarily used within the TrinityCore's LFG system
    to dynamically assign appropriate bots to fill group slots when real players are
    unavailable. The method ensures that only bots meeting all specified conditions
    are returned, maintaining game balance and role distribution in group content
    such as dungeons or raids. This function does not modify any persistent state;
    it simply retrieves and returns a list of suitable bot entries based on the input
    parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: minLevel
    description: The minimum level that bots must meet or exceed to be considered
      for selection. Valid values are typically between 1 and 80, depending on server
      configuration.
  - name: maxLevel
    description: The maximum level that bots can have to be considered for selection.
      Must be greater than or equal to minLevel.
  - name: desiredRole
    description: The role that the returned bots should fulfill (e.g., tank, healer,
      damage dealer). Role values are defined by TrinityCore's internal constants
      and typically map to 0 (none), 1 (tank), 2 (healer), 3 (dps).
  - name: count
    description: The number of bots to attempt to find. The method may return fewer
      if insufficient matching bots exist in the system.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the actual number of bots found and added
    to the result set. A value of zero indicates no suitable bots were available,
    while a positive integer reflects the count of bots successfully matched. Negative
    values are not expected under normal operation.
  examples:
  - title: Find 2 DPS bots between levels 60-70
    code: int foundBots = selector.FindBotsForRole(60, 70, 3, 2);
    language: cpp
  - title: Find 1 tank bot at level 80
    code: int foundBots = selector.FindBotsForRole(80, 80, 1, 1);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on an internal database or cache of bots that must be
    populated before use. Performance may degrade if the bot list is large and filtering
    is done frequently without caching results. The method assumes that bots are pre-configured
    with appropriate roles and levels.
  warnings: Ensure that minLevel is not greater than maxLevel, as this will result
    in no bots being returned. Also, be cautious when requesting more bots than exist
    in the system for a given role and level range; the method will return only what
    is available.
