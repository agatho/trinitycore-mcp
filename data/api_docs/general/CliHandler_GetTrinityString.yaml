documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a localized string message from the TrinityCore database based
    on the provided entry ID
  description: The GetTrinityString method fetches a localized string message from
    the TrinityCore database using an integer entry identifier. This method is commonly
    used in command-line interface (CLI) handlers to provide user-friendly messages,
    error notifications, or informational text in the player's selected language.
    The method accesses internal string tables that store localized messages for various
    game systems and commands. It serves as a bridge between the core game logic and
    user-facing text output, ensuring consistent localization across different client
    languages.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a null-terminated character array containing the localized
    string message associated with the given entry ID. Returns NULL if the entry ID
    is not found in the database or if there's an internal error accessing the string
    table.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in CLI command handler
    code: "void HandleTestCommand(ChatHandler* handler)\n{\n    const char* message\
      \ = handler->GetTrinityString(12345);\n    if (message)\n        handler->PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Retrieved message: %s\", message);\n    else\n        handler->PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Message not found for ID 12345\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with error handling in a custom command
    code: "bool ChatHandler::HandleCustomCommand(const char* args)\n{\n    int entryId\
      \ = 54321;\n    const char* localizedText = GetTrinityString(entryId);\n   \
      \ \n    if (!localizedText)\n    {\n        PSendSysMessage(\"Error: Could not\
      \ retrieve localized string for ID %d\", entryId);\n        return false;\n\
      \    }\n    \n    PSendSysMessage(\"Localized message: %s\", localizedText);\n\
      \    return true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the TrinityCore's string localization system which
    must be properly initialized. The entry IDs correspond to specific string entries
    in the database tables such as 'trinity_string' or similar localization tables.
    The returned pointer is valid only for the lifetime of the handler object and
    should not be freed by the caller. Performance is generally good as it uses cached
    lookups, but repeated calls with many different IDs may impact performance if
    not properly optimized.
  warnings: Do not assume that all entry IDs will return valid strings - always check
    for NULL returns. The method may return NULL if the database entry does not exist
    or if localization data is missing. Avoid calling this method in performance-critical
    code paths without proper caching mechanisms.
