documentation:
  brief: Moves the bot to wander within the area of a quest.
  description: The WanderInQuestArea method instructs a bot AI to move around within
    the geographical boundaries of the current quest's area. This behavior is typically
    used when the bot needs to explore or patrol the quest zone without specific targeting.
    The method leverages the AI's movement capabilities and quest context to determine
    appropriate wandering paths and destinations. It ensures that the bot remains
    within the relevant quest area while performing idle actions such as looting,
    interacting with objects, or waiting for quest objectives.

  - title: Basic Usage in Quest Strategy
    code: "void MyQuestStrategy::OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n\
      {\n    if (BotAI* ai = GetBotAI(player))\n    {\n        ai->WanderInQuestArea(ai);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the bot's current quest context to define the wandering
    area. It may use pathfinding algorithms to ensure the bot moves naturally within
    the quest zone boundaries.
