  class: FlameShockTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void FlameShockTracker::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the Flame Shock tracker state for the specified player bot.
  description: The Update method in the FlameShockTracker class is responsible for
    managing and refreshing the state of Flame Shock effects applied to a player bot.
    This method typically checks the current status of Flame Shock buffs on the target,
    evaluates whether the effect should be refreshed or maintained, and ensures proper
    tracking of duration and damage application. It plays a crucial role in maintaining
    accurate spell tracking for elemental shaman abilities within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose Flame Shock
      state needs to be updated. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Flame Shock Tracker Update
    code: 'FlameShockTracker tracker;

      Player* myBot = ...; // Assume valid player pointer

      tracker.Update(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI decision-making cycles or when
    spell effects need to be refreshed. It assumes that the provided Player object
    has valid Flame Shock spell data and is actively engaged in combat.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot pointer passed to this method is valid and not null,
    as dereferencing an invalid pointer will cause undefined behavior. The method
    does not perform null checks internally.
