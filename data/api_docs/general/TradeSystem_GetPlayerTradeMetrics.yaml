  class: TradeSystem
  method: GetPlayerTradeMetrics
  signature: TradeMetrics TradeSystem::GetPlayerTradeMetrics(uint32 playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves trade metrics for a specified player by their GUID.
  description: The GetPlayerTradeMetrics method fetches comprehensive trading statistics
    and performance data for a given player within the TrinityCore framework. This
    includes information such as total trades completed, successful trades, failed
    trades, and other relevant trade-related metrics. The method is typically used
    for player progression tracking, achievement systems, or administrative monitoring
    of in-game economic activity. It requires a valid player GUID to retrieve accurate
    data, and will return an empty or default TradeMetrics structure if the player
    does not exist or has no trade history.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose trade metrics are
      being retrieved. Must be a valid player GUID within the game database.
  returns: Returns a TradeMetrics object containing detailed statistics about the
    player's trading activity, including counts of successful and failed trades, total
    transactions, and other relevant performance indicators. If no data is found for
    the specified player, an empty or default-initialized TradeMetrics structure is
    returned.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "TradeMetrics metrics = tradeSystem.GetPlayerTradeMetrics(12345);\nif (metrics.totalTrades\
      \ > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Player has completed \" << metrics.totalTrades\
      \ << \" trades.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "uint32 playerId = 54321;\nTradeMetrics metrics = tradeSystem.GetPlayerTradeMetrics(playerId);\n\
      if (metrics.totalTrades > 0) {\n    float successRate = static_cast<float>(metrics.successfulTrades)\
      \ / static_cast<float>(metrics.totalTrades) * 100.0f;\n    std::cout << \"Success\
      \ Rate: \" << successRate << \"%\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"No trade history found for player.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses cached or database-stored trade data, so performance
    may vary depending on how frequently the data is updated. The TradeMetrics structure
    should be designed to handle missing or zero values gracefully. Ensure that player
    GUIDs are validated before calling this method to avoid unnecessary database lookups.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent player GUID may result
    in undefined behavior or return default values. Always validate input GUIDs and
    check for valid trade data before using the returned metrics in critical systems
    like achievements or economy-based mechanics.
