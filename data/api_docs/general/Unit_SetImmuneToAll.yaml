  method: SetImmuneToAll
  signature: void Unit::SetImmuneToAll(bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Sets unit to be immune to all attacks and spells
  description: This method makes the unit completely immune to all incoming attacks
    and spells by setting the appropriate flags in the unit's combat state. When applied,
    it prevents the unit from taking any damage or being affected by spells, effectively
    making them invulnerable to all forms of combat. The method can be used to create
    temporary invulnerability for units such as bosses or NPCs during certain phases
    of encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to apply or remove the immunity
      state. True applies immunity, false removes it.
  - name: keep
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to keep the immunity even when the
      unit is not in combat. True maintains immunity during non-combat periods, false
      only applies immunity during combat.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetUnit();


      // Apply immunity to the unit

      target->SetImmuneToAll(true);


      // Remove immunity after a time period

      target->SetImmuneToAll(false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: '// In a boss fight scenario

      Unit* boss = GetUnit();


      // Apply immunity during combat phase

      boss->SetImmuneToAll(true, true);


      // Apply immunity only during combat

      boss->SetImmuneToAll(true, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method typically uses internal flags and state
    management to control the unit''s immunity status. It may interact with combat
    state tracking mechanisms and should be used carefully to avoid unintended side
    effects in combat situations.'
  warnings: This method should not be used for regular players, as it can prevent
    them from taking damage or being affected by spells. Also, applying immunity during
    non-combat periods might cause unexpected behavior if the unit is not properly
    managed.
