documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads auction house configuration settings from the database.
  description: The LoadConfiguration method retrieves and applies all relevant auction
    house settings from the database, including auction duration limits, starting
    bid percentages, and commission rates. This method is typically called during
    server startup or when reloading auction configurations dynamically. It ensures
    that the AuctionManager has the most up-to-date settings before processing any
    auction-related operations. The method does not return any value but modifies
    internal state variables within the AuctionManager class.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'AuctionManager* auctionMgr = sAuctionMgr;

      auctionMgr->LoadConfiguration();

      // Configuration is now loaded and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the database connection has been
    established. It's typically invoked during server startup sequence before any
    auction operations begin. The method performs database queries to fetch configuration
    data, so calling it frequently may impact performance.
