  class: CollectableSourceTrackedData
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void CollectableSourceTrackedData::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const
    Player * owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Serializes collectable source tracked data into a byte buffer for client
    transmission.
  description: 'The WriteCreate method serializes the internal state of a CollectableSourceTrackedData
    object into a ByteBuffer, which is typically used to send initial data about collectable
    sources to players in the World of Warcraft client. This method is part of the
    TrinityCore server''s implementation for handling collectable items and their
    tracking states. It takes two player references: one representing the owner of
    the collectable source and another representing the receiver who will be notified
    of this data. The serialized data includes relevant metadata about the tracked
    collectable source, such as its type, state, and associated identifiers that are
    necessary for the client to properly display and manage the collectable items.'
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: A reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized collectable source
      data will be written. This buffer is typically used to construct network packets
      sent to players.
  - name: owner
    description: A pointer to the Player object who owns or is associated with the
      collectable source being tracked. This player's data may be referenced during
      serialization for ownership information.
  - name: receiver
    description: A pointer to the Player object who will receive this serialized data.
      This represents the client that will interpret and display the collectable source
      information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet creation
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = ...; // Get player who owns the collectable

      Player* receiver = ...; // Get player who receives the update

      CollectableSourceTrackedData trackedData;

      trackedData.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);

      // Send ''data'' buffer as part of a packet to receiver'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the initialization phase when sending
    initial state information about collectable sources to players. It's important
    that both owner and receiver parameters are valid player objects, otherwise undefined
    behavior may occur. The method does not perform any validation on the input parameters
    beyond ensuring they are non-null pointers.
