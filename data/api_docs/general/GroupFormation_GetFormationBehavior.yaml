documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the formation behavior configuration for the group
  description: The GetFormationBehavior method returns the current formation behavior
    setting for a GroupFormation object. This behavior defines how members of a group
    should position themselves relative to each other during movement or combat situations.
    The returned FormationBehavior enum value indicates the specific positioning strategy
    being used by the group, such as linear, circular, or custom formations. This
    method is typically used in AI pathfinding and group coordination systems within
    TrinityCore's game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a FormationBehavior enum value representing the current formation
    behavior configuration. Possible values include standard formation types like
    LINE, CIRCLE, or CUSTOM depending on the group's configured behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();\nFormationBehavior\
      \ behavior = formation->GetFormationBehavior();\nif (behavior == FORMATION_LINE)\n\
      {\n    // Handle line formation logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and does not modify any internal state. The returned
    FormationBehavior value should be checked against valid enum constants before
    using in conditional logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the GroupFormation object is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as accessing formation behavior on an uninitialized group may result
    in undefined behavior.
