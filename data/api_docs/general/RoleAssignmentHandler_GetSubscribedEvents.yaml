  signature: int RoleAssignmentHandler::GetSubscribedEvents() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the bitmask of events this handler is subscribed to
  description: The GetSubscribedEvents method retrieves the event subscription mask
    for a RoleAssignmentHandler instance. This bitmask indicates which game events
    the handler wishes to receive notifications for, allowing the system to efficiently
    route relevant events to the appropriate handler. The returned value is typically
    used by the event management system to determine whether to invoke this handler's
    callback methods when specific events occur within the World of Warcraft environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer bitmask representing the set of subscribed events. Each bit
    in the mask corresponds to a specific event type, with bits set to 1 indicating
    subscription to that event. The exact bit values and their meanings are defined
    by the TrinityCore event system constants.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "RoleAssignmentHandler handler;\nint subscribedEvents = handler.GetSubscribedEvents();\n\
      if (subscribedEvents & EVENT_ROLE_ASSIGNED)\n{\n    // Handle role assignment\
      \ event\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the initialization or registration
    phase of an event handler. The returned bitmask should be treated as read-only
    and must not be modified directly by external code. Implementations may cache
    this value for performance reasons.
