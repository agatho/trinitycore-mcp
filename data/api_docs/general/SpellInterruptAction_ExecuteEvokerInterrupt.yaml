  class: SpellInterruptAction
  method: ExecuteEvokerInterrupt
  signature: ActionResult SpellInterruptAction::ExecuteEvokerInterrupt(BotAI * ai,
    ::Unit * target, uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Interrupts an evoker's spell cast on a target using the provided bot AI context.
  description: The ExecuteEvokerInterrupt method is designed to handle the interruption
    of an evoker's ongoing spell cast on a specified target within the TrinityCore
    framework. It leverages the BotAI context to determine appropriate interrupt behavior,
    ensuring that the evoker's current spell is properly interrupted based on game
    mechanics and AI logic. This method typically involves checking if the target
    is casting a spell, verifying that the interruption is valid according to game
    rules, and executing the necessary actions to halt the cast. It is commonly used
    in bot AI systems where automated control of evoker characters requires precise
    handling of spell interruptions.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance managing the evoker character's behavior.
      This context provides access to AI decision-making logic and state information.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target whose spell cast
      is to be interrupted. Must be a valid unit in the game world.
  - name: spellId
    description: The identifier of the spell that should be interrupted. Used to verify
      the correct spell is being targeted for interruption.
  returns: Returns an ActionResult enum value indicating whether the interrupt was
    successful, failed, or resulted in a specific outcome. Possible values may include
    SUCCESS, FAILED, or INVALID_TARGET depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecuteEvokerInterrupt
    code: "BotAI* ai = player->GetBotAI();\nUnit* target = ai->GetTarget();\nuint32\
      \ spellId = 12345;\nActionResult result = SpellInterruptAction::ExecuteEvokerInterrupt(ai,\
      \ target, spellId);\nif (result == ActionResult::SUCCESS) {\n    // Handle successful\
      \ interrupt\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided BotAI context is properly initialized
    and that the target unit is valid. The spell ID must correspond to a real spell
    in the game database for proper validation. Performance may be affected if called
    frequently without batching operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit is actively casting a spell before calling
    this method, as attempting to interrupt a non-casting target may lead to undefined
    behavior or errors. Also, verify that the spell ID corresponds to an actual evoker
    spell to avoid incorrect interruptions.
