documentation:
  brief: Sends a feature system status message to the client's glue screen, indicating
    available game features and restrictions.
  description: The SendFeatureSystemStatusGlueScreen method is responsible for transmitting
    information about the current state of game features and restrictions to the client's
    initial loading screen (glue screen). This method typically informs the client
    about which features are enabled or disabled based on account permissions, game
    build settings, or regional restrictions. It plays a crucial role in the client-server
    communication during the login process, ensuring that the user interface accurately
    reflects the available functionality. The method does not require any parameters
    and is usually invoked automatically by the server as part of the authentication
    sequence.

  notes: This method is typically called during the initial authentication handshake
    and may be tied to specific client versions or game builds. It's important to
    note that this method sends data directly to the client's UI layer, so any changes
    should be carefully considered for compatibility across different client versions.
