  signature: void ChannelMgr::LoadFromDB()
documentation:
  brief: Loads all channel information from the database into memory for active use
    in the game world.
  description: The LoadFromDB method initializes the ChannelMgr by retrieving all
    existing channels from the database and populating internal data structures with
    this information. This method is typically invoked during server startup or when
    reloading channel configurations to ensure that all previously created channels
    are available for player interaction. It handles the synchronization of persistent
    channel data with in-memory representations, allowing players to join, leave,
    and communicate through channels as expected. The method does not accept any parameters
    and performs no direct return operations; instead, it modifies internal state
    to reflect database contents.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'ChannelMgr* channelMgr = ChannelMgr::GetSharedInstance();

      channelMgr->LoadFromDB();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    explicitly reloading channels from the database. Repeated calls may lead to duplicate
    channel entries or inconsistent state if not handled properly by the underlying
    implementation.
