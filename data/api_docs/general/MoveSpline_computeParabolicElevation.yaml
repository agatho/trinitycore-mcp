  method: computeParabolicElevation
  signature: void MoveSpline::computeParabolicElevation(int32 time_point, float &
    el) const
documentation:
  brief: Computes the parabolic elevation angle for a given time point along a movement
    spline.
  description: The computeParabolicElevation method calculates the vertical angle
    (elevation) of a character's movement at a specific time point along a spline
    path. This is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to simulate realistic
    jumping, flying, or other curved motion behaviors. The method takes into account
    the spline's properties such as height, duration, and timing to determine the
    elevation at the specified point. It modifies the provided float reference parameter
    to store the computed elevation value in degrees.
  parameters:
  - name: time_point
    description: The time point along the spline path (in milliseconds) for which
      to compute the elevation. This value should be within the valid range of the
      spline's duration.
  - name: el
    description: Reference to a float variable where the computed elevation angle
      will be stored. The result is expressed in degrees.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'MoveSpline spline;

      int32 currentTime = 500; // 500ms into the movement

      float elevationAngle;

      spline.computeParabolicElevation(currentTime, elevationAngle);

      // elevationAngle now contains the computed vertical angle at 500ms'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Movement Logic
    code: "void UpdateMovement(float deltaTime)\n{\n    static int32 totalDuration\
      \ = 2000; // 2 seconds\n    static int32 currentTime = 0;\n    \n    currentTime\
      \ += (int32)(deltaTime * 1000); // Convert to milliseconds\n    if (currentTime\
      \ > totalDuration) currentTime = totalDuration;\n    \n    float elevation;\n\
      \    spline.computeParabolicElevation(currentTime, elevation);\n    \n    //\
      \ Use elevation for character positioning or animation\n    SetCharacterElevation(elevation);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore's movement system.
    The elevation calculation follows a parabolic curve which simulates natural motion
    like jumping or flying. The implementation assumes that the spline has been properly
    initialized with valid parameters including height and duration.
  warnings: The time_point parameter must be within the valid range of the spline's
    duration, otherwise the result may be undefined. This method modifies the provided
    float reference directly, so ensure it's properly initialized before calling.
