  method: ClearBotMetrics
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::ClearBotMetrics(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Clears performance metrics associated with a specific bot identified by its
    GUID.
  description: The ClearBotMetrics method removes all stored performance data for
    a specified bot within the BotPerformanceMonitor system. This function is typically
    invoked when a bot is removed from monitoring or when resetting performance tracking
    for a particular entity. The method ensures that no stale or outdated metrics
    persist in memory, which helps maintain accurate performance reporting and prevents
    potential memory leaks. It operates on a per-bot basis using the unique identifier
    (GUID) of the bot to locate and clear its associated metrics.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose performance metrics
      are to be cleared. This value must correspond to an existing bot in the system;
      otherwise, the operation will have no effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing Metrics for a Specific Bot
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      monitor.ClearBotMetrics(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing Metrics After Bot Removal
    code: "void OnBotRemoved(uint32_t botGuid) {\n    // Perform cleanup tasks\n \
      \   BotPerformanceMonitor::GetInstance().ClearBotMetrics(botGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BotPerformanceMonitor maintains an internal
    data structure (such as a map or hash table) indexed by bot GUIDs. The implementation
    should be efficient to avoid performance bottlenecks during frequent calls. It
    is recommended to call this function before removing a bot from the system to
    prevent dangling references.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent botGuid may result
    in no-op behavior, but it's best practice to verify that the GUID corresponds
    to an active bot before invoking the function. Improper use could lead to inconsistent
    performance data if metrics are cleared prematurely.
