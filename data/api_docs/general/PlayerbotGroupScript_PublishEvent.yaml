documentation:
  brief: Publishes a group event to all player bots in the group
  description: The PublishEvent method broadcasts a GroupEvent to all player bots
    that are currently part of the group. This method is used within the TrinityCore
    playerbot system to synchronize game state changes, actions, or notifications
    across multiple AI-controlled characters. The event is queued for delivery to
    each bot's event processing system, allowing them to react accordingly to group-wide
    occurrences such as combat events, loot distribution, or strategic decisions.
    This mechanism ensures that all bots in a group stay synchronized with the current
    group state and can respond appropriately to shared circumstances.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The GroupEvent object containing the event data to be published to
      all player bots in the group. This includes information about the type of event,
      associated data, and any relevant context that the bots need to process.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Publishing a combat start event
    code: 'GroupEvent event;

      event.type = GROUP_EVENT_COMBAT_START;

      event.data = "Enemy detected at location (100, 200)";

      playerbotGroupScript->PublishEvent(event);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Broadcasting loot distribution notification
    code: 'GroupEvent event;

      event.type = GROUP_EVENT_LOOT_DISTRIBUTED;

      event.data = "Item: Health Potion (ID: 12345) awarded to player ''John''";

      playerbotGroupScript->PublishEvent(event);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the playerbot framework and assumes that the
    group has been properly initialized with active bots. The event delivery is asynchronous,
    meaning that bots may process events at different times based on their current
    state and processing queue. The method does not validate whether the bots are
    currently in the same zone or have line-of-sight to each other, as this is handled
    by the underlying bot AI systems.
  warnings: Calling PublishEvent with an invalid or malformed GroupEvent may cause
    undefined behavior in the bot AI system. Ensure that all event data is properly
    initialized before publishing. Additionally, excessive use of this method can
    lead to performance degradation if too many events are published simultaneously,
    as each event must be processed by every bot in the group.
