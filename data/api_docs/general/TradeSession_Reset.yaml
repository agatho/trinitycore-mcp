  class: TradeSession
  method: Reset
  signature: void TradeSession::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the trade session state, clearing all trade data and notifying involved
    parties.
  description: The Reset method clears all active trade data within a TradeSession
    object, effectively ending any ongoing trade negotiation between two players.
    This method ensures that both traders' trade windows are closed and their trade
    states are reset to default. It is typically invoked when a trade is cancelled,
    completed, or when an error occurs during the trading process. The method handles
    cleanup of trade items, resets trade status flags, and sends appropriate network
    messages to update client interfaces. This ensures that players cannot continue
    trading after the session has been terminated.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trade Session Reset
    code: "TradeSession* session = player1->GetTradeData();\nif (session)\n{\n   \
      \ session->Reset();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the trade session is no longer active
    or valid. It's typically invoked internally by the core trading system, but can
    also be manually triggered in custom modules for specific trade scenarios.
  warnings: Calling Reset on an already reset session may cause undefined behavior.
    Ensure that proper state checks are performed before invoking this method to avoid
    potential client-side issues or data corruption.
