  class: WorldSession
  method: HandleStandStateChangeOpcode
  signature: void WorldSession::HandleStandStateChangeOpcode(WorldPackets::Misc::StandStateChange
    & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Processes incoming stand state change packets from players to update their
    animation states.
  description: The HandleStandStateChangeOpcode method is responsible for processing
    the StandStateChange opcode sent by clients when a player changes their standing
    state (e.g., sitting, standing, kneeling). This method updates the player's current
    animation state in the game world and ensures synchronization between client and
    server. It typically handles transitions between different body postures such
    as standing, sitting, sitting chairs, kneeling, and other positional states that
    affect character animations and interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: packet
    description: The incoming WorldPackets::Misc::StandStateChange packet containing
      the new stand state value sent by the client. This packet includes a uint8 value
      representing the desired stand state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleStandStateChangeOpcode(WorldPackets::Misc::StandStateChange&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    Player* player = GetPlayer();\n    if (!player)\n        return;\n\
      \n    player->SetStandState(packet.StandState);\n    // Synchronize with other\
      \ players in the area\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core packet handling system for player movement
    and animation states. The stand state value should be validated against valid
    enum values to prevent invalid states. This method may trigger additional events
    or updates related to player positioning, interaction states, and visual effects.
  warnings: Improper handling of stand state changes can lead to desynchronization
    between client and server, causing visual glitches or incorrect character behavior.
    Ensure that all stand state transitions are properly validated before applying
    them to prevent exploits or invalid states.
