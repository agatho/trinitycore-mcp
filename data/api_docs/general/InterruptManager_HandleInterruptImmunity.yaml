  class: InterruptManager
  method: HandleInterruptImmunity
  signature: void InterruptManager::HandleInterruptImmunity(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Checks and handles interrupt immunity for a target unit during spell casting.
  description: The HandleInterruptImmunity method evaluates whether a target unit
    has any interrupt immunity effects that would prevent a spell interruption. It
    typically checks for immunity states such as divine shielding, magic immunity,
    or other defensive mechanisms that protect units from being interrupted while
    casting spells. This method is commonly invoked during spell execution to determine
    if an interrupt attempt should be blocked. The function does not directly interrupt
    spells but rather assesses the target's immunity status and potentially modifies
    the interrupt behavior accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is being checked for interrupt immunity.
      This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid game entity that
      can be interrupted.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell interruption logic
    code: "void MySpell::InterruptSpell(Unit* target)\n{\n    InterruptManager im;\n\
      \    im.HandleInterruptImmunity(target);\n    // Proceed with interrupt logic\
      \ if immunity not bypassed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core spell system when
    evaluating whether an interrupt effect should be applied. Developers should ensure
    that the target unit pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null target pointer will likely result in a
    crash or undefined behavior. Always validate the target parameter before invoking
    this function.
