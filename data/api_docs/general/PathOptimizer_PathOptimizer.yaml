  class: PathOptimizer
  method: PathOptimizer
  signature: void PathOptimizer::PathOptimizer()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new PathOptimizer instance for calculating optimized movement
    paths.
  description: The PathOptimizer constructor initializes a new instance of the PathOptimizer
    class, which is responsible for computing optimized movement paths for units in
    the game world. This class typically handles pathfinding calculations to determine
    the most efficient route between two points while considering obstacles, terrain,
    and other environmental factors. The optimizer may use various algorithms such
    as A* or Dijkstra's to calculate paths that minimize travel time or distance.
    It is commonly used by AI systems for NPC movement and player character pathfinding.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a PathOptimizer instance
    code: 'PathOptimizer optimizer;

      // The optimizer is now ready to calculate paths'
    language: cpp
  notes: The PathOptimizer class typically requires additional setup before path calculation
    can occur, such as setting start and end points. It may also require access to
    navigation mesh data or world collision information for accurate pathfinding.
