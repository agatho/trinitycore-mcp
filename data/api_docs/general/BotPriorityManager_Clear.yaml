documentation:
  brief: Clears all bot priorities from the manager
  description: The Clear method removes all configured bot priorities from the BotPriorityManager,
    resetting its internal state to an empty configuration. This operation is typically
    used when reconfiguring bot behavior or during cleanup operations. The method
    does not take any parameters and performs no validation checks on the current
    state of priorities before clearing them. After execution, the manager will contain
    zero priority entries until new priorities are added.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clear all bot priorities
    code: 'BotPriorityManager* manager = BotPriorityManager::Instance();

      manager->Clear();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a complete reset of the priority list. It is recommended
    to call this before applying new priority configurations to avoid conflicts or
    duplicate entries. The operation is thread-safe if the underlying implementation
    supports concurrent access.
