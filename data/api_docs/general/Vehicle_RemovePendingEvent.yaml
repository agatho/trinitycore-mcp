documentation:
  brief: Removes a pending vehicle join event from the vehicle's event queue
  description: The RemovePendingEvent method removes a specific VehicleJoinEvent from
    the vehicle's internal pending event list. This method is typically used to cancel
    or clean up pending vehicle boarding operations before they are executed. The
    method operates on a pointer to a VehicleJoinEvent object, which must be a valid
    pending event that was previously added to the vehicle's event queue. This functionality
    is essential for managing vehicle boarding states and preventing invalid or stale
    events from being processed later in the game loop.
  parameters:
  - name: e
    description: Pointer to the VehicleJoinEvent object that should be removed from
      the pending events list. Must not be null and must represent a valid pending
      event that was previously added to this vehicle's event queue.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing a Pending Vehicle Join Event
    code: "VehicleJoinEvent* pendingEvent = vehicle->GetPendingEvent();\nif (pendingEvent\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    vehicle->RemovePendingEvent(pendingEvent);\n    // The\
      \ event is now removed and will not be processed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided VehicleJoinEvent pointer was previously
    added to the vehicle's pending events list. It's important to ensure thread safety
    when calling this method, as vehicle events may be processed from different threads
    in the game loop.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null pointer or an event not currently in the
    pending queue may result in undefined behavior or memory corruption. Always verify
    that the event exists in the pending list before removal.
