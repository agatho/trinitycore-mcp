  signature: const HeirloomContainer & CollectionMgr::GetAccountHeirlooms() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant reference to the account's heirloom collection container.
  description: The GetAccountHeirlooms method retrieves the complete collection of
    heirlooms associated with the account. This method provides access to all heirlooms
    that have been acquired by any character on the account, including those that
    are not yet obtained by the currently active character. The returned HeirloomContainer
    is read-only and should not be modified directly. This method is typically used
    in conjunction with other collection management functions to display or process
    an account's heirloom progress across all characters.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a HeirloomContainer object that holds all heirlooms
    available to the account. The container can be iterated over to access individual
    heirloom data, and it provides methods for checking if specific heirlooms are
    obtained or for retrieving heirloom information.
  examples:
  - title: Iterating Through Account Heirlooms
    code: "const HeirloomContainer& heirlooms = collectionMgr.GetAccountHeirlooms();\n\
      for (const auto& heirloom : heirlooms)\n{\n    if (heirloom.IsObtained())\n\
      \    {\n        std::cout << \"Obtained heirloom: \" << heirloom.GetName() <<\
      \ std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Specific Heirloom
    code: "const HeirloomContainer& heirlooms = collectionMgr.GetAccountHeirlooms();\n\
      uint32 heirloomId = 12345;\nif (heirlooms.HasHeirloom(heirloomId))\n{\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Heirloom \" << heirloomId << \" is available on this account.\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned HeirloomContainer is a const reference, meaning modifications
    to the container are not allowed through this method. The data is cached and may
    not reflect real-time changes unless the collection manager has been updated with
    recent account data. This method does not perform any database queries directly;
    it returns pre-loaded data from the CollectionMgr's internal state.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the returned HeirloomContainer as it is a const
    reference. If you need to update heirloom data, use appropriate CollectionMgr
    methods such as AddHeirloom or MarkHeirloomAsObtained. Be aware that this method
    returns all heirlooms for the account, which may include heirlooms not yet obtained
    by the current character.
