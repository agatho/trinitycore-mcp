  method: Update

documentation:
  brief: Updates the movement arbiter's internal state and processes pending movement
    commands.
  description: The Update method is responsible for advancing the internal state of
    the MovementArbiter class, typically called once per game tick or frame. It handles
    processing queued movement commands, updating position data, and managing movement-related
    logic such as pathfinding, collision detection, and synchronization with the game
    world. This method is crucial for maintaining consistent character movement behavior
    in TrinityCore's AI and movement systems. The implementation likely involves iterating
    through active movement requests, applying time-based updates to positions, and
    ensuring that movement constraints are respected.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = sWorld->GetLastTickTime();\n    movementArbiter->Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game loop or tick handler.
    It's important to note that the 'diff' parameter represents the time elapsed since
    the last update in milliseconds, which affects movement calculations and timing-sensitive
    operations. The MovementArbiter may perform different actions based on the current
    state of the entity it manages.
