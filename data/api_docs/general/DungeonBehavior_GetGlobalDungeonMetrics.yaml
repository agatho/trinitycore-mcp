  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: GetGlobalDungeonMetrics
  signature: DungeonMetrics DungeonBehavior::GetGlobalDungeonMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves global dungeon metrics for the current dungeon instance.
  description: The GetGlobalDungeonMetrics method returns a DungeonMetrics structure
    containing aggregated statistics and performance data for the active dungeon instance.
    This includes information such as completion times, player participation rates,
    difficulty modifiers, and other relevant metrics that are tracked globally across
    all players in the dungeon. The returned data is typically used for reporting,
    analytics, or adjusting game balance based on real-world player behavior within
    the dungeon environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A DungeonMetrics object containing global statistics for the current dungeon
    instance. This structure includes fields such as average completion time, number
    of participants, success rates, and other aggregate performance indicators relevant
    to the dungeon's gameplay mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'DungeonMetrics metrics = dungeonBehavior->GetGlobalDungeonMetrics();

      printf("Average Completion Time: %f seconds\n", metrics.averageCompletionTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Analyzing Dungeon Performance
    code: "DungeonMetrics metrics = dungeonBehavior->GetGlobalDungeonMetrics();\n\
      if (metrics.successRate > 0.75f)\n{\n    printf(\"Dungeon is performing well\
      \ with %f success rate\\n\", metrics.successRate);\n}\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"\
      Dungeon may need balancing - success rate: %f\\n\", metrics.successRate);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses global dungeon statistics that are maintained by the
    server and may be updated periodically. The returned data reflects cumulative
    metrics from all players who have participated in the current dungeon instance
    since it was last reset or initialized.
  warnings: The DungeonMetrics structure should not be modified directly as it represents
    read-only global state. Modifications to this data should be handled through appropriate
    game logic systems rather than direct access.
