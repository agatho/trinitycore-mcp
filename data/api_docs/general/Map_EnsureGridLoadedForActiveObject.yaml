  class: Map
  method: EnsureGridLoadedForActiveObject
  signature: void Map::EnsureGridLoadedForActiveObject(const int & param0, const WorldObject
    * object)
documentation:
  brief: Ensures that the grid containing the specified WorldObject is loaded and
    active.
  description: This method guarantees that the grid in which the provided WorldObject
    resides is loaded into memory and marked as active. It is typically used to prevent
    issues where objects might be referenced before their containing grid has been
    initialized or loaded. The method checks if the grid is already loaded, and if
    not, it triggers the loading process for that specific grid. This ensures that
    all object-related operations within that grid can proceed without encountering
    missing grid data errors.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An integer parameter representing a grid identifier or coordinate
      value used to determine which grid should be loaded.
  - name: object
    description: A pointer to the WorldObject whose containing grid must be ensured
      loaded. This object's position determines the target grid.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Ensure Grid Loaded for Player Object
    code: 'Map* map = player->GetMap();

      WorldObject* obj = player;

      map->EnsureGridLoadedForActiveObject(gridX, obj);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Object Movement Context
    code: "void HandlePlayerMove(Player* player) {\n    Map* map = player->GetMap();\n\
      \    if (map && player->IsInWorld()) {\n        int gridX = player->GetGridX();\n\
      \        map->EnsureGridLoadedForActiveObject(gridX, player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is critical for maintaining consistency in the game world's spatial
    data structure. It should be called before performing operations that require
    access to grid-specific data or when moving objects between grids. The implementation
    may involve locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety during grid loading.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid WorldObject pointer can lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the object is valid and in the world before invoking this
    function. Also, excessive calls to this method might impact performance due to
    repeated grid checks or loading operations.
