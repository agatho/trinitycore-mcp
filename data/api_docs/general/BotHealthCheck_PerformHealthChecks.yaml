documentation:
  brief: Performs health checks on all active bot characters in the game world.
  description: The PerformHealthChecks method iterates through all active bot characters
    and evaluates their current health status. It determines whether bots need to
    be healed, resuscitated, or have their health restored based on predefined thresholds
    and conditions. This method is typically called periodically by the game loop
    to maintain optimal bot character states and ensure proper gameplay experience
    for players interacting with bots. The method does not require any specific preconditions
    but assumes that bot characters are properly initialized and registered within
    the system.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 currentTime)\n{\n    // Other update logic...\n\
      \    botHealthCheck.PerformHealthChecks(currentTime);\n    // Other update logic...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from the main game loop or periodic
    update system. It performs checks on all registered bots without blocking the
    main thread. The implementation uses internal bot state tracking and health thresholds
    defined in configuration files.
