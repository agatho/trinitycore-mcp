  class: AuctionManager
  method: RecordBidPlaced
  signature: void AuctionManager::RecordBidPlaced(int botGuid, uint64 bidAmount)
documentation:
  brief: Records a bid placement for an auction item in the auction house system.
  description: The RecordBidPlaced method is used to log and process a bid placed
    by a bot on an auction item. This method updates internal auction state, tracks
    bid history, and ensures proper handling of bid amounts against existing bids.
    It integrates with the broader auction management system to maintain consistency
    between player actions and in-game auction mechanics. The method does not directly
    interact with the database but prepares necessary data structures for subsequent
    processing or persistence.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot placing the bid. This value
      must correspond to a valid bot character in the game world.
  - name: bidAmount
    description: The amount of gold the bot is bidding for the auction item. Must
      be greater than or equal to the current highest bid, or the minimum bid threshold
      if no bids exist yet.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bid Recording
    code: 'AuctionManager* auctionMgr = sAuctionMgr;

      auctionMgr->RecordBidPlaced(12345, 100000); // Bot with GUID 12345 places a
      bid of 100g'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Multiple Bids
    code: "AuctionManager* auctionMgr = sAuctionMgr;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)\n\
      {\n    uint64 bidAmount = 50000 + (i * 10000);\n    auctionMgr->RecordBidPlaced(12345\
      \ + i, bidAmount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the auction house system when
    a bot places a bid. It assumes that all validation checks (such as bid amount
    validity and player eligibility) have already been performed before calling this
    function.
  warnings: Ensure that botGuid corresponds to an actual bot character; otherwise,
    unexpected behavior may occur during auction processing. Also, bidAmount must
    be validated against the current auction state to prevent invalid bids from being
    recorded.
