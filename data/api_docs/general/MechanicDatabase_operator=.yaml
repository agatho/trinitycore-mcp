documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one MechanicDatabase object to another
  description: The operator= method performs a deep copy assignment of a MechanicDatabase
    object, transferring all internal data and state from the source object to the
    target object. This is a fundamental assignment operator that ensures proper memory
    management and data integrity when copying MechanicDatabase instances. In the
    context of TrinityCore's game mechanics system, this operation allows for seamless
    transfer of mechanic-related data between database instances, which may include
    spell effects, aura states, or other gameplay modifiers. The method follows standard
    C++ copy assignment semantics with proper self-assignment handling.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source MechanicDatabase object to be copied from. This parameter
      must be a valid, initialized MechanicDatabase instance.
  returns: A reference to the current MechanicDatabase object (this) after the assignment
    has been completed. This enables method chaining for consecutive assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Usage
    code: 'MechanicDatabase db1;

      MechanicDatabase db2 = db1; // Uses copy constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      db2 = db1; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Method Chaining Example
    code: 'MechanicDatabase db1, db2, db3;

      // Chain multiple assignments

      db3 = db2 = db1;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements deep copying to prevent shared memory references
    between objects. The implementation should handle self-assignment properly to
    avoid memory corruption or undefined behavior. As a core database class, it may
    involve locking mechanisms or thread safety considerations depending on how it's
    used in the TrinityCore architecture.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning large MechanicDatabase objects as deep copying
    can be computationally expensive. Ensure that the source object is properly initialized
    before assignment to avoid undefined behavior. Self-assignment handling is critical
    for memory safety.
