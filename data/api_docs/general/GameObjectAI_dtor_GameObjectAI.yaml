documentation:
  brief: Destroys the GameObjectAI instance and performs necessary cleanup operations.
  description: The GameObjectAI destructor is automatically invoked when a GameObjectAI
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any resources allocated by the GameObjectAI instance, including releasing
    memory and unregistering from game systems if needed. In the context of TrinityCore's
    architecture, this destructor is part of the GameObject's AI lifecycle management
    and is called during the destruction of the associated GameObject. It typically
    handles cleanup tasks such as removing references to other objects, clearing internal
    data structures, and ensuring no dangling pointers remain in the system.

  - title: Automatic Destruction
    code: 'GameObject* go = ...; // Assume a GameObject is created

      // When ''go'' goes out of scope or is deleted, its AI destructor is automatically
      called

      // No explicit call to ~GameObjectAI() is needed'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when an object is
    destroyed. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless implementing
    custom memory management or smart pointers. The GameObjectAI class inherits from
    the base AI system, so cleanup may involve calling parent destructors as well.
