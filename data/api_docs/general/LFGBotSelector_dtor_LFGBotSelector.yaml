documentation:
  brief: Destroys an LFGBotSelector instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the LFGBotSelector class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the instance. This method
    ensures that when an LFGBotSelector object goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted, all internal data structures are properly deallocated to prevent memory
    leaks. In the context of TrinityCore's LFG (Looking For Group) system, this destructor
    may handle cleanup of bot-related data structures used for group matching and
    selection logic. The method does not take any parameters and performs no return
    operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of LFGBotSelector instance
    code: 'LFGBotSelector* selector = new LFGBotSelector();

      // ... use the selector ...

      delete selector; // Triggers ~LFGBotSelector()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a standard C++ destructor and should be called automatically by the
    runtime when an object's lifetime ends. Developers should not manually invoke
    this destructor unless implementing custom memory management patterns.
