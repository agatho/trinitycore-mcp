documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the object is a unit (player or creature) by checking
    its type
  description: The IsUnit method checks if the current Object instance represents
    a unit, which includes both players and creatures. This method is essential for
    distinguishing between different types of game objects in TrinityCore's object
    hierarchy. It returns true when the object is either a player or a creature, and
    false otherwise. The method is commonly used in game logic to determine if an
    object can be interacted with as a unit, such as when checking target validity
    or performing actions that require unit-based interaction.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the object is a unit (player or creature), false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the object belongs to the unit type category in TrinityCore's
    object system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (object->IsUnit()) {\n    // Perform unit-specific actions\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with conditional logic
    code: "Object* target = GetTarget();\nif (target && target->IsUnit()) {\n    //\
      \ Handle unit-based interaction\n    // e.g., attack, cast spells, or interact\
      \ with player/creature\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is implemented using dynamic_cast and relies on the object's
    type information stored in the game world. It should be used carefully as it may
    impact performance if called frequently in tight loops. The method is thread-safe
    as long as the object's type remains consistent during execution.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method in performance-critical code sections without
    proper optimization, as it involves type checking that can add overhead. Also
    note that this method only returns true for player and creature objects; other
    types like GameObject or Item will return false.
