  class: BotAI
  method: OnAuctionEvent
  signature: void BotAI::OnAuctionEvent(const AuctionEvent & event)
documentation:
  brief: Handles auction events for bot AI, processing notifications when auction
    items are added, updated, or removed.
  description: The OnAuctionEvent method is a callback function within the BotAI class
    that processes auction-related events in the World of Warcraft TrinityCore environment.
    This method is invoked whenever an auction event occurs, such as when an item
    is listed on the auction house, updated, or removed. It allows bot AI to react
    dynamically to changes in the auction market, enabling bots to make informed decisions
    about bidding, listing items, or adjusting their economic strategies based on
    current auction data. The method receives a constant reference to an AuctionEvent
    object containing details about the event type and affected item.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: A constant reference to an AuctionEvent object that contains information
      about the auction event, including event type (add, update, remove), item details,
      and relevant auction data.
  returns: null

    code: "void BotAI::OnAuctionEvent(const AuctionEvent& event) {\n    switch (event.GetType())\
      \ {\n        case AUCTION_EVENT_ADDED:\n            // Process new auction item\n\
      \            Log(\"New auction added: \" + event.GetItem()->GetTemplate()->GetName());\n\
      \            break;\n        case AUCTION_EVENT_UPDATED:\n            // Handle\
      \ updated auction\n            Log(\"Auction updated: \" + event.GetItem()->GetTemplate()->GetName());\n\
      \            break;\n        case AUCTION_EVENT_REMOVED:\n            // Handle\
      \ removed auction\n            Log(\"Auction removed: \" + event.GetItem()->GetTemplate()->GetName());\n\
      \            break;\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is typically called from the auction house system's internal
    event dispatcher. Developers should ensure that any heavy processing within this
    function does not block the main game thread, as it may be invoked synchronously
    during auction house operations.
  warnings: Improper handling of auction events might lead to inconsistent bot behavior
    or memory leaks if event data is not properly managed. Avoid performing blocking
    operations or complex computations directly in this method.
