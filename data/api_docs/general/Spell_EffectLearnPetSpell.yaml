  brief: Learn a pet spell from a spell effect.
  description: This method handles the process of learning a pet spell when triggered
    by a spell effect. It typically occurs during spell casting or when a player receives
    a new pet through a spell. The method ensures that the pet's spell is properly
    added to the pet's spellbook, allowing the pet to use the learned spell. This
    functionality is commonly used in conjunction with pet-related spells such as
    summoning or training pets.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void Spell::EffectLearnPetSpell() {\n    // Implementation would handle\
      \ pet spell learning\n    // This method is called when a spell effect triggers\
      \ pet spell learning\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely involves checking if the caster has a pet, and if so, adding
    the spell to the pet's spellbook. Implementation details may vary based on the
    specific spell being used.
  warnings: This method should only be called when a pet is present or when the spell
    effect explicitly requires a pet to be learned. Improper usage could result in
    invalid spell learning or missing pet spells.
