  method: GetInterruptibleRate
  signature: float DetectionMetrics::GetInterruptibleRate() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the interruptible rate of a detection metric.
  description: The GetInterruptibleRate method computes the probability or percentage
    at which a detection event can be interrupted. This is commonly used in game mechanics
    to determine how often an ongoing detection process (such as a spell or ability)
    can be disrupted by external factors like movement, damage, or other interrupts.
    The value returned represents a normalized rate typically expressed as a float
    between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 indicates no chance of interruption and 1.0 indicates
    complete certainty of interruption. This method is read-only and does not modify
    any internal state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A floating-point value representing the interruptible rate, typically ranging
    from 0.0 (no interruption possible) to 1.0 (fully interruptible).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'DetectionMetrics metrics;

      float interruptRate = metrics.GetInterruptibleRate();

      std::cout << "Interruptible Rate: " << interruptRate << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger detection or spell interruption system
    in TrinityCore. It may be influenced by various factors such as player class,
    talents, buffs, or debuffs that affect interruptibility.
