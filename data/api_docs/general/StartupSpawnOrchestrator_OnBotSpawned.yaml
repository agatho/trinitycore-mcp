  brief: Handles post-spawn initialization logic for bot entities within the TrinityCore
    server environment
  description: The OnBotSpawned method is invoked when a bot entity has been successfully
    spawned and initialized within the World of Warcraft server. This method serves
    as a callback mechanism that allows the StartupSpawnOrchestrator to perform necessary
    setup operations, such as initializing bot behavior, assigning roles, configuring
    AI parameters, or establishing initial state conditions. The method ensures that
    all required systems are properly synchronized with the newly created bot instance
    before it becomes active in the game world. It typically executes after the core
    spawning process but before the bot is made available for gameplay interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spawn handler
    code: "void MySpawnHandler::HandleBotSpawn()\n{\n    // Bot has been spawned\n\
      \    m_orchestrator.OnBotSpawned();\n    // Continue with additional initialization\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom bot AI system
    code: "class CustomBotAI : public BotAI\n{\npublic:\n    void OnSpawned() override\n\
      \    {\n        m_orchestrator.OnBotSpawned();\n        // Initialize custom\
      \ behavior after base spawn logic\n        SetupCustomBehavior();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the server's core spawning pipeline
    and should not be invoked manually unless implementing custom spawn logic. The
    method assumes that all basic bot initialization has already occurred and focuses
    on higher-level orchestration tasks. It may involve thread synchronization if
    multiple bots are being spawned concurrently.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly during bot creation as it may interfere
    with the normal spawning sequence. Ensure that any custom logic implemented in
    this method does not block the main server thread for extended periods, as this
    could cause performance degradation.
