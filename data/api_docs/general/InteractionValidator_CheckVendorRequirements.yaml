  class: InteractionValidator
  method: CheckVendorRequirements
  signature: bool InteractionValidator::CheckVendorRequirements(::Player * bot, ::Creature
    * vendor) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player meets all requirements to interact with a vendor.
  description: The CheckVendorRequirements method validates whether a given player
    character has met all necessary conditions to successfully interact with a vendor
    NPC. This includes checking for proper faction standing, level requirements, quest
    completion status, and any other game-specific constraints that might prevent
    the player from purchasing items or accessing vendor services. The method returns
    true if all requirements are satisfied and false otherwise. This validation is
    typically performed before allowing vendor interactions to ensure game balance
    and logical progression.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character attempting
      to interact with the vendor.
  - name: vendor
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the vendor NPC with which
      the player is attempting to interact.
  returns: Returns true if the player meets all vendor interaction requirements, false
    otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that the player cannot
    currently access the vendor's services due to unmet conditions such as insufficient
    level, bad faction status, or missing required quests.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vendor Interaction Check
    code: "if (validator.CheckVendorRequirements(player, vendor)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with vendor interaction\n    player->GetSession()->SendListInventory(vendor->GetGUID());\n\
      } else {\n    // Inform player they cannot interact with vendor\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      You do not meet the requirements to interact with this vendor.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in AI Behavior
    code: "class VendorAI {\npublic:\n    bool CanInteractWithVendor(Player* bot,\
      \ Creature* vendor) {\n        return InteractionValidator().CheckVendorRequirements(bot,\
      \ vendor);\n    }\n};\n\n// Usage in AI decision making\nif (vendorAI.CanInteractWithVendor(player,\
      \ npc)) {\n    // Perform vendor actions\n    player->GetSession()->SendListInventory(npc->GetGUID());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs multiple checks internally including faction
    validation, level thresholds, quest state verification, and possibly item or currency
    requirements. It may also cache results for performance optimization in frequent
    interactions. The implementation should be thread-safe as it's expected to be
    called from various game threads during player interactions.
  warnings: Ensure that both the bot and vendor parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method; passing null pointers will likely result in crashes or undefined
    behavior. Be aware that this check might be bypassed in certain debugging or admin
    scenarios, so it should not be relied upon for critical security checks.
