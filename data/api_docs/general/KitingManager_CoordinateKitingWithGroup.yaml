  class: KitingManager
  method: CoordinateKitingWithGroup
  signature: void KitingManager::CoordinateKitingWithGroup(const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates kiting behavior for a specified group within the KitingManager.
  description: The CoordinateKitingWithGroup method manages and synchronizes kiting
    strategies across members of a specified group in TrinityCore. This method ensures
    that all group members follow consistent kiting patterns, which is essential for
    effective mob control and resource management during combat scenarios. It typically
    handles pathfinding adjustments, positioning coordination, and behavior synchronization
    to maintain optimal kiting efficiency. The method operates on the assumption that
    group members are within a defined proximity and that their individual kiting
    behaviors can be harmonized for collective benefit.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: An integer identifier representing the group whose kiting behavior
      will be coordinated. This value typically corresponds to a valid group ID within
      the TrinityCore instance, usually ranging from 0 to the maximum number of groups
      supported by the server configuration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Kiting Coordination
    code: 'KitingManager kitingMgr;

      int groupId = 1;

      kitingMgr.CoordinateKitingWithGroup(groupId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Group Kiting Based on Player Input
    code: "KitingManager kitingMgr;\nPlayer* player = ...; // Assume player is valid\n\
      if (player->GetGroup()) {\n    int groupId = player->GetGroup()->GetId();\n\
      \    kitingMgr.CoordinateKitingWithGroup(groupId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal group management systems and may
    require that the specified group is active and has members present. It's recommended
    to verify group validity before calling this function to prevent unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method on an invalid or empty group ID may result in undefined
    behavior or errors. Ensure that the group exists and contains at least one member
    before invoking this function.
