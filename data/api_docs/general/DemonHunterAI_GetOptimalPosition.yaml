api:
  class: DemonHunterAI
  method: GetOptimalPosition
  signature: int DemonHunterAI::GetOptimalPosition(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal positioning for a Demon Hunter AI to maximize
    combat effectiveness.
  description: The GetOptimalPosition method determines the best location for a Demon
    Hunter AI to position itself during combat. This method evaluates various factors
    such as target distance, line of sight, threat level, and environmental obstacles
    to compute an optimal position that enhances the AI's ability to deal damage while
    maintaining survivability. It is typically used in conjunction with movement and
    positioning logic within the DemonHunterAI class to ensure strategic placement
    during encounters. The returned value represents a positional index or identifier
    that can be used by the AI to execute movement commands.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or position
      index. This parameter is used to evaluate positioning relative to the target.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the optimal position index for the
    Demon Hunter AI. A positive value indicates a valid position, while zero or negative
    values may indicate failure or invalid targeting conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GetOptimalPosition
    code: "int targetId = 12345;\nint optimalPos = ai->GetOptimalPosition(&targetId);\n\
      if (optimalPos > 0)\n{\n    // Move to the calculated optimal position\n   \
      \ ai->MoveToPosition(optimalPos);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs complex pathfinding and threat assessment calculations.
    Performance may be impacted during high-combat scenarios with multiple targets.
    The exact positioning algorithm is implementation-dependent and may vary based
    on the current combat state.
  warnings: The target parameter must point to a valid target identifier; otherwise,
    the method may return unexpected results or fail. Ensure that the AI's target
    is properly initialized before calling this method.
