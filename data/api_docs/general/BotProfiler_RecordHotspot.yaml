api:
  class: BotProfiler
  method: RecordHotspot
  signature: void BotProfiler::RecordHotspot(const PerformanceHotspot & hotspot, uint64_t
    sessionId)
documentation:
  brief: Records a performance hotspot for the specified session ID.
  description: The RecordHotspot method logs performance-related bottlenecks or areas
    of concern within the bot's execution flow. It associates these hotspots with
    a specific session identifier, allowing for detailed profiling and analysis of
    bot behavior over time. This functionality is crucial for identifying inefficient
    code paths, resource contention, or other performance issues that may affect gameplay
    or server load. The method does not return any value but stores the hotspot data
    internally for later retrieval or reporting.
  parameters:
  - name: hotspot
    description: A reference to a PerformanceHotspot object containing details about
      the performance bottleneck, including location, duration, and severity metrics.
  - name: sessionId
    description: A unique identifier representing the session during which the hotspot
      was detected. Used for grouping and analyzing related performance data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Hotspot Recording
    code: 'PerformanceHotspot hotspot;

      hotspot.location = "AI::Update";

      hotspot.duration = 1500;

      hotspot.severity = 3;

      botProfiler.RecordHotspot(hotspot, 123456789ULL);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the bot profiler system when
    performance thresholds are exceeded. It's designed to be lightweight and non-blocking
    to avoid impacting real-time gameplay.
