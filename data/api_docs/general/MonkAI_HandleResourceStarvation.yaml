documentation:
  brief: Handles the logic when a Monk's resource (such as energy or chi) is depleted
    or running low.
  description: The HandleResourceStarvation method in the MonkAI class manages the
    behavior and actions taken when a monk's resource pool reaches critically low
    levels or becomes empty. This typically involves triggering specific abilities,
    adjusting combat strategies, or switching to alternative resource management behaviors
    to ensure optimal gameplay performance. The method may also handle visual or auditory
    feedback to the player indicating resource depletion. It is an integral part of
    the AI decision-making process for monks in TrinityCore's NPC combat system.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n\
      \    if (m_resourceLow)\n        HandleResourceStarvation();\n    // ... rest\
      \ of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called during AI update cycles when resource levels
    fall below a defined threshold. It may interact with other monk-specific methods
    like CheckChi(), UseAbility(), or SwitchToDefensiveMode(). The implementation
    details depend on the specific monk class (e.g., Brewmaster, Windwalker) and their
    unique resource mechanics.
  warnings: Improper handling of resource starvation can lead to AI behavior that
    feels unnatural or breaks game balance. Ensure this method does not cause infinite
    loops or abrupt state changes without proper checks. Also, verify that resource
    depletion is handled consistently across different monk specializations.
