  class: AIDecisionProfiler
  method: UpdateBotSpecialization
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::UpdateBotSpecialization(uint32_t botGuid, uint8_t
    newSpecialization)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the specialization of a bot identified by its GUID in the AI decision
    profiler system.
  description: The UpdateBotSpecialization method is used to modify or set the specialization
    type for a specific bot within the AI decision profiling framework. This function
    allows the system to track and adjust how different bots behave based on their
    assigned specializations, which can influence their decision-making processes
    during gameplay. The method takes a unique identifier for the bot and assigns
    it a new specialization value. It is typically invoked when a bot's role or class
    changes dynamically during runtime, ensuring that profiling data accurately reflects
    current behavior patterns.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The globally unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose specialization
      is to be updated. This value uniquely identifies the specific bot instance within
      the TrinityCore world.
  - name: newSpecialization
    description: An 8-bit unsigned integer representing the new specialization type
      for the bot. Valid values are typically defined by game constants or enums related
      to class specializations (e.g., 0 = None, 1 = Combat, 2 = Healing, etc.).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update a bot's specialization to Combat
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      profiler.UpdateBotSpecialization(botGuid, 1); // Set specialization to Combat'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update multiple bots' specializations in a loop
    code: "AIDecisionProfiler profiler;\nstd::vector<uint32_t> botGuids = {1001, 1002,\
      \ 1003};\nfor (auto guid : botGuids)\n{\n    profiler.UpdateBotSpecialization(guid,\
      \ 2); // Set all to Healing specialization\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI profiling subsystem and should be called carefully
    to avoid performance bottlenecks. Ensure that bot GUIDs are valid before calling
    this function. The specialization values must align with predefined game constants
    or enums to maintain consistency in AI behavior tracking.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid botGuid may result in undefined behavior
    or corruption of internal profiling data structures. Always validate the existence
    and validity of the bot before updating its specialization.
