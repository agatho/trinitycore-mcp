  class: RoleBasedCombatPositioning
  method: CalculateTankPosition
  signature: int RoleBasedCombatPositioning::CalculateTankPosition(Player * tank,
    const CombatPositionContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal positional coordinate for a tank based
    on combat context and role requirements.
  description: The CalculateTankPosition method determines the most advantageous location
    for a tank player within a combat scenario. It evaluates various factors such
    as enemy positioning, threat levels, and group dynamics to compute an ideal tank
    position that maximizes survivability and effectiveness. This method is typically
    used in dynamic combat systems where positioning plays a critical role in raid
    or dungeon encounters. The method requires a valid Player object representing
    the tank and a CombatPositionContext that provides situational data about the
    current battlefield state.
  parameters:
  - name: tank
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the tank character for
      whom the position is being calculated. Must be a valid player instance with
      proper combat state.
  - name: context
    description: Reference to a CombatPositionContext structure containing contextual
      data about current combat state, including enemy positions, threat levels, and
      group configuration.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated tank position index
    or identifier. A positive value typically indicates a valid position, while negative
    values may indicate errors or invalid states such as insufficient context data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Tank Position Calculation
    code: "Player* myTank = ...; // Get tank player\nCombatPositionContext ctx = ...;\
      \ // Initialize combat context\nint position = roleBasedCombat->CalculateTankPosition(myTank,\
      \ ctx);\nif (position >= 0) {\n    // Use calculated position for tank movement\n\
      \    printf(\"Optimal tank position: %d\\n\", position);\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ error case\n    printf(\"Failed to calculate tank position\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Tank Positioning in Raid Encounter
    code: "void ExecuteRaidStrategy(Player* tank, Group* group) {\n    CombatPositionContext\
      \ context;\n    context.InitializeFromGroup(group);\n    \n    RoleBasedCombatPositioning\
      \ positioning;\n    int optimalPosition = positioning.CalculateTankPosition(tank,\
      \ context);\n    \n    if (optimalPosition >= 0) {\n        // Move tank to\
      \ calculated position\n        tank->TeleportTo(optimalPosition);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed for use in combat scenarios where positioning significantly
    impacts encounter success. The implementation may involve complex pathfinding
    algorithms and threat assessment calculations. Performance considerations include
    avoiding frequent recalculations during active combat, as this could impact frame
    rate.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player object passed is valid and currently in combat
    state. Passing a null pointer or an inactive player will likely result in undefined
    behavior. The CombatPositionContext must be properly initialized with relevant
    data for meaningful results.
