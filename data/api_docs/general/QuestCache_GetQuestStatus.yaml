documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current status of a specified quest for the player
  description: The GetQuestStatus method fetches the current state of a given quest
    from the player's quest cache. It returns true if the quest exists in the cache
    and false if it does not. The method populates the provided QuestStatus reference
    with the relevant quest information, which typically includes whether the quest
    is incomplete, complete, rewarded, or otherwise marked in the player's quest log.
    This function is commonly used by quest-related systems to determine what actions
    a player can take regarding a specific quest, such as whether they can turn in
    the quest or if it needs to be tracked.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to retrieve status for. This value
      must correspond to a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: status
    description: A reference to a QuestStatus object that will be populated with the
      quest's current state upon successful retrieval.
  returns: True if the quest was found in the cache and the status was successfully
    retrieved; false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "QuestStatus status;\nif (questCache.GetQuestStatus(12345, status)) {\n\
      \    // Quest exists, process status\n    switch (status) {\n        case QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE:\n\
      \            // Handle completed quest\n            break;\n        case QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE:\n\
      \            // Handle incomplete quest\n            break;\n    }\n} else {\n\
      \    // Quest not found in cache\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking if a quest is complete
    code: "QuestStatus status;\nif (questCache.GetQuestStatus(67890, status) && status\
      \ == QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE) {\n    // Quest is complete, proceed with reward\
      \ logic\n    player->AddQuestReward(67890);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on cached quest data and may not reflect real-time changes
    unless the cache has been updated. It should be used in contexts where cached
    quest information is sufficient for gameplay logic.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only works with quests already loaded into the
    player's quest cache. If a quest has not been interacted with yet, it might not
    be present in the cache and will return false.
