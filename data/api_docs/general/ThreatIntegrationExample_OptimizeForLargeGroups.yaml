  class: ThreatIntegrationExample
  method: OptimizeForLargeGroups
  signature: void ThreatIntegrationExample::OptimizeForLargeGroups(ThreatCoordinator
    * coordinator, uint32 botCount)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes threat management for large groups of bots using the provided coordinator.
  description: The OptimizeForLargeGroups method adjusts internal threat handling
    mechanisms to efficiently manage high numbers of bots in a group scenario. It
    configures the ThreatCoordinator to scale its threat calculations and updates
    based on the specified bot count, ensuring optimal performance and accurate threat
    distribution across multiple entities. This method is particularly useful in scenarios
    involving large raid groups or bot-controlled parties where traditional threat
    management approaches may become inefficient.
  parameters:
  - name: coordinator
    description: Pointer to the ThreatCoordinator instance that will be optimized
      for large group handling. Must not be null.
  - name: botCount
    description: The number of bots in the group that threat management should be
      optimized for. Should be a positive integer representing the expected group
      size.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage with ThreatCoordinator
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator* coord = new ThreatCoordinator();

      example->OptimizeForLargeGroups(coord, 25);

      // Configures the coordinator for optimal performance with 25 bots'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in Group Management System
    code: "void SetupLargeGroupCombat()\n{\n    ThreatCoordinator* coordinator = sThreatMgr->GetThreatCoordinator();\n\
      \    ThreatIntegrationExample example;\n    example.OptimizeForLargeGroups(coordinator,\
      \ GetBotCount());\n}\n// Called when initializing combat for a large bot group"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the ThreatCoordinator to accommodate
    larger groups. It should be called before adding bots to the threat system to
    ensure proper initialization. The optimization is based on empirical data and
    may adjust internal thresholds for threat updates and recalculations.
  warnings: Calling this method with a very large botCount value may cause performance
    degradation due to increased memory allocation and processing overhead. Ensure
    that the ThreatCoordinator has sufficient resources before calling this method.
