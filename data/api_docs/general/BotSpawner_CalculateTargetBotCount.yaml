  class: BotSpawner
  method: CalculateTargetBotCount
  signature: uint32 BotSpawner::CalculateTargetBotCount(const int & zone) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the target number of bots for a specified zone based
    on configured spawn rules.
  description: The CalculateTargetBotCount method determines how many bots should
    be present in a given zone according to the bot spawner's configuration settings.
    This method is typically used during bot spawning cycles to decide the desired
    population count for a specific zone. It evaluates various factors such as zone
    difficulty, player density, and server load to compute an appropriate target number
    of bots. The result is a uint32 value representing the calculated target count
    that can be used by the spawner logic to maintain optimal bot distribution across
    zones.
  parameters:
  - name: zone
    description: An integer identifier representing the zone for which to calculate
      the target bot count. This typically corresponds to a zone ID or index used
      internally by the TrinityCore framework.
  returns: A uint32 value indicating the calculated target number of bots for the
    specified zone. Returns zero if no bots are configured for the zone or if the
    zone is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int zoneId = 1234;

      uint32 targetCount = botSpawner.CalculateTargetBotCount(zoneId);

      // targetCount now holds the number of bots that should be present in zone 1234'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Error Handling
    code: "int zoneId = GetPlayerZoneId();\nuint32 count = botSpawner.CalculateTargetBotCount(zoneId);\n\
      if (count > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with spawning bots\n    SpawnBots(count);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // No bots required for this zone\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"bot\", \"\
      No bots configured for zone {}\", zoneId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called during periodic bot management routines and
    may involve reading from configuration files or database entries that define bot
    population rules per zone. The calculation might take into account dynamic server
    conditions like current player activity, time of day, or event schedules.
  warnings: Ensure the zone parameter is valid before calling this method to avoid
    unexpected behavior. The returned value should not be used directly for spawning
    without considering existing bot counts and spawn limits.
