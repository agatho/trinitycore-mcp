  class: Pet
  method: SetGroupUpdateFlag
  signature: void Pet::SetGroupUpdateFlag(uint32 flag)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a group update flag for the pet, indicating that the pet's group data
    needs to be refreshed.
  description: The SetGroupUpdateFlag method is used to mark a pet as requiring an
    update to its group-related data within the World of Warcraft client. This typically
    occurs when changes are made to the pet's status, such as its health, mana, or
    other attributes that affect how it appears in the player's group interface. The
    flag signals to the game engine that the pet's information should be synchronized
    with the group members. This method is part of the internal mechanics that maintain
    consistency between the server and client for pet-related group data.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: The group update flag value to set. This is typically a bitmask representing
      different aspects of group data that require updating, such as health, mana,
      or status effects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a basic group update flag
    code: "Pet* myPet = player->GetPet();\nif (myPet)\n{\n    myPet->SetGroupUpdateFlag(GROUP_UPDATE_FLAG_FULL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting a specific group update flag for pet status
    code: "Pet* myPet = player->GetPet();\nif (myPet)\n{\n    myPet->SetGroupUpdateFlag(GROUP_UPDATE_FLAG_PET_HEALTH);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    pet state changes occur. Developers should not need to call this method directly
    unless implementing custom pet behavior or group synchronization logic. The flag
    parameter is usually a predefined constant from the GROUP_UPDATE_FLAG enumeration.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context may cause unexpected behavior
    in group synchronization. It's recommended to use this method only when necessary
    and after understanding the implications of setting specific flags. Improper usage
    can lead to visual inconsistencies in the pet's display within the group interface.
