documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the quest log, resetting all modified quest states.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with the quest log. This operation is typically used to indicate that all quest-related
    modifications have been processed and should no longer be marked as changed. In
    the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this method ensures that subsequent
    checks for quest state changes will not detect any pending updates until new changes
    occur. The method does not affect the actual quest data itself, only the tracking
    mechanism used to identify modified quests.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'QuestLog* questLog = player->GetQuestLog();

      questLog->ClearChangesMask();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly called after synchronizing quest data with the client
    or database to prevent redundant update operations. It's part of the internal
    state management system for tracking quest modifications.
