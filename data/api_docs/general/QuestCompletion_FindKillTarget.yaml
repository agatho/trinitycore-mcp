  class: QuestCompletion
  method: FindKillTarget
  signature: bool QuestCompletion::FindKillTarget(Player * bot, QuestObjectiveData
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and assigns a kill target for the specified bot player based on quest
    objectives.
  description: The FindKillTarget method is responsible for identifying an appropriate
    creature or NPC to kill in order to fulfill a quest objective. It takes a Player
    pointer representing the bot and a reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure
    that contains information about the current quest objective. The method evaluates
    the quest data, determines the required kill target type (creature or NPC), and
    attempts to locate a suitable target within the bot's current zone or area. This
    functionality is commonly used in automated quest completion systems where bots
    need to identify and engage targets without player intervention. The method returns
    true if a valid target was found and assigned, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that needs to find
      a kill target. This parameter must not be null and should represent an active
      player character with valid quest data.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing information
      about the current quest objective requiring a kill target. The structure should
      contain valid objective data including target type, count, and creature ID if
      applicable.
  returns: Returns true if a suitable kill target was successfully found and assigned
    to the bot's quest completion logic; returns false if no appropriate target could
    be located or if the method failed to process the objective.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest completion
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nQuestObjectiveData objective;\nobjective.type = QUEST_OBJECTIVE_KILL;\n\
      objective.targetEntry = 12345;\nobjective.requiredCount = 5;\n\nif (QuestCompletion::FindKillTarget(bot,\
      \ objective)) {\n    // Target found, proceed with quest completion logic\n\
      \    bot->GetSession()->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Found target for quest completion\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // No target found\n    bot->GetSession()->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      No kill target found\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically part of a larger automated quest completion system
    and relies on proper quest data initialization. The method may perform zone-based
    searches for targets, so performance could be affected in areas with many creatures.
    It assumes that the bot player has valid quest data loaded and that the objective
    structure contains correct target information.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the bot is in a valid state with
    active quest data. Calling it without proper initialization of the objective data
    or with an invalid bot pointer may lead to undefined behavior. The method does
    not handle all edge cases, such as when multiple targets exist but none are suitable
    for the current quest.
