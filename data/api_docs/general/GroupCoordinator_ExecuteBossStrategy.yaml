  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: ExecuteBossStrategy
  signature: void GroupCoordinator::ExecuteBossStrategy(Creature * boss)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the boss strategy for a given creature within the group coordination
    system.
  description: The ExecuteBossStrategy method is responsible for triggering and managing
    the strategic behavior of a boss creature within a group coordination context.
    This method likely coordinates with other group members, handles encounter phases,
    and ensures proper execution of boss-specific AI behaviors. It serves as a central
    point for initiating or updating the tactical approach during boss encounters,
    potentially involving mechanics such as phase transitions, ability usage, or group
    synchronization. The method operates on a provided Creature pointer, which represents
    the boss entity in the world.
  parameters:
  - name: boss
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the boss for which the
      strategy should be executed. Must not be null and must represent a valid boss
      creature within the group context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Boss Encounter
    code: "void OnBossEnterCombat(Unit* who)\n{\n    if (Creature* boss = GetBoss())\n\
      \    {\n        groupCoordinator->ExecuteBossStrategy(boss);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger encounter management system and may
    interact with other components such as phase managers, AI state machines, or event
    handlers. It's important to ensure that the boss pointer passed is valid and represents
    an actual boss creature to prevent undefined behavior.
