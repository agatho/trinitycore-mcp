  class: ChatHandler
  method: ChatHandler
  signature: void ChatHandler::ChatHandler(ChatHandler && param0)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a ChatHandler instance with a moved parameter, setting up the
    handler for processing in-game chat commands.
  description: The ChatHandler constructor initializes a new instance of the ChatHandler
    class using a moved parameter. This method is typically used internally within
    TrinityCore's command system to set up a chat handler object that can process
    and execute in-game commands. The handler is responsible for interpreting player
    input, validating permissions, and executing appropriate actions based on the
    command issued. It integrates with the core game mechanics to manage player interactions
    through the chat interface and command system.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to a ChatHandler object that will be moved into
      this instance. This parameter contains the state and configuration data from
      an existing ChatHandler instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Moving a ChatHandler instance
    code: 'ChatHandler handler1(session);

      ChatHandler handler2 = std::move(handler1); // Moves handler1 into handler2'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used in scenarios where ChatHandler objects
    need to be efficiently transferred between contexts without unnecessary copying.
    The move semantics ensure optimal performance when handling command processing
    in high-frequency game environments.
