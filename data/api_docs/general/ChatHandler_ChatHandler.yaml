  class: ChatHandler
  method: ChatHandler
  signature: void ChatHandler::ChatHandler()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new ChatHandler instance for processing in-game chat commands.
  description: The ChatHandler constructor initializes a new instance of the ChatHandler
    class, which is responsible for processing and handling in-game chat commands
    issued by players. This method sets up the necessary internal state and context
    required to interpret player input, validate permissions, and execute appropriate
    actions based on the command structure. The ChatHandler is typically instantiated
    when a player sends a chat message that begins with a command prefix (such as
    '/') and is used to route the command to the correct handler within the TrinityCore
    framework. It establishes the connection between the player's input and the server's
    command processing system, ensuring proper execution of administrative and gameplay
    commands.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a ChatHandler instance
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is valid

      ChatHandler handler(player);

      // The handler can now process chat commands from this player'
    language: cpp
  notes: The ChatHandler constructor does not perform any command processing itself
    - it merely initializes the object. Actual command execution occurs through other
    methods like HandleCommand or similar dispatch functions. The instance maintains
    a reference to the associated player object and uses it to determine permissions,
    send responses, and access player-specific data.
  warnings: Care should be taken when creating ChatHandler instances directly, as
    improper initialization may lead to null pointer exceptions or incorrect command
    processing. The constructor requires a valid Player pointer to function correctly,
    and passing an invalid or null pointer will likely cause undefined behavior.
