  class: BotSpawnerOptimized
  method: operator=
  signature: BotSpawnerOptimized & BotSpawnerOptimized::operator=(const BotSpawnerOptimized
    & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one BotSpawnerOptimized object to another, performing
    a deep copy of all managed resources.
  description: The assignment operator for the BotSpawnerOptimized class performs
    a deep copy of all internal data members from the source object to the target
    object. This ensures that both objects maintain independent copies of their data,
    preventing unintended side effects when modifying either instance. The method
    handles memory management properly by releasing any existing resources in the
    target object before copying new ones. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework, this operation is commonly used when reconfiguring bot spawning parameters
    or transferring spawner configurations between different instances during runtime.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotSpawnerOptimized object whose contents will be copied
      to this instance. This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid
      initialized object.
  returns: A reference to the current BotSpawnerOptimized object (this) after the
    assignment has been completed, enabling chained assignment operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Example
    code: 'BotSpawnerOptimized spawner1;

      BotSpawnerOptimized spawner2 = spawner1; // Uses copy constructor

      spawner2 = spawner1; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'BotSpawnerOptimized spawner1, spawner2, spawner3;

      spawner1 = spawner2 = spawner3; // Chained assignment

      // All three objects now contain identical data'
    language: cpp
  notes: The implementation likely includes proper handling of dynamic memory allocation
    and deallocation to prevent memory leaks. This operator should be used carefully
    in performance-critical sections as deep copying may involve significant overhead
    depending on the internal structure of BotSpawnerOptimized.
  warnings: Ensure that the source object is properly initialized before assignment
    to avoid undefined behavior. Be cautious when using this operator in multithreaded
    environments without proper synchronization mechanisms.
