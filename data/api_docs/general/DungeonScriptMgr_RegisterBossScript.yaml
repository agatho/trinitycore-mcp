  signature: void DungeonScriptMgr::RegisterBossScript(uint32 bossEntry, DungeonScript
    * script)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a dungeon script for a specific boss entry in the DungeonScriptMgr.
  description: The RegisterBossScript method associates a DungeonScript instance with
    a specific boss entry ID within the DungeonScriptMgr. This allows the game to
    properly initialize and manage boss-specific scripts during dungeon encounters.
    The method is typically called during server initialization or script loading
    phases to ensure that each boss in a dungeon has its corresponding scripted behavior
    registered. The registration process ensures that when a boss with the specified
    entry ID is spawned, the associated script will be automatically linked and executed.
  parameters:
  - name: bossEntry
    description: The unique identifier (entry ID) of the boss creature that this script
      should be associated with. This value corresponds to the creature_template.entry
      field in the database.
  - name: script
    description: A pointer to the DungeonScript instance that defines the behavior
      for the specified boss. This script will be used when encounters involving this
      boss occur during dungeon instances.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Boss Script Registration
    code: "class MyBossScript : public DungeonScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyBossScript()\
      \ : DungeonScript(\"MyBossScript\") {}\n    // Implementation details\n};\n\n\
      void RegisterCustomScripts()\n{\n    DungeonScriptMgr::instance()->RegisterBossScript(12345,\
      \ new MyBossScript());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during server startup or script initialization
    phase before any dungeons are created. The DungeonScript instance passed to this
    method will be managed by the DungeonScriptMgr and should not be deleted manually
    after registration. Multiple bosses can have their scripts registered using this
    method, but each boss entry ID should only map to one script instance.
  warnings: Do not register the same script instance multiple times for different
    boss entries as it may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the DungeonScript
    pointer is valid and properly initialized before calling this method. Avoid calling
    this method after dungeon instances have started, as it might not take effect
    for already running encounters.
