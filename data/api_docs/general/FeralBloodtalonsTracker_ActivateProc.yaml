  class: FeralBloodtalonsTracker
  method: ActivateProc
  signature: void FeralBloodtalonsTracker::ActivateProc(uint32 stacks)
documentation:
  brief: Activates the Feral Bloodtalons proc effect with the specified stack count.
  description: The ActivateProc method is responsible for triggering the Feral Bloodtalons
    ability's proc effect within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically
    sets internal state variables to indicate that the proc is active and may modify
    the affected unit's stats or apply visual effects. The stacks parameter determines
    how many times the proc effect should be applied, which can influence damage multipliers
    or other game mechanics related to the Feral Bloodtalons talent. This method is
    usually called when a player's attack triggers the proc condition, such as when
    landing a melee hit with a weapon that has the Feral Bloodtalons enchantment.
  parameters:
  - name: stacks
    description: The number of stacks to activate for the Feral Bloodtalons proc effect.
      Valid values are typically positive integers representing the number of active
      procs, usually ranging from 1 to 5 depending on the game mechanics and talent
      levels.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Proc Activation
    code: 'FeralBloodtalonsTracker tracker;

      tracker.ActivateProc(3); // Activates 3 stacks of Feral Bloodtalons proc effect'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Proc Activation
    code: "if (player->HasAura(SPELL_FERAL_BLOODTALONS_AURA))\n{\n    tracker.ActivateProc(player->GetAura(SPELL_FERAL_BLOODTALONS_AURA)->GetStackAmount());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal state variables within the FeralBloodtalonsTracker
    class to track active proc stacks. It may also trigger related events or callbacks
    in the TrinityCore system for visual effects, stat modifications, or cooldown
    management. The implementation should be thread-safe as it's likely called from
    combat handling code.
  warnings: Ensure that the stacks parameter is validated before calling this method
    to prevent invalid stack counts that could cause unexpected behavior or crashes.
    This method may not be safe to call outside of combat context without proper safeguards.
