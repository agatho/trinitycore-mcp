documentation:
  brief: Checks if a creature has a specific quest assigned.
  description: This method determines whether a creature has been assigned a particular
    quest, which is essential for managing quest-related interactions in World of
    Warcraft. It is commonly used during quest completion checks or when verifying
    if a creature can provide quest rewards. The method returns true if the quest
    is assigned to the creature and false otherwise, making it crucial for quest system
    logic within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature has the specified quest assigned, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the quest is active in the creature's quest log or if it's
    been assigned but not yet completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Check
    code: "if (creature->hasQuest(12345)) {\n    // Do something\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    such as 'GetQuestOffer' or 'HasQuestReward'. Performance-wise, it's a lightweight
    operation that checks internal quest tracking state. Thread safety depends on
    the implementation of the creature object itself.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in scenarios where multiple quests
    may be active simultaneously; ensure proper quest ID validation to avoid false
    positives.
