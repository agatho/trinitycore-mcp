  method: PrioritizeResourceSpenders
  signature: void MonkAI::PrioritizeResourceSpenders(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Prioritizes resource spenders for the Monk AI based on current combat state
    and available resources.
  description: The PrioritizeResourceSpenders method determines the optimal sequence
    of abilities to use for a Monk AI character, considering factors such as mana
    or energy levels, cooldowns, and combat requirements. This method is typically
    invoked during the AI's decision-making process to ensure efficient resource utilization
    and maximum damage output or survivability. It evaluates various monk abilities
    like Tiger Palm, Blackout Kick, and Spinning Crane Kick based on their current
    state and the target's health or status effects. The method modifies internal
    AI decision-making parameters but does not directly interact with the game world
    or affect the character's actual actions.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target index or identifier
      for which resource spenders are being prioritized. This value is used internally
      by the AI to determine which target to focus on when calculating ability priorities.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in Monk AI context
    code: "void exampleUsage() {\n    int targetIndex = 0;\n    monkAI->PrioritizeResourceSpenders(&targetIndex);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat decision loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI() {\n    if (me->IsInCombat()) {\n        int target\
      \ = GetTargetIndex();\n        PrioritizeResourceSpenders(&target);\n      \
      \  // Proceed with executing prioritized abilities\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal AI logic and should not be called directly
    from external modules. It relies on the AI's current state, including resource
    levels, cooldowns, and target information. The method assumes that a valid target
    exists and that the AI has access to necessary ability data.
  warnings: Do not call this method without ensuring that the target pointer points
    to a valid integer. Incorrect usage may lead to undefined behavior or crashes
    in the AI system. This method modifies internal AI state and should only be used
    within the context of the AI's main update loop.
