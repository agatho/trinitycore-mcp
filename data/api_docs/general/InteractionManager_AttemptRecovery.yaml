documentation:
  brief: Attempts to recover a bot player from an interaction state
  description: The AttemptRecovery method is designed to restore a bot player to a
    functional state after it has encountered an interaction-related issue or error.
    This method typically handles cleanup of temporary states, resets interaction
    flags, and ensures the bot can continue normal operation within the game environment.
    It may involve checking for valid player references, verifying the current interaction
    context, and performing necessary recovery actions such as reinitializing the
    bot's state machine or releasing held resources.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the recovery process was successful and the bot is now
    in a recoverable state; returns false if the recovery failed due to invalid input,
    missing references, or an inability to restore the bot to a usable condition.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of AttemptRecovery
    code: "if (interactionManager.AttemptRecovery(bot)) {\n    // Bot successfully\
      \ recovered\n    bot->SendChatMessage(CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM, LANG_BOT_RECOVERED);\n\
      } else {\n    // Recovery failed\n    bot->SendChatMessage(CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM,\
      \ LANG_BOT_RECOVERY_FAILED);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided Player pointer is valid and points
    to an active bot instance. It should only be called when the bot is in a known
    problematic interaction state. The recovery process may involve internal state
    resets, which could temporarily affect the bot's responsiveness or behavior during
    execution.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-bot player or a null pointer will likely
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the Player object passed
    to this method is indeed a valid bot instance before invoking the function.
