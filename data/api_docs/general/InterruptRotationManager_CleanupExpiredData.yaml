documentation:
  brief: Removes expired interrupt rotation data from the manager's internal storage.
  description: The CleanupExpiredData method is responsible for removing outdated
    or expired interrupt rotation entries from the InterruptRotationManager's internal
    data structures. This method ensures that the manager does not retain unnecessary
    data that has surpassed its valid time window, thereby maintaining optimal performance
    and memory usage. It typically iterates through stored interrupt rotations and
    removes those whose expiration time has passed. The method is commonly called
    during periodic cleanup routines or when the manager needs to refresh its state.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InterruptRotationManager* manager = sObjectAccessor->GetInterruptRotationManager();

      manager->CleanupExpiredData();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be invoked regularly to prevent accumulation of stale
    data. It is typically called as part of a periodic cleanup task or during server
    maintenance cycles.
