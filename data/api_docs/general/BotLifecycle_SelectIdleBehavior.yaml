  class: BotLifecycle
  method: SelectIdleBehavior
  signature: void BotLifecycle::SelectIdleBehavior()
documentation:
  brief: Selects an appropriate idle behavior for the bot based on current state and
    environment.
  description: The SelectIdleBehavior method determines and assigns an idle behavior
    to a bot when it is not engaged in any active tasks or quests. This method evaluates
    various factors such as the bot's current location, available objectives, player
    interaction needs, and server conditions to choose the most suitable idle action.
    It ensures that bots remain useful and realistic within the game world by preventing
    them from appearing inactive or stuck. The behavior selection process may involve
    checking for nearby quest givers, patrol points, or other interactive elements
    that can provide meaningful idle activities.

  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Update Loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n \
      \   if (m_bot->GetBotState() == BOT_STATE_IDLE)\n    {\n        m_bot->SelectIdleBehavior();\n\
      \    }\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the bot's AI update cycle when no
    active tasks are assigned. It may trigger internal state changes and behavior
    modifications that affect how the bot interacts with the game world. The selection
    process might involve randomization or weighted decision making based on bot configuration.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of the proper AI update context could lead
    to inconsistent bot behavior or unexpected state transitions. Ensure that the
    bot is in an appropriate idle state before invoking this method.
