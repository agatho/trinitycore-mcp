  class: BattlePetManager
  method: ShouldCapturePet
  signature: bool BattlePetManager::ShouldCapturePet(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a battle pet can be captured by the player.
  description: The ShouldCapturePet method evaluates if the current player is eligible
    to capture a battle pet based on game rules and conditions. This method typically
    checks factors such as the pet's level, the player's current battle pet team capacity,
    and any active modifiers or restrictions that might prevent capturing. It returns
    true if the pet can be captured, false otherwise. The method does not modify any
    state but rather performs a read-only evaluation to determine capture eligibility.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or index
      in the system. This parameter is likely used internally to access player-specific
      data such as battle pet team capacity, level restrictions, or other relevant
      game state information.
  returns: Returns true if the player can capture the battle pet, false otherwise.
    A return value of false typically indicates that the pet is either too high level,
    the player's team is full, or another restriction prevents capture.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check capture eligibility
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nbool canCapture = battlePetManager->ShouldCapturePet(&playerId);\n\
      if (canCapture) {\n    // Proceed with capturing the pet\n    printf(\"Pet can\
      \ be captured\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle capture failure\n    printf(\"\
      Pet cannot be captured\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with battle pet mechanics and may
    involve checks against player's current battle pet team size, level restrictions,
    or other game-specific rules. The parameter 'player' should be valid to avoid
    undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed to this method points to a valid
    player object or identifier. Passing an invalid or null pointer could lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes.
