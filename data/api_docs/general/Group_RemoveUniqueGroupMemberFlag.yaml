  method: RemoveUniqueGroupMemberFlag
  signature: void Group::RemoveUniqueGroupMemberFlag(GroupMemberFlags flag)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a unique group member flag from the group's member flags.
  description: The RemoveUniqueGroupMemberFlag method removes a specified GroupMemberFlags
    value from the internal set of flags associated with the group. This method is
    typically used to manage special roles or permissions within a group, such as
    removing a player's leadership status or unique role flags. The method operates
    on the group's internal flag storage and does not directly interact with individual
    member data structures. It is part of the group management system in TrinityCore
    that handles various group states and member privileges.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: The GroupMemberFlags value to be removed from the group's member
      flags. This parameter specifies which particular flag should be cleared from
      the group's flag set.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove leader flag from group
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->RemoveUniqueGroupMemberFlag(GROUP_MEMBER_FLAG_LEADER);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove unique role flag in conditional logic
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && group->IsLeader(player))\n\
      {\n    group->RemoveUniqueGroupMemberFlag(GROUP_MEMBER_FLAG_MAINASSIST);\n \
      \   // Additional logic for handling role removal\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the group's member flags. It is
    important to note that this operation does not automatically update client-side
    UI or send notifications to players; additional code may be required to synchronize
    changes with the user interface. The method assumes that the flag being removed
    is valid and corresponds to a defined GroupMemberFlags enum value.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring the group exists or has the specified
    flag set can lead to unexpected behavior. It's recommended to verify that the
    group is valid and that the flag is actually set before attempting removal. Additionally,
    removing flags should be done carefully in multi-threaded environments where group
    state might be modified concurrently.
