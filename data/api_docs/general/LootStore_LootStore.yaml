documentation:
  brief: Moves a LootStore object to another LootStore instance, transferring all
    loot data and resources.
  description: The LootStore move constructor initializes a new LootStore object by
    transferring ownership of all internal data and resources from an existing LootStore
    object. This operation is typically used when creating new LootStore instances
    from temporary or rvalue objects, allowing efficient resource management without
    unnecessary copying. The source LootStore becomes invalid after the move operation
    and should not be used. In the context of TrinityCore's loot system, this constructor
    is essential for managing loot templates and their associated data during runtime
    initialization and object lifecycle management.

  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing a LootStore
    code: 'LootStore store1;

      // ... populate store1 with loot data ...

      LootStore store2 = std::move(store1); // Move constructor in action

      // store1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a copy constructor. It transfers resources
    rather than copying them, making it more efficient for large data structures.
    The moved-from object should not be used after the operation.
  warnings: After moving a LootStore, the source object enters a valid but unspecified
    state. Using the source object afterward will result in undefined behavior.
