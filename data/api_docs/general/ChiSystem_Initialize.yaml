  class: ChiSystem
  method: Initialize
  signature: void ChiSystem::Initialize(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the ChiSystem with the provided bot reference.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the ChiSystem for operation by assigning
    the provided bot pointer to an internal member variable. This method is typically
    called during system startup or when a new bot instance needs to be configured.
    It prepares the system to manage chi-related mechanics for the specified bot,
    ensuring that all necessary resources are allocated and initialized properly.
    The method does not perform any complex initialization logic but rather serves
    as a setup routine to bind the system to a specific bot instance.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot identifier or reference.
      This parameter is used to associate the ChiSystem with a specific bot instance
      for chi management operations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'int botId = 42;

      ChiSystem chiSystem;

      chiSystem.Initialize(&botId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided bot pointer is valid and points to
    a properly initialized integer. The ChiSystem should not be used until this method
    has been called with a valid parameter.
