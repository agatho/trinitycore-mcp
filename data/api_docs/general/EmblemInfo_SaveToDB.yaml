documentation:
  brief: Saves the emblem information for a guild to the database.
  description: The SaveToDB method persists the emblem data associated with a specific
    guild into the database. This method is typically invoked when a guild's emblem
    configuration has been modified and needs to be stored permanently. It ensures
    that changes made to the guild's emblem, such as colors, patterns, or symbols,
    are saved for future retrieval. The method requires the guild identifier to properly
    associate the emblem data with the correct guild entry in the database.
  parameters:
  - name: guildId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild whose emblem information is to
      be saved. This value must correspond to an existing guild in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Saving Guild Emblem Data
    code: 'EmblemInfo emblem;

      // Assume emblem data has been set

      emblem.SaveToDB(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a database write operation, so it should be used
    judiciously to avoid performance bottlenecks. It is recommended to batch multiple
    emblem updates or use asynchronous operations if frequent saves are required.
