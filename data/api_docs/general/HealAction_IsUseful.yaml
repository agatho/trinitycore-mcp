documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a healing action is beneficial for the bot's current state
    and target.
  description: The IsUseful method evaluates if performing a heal action would be
    advantageous given the current context of the AI bot. It considers factors such
    as the target's health status, the bot's available resources (mana, health), and
    the overall tactical situation. This method is typically used by the AI to make
    decisions about when to initiate healing actions rather than other possible actions
    like attacking or moving. The result helps prioritize actions in the decision-making
    process of the bot.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the heal action is considered beneficial and should be
    executed; returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (healAction.IsUseful(ai)) {\n    ai->DoAction(healAction);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the decision-making framework for bot AI and should
    be called before executing a heal action to avoid unnecessary resource expenditure.
    The implementation likely involves checking target health percentages, bot mana
    levels, and proximity to the target.
