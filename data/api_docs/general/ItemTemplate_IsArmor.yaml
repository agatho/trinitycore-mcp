documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the item template represents an armor type item.
  description: The IsArmor method checks if the current item template belongs to the
    armor category. This method evaluates the item's class and subclass to determine
    if it is classified as armor within the World of Warcraft item system. It returns
    true for items such as cloth, leather, mail, and plate armor, including their
    various types like helmets, shoulders, chest pieces, etc. The check is based on
    predefined item class and subclass values that correspond to armor items in the
    game's database.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item template represents an armor item (class 4), false
    otherwise. This includes all armor types such as cloth, leather, mail, and plate
    armor across all armor slots.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Armor Check
    code: "if (itemTemplate->IsArmor()) {\n    // Handle armor item logic\n    printf(\"\
      This is an armor item\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Armor Type Classification
    code: "ItemTemplate* template = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(itemId);\nif (template\
      \ && template->IsArmor()) {\n    switch (template->SubClass) {\n        case\
      \ ITEM_SUBCLASS_ARMOR_CLOTH:\n            printf(\"Cloth armor\\n\");\n    \
      \        break;\n        case ITEM_SUBCLASS_ARMOR_LEATHER:\n            printf(\"\
      Leather armor\\n\");\n            break;\n        // ... other armor subclasses\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the item's class and subclass values being properly
    set according to the WoW item database structure. It does not consider enchantments
    or temporary modifications to item properties. The implementation uses hardcoded
    class/subclass comparisons that match the standard TrinityCore item classification
    system.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only checks the base item template classification
    and does not account for temporary item modifications such as enchantments, gems,
    or other effects that might change an item's behavior. Also, some items may have
    class/subclass combinations that are not explicitly defined in the standard armor
    categories but still return true if they match the armor criteria.
