  class: SpatialGridScheduler
  method: SetUpdateInterval
  signature: void SpatialGridScheduler::SetUpdateInterval(uint32 intervalMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the update interval for the spatial grid scheduler in milliseconds.
  description: The SetUpdateInterval method configures how frequently the SpatialGridScheduler
    updates its internal state and processes scheduled events. This interval determines
    the granularity of time-based operations within the spatial grid system, affecting
    performance and responsiveness of grid-related activities such as object movement
    detection, visibility updates, and AI behavior calculations. The scheduler will
    not process any updates more frequently than this interval, ensuring consistent
    timing across all grid operations.
  parameters:
  - name: intervalMs
    description: The update interval in milliseconds. Must be a positive integer value.
      Lower values increase frequency of updates but may impact performance. Typical
      values range from 50ms to 500ms depending on required responsiveness.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SpatialGridScheduler scheduler;

      scheduler.SetUpdateInterval(100); // Set update interval to 100 milliseconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Tuning Example
    code: 'uint32 optimalInterval = 250; // Mid-range for balancing performance and
      responsiveness

      SpatialGridScheduler* gridScheduler = GetWorld()->GetGridScheduler();

      gridScheduler->SetUpdateInterval(optimalInterval);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the timing of all scheduled operations within
    the spatial grid. Changing this interval while the scheduler is active may cause
    irregularities in timing for existing scheduled events. The default interval is
    typically set based on server configuration and game requirements.
  warnings: Setting very low intervals (e.g., below 10ms) can significantly impact
    server performance due to excessive processing overhead. Avoid frequent calls
    to this method during active operation as it may disrupt ongoing scheduling operations.
