documentation:
  brief: Processes the next pending group invitation in the queue.
  description: The ProcessNextInvitation method handles the processing of the next
    available group invitation within the GroupInvitationHandler. It typically manages
    the state transitions and validation of invitations, ensuring that players are
    properly added to groups when invitations are accepted or processed. This method
    is part of the core group management system in TrinityCore, responsible for maintaining
    group integrity and player synchronization during invitation handling. The method
    may return false if no invitations are pending or if processing fails due to invalid
    states or conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if an invitation was successfully processed, or false if there
    were no pending invitations or if the processing failed for any reason.
