  class: BotProfiler
  method: ResumeProfilingSession
  signature: bool BotProfiler::ResumeProfilingSession(uint64_t sessionId)
documentation:
  brief: Resumes a previously paused profiling session identified by the given session
    ID.
  description: The ResumeProfilingSession method attempts to resume a profiling session
    that was previously suspended. This functionality is typically used in debugging
    or performance analysis scenarios where profiling needs to be temporarily halted
    and then restarted. The method takes a unique session identifier (sessionId) as
    input and returns a boolean indicating whether the operation was successful. If
    the specified session does not exist or is already active, the method will return
    false. This method is part of the BotProfiler class which manages profiling sessions
    for AI bots in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionId
    description: A unique identifier representing the profiling session to be resumed.
      This value should correspond to a valid session that was previously created
      and paused using the appropriate methods.
  returns: Returns true if the profiling session was successfully resumed, false otherwise.
    The method will return false if the session ID is invalid, the session does not
    exist, or if the session is already active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ResumeProfilingSession
    code: "uint64_t sessionId = 123456789ULL;\nbool success = profiler.ResumeProfilingSession(sessionId);\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Profiling session resumed successfully\n    printf(\"\
      Profiling session %llu resumed\\n\", sessionId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Failed\
      \ to resume the profiling session\n    printf(\"Failed to resume profiling session\
      \ %llu\\n\", sessionId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the session has been previously created and paused.
    It's important to ensure that the session ID passed is valid and corresponds to
    an existing session in the profiler's internal tracking system. The method may
    have performance implications if called frequently during active profiling sessions.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent session ID will result
    in a failed operation. Ensure proper error handling when using this method, especially
    in production environments where session management is critical.
