  class: HealerPositionStrategy
  method: HealerPositionStrategy
  signature: void HealerPositionStrategy::HealerPositionStrategy(Map * map)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new healer position strategy for the specified map.
  description: The HealerPositionStrategy constructor initializes a new instance of
    the healer positioning strategy class, associating it with a specific game map.
    This strategy is typically used by AI systems to determine optimal positioning
    for healers during combat scenarios. The constructor sets up internal state and
    configuration parameters necessary for the strategy to function correctly within
    the context of the provided map's environment and game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Map* map = sMapMgr->FindMap(0, 0);

      HealerPositionStrategy strategy(map);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called with a valid Map pointer. The strategy
    will not function properly if initialized with a null map reference. The strategy
    is typically used in conjunction with AI decision-making systems for healer NPCs.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor with a null Map pointer as it may lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the Map object remains valid for the
    lifetime of the HealerPositionStrategy instance.
