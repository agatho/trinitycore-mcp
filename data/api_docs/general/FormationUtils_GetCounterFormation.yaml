  class: FormationUtils
  method: GetCounterFormation
  signature: FormationType FormationUtils::GetCounterFormation(FormationType enemyFormation)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the formation type that is counter to the specified enemy formation.
  description: The GetCounterFormation method determines and returns the optimal defensive
    or offensive formation that counters a given enemy formation in World of Warcraft's
    AI system. This utility function is typically used by NPCs or game entities to
    dynamically adjust their tactical positioning based on the formation of their
    opponents. The method evaluates the provided FormationType and returns a corresponding
    counter-formation that would be most effective against it, considering factors
    such as unit positioning, attack patterns, and battlefield dynamics. It serves
    as part of the broader tactical decision-making system within TrinityCore's AI
    framework.
  parameters:
  - name: enemyFormation
    description: The FormationType representing the enemy's current formation layout.
      This parameter defines how the opposing units are positioned and organized,
      which influences the counter-strategy.
  returns: Returns a FormationType that represents the optimal counter-formation to
    the provided enemyFormation. The returned value corresponds to a known formation
    type that is considered most effective against the input formation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'FormationType myFormation = FormationUtils::GetCounterFormation(FormationType::LINE);
      // Returns the counter formation for LINE

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Tactical AI Decision Making
    code: "void UnitAI::UpdateCombatStrategy()\n{\n    if (enemy && enemy->GetFormation())\n\
      \    {\n        FormationType counter = FormationUtils::GetCounterFormation(enemy->GetFormation());\n\
      \        SetFormation(counter);\n    }\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a static utility class and does not require instantiation.
    It relies on predefined mappings between formation types to determine counter-strategies,
    making it deterministic for known formations. The implementation assumes that
    all FormationType values are valid and supported within the AI system.
  warnings: Ensure that the input FormationType is valid before calling this method,
    as invalid or undefined formation types may result in unexpected behavior or return
    values. This function should not be used with custom or unsupported formation
    types unless explicitly extended.
