documentation:
  brief: Returns the total armor value of the unit, including all modifiers and buffs.
  description: The GetArmor method retrieves the total armor value of a Unit object,
    which represents the combined armor from all sources including base armor, armor
    bonuses, and any temporary buffs. Armor is a fundamental defensive stat in World
    of Warcraft that reduces incoming physical damage by a percentage. This method
    is commonly used in combat calculations and defense-related mechanics to determine
    how much protection a unit has against physical attacks. The value returned includes
    all armor components from various sources such as equipment, talents, and buffs.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the total armor value as an unsigned integer, representing the
    combined armor from all sources including base armor, bonuses, and temporary buffs.
    This value is used in combat calculations to determine damage reduction against
    physical attacks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Armor Retrieval
    code: 'uint32 armor = unit->GetArmor();

      // armor now contains the total armor value of the unit'
    language: cpp
  - title: Armor in Combat Calculation
    code: 'Unit* target = player->GetVictim();

      uint32 armor = target->GetArmor();

      uint32 damageReduction = (armor * 0.01);

      // This calculates the percentage reduction in damage from armor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. It's
    important to note that armor values may change during combat due to buffs or debuffs,
    so this value should be re-evaluated before each combat calculation.
  warnings: This method returns the total armor value including all modifiers, so
    it may not reflect just the base armor from equipment. Be aware that armor values
    can fluctuate during combat due to temporary buffs or debuffs.
