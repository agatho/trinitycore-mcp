  class: ProfessionAuctionBridge
  method: ShouldSellMaterial
  signature: bool ProfessionAuctionBridge::ShouldSellMaterial(int * player, uint32
    itemId, uint32 currentCount) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player should sell a specific material item based on
    auction house logic and inventory management.
  description: The ShouldSellMaterial method evaluates if a given material item should
    be sold by a player's auction house listing. It considers factors such as current
    inventory count, market demand, and predefined thresholds to decide whether the
    item is worth keeping or selling. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with profession-related auction house automation systems within TrinityCore's
    framework. The function takes into account the player's reference, item ID, and
    the quantity currently possessed.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object representing the auction house owner.
      This parameter is used to access player-specific data such as inventory and
      auction settings.
  - name: itemId
    description: Unique identifier for the material item being evaluated. This ID
      corresponds to an entry in the game's item database.
  - name: currentCount
    description: The number of items currently available in the player's inventory
      for the specified item ID.
  returns: Returns true if the material should be sold according to auction house
    logic and inventory rules; otherwise returns false. A return value of true indicates
    that the system has determined the item is either overstocked or not profitable
    to retain.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ShouldSellMaterial
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 itemId = 12345;\nuint32 count = 10;\nbool\
      \ shouldSell = ProfessionAuctionBridge::ShouldSellMaterial(player, itemId, count);\n\
      if (shouldSell)\n{\n    // Handle selling logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with auction house update loop
    code: "void UpdateAuctionHouse()\n{\n    for (auto& item : player->GetAuctionItems())\n\
      \    {\n        if (ProfessionAuctionBridge::ShouldSellMaterial(player, item.GetItemId(),\
      \ item.GetCount()))\n        {\n            // Remove item from auction house\n\
      \            player->RemoveFromAuctionHouse(item);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the profession auction bridge system and relies on
    internal game logic for determining when items are considered overstocked or underperforming.
    It may be called frequently during auction house updates, so performance optimization
    is important. The exact criteria for 'should sell' can vary depending on server
    configuration settings.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null, as accessing invalid memory could lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
    Also note that this function does not perform any actual selling; it only determines
    whether an action should occur.
