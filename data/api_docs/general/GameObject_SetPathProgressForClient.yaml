  class: GameObject
  method: SetPathProgressForClient
  signature: void GameObject::SetPathProgressForClient(float progress)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the progress of a game object's path for client display.
  description: This method updates the progress of a GameObject's movement path, allowing
    the client to visualize the current position along the path. It is typically used
    during dynamic movement or when the object needs to be animated in relation to
    its path. The progress value represents a percentage from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0
    indicates the start of the path and 1.0 indicates the end. This method is commonly
    used in conjunction with path-based movement systems for NPCs or game objects
    that follow predefined routes.
  parameters:
  - name: progress
    description: A float value representing the progress along the path, where 0.0
      is the start and 1.0 is the end. Values outside this range may cause unexpected
      behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Path Progress for Client
    code: 'GameObject* gameObj = new GameObject();

      float progress = 0.5f;

      gameObj->SetPathProgressForClient(progress);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it affects client-side rendering
    and may impact performance if used frequently. It is typically used in conjunction
    with movement path updates to ensure proper synchronization between server and
    client.
  warnings: This method does not validate the progress value; values outside the range
    0.0 to 1.0 may cause visual artifacts or incorrect behavior in client-side rendering.
