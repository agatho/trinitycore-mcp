  signature: bool GameObject::CanInteractWithCapturePoint(const int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a GameObject can interact with a capture point.
  description: This method checks if a GameObject is capable of interacting with a
    capture point, typically used in battleground scenarios or quest systems where
    objects need to be interacted with to trigger capture mechanics. The method evaluates
    the object's state and interaction capabilities against the target capture point,
    returning true if the interaction is possible and false otherwise. It is commonly
    used in game logic to determine valid interactions during capture point events.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the capture point that the GameObject should interact
      with. This parameter represents the target object or entity that the GameObject
      can potentially interact with.
  returns: Returns true if the GameObject can interact with the specified capture
    point, false otherwise. The method evaluates whether the GameObject's state allows
    interaction with the target capture point based on game mechanics and object properties.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (gameObject->CanInteractWithCapturePoint(&capturePoint)) {\n    // Perform\
      \ interaction\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include checking object state, interaction conditions,
    and potential cooldowns. Performance considerations involve minimal overhead as
    this is typically used in game logic checks rather than intensive operations.
  warnings: This method should not be used for direct interaction without verifying
    the target capture point's validity. Incorrect usage may lead to invalid interactions
    or game state issues.
