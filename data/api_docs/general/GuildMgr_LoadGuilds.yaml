  brief: Initializes and loads all guild data from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadGuilds method is responsible for initializing the guild management
    system by loading all existing guilds from the database into memory. This method
    is typically called during server startup or when the guild manager needs to refresh
    its internal data structures. It iterates through the guild table in the database,
    constructs Guild objects for each entry, and populates the internal guild container.
    The method ensures that all guild-related information such as guild name, leader,
    members, and permissions are properly loaded and accessible for game operations.
    This is a critical initialization step for guild functionality within TrinityCore.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeGuilds()\n{\n    sGuildMgr->LoadGuilds();\n\
      \    // Guild data is now available for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization. It performs
    a database query that may impact performance on servers with many guilds. The
    method assumes the database connection is already established and functional.
