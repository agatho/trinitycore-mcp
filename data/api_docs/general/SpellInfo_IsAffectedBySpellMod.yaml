documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell is affected by a specific spell modifier.
  description: This method checks if a spell is influenced by a given SpellModifier,
    which represents a modifier that affects spell properties such as duration, cost,
    or effect. It evaluates the relationship between the spell and the modifier to
    determine if the spell's behavior is altered by the modifier. The method returns
    a uint32 value indicating the degree of influence, typically used for determining
    whether a spell should be modified or not in various game mechanics contexts.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the degree to which the spell is affected
    by the SpellModifier. A value of 0 indicates no effect, while higher values indicate
    stronger influence. This value is typically used for determining whether a spell
    should be modified or not in various game mechanics contexts.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "SpellInfo* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(12345);\nSpellModifier*\
      \ mod = new SpellModifier(SpellModType::SPELLMOD_DURATION);\nuint32 result =\
      \ spellInfo->IsAffectedBySpellMod(mod);\nif (result > 0)\n    // The spell is\
      \ affected by the modifier"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related functions
    to determine whether a spell should be modified based on modifiers. It's important
    to note that this function does not modify the spell itself, but rather evaluates
    its relationship with the modifier.
  warnings: This method should not be used to directly modify spell properties; it
    only determines if a spell is affected by a modifier. Care must be taken when
    using SpellModifier objects as they may be modified or destroyed during gameplay.
