documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables automatic acceptance of group invites during trading.
  description: The SetAutoAcceptGroup method configures whether a player's trade session
    will automatically accept group invitations from other players. When enabled,
    the player will automatically join any group that another trader invites them
    to during a trade negotiation. This feature is useful for streamlining cooperative
    gameplay where players frequently form groups during trading sessions. The setting
    only affects the current player's trade session and does not persist across logout
    or server restarts.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean value that determines whether auto-accept group invites is
      enabled (true) or disabled (false).
  returns: null

  notes: This method affects only the local player's trading behavior and does not
