  method: PlanBankReorganization
  signature: void GuildBankManager::PlanBankReorganization(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Schedules a guild bank reorganization process for the specified player.
  description: The PlanBankReorganization method initiates the planning phase for
    a guild bank reorganization operation. This function prepares the necessary data
    structures and triggers the reorganization sequence for a specific player's guild
    bank. The method likely handles inventory sorting, item redistribution, or structural
    changes to the guild bank layout. It is typically invoked when a guild leader
    or officer wants to restructure their guild's bank organization, possibly to optimize
    space usage or rearrange items according to new guild policies. This planning
    phase may involve validating item permissions, calculating storage requirements,
    and preparing transaction logs before executing any actual reorganization.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) for whom the bank reorganization is planned. The value should correspond
      to a valid online player in the guild.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildBankManager bankManager;

      bankManager.PlanBankReorganization(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs preliminary checks on the player's guild membership
    and permissions before planning the reorganization. It may queue the operation
    for later execution or trigger asynchronous processing to avoid blocking the main
    game thread during potentially heavy computations.
  warnings: Ensure that the player ID passed is valid and corresponds to an online
    player in the guild, otherwise the method may fail silently or cause undefined
    behavior. This method should only be called by authorized guild members with appropriate
    permissions.
