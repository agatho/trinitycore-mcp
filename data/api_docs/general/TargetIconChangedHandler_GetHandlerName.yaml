    with the TargetIconChangedHandler class. This identifier is used internally by
    the TrinityCore framework to register and dispatch packet handling events related
    to target icon changes in the game world. The method provides a consistent way
    to identify this specific event handler among other packet handlers within the
    system.

    class
  examples:

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during system initialization or event registration
    to ensure proper mapping of packet handlers. The returned string should be consistent
    across all instances of the handler and is used for internal framework operations.
