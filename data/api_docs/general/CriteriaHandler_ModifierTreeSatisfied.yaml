  class: CriteriaHandler
  method: ModifierTreeSatisfied
  signature: bool CriteriaHandler::ModifierTreeSatisfied(const ModifierTreeNode *
    parent, uint64 miscValue1, uint64 miscValue2, const WorldObject * ref, Player
    * referencePlayer) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether a criteria modifier tree is satisfied based on provided
    values and references.
  description: The ModifierTreeSatisfied method checks if a given criteria modifier
    tree, represented by a parent node, is satisfied according to specified miscellaneous
    values and reference objects. This method is used in the context of achievement
    and criterion evaluation within TrinityCore's framework. It recursively evaluates
    child nodes of the modifier tree against provided parameters such as miscValue1,
    miscValue2, and reference objects like WorldObject or Player. The method ensures
    that all conditions defined in the modifier tree are met before returning true.
    This functionality is crucial for determining whether players have fulfilled specific
    criteria required for achievements or other game events.
  parameters:
  - name: parent
    description: Pointer to the root node of the modifier tree to be evaluated. Must
      not be null for valid evaluation.
  - name: miscValue1
    description: First miscellaneous value used in criterion evaluation, typically
      representing a specific game state or parameter such as item count or spell
      ID.
  - name: miscValue2
    description: Second miscellaneous value used in criterion evaluation, often used
      alongside miscValue1 for more complex condition checking.
  - name: ref
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject reference used in evaluation. Can be null
      if no specific reference is required.
  - name: referencePlayer
    description: Pointer to the Player object that serves as the reference player
      for criterion evaluation. Must not be null when player-specific conditions are
      involved.
  returns: Returns true if all criteria within the modifier tree are satisfied, false
    otherwise. The method will return false if any node in the tree fails its condition
    check.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ModifierTreeSatisfied
    code: 'CriteriaHandler handler;

      ModifierTreeNode* root = new ModifierTreeNode();

      Player* player = ...; // valid player object

      WorldObject* target = ...; // valid world object

      bool result = handler.ModifierTreeSatisfied(root, 100, 200, target, player);

      // result will be true if all conditions in root tree are satisfied'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking achievement criteria with modifier trees
    code: "CriteriaHandler* criteriaHandler = player->GetCriteriaHandler();\nModifierTreeNode*\
      \ tree = GetAchievementCriteriaTree(12345); // hypothetical method\nuint64 value1\
      \ = player->GetMoney();\nuint64 value2 = player->GetLevel();\nWorldObject* reference\
      \ = player->GetMap()->GetGameObject(54321);\nbool satisfied = criteriaHandler->ModifierTreeSatisfied(tree,\
      \ value1, value2, reference, player);\nif (satisfied) {\n    // Award achievement\
      \ or trigger event\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs recursive evaluation of modifier trees and should be
    used carefully in performance-critical sections. The method assumes that all input
    parameters are valid and properly initialized. It's designed to work with the
    internal criteria system of TrinityCore, which handles complex achievement logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the parent node is not null before calling this method. Passing
    invalid or uninitialized WorldObject pointers may lead to undefined behavior.
    This method should only be called when the criteria system is fully initialized
    and ready for evaluation.
