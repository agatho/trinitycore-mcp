  brief: Returns the reputation value for a specified faction.
  description: The GetReputation method retrieves the current reputation level of
    the player for a specific faction. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft
    development to check player's standing with various factions such as guild, alliance,
    or NPC factions. The returned value represents the player's reputation points
    relative to the faction's standing, which can be used to determine if the player
    has reached certain reputation levels or to calculate rewards based on reputation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the current reputation level for the specified
    faction. This value can be negative, zero, or positive depending on the player's
    standing with that faction.

      \ hostile standing\n}"

  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. It does not
    modify the player's reputation state, but simply returns the current value.
  warnings: Be aware that the returned value may be negative if the player has hostile
    standing with the faction. Also note that this method does not account for reputation
    modifiers or bonus points that might affect the final reputation value.
