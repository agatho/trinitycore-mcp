  class: BehaviorPriorityManager
  method: UnregisterStrategy
  signature: void BehaviorPriorityManager::UnregisterStrategy(Strategy * strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified strategy from the behavior priority manager's registered
    strategies.
  description: The UnregisterStrategy method removes a given Strategy object from
    the internal collection managed by the BehaviorPriorityManager. This operation
    is typically used during cleanup or when dynamically modifying AI behaviors at
    runtime. The method ensures that the specified strategy is no longer considered
    when determining the priority order of AI actions. It's important to note that
    unregistering a strategy does not automatically delete the strategy object itself;
    it only removes it from the manager's active list. This allows for potential reuse
    of strategy objects or deferred deletion by the calling code.
  parameters:
  - name: strategy
    description: Pointer to the Strategy object that should be removed from the behavior
      priority manager. Must not be null, otherwise the behavior is undefined.
  returns: None. This method has no return value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic strategy unregistration
    code: 'Strategy* myStrategy = new CombatStrategy();

      behaviorManager->RegisterStrategy(myStrategy);

      // ... some logic ...

      behaviorManager->UnregisterStrategy(myStrategy);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe unregistration with null check
    code: "if (myStrategy != nullptr) {\n    behaviorManager->UnregisterStrategy(myStrategy);\n\
      \    delete myStrategy;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on an internal data structure such as a list
    or map. It's recommended to ensure that the strategy object remains valid until
    after this call, especially if it's being used by other components. The implementation
    may involve locking mechanisms in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Calling UnregisterStrategy with a null pointer will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crash. Always validate that the strategy pointer is valid before calling
    this method. Additionally, be cautious about unregistering strategies while they
    are actively being used by AI threads.
