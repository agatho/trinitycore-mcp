documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the internal identifier for an achievement based on its referenced
    ID.
  description: The GetAchievementByReferencedId method is used to obtain the internal
    identifier (ID) of an achievement given a referenced ID. This function is typically
    utilized in the context of World of Warcraft's achievement system within TrinityCore,
    where achievements may be stored or referenced using different identifiers for
    various purposes such as database lookups or client synchronization. The method
    performs a lookup in the global achievement manager's internal data structures
    to map the provided referenced ID to its corresponding internal achievement ID.
    It is important to note that this function returns a pointer to an integer, which
    means the caller must ensure proper handling of potential null values and understand
    that the returned value may be invalidated if the underlying data structure changes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the internal achievement ID corresponding
    to the provided referenced ID. If no matching achievement is found, this function
    may return a null pointer or a default value depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const int* achievementId = AchievementGlobalMgr::GetAchievementByReferencedId(12345);\n\
      if (achievementId != nullptr) {\n    printf(\"Found achievement with ID: %d\\\
      n\", *achievementId);\n} else {\n    printf(\"No achievement found for referenced\
      \ ID 12345\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a caching or lookup mechanism within the AchievementGlobalMgr
    class. The returned pointer should be treated carefully to avoid dangling references,
    especially if the internal data structures are modified during execution. Performance
    considerations may apply depending on how the internal mapping is implemented
    (e.g., hash table, vector, etc.).
  warnings: The function returns a raw pointer which can be null. Always check for
    null before dereferencing the returned value to prevent segmentation faults or
    undefined behavior.
