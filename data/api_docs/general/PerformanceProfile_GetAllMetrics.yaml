documentation:
  brief: Retrieves all performance metrics collected by the profile instance
  description: The GetAllMetrics method returns an integer value representing the
    total count of performance metrics currently stored within the PerformanceProfile
    instance. This method is typically used to determine how many metric entries have
    been recorded during profiling sessions. The returned integer can be used to iterate
    through or process all collected metrics. This functionality is essential for
    performance analysis and debugging in TrinityCore's profiling system, allowing
    developers to understand resource usage patterns and identify potential bottlenecks
    in the game server's operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the total number of performance metrics stored
    in this profile instance. Returns zero if no metrics have been collected or if
    the profile is empty.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Metric Count
    code: "PerformanceProfile profile;\n// ... collect some metrics ...\nint metricCount\
      \ = profile.GetAllMetrics();\nif (metricCount > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Collected\
      \ %d performance metrics\\n\", metricCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterating Through All Metrics
    code: "PerformanceProfile profile;\n// ... collect metrics ...\nint totalMetrics\
      \ = profile.GetAllMetrics();\nfor (int i = 0; i < totalMetrics; ++i)\n{\n  \
      \  // Access individual metric using index-based retrieval\n    // Note: Actual\
      \ metric access would depend on other methods in the class\n    printf(\"Metric\
      \ %d retrieved\\n\", i);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a quick way to determine the size of the metrics collection
    without needing to iterate through all entries. It's a read-only operation that
    does not modify the profile state. The returned value is typically used in conjunction
    with other methods that access individual metrics by index or through enumeration.
