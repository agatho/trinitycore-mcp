documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can use the mail system in World of Warcraft.
  description: The CanUseMail method evaluates if a given player character is permitted
    to interact with the mail system within the TrinityCore framework. This validation
    typically checks for conditions such as player state, account restrictions, server
    rules, or game mechanics that might prevent mail usage. The method returns true
    if the player can use mail, and false otherwise. It's commonly used in AI behavior
    scripts or automated systems to ensure valid interactions before attempting to
    send or receive mail.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether the specified player can use
    the mail system. True indicates the player is allowed to use mail; false means
    they are currently restricted from doing so.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Script
    code: "if (validator.CanUseMail(player)) {\n    // Proceed with mail-related actions\n\
      \    player->GetSession()->SendMailResult(...);\n} else {\n    // Handle restricted\
      \ case\n    player->SendNotification(\"You cannot use the mail system at this\
      \ time.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against internal flags, account status,
    and possibly server configuration settings. It may also consider character level,
    faction, or other gameplay restrictions that apply to mail functionality.
