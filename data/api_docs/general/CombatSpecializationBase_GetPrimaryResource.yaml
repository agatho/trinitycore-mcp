  method: GetPrimaryResource
  signature: ResourceType CombatSpecializationBase::GetPrimaryResource() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the primary resource type associated with the combat specialization.
  description: The GetPrimaryResource method returns the ResourceType enum value that
    represents the primary resource used by this combat specialization. In World of
    Warcraft context, this typically corresponds to a player's main resource such
    as mana, rage, energy, or focus, depending on their class and specialization.
    This method is commonly used in combat-related logic to determine which resource
    should be managed or displayed for the current specialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ResourceType enum value indicating the primary resource type for this
    combat specialization. Possible values include RESOURCE_MANA, RESOURCE_RAGE, RESOURCE_ENERGY,
    RESOURCE_FOCUS, and others depending on class and specialization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Determine Primary Resource
    code: "CombatSpecializationBase* spec = player->GetSpecialization();\nResourceType\
      \ primaryResource = spec->GetPrimaryResource();\nif (primaryResource == RESOURCE_MANA)\n\
      {\n    // Handle mana-based specialization logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Primary Resource in Resource Management
    code: "void UpdatePlayerResource(Player* player)\n{\n    CombatSpecializationBase*\
      \ spec = player->GetSpecialization();\n    ResourceType resourceType = spec->GetPrimaryResource();\n\
      \    \n    switch (resourceType)\n    {\n        case RESOURCE_MANA:\n     \
      \       // Update mana display\n            break;\n        case RESOURCE_ENERGY:\n\
      \            // Update energy display\n            break;\n        default:\n\
      \            // Handle other resource types\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat state updates or resource management
    calculations. The returned ResourceType value should be used to determine appropriate
    UI elements, resource regeneration rates, and spell cost calculations specific
    to the player's current specialization.
  warnings: Ensure that the CombatSpecializationBase object is valid before calling
    this method, as calling it on a null specialization may result in undefined behavior.
    The method assumes that the specialization has been properly initialized with
    a valid primary resource type.
