api:
  class: BlackMarketEntry
  method: GetCurrentBid
  signature: int BlackMarketEntry::GetCurrentBid() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current highest bid amount for the black market item entry.
  description: The GetCurrentBid method returns the integer value representing the
    highest bid placed on a specific black market item. This value is typically used
    to determine whether a new bid meets or exceeds the current bid threshold, and
    it plays a crucial role in the auction mechanics of the black market system within
    TrinityCore. The method does not perform any validation or modification of bids;
    it simply retrieves the stored highest bid amount from the internal data structure
    associated with the BlackMarketEntry object.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the current highest bid amount for this black market
    item entry. A return value of 0 typically indicates that no bids have been placed
    yet.
  examples:
  - title: Check Current Bid Before Placing New Bid
    code: "BlackMarketEntry* entry = sBlackMarketMgr->GetBlackMarketEntry(12345);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    int currentBid = entry->GetCurrentBid();\n    if (currentBid\
      \ < 1000)\n    {\n        // Place a new bid of 1000\n        entry->PlaceBid(1000);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is read-only and does not modify any internal state. It's recommended
    to cache the return value if multiple checks are needed, as accessing the bid
    amount may involve a lookup operation in the database or in-memory data structure.
