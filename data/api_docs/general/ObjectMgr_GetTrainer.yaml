documentation:
  brief: Retrieves trainer data for a specified trainer ID
  description: The GetTrainer method retrieves trainer-related data from the object
    manager's internal database using the provided trainer ID. This method is typically
    used to fetch information about NPCs that serve as trainers for skills, spells,
    or professions in World of Warcraft. The returned pointer points to an array of
    integers containing trainer-specific data such as spell IDs, required skill levels,
    and other training parameters. The method performs a lookup in the database and
    returns a const int* pointing to the data structure associated with the given
    trainer ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const int* pointer to an array of integers containing trainer data. Returns
    nullptr if no trainer data is found for the specified trainerId.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trainer Data Retrieval
    code: "uint32 trainerId = 12345;\nconst int* trainerData = sObjectMgr->GetTrainer(trainerId);\n\
      if (trainerData != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process trainer data\n    for (int i\
      \ = 0; i < 10; ++i)\n    {\n        printf(\"Spell ID: %d\\n\", trainerData[i]);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal database structures and should be used carefully.
    The returned data is read-only and must not be modified directly. Performance
    may vary depending on the number of trainers loaded in memory.
  warnings: The returned pointer becomes invalid if the object manager's internal
    data structures are modified or reloaded. Always check for null return values
    before dereferencing the pointer to prevent segmentation faults.
