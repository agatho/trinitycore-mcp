  class: ResourceManager
  method: SetResource
  signature: void ResourceManager::SetResource(ResourceType type, uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the amount of a specified resource type for the current player.
  description: The SetResource method updates the value of a specific resource type
    for the player character. This method is typically used in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework to manage player resources such as mana, rage, energy, or
    focus. The resource type is defined by the ResourceType enum, and the amount parameter
    specifies the new value for that resource. This method directly modifies the player's
    resource state and may trigger updates to the client UI to reflect the changed
    values. It is commonly used in spell effects, ability usage, or resource regeneration
    systems.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The ResourceType enum value indicating which resource to modify (e.g.,
      MANA, RAGE, ENERGY, FOCUS). Valid values are defined by the ResourceType enumeration
      in the TrinityCore codebase.
  - name: amount
    description: The new amount of the specified resource. This value should be non-negative
      and typically constrained by the maximum allowed value for that resource type.
      Values exceeding the maximum may be clamped or handled according to game logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Player Mana to Full
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      ResourceType manaType = ResourceType::MANA;

      uint32 maxMana = player->GetMaxPower(manaType);

      player->GetResourceManager()->SetResource(manaType, maxMana);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reduce Player Energy by 10 Units
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      ResourceType energyType = ResourceType::ENERGY;

      uint32 currentEnergy = player->GetPower(energyType);

      player->GetResourceManager()->SetResource(energyType, currentEnergy - 10);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal resource state of a player. It
    does not perform any validation on the resource type or amount values beyond basic
    parameter passing. The ResourceManager class is expected to handle clamping or
    boundary checks internally if necessary. This method should be called from within
    the game's main thread for thread safety.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid resource types may result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the resource type passed matches one of the supported ResourceType
    enum values. Also, setting an amount higher than the maximum allowed value for
    a resource might lead to unexpected client-side UI updates or game state inconsistencies
    if not properly handled by the ResourceManager implementation.
