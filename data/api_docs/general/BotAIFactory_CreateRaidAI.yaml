  signature: int BotAIFactory::CreateRaidAI(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new raid AI instance for the specified bot player
  description: The CreateRaidAI method initializes and configures a raid AI behavior
    for a given bot player within the TrinityCore framework. This method is responsible
    for setting up the appropriate AI state, assigning raid-specific roles, and configuring
    combat behaviors tailored for group encounters. The method typically integrates
    with the existing bot management system to ensure proper AI coordination within
    raid environments. It may return an identifier or status code indicating success
    or failure of the AI creation process.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the result of the AI creation operation.
    A positive value typically indicates successful creation, while a negative value
    may indicate an error or failure condition such as invalid player reference or
    insufficient resources.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is valid\nint result = BotAIFactory::CreateRaidAI(bot);\n\
      if (result >= 0) {\n    // AI created successfully\n    printf(\"Raid AI created\
      \ with ID: %d\\n\", result);\n} else {\n    // Handle error\n    printf(\"Failed\
      \ to create Raid AI: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot AI system and assumes that the Player object
    passed is a valid bot instance. The implementation likely involves memory allocation
    for AI structures, initialization of behavior trees, and integration with TrinityCore's
    event handling system for raid-specific triggers.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-bot player may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure proper validation of the Player pointer before invocation.
    The return value should always be checked to confirm successful AI creation before
    attempting to use the bot in raid scenarios.
