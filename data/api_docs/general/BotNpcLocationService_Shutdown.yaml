documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the bot NPC location service, cleaning up resources and stopping
    all active operations.
  description: The Shutdown method terminates the BotNpcLocationService, ensuring
    that all active bot NPC location tracking is stopped and any associated resources
    are properly released. This method is typically called during server shutdown
    or when the service needs to be disabled temporarily. It performs cleanup operations
    such as stopping background threads, clearing internal data structures, and notifying
    dependent systems that the service is no longer available. The method ensures
    thread-safe termination of all ongoing processes related to NPC location tracking.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the service is no longer needed or
    during server shutdown. Calling Shutdown multiple times may result in undefined
    behavior if not properly handled by the implementation.
