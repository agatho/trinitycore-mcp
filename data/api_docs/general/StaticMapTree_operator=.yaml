documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of another StaticMapTree object to this instance
  description: The assignment operator for StaticMapTree performs a deep copy of all
    internal data structures from the right-hand side object. This includes copying
    the spatial partitioning tree structure used for collision detection and line-of-sight
    calculations in the game world. The operation ensures that both objects become
    independent copies with identical state, maintaining the integrity of the map
    navigation system. This method is typically used when reassigning one StaticMapTree
    instance to another, such as during object initialization or when swapping map
    data structures.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The source StaticMapTree object whose contents will be copied to
      this instance
  returns: A reference to the current StaticMapTree object (this), allowing for chained
    assignment operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Usage
    code: 'StaticMapTree tree1;

      StaticMapTree tree2;

      // ... populate tree2 with data ...

      tree1 = tree2; // Assigns all contents of tree2 to tree1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'StaticMapTree tree1, tree2, tree3;

      // ... populate trees with data ...

      tree1 = tree2 = tree3; // Chained assignment - all trees get contents of tree3'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator performs a deep copy operation which may have performance implications
    when dealing with large map data structures. The implementation should ensure
    thread safety if used in multi-threaded contexts, though the typical usage pattern
    in TrinityCore involves single-threaded access during map loading and initialization.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning to an already initialized StaticMapTree object
    as this operation will overwrite all existing internal data without warning. Ensure
    that any references to the previous state are properly handled to avoid dangling
    pointers or undefined behavior.
