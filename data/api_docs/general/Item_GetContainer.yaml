  class: Item
  method: GetContainer
  signature: Bag * Item::GetContainer()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the container bag that holds this item.
  description: The GetContainer method retrieves the Bag object that contains this
    Item. This method is essential for determining the item's location within the
    player's inventory, as items can be stored in various containers such as bags,
    backpacks, or other container slots. The returned pointer represents the container
    in which the item resides, allowing developers to access container-specific properties
    and methods. When an item is not contained within a bag, this method returns nullptr,
    indicating that the item is directly in the player's main inventory.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Bag object that contains this item. If the item
    is not inside a bag, the method returns nullptr. The returned pointer can be used
    to access container properties such as slot number, item count, and container-specific
    methods.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByGUID(123456789);\nBag* container = item->GetContainer();\n\
      if (container != nullptr)\n{\n    // Item is inside a bag\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"Item is in bag: \" << container->GetSlot() << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n \
      \   // Item is in main inventory\n    std::cout << \"Item is in main inventory\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other item-related methods
    to determine item location and manage inventory operations. Performance considerations
    are minimal, as the method simply returns a pointer to the container object without
    performing complex operations.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method on items that may not be properly initialized
    or loaded. Always check for nullptr before dereferencing the returned pointer
    to avoid memory access violations.
