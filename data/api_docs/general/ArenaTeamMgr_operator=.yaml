documentation:
  brief: Moves an ArenaTeamMgr object by transferring ownership of its resources to
    another ArenaTeamMgr instance.
  description: The operator= method implements move assignment for the ArenaTeamMgr
    class, allowing efficient transfer of resources from a temporary or rvalue ArenaTeamMgr
    object to the current instance. This operation typically involves transferring
    internal data structures such as arena team collections, member lists, and associated
    metadata without performing deep copies. The source object is left in a valid
    but unspecified state after the move. In the context of TrinityCore's World of
    Warcraft emulation, this method supports efficient management of arena teams during
    dynamic operations like team creation, destruction, or reassignment. This is particularly
    useful when dealing with temporary objects or when implementing container operations
    that require moving elements rather than copying them.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to another ArenaTeamMgr object whose resources
      will be moved to this instance. After the operation, param0 will be left in
      a valid but unspecified state.
  returns: A reference to the current ArenaTeamMgr instance (this), allowing for chaining
    of assignment operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'ArenaTeamMgr manager1;

      // ... populate manager1 with data ...

      ArenaTeamMgr manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Uses move constructor

      // or alternatively:

      ArenaTeamMgr manager3;

      manager3 = std::move(manager1); // Uses move assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Container Context
    code: 'std::vector<ArenaTeamMgr> managers;

      managers.emplace_back();

      // ... populate first manager ...

      ArenaTeamMgr tempManager;

      // ... populate tempManager ...

      managers[0] = std::move(tempManager); // Efficiently transfers resources'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the C++ move semantics implementation and should be
    used when transferring ownership of expensive-to-copy objects. The ArenaTeamMgr
    class likely manages dynamic memory or resource handles that benefit from move
    semantics. After a successful move assignment, the source object should not be
    used in a meaningful way as its internal state is undefined but valid.
  warnings: Do not use the moved-from object after calling this operator unless you
    explicitly reset it. The behavior of using the source object after move assignment
    is undefined. Be cautious when mixing move and copy operations in containers or
    complex data structures where the distinction between these operations matters
    for correctness.
