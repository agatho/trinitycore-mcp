  signature: void DungeonScriptMgr::LoadScripts()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads all dungeon-specific scripts into the script manager.
  description: The LoadScripts method is responsible for initializing and loading
    all dungeon-related scripts into the DungeonScriptMgr. This method is typically
    called during server startup or when a new dungeon instance is created to ensure
    that all scripted behaviors, events, and triggers are properly registered and
    available for execution within the dungeon environment. It processes script definitions
    and associates them with appropriate dungeon instances, enabling dynamic gameplay
    elements such as boss AI, quest triggers, and environmental interactions. The
    method ensures that all required scripts are loaded before any dungeon content
    is made accessible to players.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'DungeonScriptMgr::instance()->LoadScripts();

      // Called during server startup to load all dungeon scripts'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the server's initialization
    phase. It is not thread-safe and should be executed in a single-threaded context.
    The loading process may take some time depending on the number of dungeon scripts
    defined in the database.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times can result in duplicate script registrations.
    Ensure that this method is only invoked once per server session to prevent memory
    leaks or unexpected behavior.
