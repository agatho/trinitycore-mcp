  brief: Sends a greeting message to the specified player, typically used during initial
    player login or social interaction.
  description: The GreetPlayer method is responsible for delivering a welcome message
    or social greeting to a given player object. This method is commonly invoked when
    a player first logs into the game or when establishing social connections within
    the World of Warcraft environment. It handles the presentation of initial social
    cues such as welcome messages, faction-specific greetings, or other predefined
    social interactions. The implementation may vary based on the player's current
    state, faction, and social settings. This method does not return any value but
    performs internal operations to manage player social experience.

  - title: Basic Usage in Player Login Context
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    // Called when a player\
      \ successfully logs in\n    sSocialMgr->GreetPlayer(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core game loop during player
    initialization. It may trigger additional social system events or updates, such
    as updating friend lists or sending initial social notifications. Developers should
    be aware that this function might perform database operations or network communications
    depending on the implementation.
