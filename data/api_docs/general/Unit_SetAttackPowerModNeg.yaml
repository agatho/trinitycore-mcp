  class: Unit
  method: SetAttackPowerModNeg
  signature: void Unit::SetAttackPowerModNeg(int32 attackPowerMod)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the negative attack power modifier for the unit.
  description: This method modifies the attack power of a Unit by applying a negative
    value, which affects the unit's melee attack power calculation. The method is
    typically used in game mechanics to adjust combat statistics, such as when applying
    debuffs or modifying weapon damage. It directly influences how the unit's attack
    power is calculated during combat, particularly affecting the base attack power
    and potentially the total attack power of the unit.
  parameters:
  - name: attackPowerMod
    description: The negative attack power modifier value to be applied. This value
      represents a change in attack power that will be subtracted from the base attack
      power, typically used for debuffs or modifiers that reduce attack power.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SetAttackPowerModNeg(-100);

      // This reduces the unit''s attack power by 100'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal combat system and should be used carefully
    when modifying game mechanics. It affects the calculation of attack power in relation
    to weapon damage and may influence combat outcomes.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect combat calculations,
    potentially affecting gameplay balance. Care should be taken when applying negative
    modifiers to avoid unintended consequences.
