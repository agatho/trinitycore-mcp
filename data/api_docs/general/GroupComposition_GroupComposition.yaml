documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new GroupComposition object with default values.
  description: The GroupComposition constructor initializes a new instance of the
    GroupComposition class. This method sets up the internal state of the group composition
    object, typically initializing member variables to their default values or null
    states. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, GroupComposition
    likely represents the structure and makeup of a player group (raid or party),
    including information about group members, roles, and composition rules. The constructor
    ensures that the object is in a valid initial state before any operations are
    performed on it.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new GroupComposition instance
    code: 'GroupComposition groupComp;

      // Initializes a new group composition with default settings'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a default constructor, meaning it takes no parameters. It's typically
    used to create an empty or uninitialized group composition object that can then
    be populated with data through other methods or member functions.
