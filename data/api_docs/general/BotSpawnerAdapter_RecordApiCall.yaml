  class: BotSpawnerAdapter
  method: RecordApiCall
  signature: void BotSpawnerAdapter::RecordApiCall(uint64 durationMicroseconds)
documentation:
  brief: Records an API call duration for performance monitoring and logging purposes.
  description: The RecordApiCall method is used to log the execution time of a specific
    API call within the BotSpawnerAdapter class. This method accepts a duration value
    in microseconds and stores it for later analysis or reporting. It is typically
    invoked after completing an API operation to track performance metrics, which
    can be useful for identifying bottlenecks or optimizing bot behavior in World
    of Warcraft environments. The recorded data may contribute to overall system performance
    monitoring and debugging efforts.
  parameters:
  - name: durationMicroseconds
    description: The time taken to execute the API call, measured in microseconds.
      This value represents the elapsed time from when the call began until it completed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint64 executionTime = 1500; // 1.5 milliseconds

      botSpawnerAdapter->RecordApiCall(executionTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Integration
    code: 'auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      // ... perform some API operation ...

      auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      uint64 duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end
      - start).count();

      botSpawnerAdapter->RecordApiCall(duration);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other performance tracking
    mechanisms within the TrinityCore framework. It's important to ensure that timing
    measurements are accurate and consistent across different systems. The recorded
    durations may be aggregated or stored in memory for later retrieval and analysis.
