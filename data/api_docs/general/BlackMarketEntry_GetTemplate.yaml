  class: BlackMarketEntry
  method: GetTemplate
  signature: const BlackMarketTemplate * BlackMarketEntry::GetTemplate() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the template associated with this black market entry.
  description: The GetTemplate method returns a constant pointer to the BlackMarketTemplate
    object that defines the properties and characteristics of this specific black
    market item entry. This template contains static data such as item ID, bid increments,
    duration, and other configuration values that govern how the item behaves within
    the black market system. The returned pointer is guaranteed to be valid during
    the lifetime of the BlackMarketEntry object and should not be modified directly.
    This method is commonly used by the black market subsystem to access item definitions
    when processing bids, displaying items, or managing auction lifecycle events.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to the BlackMarketTemplate associated with this entry.
    Returns nullptr if the entry has no valid template reference, which may occur
    during object initialization or in error conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Template Data for Item Display
    code: "void DisplayBlackMarketItem(BlackMarketEntry const* entry)\n{\n    if (entry)\n\
      \    {\n        BlackMarketTemplate const* template = entry->GetTemplate();\n\
      \        if (template)\n        {\n            // Use template data to display\
      \ item information\n            sLog->outString(\"Item ID: %u, Duration: %u\
      \ seconds\", \n                           template->ItemId, template->Duration);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Bid Validity Against Template
    code: "bool IsBidValid(BlackMarketEntry const* entry, uint32 bidAmount)\n{\n \
      \   if (!entry) return false;\n    \n    BlackMarketTemplate const* template\
      \ = entry->GetTemplate();\n    if (!template) return false;\n    \n    // Check\
      \ if bid meets minimum increment requirements\n    return bidAmount >= template->MinBid\
      \ + template->BidIncrement;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned BlackMarketTemplate pointer should be treated as read-only.
    Modifications to the template data structure are not recommended and may lead
    to undefined behavior. The method is thread-safe for read operations, but concurrent
    modifications to the underlying template data should be avoided.
  warnings: Do not store the returned pointer beyond the lifetime of the BlackMarketEntry
    object, as it may become invalid if the entry is destroyed or reinitialized. Always
    check for null return values before dereferencing the pointer.
