documentation:
  brief: Updates the black market manager's state and timers.
  description: The Update method is responsible for maintaining the state of the BlackMarketMgr,
    including updating auction timers, checking for expired auctions, and managing
    the overall black market interface. This method is typically called periodically
    by the game loop to ensure that black market auctions are properly managed and
    that the UI reflects current auction statuses. It handles internal state synchronization
    and may trigger events or notifications when auction states change.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void UpdateBlackMarket()\n{\n    sBlackMarketMgr->Update(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly, typically from the main game loop
    or a dedicated update thread. The updateTime parameter controls whether internal
    timers are updated; setting it to false may skip timer-based operations for performance
    reasons.
