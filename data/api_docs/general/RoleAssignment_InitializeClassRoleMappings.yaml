  signature: void RoleAssignment::InitializeClassRoleMappings()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the mapping of player classes to their assigned roles within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The InitializeClassRoleMappings method sets up internal data structures
    that associate each playable class with its default role in group scenarios. This
    function is typically called during server initialization or when loading configuration
    settings related to role assignment. It ensures that all classes have a defined
    role (such as tank, healer, or damage dealer) which is used by the group management
    system and raid planning tools. The method does not accept any parameters and
    performs no direct return operations; instead, it populates internal mappings
    for later use by other methods in the RoleAssignment class.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Startup
    code: 'RoleAssignment roleAssign;

      roleAssign.InitializeClassRoleMappings();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be invoked once during the initialization phase of
    the server to avoid overwriting existing mappings. It relies on hardcoded or configuration-based
    class-to-role associations and does not dynamically adjust based on runtime conditions.
