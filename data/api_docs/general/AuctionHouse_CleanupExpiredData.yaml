  brief: Removes expired auction entries from the auction house database
  description: The CleanupExpiredData method is responsible for removing all auction
    items that have exceeded their auction duration and are no longer valid. This
    method iterates through the auction house database, identifies auctions with expiration
    timestamps that are earlier than the current time, and removes them from the system.
    It ensures that the auction house inventory remains clean and up-to-date by automatically
    purging expired listings. The cleanup process typically occurs periodically as
    part of the server's maintenance routines to prevent accumulation of stale auction
    data.

    code: 'AuctionHouse* ah = sAuctionHouseMgr;

      ah->CleanupExpiredData();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the server's periodic cleanup routines
    and should not be invoked manually in most cases. The method operates on the auction
    house database directly, so it may have performance implications during high-traffic
    periods when many auctions are expiring simultaneously.
