  class: PositionStrategyBase
  method: CalculateCircleFormation
  signature: int PositionStrategyBase::CalculateCircleFormation(int bots, Unit * target,
    float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal circular formation position for a specified
    number of bots around a target unit.
  description: The CalculateCircleFormation method determines the appropriate positioning
    for a group of bots arranged in a circular formation around a given target unit.
    It computes the angular distribution and spatial coordinates of each bot to ensure
    even spacing and optimal tactical positioning. This method is typically used in
    AI systems where multiple units need to maintain a defensive or offensive circle
    around a central point, such as in group combat scenarios or when forming protective
    formations. The method takes into account the number of bots, the target unit's
    position, and a specified radius for the formation.
  parameters:
  - name: bots
    description: The number of bots to position in the circular formation. Must be
      a positive integer greater than zero.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target Unit around which the bots will be positioned.
      Cannot be null.
  - name: radius
    description: The radius of the circular formation in yards. Must be a positive
      floating-point value.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of successfully calculated positions
    for the bots in the formation. A return value of zero indicates failure, while
    a positive value indicates the number of valid positions computed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Circle Formation Calculation
    code: "Unit* target = player;\nint botCount = 5;\nfloat radius = 10.0f;\nint result\
      \ = positionStrategy->CalculateCircleFormation(botCount, target, radius);\n\
      if (result > 0) {\n    // Successfully calculated positions for 5 bots\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "Unit* target = nullptr;\nint botCount = 3;\nfloat radius = 15.0f;\nint\
      \ result = positionStrategy->CalculateCircleFormation(botCount, target, radius);\n\
      if (result <= 0) {\n    // Handle error case - invalid parameters or failure\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Failed to calculate circle formation\");\n} else {\n \
      \   // Proceed with using the calculated positions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the target unit is valid and accessible. It does
    not modify the actual positions of units in the game world, but rather calculates
    theoretical positions for use in AI logic or pathfinding calculations. The implementation
    may be affected by the specific positioning constraints of the AI system it's
    integrated with.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid undefined behavior. The radius parameter should be carefully chosen to prevent
    bots from overlapping or placing them outside of valid game boundaries.
