  class: Corpse
  method: SetFaction
  signature: void Corpse::SetFaction(int faction)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the faction ID for the corpse object, determining its relationship with
    other game entities.
  description: The SetFaction method assigns a specific faction ID to a Corpse object,
    which controls how the corpse interacts with other units in the game world. This
    includes determining whether the corpse is considered hostile, friendly, or neutral
    to various factions. The faction ID influences visibility, loot distribution,
    and AI behavior related to the corpse. This method typically updates internal
    faction data stored within the corpse's object state and may trigger associated
    events or visual changes depending on the faction assignment.
  parameters:
  - name: faction
    description: The faction ID to assign to the corpse. Valid values correspond to
      faction IDs defined in the game's faction database, typically ranging from 0
      to several thousand depending on the expansion and custom content.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Assigning a Neutral Faction to a Corpse
    code: 'Corpse* corpse = player->GetCorpse();

      corpse->SetFaction(35); // Assigns the ''Neutral'' faction ID'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Hostile Faction for Player Corpse
    code: 'Corpse* corpse = player->GetCorpse();

      corpse->SetFaction(14); // Assigns the ''Horde'' faction ID for hostile behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal faction state of the corpse object.
    Changes may affect how the corpse is treated by AI systems, quest completion conditions,
    and loot eligibility. The faction ID must correspond to a valid entry in the game's
    faction database or behavior may be undefined.
  warnings: Setting an invalid or non-existent faction ID can cause unexpected behavior
    or errors in AI interactions. This method should not be called during critical
    gameplay events where faction state is actively being processed, as it may lead
    to race conditions or inconsistent states.
