documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes all gossip menu items from the database into memory
    for use in World of Warcraft NPC interactions.
  description: The LoadGossipMenuItems method is responsible for loading all gossip
    menu items from the database tables into the game's memory cache. This method
    is typically called during server startup or when reloading gossip data. It processes
    entries from tables such as `gossip_menu`, `gossip_menu_option`, and related gossip
    tables to build in-memory structures that support NPC dialogue systems. The loaded
    gossip items define what options appear when players interact with NPCs, including
    quest gossips, vendor menus, and general dialogue choices. This method ensures
    that all gossip-related data is available for real-time use during player-NPC
    interactions without requiring repeated database queries.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during server initialization
    code: "void World::LoadGossipData()\n{\n    sObjectMgr->LoadGossipMenuItems();\n\
      \    // Other gossip-related loading\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked during server startup sequence and may be
    called again during hot-reloading of game data. It's important to note that this
    method modifies internal caches and should not be called while active player sessions
    are processing gossip interactions. The method performs database queries to fetch
    all gossip entries, so performance can vary depending on the number of gossip
    items in the database.
  warnings: Calling this method during active gameplay sessions may cause inconsistent
    behavior or crashes if players are currently interacting with NPCs that rely on
    these gossip menus. It should only be called during server initialization or controlled
    reload scenarios when no active player interactions are occurring.
