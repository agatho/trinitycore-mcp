  brief: Sends the guild roster to the player's session, including member details
    and guild information.
  description: The HandleRoster method is responsible for constructing and sending
    a comprehensive guild roster to the specified WorldSession. This roster includes
    detailed information about each guild member such as their name, rank, online
    status, level, class, and last seen time. The method ensures that the player receives
    an up-to-date view of their guild's composition and status. It typically gets
    invoked when a player opens their guild window or requests a roster update. This
    functionality is integral to World of Warcraft's guild management system, allowing
    players to monitor their guild members' availability and roles.

    code: "void HandleGuildRosterCommand(WorldSession* session)\n{\n    if (Player*\
      \ player = session->GetPlayer())\n    {\n        if (Guild* guild = player->GetGuild())\n\
      \        {\n            guild->HandleRoster(session);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally handles packet construction and sending, so developers
    should not manually send packets after calling it. The roster data is fetched
    from the guild's internal member list, which may be cached or refreshed depending
    on the server configuration.
  warnings: Ensure that the player has a valid guild membership before calling this
    method to prevent potential null pointer exceptions. This method does not validate
    session state, so callers should confirm the session is active.
