  class: BattlePetMgr
  method: RemovePet
  signature: void BattlePetMgr::RemovePet(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a battle pet with the specified GUID from the player's collection.
  description: The RemovePet method removes a specific battle pet from the player's
    active battle pet collection. This method is typically used when a pet is released,
    traded, or lost during gameplay. The method takes a single integer parameter representing
    the unique identifier (GUID) of the pet to be removed. It performs no validation
    on the GUID itself, so calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID
    may result in undefined behavior. This operation modifies the player's battle
    pet data and is generally irreversible without restoring from a backup or reacquiring
    the pet through game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the battle pet to be removed. This
      should correspond to a valid battle pet in the player's collection.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BattlePetMgr* petManager = player->GetBattlePetMgr();

      petManager->RemovePet(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Removal
    code: "BattlePetMgr* petManager = player->GetBattlePetMgr();\nif (petManager->HasPet(12345))\
      \ {\n    petManager->RemovePet(12345);\n    // Pet successfully removed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's battle pet collection data. It
    is recommended to verify that the pet exists before calling this method to avoid
    potential errors or inconsistencies in the player's pet list. The method does
    not trigger any UI updates or notifications, so additional code may be required
    to reflect the change in the user interface.
  warnings: Calling RemovePet with an invalid GUID can lead to undefined behavior
    or data corruption. Ensure that the GUID corresponds to a valid battle pet before
    invoking this method. Additionally, this method does not perform any checks for
    pet ownership or game state validation, so it should only be called when appropriate
    game conditions are met.
