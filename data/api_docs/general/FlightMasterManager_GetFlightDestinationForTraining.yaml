documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the destination ID for a flight path used in training.
  description: The GetFlightDestinationForTraining method returns the unique identifier
    of the flight destination that is associated with a training-related flight path.
    This typically corresponds to a specific location in the game world where players
    can learn or practice flight paths. The returned value represents the destination
    node in the flight master's path table and is used internally by the game engine
    to manage player flight training sessions and teleportation logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the unique identifier of the flight destination
    used for training purposes. This ID corresponds to a specific waypoint or location
    in the game world's flight path system.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Flight Destination for Training
    code: "uint32 destinationId = flightMasterManager.GetFlightDestinationForTraining();\n\
      if (destinationId != 0)\n{\n    // Use destinationId to determine training location\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Training destination ID: %u\", destinationId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during flight master interaction or player
    training events. The returned value should be validated against the game's flight
    path database to ensure it represents a valid destination node.
