  class: PlayerDumpReader
  method: LoadDumpFromString
  signature: DumpReturn PlayerDumpReader::LoadDumpFromString(const std::string & dump,
    int account, std::string name, int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Loads and processes a player dump string into the database for the specified
    account and character name.
  description: The LoadDumpFromString method parses a player dump string, which typically
    contains serialized character data including inventory, skills, quests, and other
    game state information. It validates the dump data against the provided account
    ID and character name, then imports the data into the TrinityCore database. This
    method is commonly used for character restoration, migration, or administrative
    operations where existing character data needs to be reimported into the game
    world. The method performs internal validation checks on the dump format and ensures
    consistency with the target account and GUID before committing changes.
  parameters:
  - name: dump
    description: The serialized player dump string containing all character data including
      inventory, skills, quests, and game state information
  - name: account
    description: The account ID to which the character belongs, used for validation
      and database association
  - name: name
    description: The character name associated with the dump data, used for verification
      and database lookup
  - name: guid
    description: The unique global identifier (GUID) of the character, used to ensure
      proper data mapping in the database
  returns: Returns a DumpReturn enum value indicating success or failure status of
    the dump loading operation. Possible values include DUMP_SUCCESS, DUMP_INVALID_DATA,
    DUMP_ACCOUNT_MISMATCH, DUMP_NAME_MISMATCH, and DUMP_ERROR.
  examples:
  - title: Basic character dump loading
    code: "std::string dumpData = \"...serialized character data...\";\nPlayerDumpReader\
      \ reader;\nDumpReturn result = reader.LoadDumpFromString(dumpData, 12345, \"\
      TestCharacter\", 67890);\nif (result == DUMP_SUCCESS) {\n    printf(\"Character\
      \ dump loaded successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"Failed to load character\
      \ dump with error code: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs extensive validation of the input dump data and should
    only be called with properly formatted dump strings. The method may block during
    database operations, so it's recommended to use it in a background thread for
    better performance. Ensure that the account ID and character name match existing
    records to avoid validation failures.
  warnings: Calling this method with malformed or corrupted dump data can result in
    database inconsistencies or partial character restoration. Always validate the
    dump string format before calling this method, and ensure that the target account
    and character name are valid. This operation modifies the database directly and
    should be used carefully in production environments.
