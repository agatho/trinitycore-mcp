  class: DefensiveBehaviorManager
  method: GetClassDefensives
  signature: int DefensiveBehaviorManager::GetClassDefensives(uint8 classId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of defensive abilities available for a specified class
    in the DefensiveBehaviorManager.
  description: The GetClassDefensives method returns the number of defensive abilities
    configured for a given class ID within the DefensiveBehaviorManager. This method
    is used to determine how many defensive actions are available for a specific player
    class, which can be useful for AI decision-making or behavior customization. The
    method likely accesses internal data structures that map class IDs to their respective
    defensive ability counts. It assumes that the class ID provided corresponds to
    a valid class in the game's database and that the DefensiveBehaviorManager has
    been properly initialized with class-specific defensive data.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the count of defensive abilities available for
    the specified class. Returns 0 if the class ID is invalid or no defensive abilities
    are configured for that class.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int defensives = manager->GetClassDefensives(CLASS_WARRIOR); // Returns
      number of defensive abilities for Warriors
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Error Checking
    code: "uint8 playerClass = player->getClass();\nint defensiveCount = manager->GetClassDefensives(playerClass);\n\
      if (defensiveCount > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with AI logic that uses defensive\
      \ abilities\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"ai\", \"Player class {} has {} defensive abilities\
      \ available.\", playerClass, defensiveCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on cached or precomputed data structures for
    performance reasons. The class ID parameter should correspond to valid TrinityCore
    class constants (e.g., CLASS_WARRIOR, CLASS_PALADIN). The method may be called
    frequently during AI decision-making processes, so it's expected to have low computational
    overhead.
  warnings: Ensure that the classId parameter is validated before calling this method,
    as invalid class IDs might lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. This
    method should not be used in contexts where real-time class data changes are expected
    without proper synchronization.
