  signature: void DungeonBehavior::PrioritizeHealingTargets(Player * healer, const
    int & groupMembers)
documentation:
  brief: Prioritizes healing targets for a healer based on group member health status
    and proximity.
  description: The PrioritizeHealingTargets method determines the optimal order in
    which a healer should focus their healing efforts within a dungeon group. It evaluates
    the health percentages and positional proximity of all group members to identify
    the most critical targets that require immediate attention. This method is typically
    invoked during combat situations when the healer needs to make quick decisions
    about where to direct their healing spells for maximum effectiveness. The prioritization
    logic considers both the severity of damage taken by group members and their relative
    positions to ensure efficient resource allocation.
  parameters:
  - name: healer
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the healer who will be
      performing the prioritization. Must not be null.
  - name: groupMembers
    description: Reference to an integer indicating the number of group members currently
      in the dungeon. Used to determine how many targets need to be evaluated for
      healing priority.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a healer AI context
    code: "void MyHealerAI::OnCombatStart(Player* healer)\n{\n    int groupCount =\
      \ GetGroupMemberCount();\n    DungeonBehavior::PrioritizeHealingTargets(healer,\
      \ groupCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom healing logic
    code: "void CustomDungeonAI::HandleHealing()\n{\n    Player* myHealer = GetHealer();\n\
      \    if (myHealer && myHealer->IsInCombat())\n    {\n        int memberCount\
      \ = GetGroupSize();\n        DungeonBehavior::PrioritizeHealingTargets(myHealer,\
      \ memberCount);\n        // Proceed with healing logic using prioritized targets\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core dungeon AI behavior system in TrinityCore
    and should only be called during active combat scenarios. The method assumes that
    all group members are within the same instance and have valid health states. Performance
    is optimized for small to medium-sized groups (up to 25 players), though larger
    groups may experience slight delays due to target evaluation complexity.
  warnings: Ensure that the healer pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. The groupMembers parameter
    must accurately reflect the current number of alive group members; incorrect values
    may lead to improper prioritization logic and suboptimal healing decisions.
