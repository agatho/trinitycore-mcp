documentation:
  brief: Calculates the delay moment for destination based on launch delay parameter
  description: This method computes the delay moment for a spell's target destination
    using the launch delay parameter. It determines when the spell will reach its
    target location, taking into account the time it takes to travel from the caster
    to the target. The calculation involves converting the launch delay into milliseconds
    and then adding it to the current time to determine the future moment when the
    spell will arrive at its destination.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint64 value representing the timestamp when the spell will reach
    its destination, calculated as the sum of current time and launch delay converted
    to milliseconds
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'uint64 delayMoment = spell->CalculateDelayMomentForDst(2.5f);

      // delayMoment now contains the timestamp when the spell will arrive at target

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in spell processing logic to determine when
    a spell will arrive at its target location, which affects spell casting mechanics
    and timing. The calculation assumes that launchDelay represents the time in seconds
    between spell cast and target arrival.
  warnings: The method may not be accurate if the spell's launch delay is not properly
    set or if the current time is not correctly calculated. This method should only
    be used when dealing with spells that have a destination, as it will return invalid
    results for spells without targets.
