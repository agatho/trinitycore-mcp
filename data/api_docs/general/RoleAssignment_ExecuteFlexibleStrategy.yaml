  method: ExecuteFlexibleStrategy
  signature: void RoleAssignment::ExecuteFlexibleStrategy(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a flexible role assignment strategy for a group, dynamically distributing
    roles based on player capabilities and group composition.
  description: The ExecuteFlexibleStrategy method implements a dynamic role assignment
    system within TrinityCore's group management framework. This method analyzes the
    current group composition, including player classes, levels, and available roles,
    to intelligently assign appropriate roles such as tank, healer, or damage dealer.
    The strategy adapts to the group's needs and player availability, ensuring optimal
    team performance during raids or dungeons. It typically runs during group creation
    or when players join/leave a group, automatically redistributing roles to maintain
    balanced team composition. This method does not require explicit parameters as
    it operates on the internal state of the RoleAssignment object and the provided
    Group pointer.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Group Management
    code: "RoleAssignment roleAssign;\nGroup* myGroup = sObjectMgr->GetGroupById(12345);\n\
      if (myGroup)\n{\n    roleAssign.ExecuteFlexibleStrategy(myGroup);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the group management system
    when group composition changes. It may trigger role reassignment events that other
    systems can listen to for synchronization purposes.
  warnings: The method assumes that the Group pointer passed is valid and properly
    initialized. Calling this method with a null or improperly initialized group pointer
    could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
