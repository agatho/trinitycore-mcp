  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleLinkedSummon(const AuraApplication * aurApp, uint8
    mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Handles the summoning of linked creatures when an aura is applied or removed.
  description: The HandleLinkedSummon method manages the summoning behavior of creatures
    that are linked to a specific aura effect. This function is invoked during aura
    application or removal to either summon or dismiss summoned creatures associated
    with the aura. It ensures proper positioning, faction handling, and lifecycle
    management of linked summons based on the aura's state and mode. The method operates
    within the context of TrinityCore's aura system and interacts with creature summoning
    mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. Contains information about the aura's target, caster, and
      application state.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation indicating how the summon should be handled.
      Typically represents different summoning behaviors or states within the aura
      system.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the aura is being applied (true)
      or removed (false). Controls the summoning or dismissal behavior accordingly.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in aura effect handler
    code: "void MyAuraEffect::HandleLinkedSummon(const AuraApplication* aurApp, uint8\
      \ mode, bool apply) const {\n    if (apply) {\n        // Summon linked creature\n\
      \        SummonLinkedCreature(aurApp->GetTarget(), mode);\n    } else {\n  \
      \      // Remove linked creature\n        RemoveLinkedCreature(aurApp->GetTarget());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore aura system.
    Developers should ensure that any summoned creatures are properly managed to prevent
    memory leaks or orphaned entities. The mode parameter may influence summoning
    behavior such as duration, positioning, or faction settings.
  warnings: Improper handling of linked summons can lead to orphaned creatures or
    incorrect targeting. Ensure that all summoned creatures are properly tracked and
    cleaned up when the aura is removed. This method should not be called directly
    without proper aura context.
