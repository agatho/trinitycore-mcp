  class: PlayerAI
  method: SetIsRangedAttacker
  signature: void PlayerAI::SetIsRangedAttacker(bool state)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the player is considered a ranged attacker in AI behavior.
  description: The SetIsRangedAttacker method configures the PlayerAI instance to
    treat the associated player as either a ranged or melee attacker. This flag influences
    various AI decision-making processes, such as spell selection, targeting behavior,
    and attack pattern execution. The state affects how the AI evaluates combat situations
    and determines appropriate actions during encounters. This method is typically
    used internally by the core AI system but can be called externally to override
    default behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: state
    description: Boolean value indicating whether the player should be treated as
      a ranged attacker. True enables ranged attacker behavior, false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Ranged Attacker Mode
    code: 'PlayerAI* ai = player->GetAI();

      ai->SetIsRangedAttacker(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Ranged Attacker Mode
    code: 'PlayerAI* ai = player->GetAI();

      ai->SetIsRangedAttacker(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal AI state flags. Changes take immediate
    effect and may influence ongoing combat behavior. The flag is typically managed
    automatically by the core AI system based on player's current weapon type and
    equipped ranged weapons.
