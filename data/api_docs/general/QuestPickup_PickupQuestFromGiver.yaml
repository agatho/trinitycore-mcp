  class: QuestPickup
  method: PickupQuestFromGiver
  signature: bool QuestPickup::PickupQuestFromGiver(Player * bot, uint32 questGiverGuid,
    uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the quest pickup process from a quest giver for a specified player.
  description: The PickupQuestFromGiver method handles the logic required to allow
    a player character to accept and begin a quest from a quest giver NPC. It validates
    that the quest giver is valid, checks if the player can accept the quest, and
    updates the player's quest log accordingly. This method is typically used in AI
    scripts or quest automation systems within TrinityCore. The method ensures proper
    state transitions for the quest and handles necessary database updates to reflect
    the new quest status.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character who will
      pick up the quest.
  - name: questGiverGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the quest giver NPC that offers the
      quest.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to be picked up.
  returns: Returns true if the quest was successfully picked up and added to the player's
    quest log; otherwise, returns false if the operation failed due to invalid parameters,
    quest giver issues, or quest acceptance restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Pickup
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 questGiverGuid = 12345;\nuint32 questId =\
      \ 67890;\nbool success = QuestPickup::PickupQuestFromGiver(player, questGiverGuid,\
      \ questId);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Quest pickup successful\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Quest Pickup with Error Handling
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 questGiverGuid = 12345;\nuint32 questId =\
      \ 67890;\n\nif (!player)\n{\n    // Handle invalid player\n    return false;\n\
      }\n\nbool success = QuestPickup::PickupQuestFromGiver(player, questGiverGuid,\
      \ questId);\nif (!success)\n{\n    // Log error or notify user\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to pickup quest %u from giver %u\", questId, questGiverGuid);\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Quest successfully started\n    player->SendQuestUpdateAddItem(questId,\
      \ 0, 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the quest giver is within the player's interaction
    range and that the player meets all prerequisites for accepting the quest. It
    does not perform checks on quest availability or completion status; those should
    be handled by calling code before invoking this method.
  warnings: Ensure that the questGiverGuid corresponds to a valid NPC in the world
    database, otherwise the method will fail silently or cause unexpected behavior.
    Also, calling this method without proper validation may lead to invalid quest
    states in the player's log.
