  signature: bool MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::HasCorrectAspect() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the marksmanship hunter has the correct aspect active.
  description: The HasCorrectAspect method determines whether the current marksmanship
    hunter character has the appropriate aspect buff applied. This is a critical check
    for hunter gameplay mechanics, particularly for marksmanship specialization where
    specific aspects provide essential stat bonuses and abilities. The method evaluates
    the hunter's current buff state against expected aspect requirements to ensure
    proper gameplay functionality and ability usage. It typically returns true when
    the correct aspect is active and false otherwise, enabling conditional logic in
    AI behavior or spell casting routines.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the hunter has the correct aspect active; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (hunter->HasCorrectAspect()) {\n    // Proceed with aspect-affected\
      \ abilities\n    hunter->CastSpell(target, SPELL_AIMED_SHOT);\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Apply correct aspect before casting\n    hunter->CastSpell(hunter, SPELL_ASPECT_OF_THE_HAWK);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with spell cooldown management
    code: "if (hunter->HasCorrectAspect() && !hunter->HasSpellCooldown(SPELL_STEADY_SHOT))\
      \ {\n    hunter->CastSpell(target, SPELL_STEADY_SHOT);\n} else if (!hunter->HasCorrectAspect())\
      \ {\n    // Ensure aspect is applied\n    hunter->ApplyAspect(SPELL_ASPECT_OF_THE_HAWK);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks for specific aspect buffs such as Aspect of the
    Hawk or Aspect of the Monkey, which are fundamental to marksmanship hunter gameplay.
    The implementation may involve checking the hunter's current aura state or buff
    list against expected aspect types. Performance-wise, this is a lightweight check
    that typically involves simple buff state validation.
  warnings: This method should not be used in isolation for spell casting decisions
    without considering other prerequisites like mana availability or target conditions.
    Additionally, the exact aspect requirements may vary based on the hunter's current
    specialization or talent configuration.
