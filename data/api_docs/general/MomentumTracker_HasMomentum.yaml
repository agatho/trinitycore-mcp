  class: MomentumTracker
  method: HasMomentum
  signature: bool MomentumTracker::HasMomentum() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the tracker currently has momentum applied.
  description: The HasMomentum method determines if a MomentumTracker instance currently
    possesses active momentum. This is typically used in game mechanics where certain
    abilities or effects grant temporary momentum to units, influencing their movement
    or action behavior. The method evaluates internal state flags or counters to make
    this determination. It does not modify any tracked state and is read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the tracker currently has momentum applied; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (tracker.HasMomentum()) {\n    // Perform action when momentum is active\n\
      \    DoMomentumBasedAction();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic with Momentum
    code: "void UpdatePlayerMovement() {\n    if (playerTracker.HasMomentum()) {\n\
      \        player->SetSpeed(MOVE_RUN, 2.0f); // Increase speed\n    } else {\n\
      \        player->SetSpeed(MOVE_RUN, 1.0f); // Normal speed\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during game updates or state checks.
    It's recommended to cache the result if the momentum state is checked multiple
    times within a single frame to avoid redundant evaluations.
