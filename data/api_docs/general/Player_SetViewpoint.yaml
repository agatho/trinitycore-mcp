  class: Player
  method: SetViewpoint
  signature: void Player::SetViewpoint(int * target, bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's viewpoint to a target position or object.
  description: The SetViewpoint method allows a player to adjust their camera view
    to focus on a specific target position or object within the game world. This method
    is commonly used in conjunction with other camera-related functions to control
    player perspective during gameplay, particularly when dealing with quest objectives,
    NPC interactions, or movement sequences. It typically involves setting the viewpoint
    to either a fixed point or an entity such as an NPC or object, and can be applied
    or removed based on game mechanics requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target position or object that the player's viewpoint
      should focus on. This parameter is typically used in conjunction with a coordinate
      system to define the camera's target point.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply or remove the viewpoint
      adjustment. When true, the player's camera view is set to the target; when false,
      the viewpoint is removed and the default camera perspective is restored.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic viewpoint setting example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      int targetPosition[3] = {10, 20, 30};

      player->SetViewpoint(targetPosition, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced viewpoint setting with object reference
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      int targetPosition[3] = {10, 20, 30};

      player->SetViewpoint(targetPosition, false);

      // This would remove the viewpoint and restore default camera perspective'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other camera control functions
    to manage player perspective during gameplay. It may be subject to game mechanics
    restrictions depending on the context of use, such as during quest progression
    or NPC interaction.
  warnings: Improper use of this method could lead to unexpected camera behavior or
    player movement issues. Ensure that the target position is valid and that the
    apply flag is correctly set to avoid unintended consequences.
