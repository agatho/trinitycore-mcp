  signature: void LFGQueue::AddToQueue(int guid, bool reAdd)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a player to the LFG queue with optional re-add functionality.
  description: The AddToQueue method is responsible for inserting a player into the
    Looking For Group (LFG) queue system. It takes a player's unique identifier (GUID)
    and a boolean flag indicating whether the player should be re-added if they are
    already present in the queue. This method is typically invoked when a player initiates
    a LFG search or attempts to rejoin an existing group request. The method ensures
    proper handling of queue state management, including checking for existing entries
    and updating internal data structures accordingly. It integrates with TrinityCore's
    LFG framework to maintain synchronization between player requests and dungeon
    group matching logic.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to be added to the LFG
      queue. This value must correspond to a valid player in the game world.
  - name: reAdd
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether to re-add the player if they are
      already in the queue. If true, the player will be removed from their current
      position and re-added at the end of the queue; if false, no action is taken
      for existing entries.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to add a player to LFG queue
    code: 'LFGQueue* lfgQueue = sLFGMgr->GetLFGQueueForPlayer(playerGuid);

      lfgQueue->AddToQueue(playerGuid, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Re-adding a player to LFG queue with reset
    code: 'LFGQueue* lfgQueue = sLFGMgr->GetLFGQueueForPlayer(playerGuid);

      lfgQueue->AddToQueue(playerGuid, true); // Forces re-add and resets position'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player GUID is valid and corresponds to an active
    player in the game world. It performs internal checks for existing queue entries
    and manages state transitions accordingly. The method may trigger updates to LFG
    group matching logic depending on the current queue configuration.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent player GUID can lead
    to undefined behavior. Ensure that the player is properly logged in and exists
    in the world before calling this function. Improper use of the reAdd flag might
    cause unexpected queue ordering or duplicate entries.
