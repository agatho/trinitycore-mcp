documentation:
  brief: Respawns all game objects and creatures in the current map instance
  description: The RespawnDo method triggers a full respawn of all game objects and
    creatures within the current map instance. This method is typically used during
    world state changes, instance resets, or when restoring the initial spawn state
    of entities in a zone. It ensures that all dynamic elements such as NPCs, game
    objects, and lootable items are reset to their original spawn positions and states.
    The method operates on the active map context and does not require any parameters.
    This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper game state consistency during
    instance resets or world events.

  - title: Basic Respawn Usage
    code: "void HandleWorldReset()\n{\n    // Trigger full respawn of current map\n\
      \    sMap->RespawnDo();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the map is in a valid state for respawning.
    It may cause performance impact on large maps with many entities. The method operates
    synchronously and blocks execution until all respawns are complete.
  warnings: Calling this method during active combat or high-traffic periods may cause
    noticeable lag. Ensure that no players are actively engaged in critical gameplay
    events before invoking this method.
