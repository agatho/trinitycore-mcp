documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the NPC should teach a specific spell to the player.
  description: The ShouldLearnSpell method evaluates if an NPC interaction should
    result in the player learning a particular spell. This method is typically used
    during NPC dialogue or quest interactions where spell learning is involved. It
    checks various conditions such as player level requirements, spell availability,
    and faction restrictions to determine if the spell can be learned. The method
    does not perform the actual spell learning but rather returns a boolean value
    indicating whether the action should proceed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the NPC should teach the spell to the player based on all
    applicable conditions; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in NPC Dialogue
    code: "if (npcInteractionManager->ShouldLearnSpell(12345)) {\n    player->LearnSpell(12345);\n\
      \    player->SendSpellLearned(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spell Learning Check
    code: "uint32 spellToLearn = 67890;\nif (npcInteractionManager->ShouldLearnSpell(spellToLearn))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with spell learning logic\n    player->LearnSpell(spellToLearn);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle case where spell cannot be learned\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      You are not eligible to learn this spell.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other NPC interaction logic
    such as quest completion checks and player state validation. It's important to
    note that the actual spell learning process (e.g., calling LearnSpell) should
    be handled separately after this check.
  warnings: Do not assume that a positive return value guarantees successful spell
    learning. Additional validation may be required for complex spell learning conditions
    such as prerequisites, skill requirements, or reputation levels.
