documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a creature starts threatening the player
  description: The JustStartedThreateningMe method is invoked by the NullCreatureAI
    class when a creature begins to threaten the player. This method serves as a callback
    for AI behavior, allowing custom logic to be executed when threat engagement occurs.
    It typically handles initial threat response actions such as initiating combat,
    playing sound effects, or triggering visual effects. The method is part of the
    creature's AI system and is called automatically by the core engine when threat
    conditions are met.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer parameter that may contain threat-related data
      or context information. The exact meaning depends on implementation details
      within the AI system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Implementation Example
    code: "void NullCreatureAI::JustStartedThreateningMe(int* param0)\n{\n    // Log\
      \ threat start event\n    sLog->outString(\"Creature started threatening player\"\
      );\n    \n    // Play threat sound effect\n    if (param0 != nullptr)\n    {\n\
      \        // Use param0 for additional context if needed\n        SendAIEventAround(AI_EVENT_THREATENING_START,\
      \ nullptr, nullptr);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the AI update loop and should
    not perform heavy operations. The parameter may be used for passing additional
    context about the threat situation to allow for more nuanced behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that param0 is checked for null before dereferencing to prevent
    access violations. This method is part of the internal AI framework and should
    not be overridden in custom AI implementations without understanding the core
    engine behavior.
