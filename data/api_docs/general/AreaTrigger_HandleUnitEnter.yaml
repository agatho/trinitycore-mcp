  class: AreaTrigger
  method: HandleUnitEnter
  signature: void AreaTrigger::HandleUnitEnter(Unit * unit)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a unit enters the area trigger's effect zone
  description: The HandleUnitEnter method is invoked when a Unit (player or creature)
    enters the area trigger's active zone. This method typically processes the trigger's
    effects, such as applying spells, sending messages, or initiating quest events.
    It serves as the primary callback for area trigger interactions and is responsible
    for executing the trigger's defined behavior upon unit entry. The method ensures
    proper handling of the entering unit's state and may modify the unit's condition
    or progress through game mechanics like quests or combat.
  parameters:
  - name: unit
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that has entered the area trigger zone.
      This can be a Player or Creature instance. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in custom area trigger handler
    code: "void MyAreaTrigger::HandleUnitEnter(Unit* unit)\n{\n    if (unit->IsPlayer())\n\
      \    {\n        Player* player = unit->ToPlayer();\n        player->AddItem(ITEM_ID,\
      \ 1);\n        player->SendNotification(\"You have entered the sacred area.\"\
      );\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with conditional trigger effects
    code: "void QuestAreaTrigger::HandleUnitEnter(Unit* unit)\n{\n    if (!unit ||\
      \ !unit->IsPlayer())\n        return;\n\n    Player* player = unit->ToPlayer();\n\
      \    if (player->GetQuestStatus(QUEST_ID) == QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE)\n    {\n\
      \        player->AreaExploredOrEventHappens(QUEST_ID);\n        player->CastSpell(player,\
      \ SPELL_ID, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the core game loop when unit movement
    intersects with an area trigger's boundaries. It should not be used to perform
    heavy computations as it may affect performance during frequent unit movement
    events. The method assumes that the unit pointer is valid and has already been
    validated before being passed.
  warnings: Do not modify the unit's position or state directly within this method
    unless necessary, as it can cause synchronization issues. Avoid calling methods
    that might recursively trigger area trigger events, which could lead to stack
    overflow or unexpected behavior.
