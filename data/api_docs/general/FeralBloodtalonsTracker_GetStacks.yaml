documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current stack count of the Feral Bloodtalons buff
  description: The GetStacks method returns the number of active stacks of the Feral
    Bloodtalons aura applied to the target. This tracker is used primarily for feral
    druids and their specialization mechanics, where each stack contributes to increased
    damage or other effects. The method performs no side effects and simply reads
    the current state of the buff stack count from internal tracking structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of active stacks of the Feral Bloodtalons
    buff. Returns zero if the buff is not active or has expired.
  examples:
  - title: Check current Feral Bloodtalons stacks on a target
    code: "Unit* target = ...; // Some unit with Feral Bloodtalons\nFeralBloodtalonsTracker*\
      \ tracker = target->GetFeralBloodtalonsTracker();\nuint32 stacks = tracker->GetStacks();\n\
      if (stacks > 0)\n{\n    // Apply logic based on active stacks\n    // e.g.,\
      \ increase damage by stacks * 10%\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other buff tracking mechanisms
    to determine the current state of a druid's Feral Bloodtalons effect. It does
    not modify any internal state and is safe to call multiple times during a single
    game tick.
