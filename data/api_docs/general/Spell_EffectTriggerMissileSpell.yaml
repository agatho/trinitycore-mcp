documentation:
  brief: Triggers a missile spell effect that launches projectiles toward target locations.
  description: This method handles the execution of spell effects that involve missile
    projectiles, typically used for spells like Arcane Missiles or other ranged attacks.
    It calculates the trajectory and applies the appropriate mechanics to determine
    how the missile interacts with targets. The method is part of the Spell class
    and is invoked during spell processing when a missile effect is required. It ensures
    proper handling of target selection and projectile movement based on spell data.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(player, spellInfo);

      spell->EffectTriggerMissileSpell();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the spell has a valid missile effect.
    It requires proper initialization of the spell and its target selection before
    execution. Performance considerations include handling of multiple targets and
    projectile movement calculations.
  warnings: Improper use may lead to incorrect targeting or projectile behavior, potentially
    causing game mechanics issues. Ensure that the spell is properly initialized before
    calling this method.
