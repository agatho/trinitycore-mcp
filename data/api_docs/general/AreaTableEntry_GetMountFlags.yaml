  class: AreaTableEntry
  method: GetMountFlags
  signature: int AreaTableEntry::GetMountFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the mount flags associated with the area table entry, indicating
    which mounts are allowed or restricted in that zone.
  description: The GetMountFlags method retrieves an integer value representing the
    mount flags for a specific area table entry. These flags determine which types
    of mounts can be used within the area, such as flying mounts, ground mounts, or
    restricted zones where no mounts are allowed. The returned value is typically
    a bitmask that combines various flag constants defined in the TrinityCore codebase.
    This method is commonly used during zone loading and player movement validation
    to enforce mount restrictions based on the current area's properties. The result
    directly influences gameplay mechanics related to player mobility and mount usage.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing a bitmask of mount flags for the area. Each
    bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific mount restriction or allowance,
    such as whether flying mounts are permitted, ground mounts are allowed, or if
    mount usage is completely disabled in that zone. The exact meaning of each flag
    bit depends on the internal flag definitions used by TrinityCore.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "AreaTableEntry* areaEntry = sAreaTableStore.LookupEntry(player->GetMap()->GetAreaId(player->GetPositionX(),\
      \ player->GetPositionY(), player->GetPositionZ()));\nif (areaEntry)\n{\n   \
      \ int mountFlags = areaEntry->GetMountFlags();\n    if (mountFlags & MOUNT_FLAG_FLYING)\n\
      \    {\n        // Flying mounts are allowed in this area\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Mount Restrictions
    code: "AreaTableEntry* entry = sAreaTableStore.LookupEntry(player->GetZoneId());\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    int flags = entry->GetMountFlags();\n    if (flags == 0)\n\
      \    {\n        // No mounts allowed in this zone\n        player->SendNotification(\"\
      Mounts are not allowed in this area.\");\n    }\n    else if (flags & MOUNT_FLAG_GROUND)\n\
      \    {\n        // Only ground mounts allowed\n        player->SendNotification(\"\
      Only ground mounts are permitted here.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is frequently called during zone transitions and movement validation.
    The mount flags are defined in the area table data and can be modified through
    database updates or custom configurations. Be aware that the bitmask values may
    vary between different TrinityCore versions or custom modifications to the core.
  warnings: The returned integer value represents a bitmask, so direct comparisons
    with specific flag values should use bitwise operations (e.g., 'flags & FLAG_VALUE')
    rather than equality checks. Incorrect handling of the bitmask could lead to unexpected
    behavior in mount restriction enforcement.
