  class: Player
  method: SetHeirloom
  signature: void Player::SetHeirloom(uint32 slot, int32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a player's heirloom item for a specified slot.
  description: The SetHeirloom method allows a player to assign an heirloom item to
    a specific slot in their character's heirloom collection. This method is used
    primarily for managing heirloom items that are part of the player's inventory,
    enabling players to set or update heirloom items based on their current progression.
    The method operates within the context of World of Warcraft's heirloom system,
    which allows players to acquire and manage heirloom items that provide benefits
    as they progress through content.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The slot index where the heirloom item will be placed. Valid values
      are 0-11, representing the 12 slots available for heirloom items.
  - name: itemId
    description: The item ID of the heirloom to set. A value of -1 indicates that
      no heirloom should be assigned to the slot, effectively removing it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetHeirloom(0, 12345); // Assigns item ID 12345 to slot 0'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Heirloom
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetHeirloom(5, -1); // Removes heirloom from slot 5'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with the Player::GetHeirloom
    method to manage the state of heirloom items. It should be called with proper
    validation of item IDs and slot indices to avoid invalid assignments. The implementation
    may involve updates to the player's inventory or database records depending on
    how the game handles heirloom data.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect item assignment or removal,
    potentially causing issues in gameplay progression or item display. It is recommended
    that developers verify the validity of item IDs before calling this method.
