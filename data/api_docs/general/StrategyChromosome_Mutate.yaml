  class: StrategyChromosome
  method: Mutate
  signature: void StrategyChromosome::Mutate(float mutationRate)
documentation:
  brief: Applies genetic mutation to the strategy chromosome based on the provided
    mutation rate.
  description: The Mutate method performs a genetic algorithm mutation operation on
    the StrategyChromosome instance. It modifies the chromosome's genes according
    to the specified mutation rate, which determines the probability that each gene
    will be altered. This method is typically used in evolutionary AI systems within
    TrinityCore to introduce variation into strategy populations during genetic algorithm
    iterations. The mutation process helps prevent premature convergence and maintains
    diversity in the population of strategies being evolved.
  parameters:
  - name: mutationRate
    description: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the probability that
      each gene will be mutated. A value of 0.0 means no mutation occurs, while 1.0
      means all genes will be mutated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Mutation Usage
    code: 'StrategyChromosome chromosome;

      chromosome.Mutate(0.05f); // Mutate with 5% probability per gene'
    language: cpp
  - title: High Mutation Rate for Exploration
    code: 'StrategyChromosome chromosome;

      chromosome.Mutate(0.3f); // Aggressive mutation for exploration phase'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the chromosome in-place and should only be called during
    genetic algorithm evolution cycles. The mutation process typically involves randomly
    selecting genes and applying random changes to their values. Performance is generally
    linear with respect to the number of genes in the chromosome.
  warnings: Calling this method with a mutation rate of 1.0 will completely randomize
    the chromosome, potentially destroying useful strategies. Ensure mutation rates
    are carefully tuned for your specific evolutionary algorithm implementation.
