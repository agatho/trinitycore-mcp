  method: GetEnemiesInRange
  signature: uint32 FrostMageRefactored::GetEnemiesInRange(float range) const
documentation:
  brief: Counts the number of enemy units within a specified range of the frost mage.
  description: The GetEnemiesInRange method determines how many hostile targets are
    located within a given radial distance from the frost mage's current position.
    This utility function is commonly used in AI decision-making processes to evaluate
    threat levels, determine optimal spell casting positions, or assess combat viability.
    The method performs a radius-based search using the game's internal target detection
    system and returns a count of all valid enemy units that fall within the specified
    range. It does not modify any state and is typically called during AI update cycles
    or spell preparation phases.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the total number of enemy units found
    within the specified range. A return value of zero indicates no enemies are present
    in the area, while higher values indicate increasing numbers of hostile targets.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Threat Assessment
    code: "uint32 enemyCount = frostMage->GetEnemiesInRange(10.0f);\nif (enemyCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Mage has enemies nearby, consider casting Frost Nova\n   \
      \ frostMage->CastSpell(frostMage->GetVictim(), SPELL_FROST_NOVA, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Enemy Count for Spell Selection
    code: "uint32 enemiesInRange = frostMage->GetEnemiesInRange(8.0f);\nif (enemiesInRange\
      \ >= 3)\n{\n    // Cast Blizzard for area damage\n    frostMage->CastSpell(nullptr,\
      \ SPELL_BLIZZARD, true);\n}\nelse if (enemiesInRange == 1)\n{\n    // Cast Frostbolt\
      \ for single target damage\n    frostMage->CastSpell(frostMage->GetVictim(),\
      \ SPELL_FROSTBOLT, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the game's internal target scanning system and may
    be affected by line-of-sight restrictions. The range parameter is typically measured
    in yards and accounts for the unit's collision radius. Performance-wise, this
    function performs a relatively lightweight search operation but should not be
    called excessively within tight loops without caching results.
  warnings: The method returns only enemies that are currently visible and within
    the defined range. It does not account for future movement or predicted positions
    of targets. Additionally, calling this method during combat while the mage is
    moving may return inconsistent results due to timing differences in target detection
    updates.
