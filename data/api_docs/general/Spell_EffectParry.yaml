  method: EffectParry
  signature: void Spell::EffectParry()
documentation:
  brief: Enables the spell to process parry mechanics, allowing the caster to avoid
    incoming attacks through parry.
  description: The EffectParry method is responsible for handling the parry mechanics
    within the TrinityCore spell system. It typically activates when a spell is cast
    and the target successfully parries an attack, either through a weapon or shield
    parry. This method ensures that the spell's parry effect is properly executed,
    including any associated cooldowns or resource consumption. The method is generally
    invoked during spell processing and can be used in conjunction with other parry-related
    mechanics such as parry chance calculations or defensive stance effects. It plays
    a crucial role in maintaining game balance by preventing excessive parry bonuses
    that could unbalance combat outcomes.

    code: "void Spell::EffectParry()\n{\n    // Implementation for handling parry\
      \ mechanics\n    // This method typically involves checking if the target can\
      \ parry\n    // and applying appropriate effects or cooldowns\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger spell processing system and should be used
    in conjunction with other defensive mechanics such as parry chance calculations.
    It requires proper handling of target states and may involve complex interactions
    with combat system logic.
  warnings: Improper implementation of this method can lead to unbalanced gameplay
    or incorrect parry mechanics, potentially causing issues with player defense or
    spell effectiveness.
