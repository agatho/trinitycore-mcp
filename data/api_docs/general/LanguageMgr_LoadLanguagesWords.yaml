documentation:
  brief: Loads language-specific word data into memory for use in game text processing
    and localization.
  description: The LoadLanguagesWords method initializes and populates internal data
    structures with language-specific word mappings and translations used by the TrinityCore
    server. This method is typically called during server startup or when language
    configuration changes occur. It processes language definitions, word lists, and
    translation tables from database or configuration sources to enable proper text
    localization for players. The loaded data supports in-game chat, quest text, NPC
    dialogue, and other localized content. This method ensures that the server can
    correctly interpret and display text according to player's selected language settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'LanguageMgr::instance()->LoadLanguagesWords();

      // Called during server startup to initialize language data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    language configuration needs to be refreshed. It performs database queries and
    memory allocations, so calling it repeatedly may cause performance degradation.
    The method assumes that the database connection is already established and that
    language data tables exist with proper structure.
  warnings: Do not call this method from within high-frequency update loops as it
    may block or cause performance issues. Ensure that all required database tables
    are properly populated before calling this method, otherwise it may fail silently
    or load incomplete data.
