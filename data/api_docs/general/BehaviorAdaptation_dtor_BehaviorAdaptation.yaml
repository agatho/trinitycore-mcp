documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BehaviorAdaptation instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BehaviorAdaptation class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the object's lifetime. This method ensures proper resource deallocation when an
    instance of BehaviorAdaptation goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In
    the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this may involve releasing behavior-related
    data structures, clearing internal state, and ensuring no memory leaks occur during
    the destruction of AI behaviors. The destructor does not take any parameters and
    performs no return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Destructor Usage
    code: 'BehaviorAdaptation* behavior = new BehaviorAdaptation();

      // ... use the behavior object ...

      delete behavior; // Triggers ~BehaviorAdaptation()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when an object
    goes out of scope or is deleted. Developers should not manually call this destructor
    unless implementing custom memory management patterns. The method should be noexcept
    to prevent exceptions during stack unwinding.
