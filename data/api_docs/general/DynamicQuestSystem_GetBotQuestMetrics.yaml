  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: GetBotQuestMetrics
  signature: QuestMetrics DynamicQuestSystem::GetBotQuestMetrics(uint32 botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves quest metrics for a specified bot character by its GUID.
  description: The GetBotQuestMetrics method fetches detailed quest-related statistics
    and progress data for a specific bot character identified by its unique Game Object
    ID (GUID). This function is typically used within the dynamic quest system to
    monitor or analyze bot behavior in relation to quest completion, tracking, and
    engagement. The returned QuestMetrics object contains information such as completed
    quests, active quests, quest progress percentages, and other relevant metrics
    that help evaluate how a bot interacts with the game's quest system. It assumes
    that the specified bot GUID corresponds to an existing bot character within the
    TrinityCore world state.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: A unique identifier (GUID) representing the bot character for which
      quest metrics are being retrieved. This value must correspond to a valid GameObject
      entry in the database, specifically one that represents a bot player.
  returns: Returns a QuestMetrics object containing aggregated data about the specified
    bot's quest activities, including counts of completed and active quests, progress
    statistics, and other relevant performance indicators.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Quest Metrics for a Bot
    code: 'uint32 botGuid = 12345;

      QuestMetrics metrics = dynamicQuestSystem.GetBotQuestMetrics(botGuid);

      // Use metrics to analyze bot quest behavior

      printf("Completed quests: %u\n", metrics.completedQuests);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves database queries or cached data lookups, so performance
    may vary depending on the number of quests tracked for a given bot. Ensure that
    the provided botGuid is valid and refers to an actual bot character before calling
    this function.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID could result
    in undefined behavior or errors. Always validate input parameters and ensure proper
    initialization of the DynamicQuestSystem instance.
