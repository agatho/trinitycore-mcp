documentation:
  brief: Checks and updates the artifact relic slot unlock status for the item's owner.
  description: The CheckArtifactRelicSlotUnlock method evaluates whether an artifact
    relic slot associated with this item should be unlocked for the player who owns
    it. This method is typically invoked when the item's state or the player's progress
    changes, such as when acquiring new artifact powers or reaching specific character
    levels. It ensures that the game logic correctly reflects the unlock status of
    relic slots in the context of World of Warcraft's artifact system. The method
    operates on the item's internal data and modifies its state based on the owner's
    current artifact progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Artifact Interaction
    code: "Item* artifactItem = player->GetItemByEntry(12345);\nif (artifactItem)\n\
      {\n    artifactItem->CheckArtifactRelicSlotUnlock(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the artifact relic system in TrinityCore and should
    only be called on items that are actually artifacts with relic slots. It does
    not perform any network communication or database updates directly; it modifies
    internal item state which may later be synchronized.
  warnings: Calling this method on non-artifact items or without a valid owner reference
    can lead to undefined behavior. Ensure the item is an artifact and the owner is
    a valid Player object before invoking.
