  class: DeathKnightAI
  method: GetNearbyEnemyCount
  signature: uint32 DeathKnightAI::GetNearbyEnemyCount(float range) const
documentation:
  brief: Counts the number of nearby enemy units within a specified range for the
    Death Knight AI.
  description: The GetNearbyEnemyCount method calculates and returns the total number
    of hostile units (enemies) that are currently within the defined range around
    the Death Knight AI's position. This method is typically used in AI decision-making
    processes to determine enemy density, which can influence tactical behavior such
    as spell selection or movement patterns. The method performs a radius-based search
    using the AI's current location and checks for units that are hostile to the Death
    Knight. It does not consider line of sight or other environmental factors, only
    proximity. This function is essential for implementing behaviors like AoE spell
    usage or positioning decisions based on enemy clustering.
  parameters:
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance in yards from the Death Knight's current position
      to search for enemies. Must be a positive value greater than zero.
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the count of enemy units found within the
    specified range. Returns 0 if no enemies are detected or if the range is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 enemyCount = ai->GetNearbyEnemyCount(10.0f);\nif (enemyCount > 3)\n\
      {\n    // Use AoE spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Range Based on Situation
    code: "float range = (ai->GetHealthPct() < 30) ? 15.0f : 8.0f;\nuint32 nearbyEnemies\
      \ = ai->GetNearbyEnemyCount(range);\nif (nearbyEnemies > 0)\n{\n    // Adjust\
      \ behavior based on enemy proximity\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple distance check and does not account for terrain,
    obstacles, or line of sight. It is optimized for performance but may not be suitable
    for complex AI behaviors requiring precise targeting. The method relies on the
    AI's current position to determine proximity, so it should only be called when
    the AI has a valid location.
  warnings: Ensure that the range parameter is positive and reasonable; extremely
    large values can cause performance degradation or unexpected behavior. This function
    does not filter by unit type or faction, so it will count all hostile units including
    pets and summons.
