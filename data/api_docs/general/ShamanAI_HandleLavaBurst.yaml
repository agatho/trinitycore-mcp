  class: ShamanAI
  method: HandleLavaBurst
  signature: bool ShamanAI::HandleLavaBurst(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the Lava Burst spell cast for a Shaman AI unit targeting the specified
    enemy.
  description: The HandleLavaBurst method is responsible for managing the casting
    behavior of the Lava Burst spell within the Shaman AI system. This method determines
    whether the spell can be cast successfully based on various conditions such as
    mana availability, target validity, and cooldown status. It typically involves
    checking if the target is valid, ensuring sufficient resource allocation (mana),
    and executing the spell cast sequence. The method returns true upon successful
    initiation of the spell or false if the conditions for casting are not met. This
    function plays a crucial role in the Shaman's combat decision-making process,
    particularly when utilizing the Enhancement or Elemental specialization.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier (GUID)
      for the Lava Burst spell. The value is expected to be a valid unit identifier
      within the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the Lava Burst spell was successfully initiated and queued
    for casting, or false if the conditions for casting were not satisfied.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleLavaBurst
    code: "int targetGuid = 12345;\nif (shamanAI->HandleLavaBurst(&targetGuid)) {\n\
      \    // Spell cast initiated successfully\n    printf(\"Lava Burst cast initiated\
      \ on target %d\\n\", targetGuid);\n} else {\n    // Failed to initiate spell\
      \ cast\n    printf(\"Failed to initiate Lava Burst on target %d\\n\", targetGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Shaman AI system and assumes that the AI unit
    has access to the necessary spell data and resources. It should only be called
    when the AI is in a combat state and has a valid target. The actual spell execution
    occurs asynchronously after this method returns.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid game object before
    calling this method, as passing an invalid or null pointer may result in undefined
    behavior. Additionally, calling this method outside of combat context might not
    produce expected results.
