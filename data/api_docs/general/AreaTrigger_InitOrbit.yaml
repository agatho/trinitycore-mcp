  class: AreaTrigger
  method: InitOrbit
  signature: void AreaTrigger::InitOrbit(const AreaTriggerOrbitInfo & orbit, int overrideSpeed,
    int speedIsTimeInSeconds)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an area trigger's orbital movement pattern based on provided
    orbit information.
  description: The InitOrbit method configures an AreaTrigger to follow a specific
    orbital path around a defined center point. This method sets up the necessary
    parameters for the trigger to move in a circular or elliptical orbit, using the
    provided orbit information and optional speed overrides. The area trigger will
    begin executing this orbital movement immediately upon initialization. This functionality
    is commonly used for creating dynamic environmental effects, such as rotating
    guardians, orbiting projectiles, or moving platforms within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: orbit
    description: Reference to an AreaTriggerOrbitInfo structure containing the orbital
      parameters including center position, radius, speed, and orientation. This defines
      how the area trigger will move in its orbit.
  - name: overrideSpeed
    description: Optional integer value that overrides the default orbital speed.
      If set to 0 or negative, the original speed from the orbit info is used. Positive
      values specify a custom movement speed.
  - name: speedIsTimeInSeconds
    description: Integer flag indicating whether the overrideSpeed parameter represents
      time in seconds (1) or raw speed units (0). When set to 1, the orbital path
      will be completed within the specified number of seconds regardless of distance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Orbital Initialization
    code: 'AreaTriggerOrbitInfo orbitInfo;

      orbitInfo.center = Position(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f);

      orbitInfo.radius = 50.0f;

      orbitInfo.speed = 1.0f;

      orbitInfo.orientation = 0.0f;


      areaTrigger->InitOrbit(orbitInfo);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Orbital Movement with Speed Override
    code: 'AreaTriggerOrbitInfo orbitInfo;

      orbitInfo.center = Position(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);

      orbitInfo.radius = 100.0f;

      orbitInfo.speed = 2.0f;


      areaTrigger->InitOrbit(orbitInfo, 3, 1); // Complete orbit in 3 seconds'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AreaTrigger has already been created and positioned
    in the world. The orbital movement is calculated using trigonometric functions
    to determine position along the circular path. Performance impact is minimal as
    it only calculates new positions during each tick of the area trigger's update
    loop.
  warnings: Calling InitOrbit on an area trigger that is already moving in another
    pattern may cause unpredictable behavior. Ensure the orbit information provided
    is valid and within reasonable bounds to avoid extreme movement speeds or positioning
    issues.
