  signature: void RoleAssignment::UpdateRoleExperience(PlayerRoleProfile & profile,
    Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the experience points and level of a player's role profile based
    on current game progress.
  description: The UpdateRoleExperience method is responsible for adjusting a player's
    role-specific experience points and potentially leveling up their role profile
    within the TrinityCore framework. This function typically gets invoked when a
    player performs actions that contribute to role advancement, such as completing
    quests, defeating enemies, or achieving specific in-game milestones related to
    their assigned role. It ensures that the player's role progression is accurately
    tracked and updated in real-time. The method operates on a provided PlayerRoleProfile
    object and uses the associated Player object to access current game state information
    like current experience, level thresholds, and other relevant data needed for
    accurate updates.
  parameters:
  - name: profile
    description: Reference to the PlayerRoleProfile object that holds the role-specific
      experience and level data to be updated.
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the in-game character whose
      role profile is being modified. Used to retrieve current player state for experience
      calculations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PlayerRoleProfile myProfile;

      Player* player = ...; // Obtain player reference

      RoleAssignment::UpdateRoleExperience(myProfile, player);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Completion
    code: "void OnQuestComplete(Player* player, uint32 questId)\n{\n    PlayerRoleProfile&\
      \ profile = player->GetRoleProfile();\n    RoleAssignment::UpdateRoleExperience(profile,\
      \ player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player's role experience is expected
    to change. It assumes that the PlayerRoleProfile and Player objects are valid
    and properly initialized. The implementation may involve database synchronization
    if persistent storage is required.
  warnings: Ensure that the profile and player parameters are not null before calling
    this method, as it will likely cause a crash or undefined behavior if they are
    invalid. Also, be aware that frequent calls to this method might impact performance
    in high-traffic scenarios.
