  class: MaelstromWeaponTracker
  method: HasStacks
  signature: bool MaelstromWeaponTracker::HasStacks(uint32 amount) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the Maelstrom weapon tracker has the specified number of stacks
    or more.
  description: The HasStacks method determines whether the Maelstrom weapon tracker
    currently holds at least the specified number of stacks. This is commonly used
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to evaluate the state of weapon procs
    or abilities that accumulate stackable effects. The method performs a simple comparison
    against the internal stack count and returns true if the current stack amount
    meets or exceeds the provided threshold. It does not modify any internal state
    and is typically called before applying effects or determining whether certain
    abilities can be triggered.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The minimum number of stacks required to return true. Must be a non-negative
      integer value representing the desired stack count threshold.
  returns: Returns true if the Maelstrom weapon tracker has equal to or more than
    the specified amount of stacks; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (maelstromTracker.HasStacks(5)) {\n    // Apply effect that requires\
      \ 5+ stacks\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_MASSIVE_STORM, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Proc Check
    code: "if (maelstromTracker.HasStacks(1) && player->HasAura(SPELL_MAELSTROM_WEAPON))\
      \ {\n    // Trigger ability when at least one stack is present\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_MAELSTROM_IMPACT, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the MaelstromWeaponTracker maintains an internal
    counter for stacks and that the amount parameter represents a valid stack threshold.
    It is commonly used in combat logic where abilities or effects depend on having
    a minimum number of proc stacks.
  warnings: Ensure that the amount parameter passed to this method is not negative,
    as it may lead to unexpected behavior if the internal stack count is compared
    against an invalid value. Also, be aware that calling this method does not alter
    the stack count itself.
