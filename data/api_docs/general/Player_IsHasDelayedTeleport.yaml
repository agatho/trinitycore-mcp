  method: IsHasDelayedTeleport
  signature: bool Player::IsHasDelayedTeleport() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player has a delayed teleportation in progress.
  description: The IsHasDelayedTeleport method determines whether the player currently
    has a delayed teleportation queued or in progress. This typically occurs when
    a teleportation is scheduled to happen after a short delay, such as during certain
    quest sequences, spell effects, or when the player is being moved to a different
    location with a brief transition period. The method returns true if there is an
    active delayed teleportation, and false otherwise. This check is important for
    preventing multiple simultaneous teleportations or ensuring proper timing of player
    movement events.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has a delayed teleportation in progress or queued;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check for Delayed Teleport Before Initiating New Action
    code: "if (!player->IsHasDelayedTeleport())\n{\n    // Safe to initiate new teleportation\n\
      \    player->TeleportTo(1234, 100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Delayed\
      \ teleport is active, skip action\n    player->SendNotification(\"Teleportation\
      \ in progress.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the core to manage player movement
    states and prevent conflicts during teleportation sequences. It may be called
    frequently during gameplay, so performance should be considered when using it
    in tight loops.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this check in combination with other movement-related
    methods, as it might interfere with expected behavior if not properly synchronized
    with the game's internal state management.
