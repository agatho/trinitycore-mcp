documentation:
  brief: Shuts down all active bot sessions managed by the session manager.
  description: The ShutdownAllSessions method terminates and cleans up all currently
    active bot sessions within the system. This operation is typically used during
    server shutdown, maintenance, or when resetting the bot environment. The method
    ensures that all resources associated with each bot session are properly released
    and that any ongoing processes are safely terminated. It does not return any value
    and should be called carefully as it will immediately end all active bot operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: botSessionManager->ShutdownAllSessions();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a synchronous shutdown of all sessions, which may block
    execution until all sessions are properly closed. It is recommended to call this
    method only when no other operations depend on active bot sessions.
