documentation:
  brief: Updates all objects in the vector relative to a reference WorldObject
  description: The UpdateObjects method iterates through all ObjectGuids stored in
    the ObjectGuidVector and updates their associated WorldObject references based
    on the provided reference WorldObject. This method is typically used during world
    object synchronization or when updating the state of multiple objects in relation
    to a common reference point. The operation modifies internal object references
    but does not directly alter the objects themselves. It's commonly invoked during
    zone loading, object visibility updates, or when maintaining consistent object
    states across different subsystems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in zone update
    code: 'ObjectGuidVector guidVector;

      // ... populate guidVector with ObjectGuids ...

      WorldObject refObject;

      // ... initialize refObject ...

      guidVector.UpdateObjects(refObject);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage during object visibility refresh
    code: "void RefreshVisibilityForPlayer(Player* player) {\n    ObjectGuidVector\
      \ visibleObjects = player->GetVisibleObjects();\n    visibleObjects.UpdateObjects(*player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that all ObjectGuids in the vector correspond to valid
    WorldObject instances. The reference object should be a valid, initialized WorldObject
    that serves as the synchronization point for updating related objects. Performance
    may vary depending on the number of objects in the vector and how frequently this
    method is called.
  warnings: This method modifies internal state of objects referenced by GUIDs. Ensure
    that all referenced objects remain valid throughout the execution of this method.
    Calling this method with an invalid reference object may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes.
