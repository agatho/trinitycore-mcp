  class: VehicleAI
  method: AttackStart
  signature: void VehicleAI::AttackStart(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates attack behavior against a target specified by the input parameter.
  description: The AttackStart method in VehicleAI is responsible for triggering the
    vehicle's attack behavior towards a specific target. This method is typically
    invoked when the vehicle AI needs to engage an enemy unit, initiating combat mechanics
    such as targeting, threat generation, and attack execution. The method processes
    the provided target reference and begins appropriate combat actions based on the
    vehicle's defined AI behavior. It integrates with the broader TrinityCore combat
    system to ensure proper engagement of enemies within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target entity identifier or
      index. This parameter specifies which unit the vehicle should attack. The value
      is typically a valid GameObject or Creature GUID, or may represent a specific
      combat target within the AI's context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Attack Start Usage
    code: 'VehicleAI* ai = reinterpret_cast<VehicleAI*>(vehicle->GetAI());

      int targetGuid = 12345;

      ai->AttackStart(&targetGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Attack Start with Dynamic Target
    code: "VehicleAI* ai = reinterpret_cast<VehicleAI*>(vehicle->GetAI());\nUnit*\
      \ target = vehicle->SelectNearestTarget();\nif (target)\n{\n    int guid = static_cast<int>(target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      \    ai->AttackStart(&guid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the target entity exists and is valid within the
    game world. It does not perform validation on the target parameter, so calling
    code should ensure the target is properly initialized before invoking this method.
    The implementation may interact with the vehicle's threat table and combat state
    management.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null pointer to param0 can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Always verify that the target entity exists and is accessible before
    calling AttackStart. Additionally, ensure that the vehicle AI is properly initialized
    before invoking this method.
