documentation:
  brief: Returns the spline data associated with this area trigger for movement path
    calculation.
  description: The GetSpline method retrieves the underlying spline object that defines
    the movement path for an area trigger. This spline contains the trajectory data
    used by the game engine to calculate the position of the area trigger over time.
    The returned reference is const, ensuring that external code cannot modify the
    spline directly. Area triggers often use splines to define complex movement patterns
    such as flying through the air or following a curved path. This method is typically
    called during movement updates or when calculating the current position of an
    area trigger in the world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the Movement::Spline<float> object that represents
    the movement path for this area trigger. The spline contains all necessary data
    points and interpolation information to compute the trigger's position at any
    given time during its animation or movement cycle.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Spline Data for Position Calculation
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...; // Assume we have a valid area trigger

      const Movement::Spline<float>& spline = trigger->GetSpline();

      float currentTime = 0.5f; // Halfway through animation

      G3D::Vector3 position = spline.getPosition(currentTime);

      // Use position for rendering or collision detection'
    language: cpp
  - title: Inspecting Spline Properties for Debugging
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;

      const Movement::Spline<float>& spline = trigger->GetSpline();

      uint32 pointCount = spline.getPointCount();

      float totalDuration = spline.getTotalTime();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("area.trigger", "Spline has %u points and lasts %.2f seconds",
      pointCount, totalDuration);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned spline reference is valid only as long as the AreaTrigger object
    exists. The spline data may be updated dynamically during runtime if the area
    trigger's movement pattern changes. This method does not perform any locking or
    synchronization, so access should be coordinated in multi-threaded environments
    where applicable.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the returned spline through this reference, as
    it is const. If you need to alter the spline data, use appropriate setter methods
    or create a new spline. Be cautious when accessing spline data during movement
    updates, as concurrent modification could lead to undefined behavior.
