  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: HandleIndoorFollowing
  signature: bool LeaderFollowBehavior::HandleIndoorFollowing(Player * bot, Player
    * leader)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the logic for a bot to follow its leader indoors, managing movement
    and positioning within indoor environments.
  description: The HandleIndoorFollowing method is responsible for implementing the
    behavior of a bot player following its leader in indoor environments. This method
    ensures that the bot maintains appropriate distance and positioning relative to
    the leader while navigating indoor spaces such as buildings, dungeons, or any
    enclosed areas. It evaluates the current position of both the bot and the leader,
    calculates necessary movement adjustments, and manages the bot's pathfinding behavior
    to stay close to the leader without overlapping or getting too far away. The method
    is typically invoked during AI processing when the bot is in an indoor setting
    and needs to maintain group cohesion with its leader.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will follow
      the leader. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: leader
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the leader that the bot
      will follow. Must be a valid player instance and should not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the bot successfully handled indoor following behavior,
    false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate failure in pathfinding,
    invalid parameters, or inability to maintain proper positioning.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "if (leaderFollowBehavior->HandleIndoorFollowing(bot, leader)) {\n    //\
      \ Bot is following correctly\n} else {\n    // Handle failure case\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with bot AI update loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI() {\n    if (IsIndoor()) {\n        if (!leaderFollowBehavior->HandleIndoorFollowing(m_bot,\
      \ m_leader)) {\n            // Log error or attempt alternative behavior\n \
      \       }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that both the bot and leader are in the same map instance
    and that the environment is properly initialized for indoor navigation. The method
    relies on internal pathfinding systems and may be affected by obstacles or terrain
    features within indoor environments.
  warnings: Ensure that both bot and leader pointers are valid before calling this
    method to avoid null pointer exceptions. This method should not be called in outdoor
    environments where different following logic applies.
