  signature: void GameObject::SetDestructibleState(int state, int * attackerOrHealer,
    bool setHealth)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the destructible state of a game object to control its health and damage
    handling.
  description: This method allows developers to set the destructible state of a GameObject,
    which controls how the object responds to damage and healing. It manages the object's
    health status and can be used to simulate destruction or restoration of objects
    like doors, gates, or other interactive elements in the game world. The method
    supports both damage and healing scenarios by specifying an attacker or healer
    pointer and optionally setting health values.
  parameters:
  - name: state
    description: The destructible state to set, typically representing different stages
      of destruction or restoration (0 = fully intact, 1 = partially damaged, 2 =
      destroyed)
  - name: attackerOrHealer
    description: Pointer to the attacker or healer object, used for determining damage
      or healing application. Can be nullptr if not needed.
  - name: setHealth
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to set health values. If true, sets
      health; if false, uses default behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->SetDestructibleState(2, nullptr, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with attacker
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->SetDestructibleState(1, &player, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include handling of health values and damage application
    logic. This method is commonly used in quest scripts or game object AI to control
    destruction states.
  warnings: Improper use can lead to incorrect health status or unexpected behavior
    in game objects. Ensure proper state values are used for correct game mechanics.
