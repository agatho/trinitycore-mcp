documentation:
  brief: Updates the collective knowledge base used by behavior adaptations in the
    AI system.
  description: The UpdateCollectiveKnowledge method is responsible for refreshing
    and synchronizing shared behavioral data across all instances of BehaviorAdaptation
    within the AI framework. This method ensures that adaptive behaviors are based
    on the most current collective information, enabling more intelligent and context-aware
    decision-making. It typically aggregates data from various sources such as player
    actions, environmental changes, and previous behavior patterns to update internal
    knowledge structures. The method is designed to be called periodically or upon
    significant events that warrant knowledge refreshment.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void AIUpdate()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    behaviorAdaptation->UpdateCollectiveKnowledge();\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called with caution in high-frequency update scenarios
    as it may involve expensive data synchronization operations. Consider calling
    it less frequently during periods of low activity to optimize performance.
