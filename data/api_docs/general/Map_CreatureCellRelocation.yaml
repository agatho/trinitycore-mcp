  class: Map
  method: CreatureCellRelocation
  signature: bool Map::CreatureCellRelocation(Creature * creature, int new_cell)
documentation:
  brief: Relocates a creature to a new cell within the map.
  description: The CreatureCellRelocation method handles the process of moving a creature
    from its current cell to a specified new cell on the map. This is an essential
    part of the game's spatial management system, ensuring that creatures are properly
    tracked and updated in the appropriate grid cells as they move through the world.
    The method typically gets called when a creature's position changes significantly
    enough to require a cell update, such as when it moves across grid boundaries.
    It manages internal data structures related to creature positioning and visibility
    for players in the affected areas.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that needs to be relocated to a new
      cell.
  - name: new_cell
    description: Integer representing the target cell ID where the creature should
      be moved. This value typically corresponds to a grid cell index within the map's
      spatial partitioning system.
  returns: Returns true if the relocation was successful, false otherwise. Failure
    may occur due to invalid parameters, internal errors, or if the creature is already
    in the specified cell.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Creature Relocation
    code: "Creature* myCreature = ...; // Get a valid creature pointer\nint targetCell\
      \ = 12345; // Target cell ID\nbool success = map->CreatureCellRelocation(myCreature,\
      \ targetCell);\nif (success) {\n    // Creature successfully relocated\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle relocation failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal spatial management system and should
    generally be called automatically by the core engine when creature positions change.
    Developers typically do not need to invoke this directly unless implementing custom
    movement or positioning logic. The method may trigger updates to player visibility
    lists and grid-based event systems.
  warnings: Direct usage of this method can potentially cause inconsistencies in the
    game world if not properly coordinated with other spatial management functions.
    It should only be called with valid creature pointers and appropriate cell IDs
    that exist within the map's grid structure.
