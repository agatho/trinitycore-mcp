  class: PlayerAI
  method: GetSpec
  signature: ChrSpecialization PlayerAI::GetSpec(const int * who) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the player's current specialization ID.
  description: The GetSpec method returns the ChrSpecialization identifier associated
    with the player's active specialization. This value corresponds to the player's
    chosen class specialization (e.g., Balance, Fury, Discipline) and is used internally
    by the game engine for various mechanics such as spell availability, talent calculations,
    and ability effects. The method operates on the AI's associated player object
    and does not require any input parameters. It provides a direct way to query the
    current specialization without needing to access the player's character data directly.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a ChrSpecialization value representing the player's current specialization.
    This is typically an integer identifier that maps to a specific specialization
    within the game's specialization system, such as 257 for Balance Druid or 253
    for Frost Mage.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ChrSpecialization spec = playerAI->GetSpec();\nif (spec == 257) // Balance\
      \ Druid\n{\n    // Apply Balance-specific logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Specialization for Spell Logic
    code: "ChrSpecialization spec = playerAI->GetSpec();\nif (spec == 253 || spec\
      \ == 254 || spec == 255) // Mage specs\n{\n    // Handle mage specialization-specific\
      \ spell handling\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for use within AI logic and should be called
    only when the player object is valid. The returned ChrSpecialization value is
    cached internally by the game engine, so repeated calls will not incur performance
    penalties. This method does not perform any validation on the player's state or
    specialization status.
  warnings: Ensure that the PlayerAI instance is properly initialized and associated
    with a valid player before calling this method. Calling GetSpec on an uninitialized
    or invalid AI object may result in undefined behavior or incorrect specialization
    values.
