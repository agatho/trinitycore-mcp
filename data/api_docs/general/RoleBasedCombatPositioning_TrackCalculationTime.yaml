  signature: void RoleBasedCombatPositioning::TrackCalculationTime(std::chrono::microseconds
    duration)
documentation:
  brief: Records the duration of a calculation for performance monitoring and analysis.
  description: The TrackCalculationTime method is used to log the execution time of
    specific combat positioning calculations within the RoleBasedCombatPositioning
    system. This method accepts a duration value in microseconds and stores it for
    later analysis or reporting. It plays a crucial role in maintaining performance
    metrics for AI behavior, particularly in scenarios where multiple positioning
    calculations are performed during combat encounters. The recorded timing data
    can be used to identify performance bottlenecks, optimize decision-making algorithms,
    or ensure that combat positioning logic remains within acceptable time limits.
    This method is typically called internally by the system after completing a calculation,
    rather than being invoked directly by external code.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Performance Monitoring
    code: 'auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      // ... perform combat positioning calculation ...

      auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      std::chrono::microseconds duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end
      - start);

      roleBasedCombatPositioning->TrackCalculationTime(duration);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from within the combat positioning logic
    after a calculation has completed. It's important to note that this method doesn't
    perform any complex operations itself, but rather serves as a data collection
    point for timing information. The implementation likely uses a simple storage
    mechanism (such as a vector or circular buffer) to maintain historical timing
    data for performance analysis.
