  method: _CreateDefaultGuildRanks
  signature: void Guild::_CreateDefaultGuildRanks(int trans, LocaleConstant loc)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes the default guild rank structure for a new guild.
  description: The _CreateDefaultGuildRanks method is responsible for setting up the
    standard hierarchy of ranks that every new guild in TrinityCore will have. This
    includes creating the initial rank entries such as 'Guild Master', 'Officer',
    'Veteran', 'Member', and 'Initiate' with appropriate permissions and ordering.
    The method ensures that all new guilds start with a consistent set of ranks, which
    can then be customized by guild leaders. It is typically called during the creation
    process of a new guild to establish its foundational rank system.
  parameters:
  - name: trans
    description: Transaction identifier used for database operations. This parameter
      controls whether the rank creation should be part of an existing database transaction
      or handled independently.
  - name: loc
    description: LocaleConstant value specifying the language and localization settings
      to use when creating localized rank names. This allows different languages to
      have appropriate rank titles based on the server's locale configuration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating Default Guild Ranks During Guild Creation
    code: 'Guild* guild = new Guild();

      guild->_CreateDefaultGuildRanks(0, LOCALE_en);

      // This initializes the default ranks for a new guild with English localization.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Transaction Parameter for Database Consistency
    code: 'Transaction* trans = new Transaction();

      guild->_CreateDefaultGuildRanks(trans, LOCALE_fr);

      // Creates default ranks within a transaction context for French localization.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is an internal helper function and should not be called directly
    by external code. It assumes that the guild object has been properly initialized
    but does not yet have any rank data. The method handles database persistence internally
    using either a provided transaction or a new one if none is given.
  warnings: Calling this method on a guild that already has ranks defined may result
    in duplicate entries or inconsistent state. Always ensure this method is only
    called during the initial setup phase of a guild. The locale parameter must be
    valid to avoid incorrect localization behavior.
