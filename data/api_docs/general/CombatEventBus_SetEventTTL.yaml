  class: CombatEventBus
  method: SetEventTTL
  signature: void CombatEventBus::SetEventTTL(uint32 ttlMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the time-to-live duration for combat events in the event bus.
  description: The SetEventTTL method configures the maximum lifetime (in milliseconds)
    that combat-related events will remain active within the CombatEventBus. This
    determines how long event data is retained before being automatically cleaned
    up. The TTL value affects all subsequent events added to the bus and influences
    memory usage and event processing behavior. Setting a lower TTL value reduces
    memory consumption but may cause timely events to expire prematurely, while a
    higher value ensures longer retention at the cost of increased memory usage.
  parameters:
  - name: ttlMs
    description: The time-to-live duration in milliseconds for combat events. Valid
      values are positive integers representing the maximum lifetime of events before
      automatic cleanup. A value of 0 typically disables TTL behavior or sets it to
      a default value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Combat Event TTL to 30 Seconds
    code: CombatEventBus::Instance()->SetEventTTL(30000); // Events expire after 30
      seconds
    language: cpp
  - title: Disabling Event TTL with Zero Value
    code: CombatEventBus::Instance()->SetEventTTL(0); // Uses default or infinite
      TTL behavior
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects all future events added to the CombatEventBus. Existing
    events are not immediately affected by changes to TTL, but will be subject to
    cleanup based on the new TTL value when they reach their expiration time. The
    implementation likely uses a timer-based system or periodic cleanup mechanism
    to manage event lifetimes.
  warnings: Setting TTL values too low may cause important combat events to expire
    before they can be processed by listeners. Setting excessively high TTL values
    without proper cleanup mechanisms can lead to memory leaks or performance degradation
    over time.
