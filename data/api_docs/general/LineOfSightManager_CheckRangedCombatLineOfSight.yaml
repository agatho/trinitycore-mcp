  signature: bool LineOfSightManager::CheckRangedCombatLineOfSight(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a ranged combat line of sight exists between the unit and its target.
  description: The CheckRangedCombatLineOfSight method determines whether a valid
    line of sight exists for ranged combat between the calling Unit and its target.
    This function is used to verify that an attack can be performed without obstruction,
    taking into account environmental obstacles such as walls, terrain, and other
    objects. It evaluates the spatial relationship between the unit's position and
    the target's position, ensuring that there are no blocking elements in the path.
    The method considers both the physical dimensions of the unit and target, as well
    as the game's collision detection system to determine visibility for ranged attacks.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a clear line of sight exists for ranged combat between
    the unit and its target, false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates
    that an obstacle is blocking the path or that the target is out of range for ranged
    attacks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check ranged combat visibility
    code: "if (unit->GetMap()->GetLosManager()->CheckRangedCombatLineOfSight(target))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with ranged attack\n    unit->CastSpell(target, RANGED_SPELL_ID,\
      \ true);\n} else {\n    // Cannot perform ranged attack due to obstruction\n\
      \    unit->Say(\"Cannot shoot!\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying collision detection system of TrinityCore
    and may be affected by map geometry, object placement, and server configuration
    settings. Performance can be impacted when checking many units simultaneously,
    especially in densely populated areas with numerous obstacles.
  warnings: The method assumes that the target is valid and accessible. Calling this
    method without ensuring the target exists or is within a reasonable distance may
    lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, this check does not account for temporary
    invisibility or stealth effects that might affect actual combat visibility.
