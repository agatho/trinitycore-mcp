documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new BehaviorSample instance with default values and prepares
    it for AI behavior processing.
  description: The BehaviorSample constructor initializes a new instance of the BehaviorSample
    class, setting up internal data structures and default parameters required for
    AI behavior evaluation. This method is typically called when creating a new behavior
    sample object to be used in the TrinityCore's AI system. It ensures that all necessary
    member variables are properly initialized before any behavior calculations or
    evaluations occur. The constructor may also perform basic validation of input
    parameters and set up internal state management for tracking behavior execution
    metrics.

    code: 'BehaviorSample sample;

      // Creates a new BehaviorSample instance with default settings

      // Ready for use in AI decision making processes'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the AI system when creating
    behavior samples. Developers should not directly instantiate BehaviorSample objects
    unless implementing custom AI behaviors. The initialization process may involve
    memory allocation and setup of internal data structures that are optimized for
    performance in high-frequency AI evaluation scenarios.
  warnings: Avoid calling this constructor directly in performance-critical code paths
    without understanding the underlying implementation. The constructor may perform
    operations that could impact performance if called excessively in tight loops
    or during high-frequency AI updates.
