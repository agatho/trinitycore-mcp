  signature: bool BotProfiler::GenerateHotspotReport(const int & hotspots, std::string
    & report)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a hotspot report for bot activity analysis
  description: The GenerateHotspotReport method creates a detailed report analyzing
    the distribution and intensity of bot activity across different locations in the
    game world. This functionality is primarily used for debugging and performance
    optimization purposes within the TrinityCore framework. The method collects data
    about where bots are most active, how frequently they interact with objects, and
    identifies potential bottlenecks or areas requiring attention. It requires appropriate
    permissions and may only be called when the profiler system is initialized and
    active.
  parameters:
  - name: hotspots
    description: Reference to an integer parameter that specifies the number of hotspots
      to include in the report. This value determines how many top activity locations
      will be analyzed and included in the output.
  - name: report
    description: Reference to a string where the generated hotspot report will be
      stored. The output format typically includes location coordinates, activity
      counts, and statistical data about bot behavior at each hotspot.
  returns: Returns true if the hotspot report was successfully generated and stored
    in the provided report string; returns false if the operation failed due to invalid
    parameters, uninitialized profiler system, or insufficient permissions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Hotspot Report Generation
    code: "int hotspots = 10;\nstd::string report;\nif (botProfiler.GenerateHotspotReport(hotspots,\
      \ report)) {\n    std::cout << \"Hotspot report generated successfully:\\n\"\
      \ << report << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cerr << \"Failed to generate hotspot\
      \ report.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Default Hotspot Count
    code: "std::string report;\nint hotspots = 5; // Default number of hotspots\n\
      if (botProfiler.GenerateHotspotReport(hotspots, report)) {\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"Generated report with top \" << hotspots << \" hotspots:\\n\" << report\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other profiling tools within
    TrinityCore to monitor and optimize bot behavior. The generated reports can be
    instrumental in identifying performance issues related to high-density bot activity.
    Ensure that the BotProfiler system has been properly initialized before calling
    this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the BotProfiler system
    may result in undefined behavior or a failed operation. Additionally, generating
    reports for very large numbers of hotspots can be resource-intensive and may impact
    performance.
