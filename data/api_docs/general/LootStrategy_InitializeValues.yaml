  signature: void LootStrategy::InitializeValues()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes internal loot strategy values and configurations for item distribution
    among group members.
  description: The InitializeValues method sets up default parameters and internal
    state required for the LootStrategy class to function correctly. This includes
    initializing loot distribution rules, priority settings, and any configurable
    thresholds that determine how items are awarded to players within a group context.
    The method ensures all necessary variables are properly configured before the
    loot system begins operating, typically called during object construction or when
    resetting strategy parameters. It prepares the system for subsequent calls to
    evaluate loot eligibility and assign items based on defined rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'LootStrategy strategy;

      strategy.InitializeValues();

      // Strategy is now ready for loot distribution operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called once during object initialization
    or when resetting the loot strategy to default settings. It does not perform any
    runtime calculations but rather prepares internal data structures. The method
    assumes that no prior state exists and will overwrite existing values.
