documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the ProfessionSkillInfo class with default
    values.
  description: The ProfessionSkillInfo constructor initializes a new instance of the
    ProfessionSkillInfo class, setting up internal data structures and default values
    for profession-related skill information. This method is typically called when
    creating a new profession skill entry in the game's database or when loading existing
    profession data from storage. The initialization process ensures that all member
    variables are properly configured with sensible defaults, allowing the object
    to be used for storing and manipulating player profession skill data within the
    TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new ProfessionSkillInfo instance
    code: 'ProfessionSkillInfo skillInfo;

      // The skillInfo object is now initialized with default values

      // and ready to be used for storing profession skill data.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when creating a new ProfessionSkillInfo
    object. It does not perform any database operations or load existing data - that
    must be handled separately through other methods such as LoadFromDB(). The class
    likely contains member variables for skill level, skill progress, and related
    profession metadata.
