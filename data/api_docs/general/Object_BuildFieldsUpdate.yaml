  class: Object

  signature: void Object::BuildFieldsUpdate(Player * param0, UpdateDataMapType & param1)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Populates update data with field changes for the object to be sent to a specific
    player.
  description: The BuildFieldsUpdate method constructs and populates an UpdateDataMapType
    structure with the field updates required for a given player. This method is typically
    invoked during the packet building phase of object updates, ensuring that only
    relevant field changes are transmitted to each player. It handles the serialization
    of object fields into update packets, taking into account visibility rules and
    field modification states. The method is part of the core World of Warcraft packet
    update system used by TrinityCore to efficiently synchronize game state between
    server and client.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the update data is being built.
      This determines the visibility context and update requirements for the object.
  - name: param1
    description: Reference to an UpdateDataMapType structure where the field updates
      will be stored. This map contains the serialized field data organized by update
      blocks for efficient network transmission.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in object update processing
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      UpdateDataMapType updateData;

      myObject->BuildFieldsUpdate(player, updateData);

      // updateData now contains the serialized field updates for this player'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with object visibility and update systems
    code: "void Object::BuildValuesUpdate(Player* target, UpdateDataMapType& data)\n\
      {\n    BuildFieldsUpdate(target, data);\n    // Additional processing for visibility\
      \ checks\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the update system and should
    not be invoked directly in most cases. It relies on object field change tracking
    mechanisms and visibility systems to determine what fields need to be sent. The
    UpdateDataMapType structure handles memory management and packet assembly for
    efficient network transmission.
  warnings: Direct invocation of this method without proper context may result in
    incorrect update data or incomplete field synchronization. This method assumes
    that the player parameter is valid and properly initialized. It should only be
    called when the object's fields have been modified and require updating.
