documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new FormationCommand object for managing creature formation
    behavior in World of Warcraft.
  description: The FormationCommand constructor initializes a new instance of the
    FormationCommand class, which is used to handle formation-related commands within
    the TrinityCore server. This class manages how creatures move and position themselves
    in formations, such as when following a leader or maintaining specific distances.
    The initialization process sets up internal state variables required for formation
    management, including target positions, movement types, and synchronization flags.
    This constructor is typically invoked when creating new formation command instances
    for AI-controlled creatures or during server startup when loading formation data.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a FormationCommand Instance
    code: 'FormationCommand* cmd = new FormationCommand();

      // The FormationCommand object is now initialized and ready for use

      // in managing creature formations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any network communication or database access.
    It only initializes internal data structures required for formation management.
    The actual formation behavior is controlled through other methods of the class,
    such as SetTargetPosition() and Execute().
