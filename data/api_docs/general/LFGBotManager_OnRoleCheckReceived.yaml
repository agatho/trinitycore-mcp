  method: OnRoleCheckReceived
  signature: void LFGBotManager::OnRoleCheckReceived(int groupGuid, int botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Handles role check responses from LFG bots within a group
  description: The OnRoleCheckReceived method processes incoming role check responses
    from LFG (Looking For Group) bots. This method is invoked when a bot in a group
    responds to a role check request, typically initiated by the group leader or LFG
    system. It updates internal tracking of bot roles and may trigger further actions
    such as adjusting group composition or notifying other systems about role assignments.
    The method operates within the context of TrinityCore's LFG framework and is part
    of the LFGBotManager class responsible for managing bot behavior in group scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: groupGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group that initiated the role
      check. This value represents the group's identity within the TrinityCore database
      and is used to track which group the bot belongs to.
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the LFG bot that responded to the
      role check. This identifies the specific bot instance whose role information
      is being processed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group management
    code: "void HandleRoleCheck(int groupId, int botId) {\n    LFGBotManager* manager\
      \ = LFGBotManager::instance();\n    manager->OnRoleCheckReceived(groupId, botId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with LFG system
    code: "void ProcessBotRoleResponse(int groupGuid, int botGuid) {\n    // Validate\
      \ group exists\n    if (!sGroupMgr->GetGroupByGuid(groupGuid))\n        return;\n\
      \    \n    // Process the role check response\n    LFGBotManager::instance()->OnRoleCheckReceived(groupGuid,\
      \ botGuid);\n    \n    // Update group status\n    sLFGMgr->UpdateGroupStatus(groupGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group and bot GUIDs are valid and exist in the
    database. It should only be called from within the LFG system's event handling
    context to ensure proper synchronization. The method does not perform any direct
    database operations but relies on internal state tracking.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid GUIDs may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that both groupGuid and botGuid correspond to valid entities
    before invoking this method. This method is typically called internally by the
    LFG system and should not be invoked directly in most cases.
