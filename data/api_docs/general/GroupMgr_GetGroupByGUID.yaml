  method: GetGroupByGUID
  signature: Group * GroupMgr::GetGroupByGUID(const int & guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a group object by its unique identifier (GUID) from the group manager.
  description: The GetGroupByGUID method is used to fetch a Group object from the
    GroupMgr system using a specified GUID. This method allows for quick lookup of
    player groups within the game world, which is essential for managing player interactions,
    loot distribution, and raid coordination. The method performs a lookup in an internal
    data structure that maps group GUIDs to their corresponding Group objects. It's
    commonly used during gameplay events such as when a player joins or leaves a group,
    or when checking group membership status.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group to retrieve. This value
      should correspond to a valid group GUID that has been previously registered
      with the GroupMgr system.
  returns: A pointer to the Group object if a group with the specified GUID exists,
    or nullptr if no such group is found. The returned pointer should be checked for
    null before use to avoid dereferencing a null pointer.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GetGroupByGUID
    code: "Group* group = sGroupMgr->GetGroupByGUID(12345);\nif (group != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Group exists, perform operations\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(\"Found\
      \ group with %u members\", group->GetMembersCount());\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No\
      \ group found with this GUID\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(\"No group found with\
      \ specified GUID\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GetGroupByGUID in a player join scenario
    code: "void HandlePlayerJoinGroup(Player* player, uint32 groupId)\n{\n    Group*\
      \ group = sGroupMgr->GetGroupByGUID(groupId);\n    if (group == nullptr)\n \
      \   {\n        // Create new group if none exists\n        group = new Group();\n\
      \        group->Create(player);\n        sGroupMgr->AddGroup(group);\n    }\n\
      \    else\n    {\n        // Add player to existing group\n        group->AddMember(player);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation that is generally fast due to internal
    hash map implementation. The GUID parameter must be a valid group identifier;
    invalid or non-existent GUIDs will result in a null return value. This method
    is thread-safe as long as the GroupMgr system itself is properly synchronized.
  warnings: Always check for null return values before using the returned Group pointer
    to prevent segmentation faults. Be cautious when modifying groups returned by
    this method, as changes may affect other systems that rely on group state consistency.
