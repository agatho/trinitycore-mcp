  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: RecordSpellCastTime
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::RecordSpellCastTime(uint32_t botGuid, uint64_t
    microseconds, uint32_t spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Records the cast time of a spell executed by a bot for performance monitoring.
  description: The RecordSpellCastTime method logs the duration (in microseconds)
    that a specific bot took to cast a spell. This functionality is part of the BotPerformanceMonitor
    class, which tracks various performance metrics related to AI-controlled bots
    in the game. The recorded data can be used for analysis, optimization, or debugging
    purposes to ensure that bot behavior remains within acceptable performance thresholds.
    The method stores this information using the provided bot GUID, spell ID, and
    cast time values.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that executed the spell. This
      value must be a valid, non-zero GUID representing an active AI-controlled character.
  - name: microseconds
    description: The time taken to cast the spell, measured in microseconds. This
      value should represent a positive integer indicating the duration of the spell's
      casting process.
  - name: spellId
    description: Identifier of the spell that was cast. Must be a valid spell entry
      ID from the game's spell database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      uint64_t castTimeMicroseconds = 500000;

      uint32_t spellId = 8472;

      monitor.RecordSpellCastTime(botGuid, castTimeMicroseconds, spellId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during or after a bot casts a spell to capture
    performance data. It assumes that the provided parameters are valid and do not
    perform any validation internally. The implementation may use internal storage
    structures like maps or lists to maintain cast time records per bot and spell.
  warnings: Ensure that botGuid and spellId correspond to existing entities in the
    game world; otherwise, the recorded data might be meaningless or cause issues
    if used later for analysis. Also, calling this method too frequently without batching
    could impact performance.
