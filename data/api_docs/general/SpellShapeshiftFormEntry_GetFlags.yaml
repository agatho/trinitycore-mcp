documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flags associated with a spell shapeshift form entry.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitmask
    flags that define various properties and behaviors of a spell shapeshift form.
    These flags control aspects such as whether the form is passive, requires specific
    conditions, or modifies player abilities. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    this method allows access to the internal flag configuration for shapeshift forms,
    which are commonly used by druids and other classes that can transform into different
    forms. The returned integer value should be interpreted using bitwise operations
    to check individual flag states.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the bitmask flags of the spell shapeshift form
    entry. Each bit in the integer corresponds to a specific property or behavior
    of the form, such as passive status, required aura, or combat restrictions. The
    caller must use bitwise operations (e.g., & operator) to test individual flag
    values.
  examples:
  - title: Check if shapeshift form is passive
    code: "SpellShapeshiftFormEntry* form = sSpellShapeshiftStore.LookupEntry(1);\n\
      if (form && (form->GetFlags() & SHAPESHIFT_FLAG_PASSIVE)) {\n    // This form\
      \ is passive\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validate shapeshift form properties
    code: "SpellShapeshiftFormEntry* form = sSpellShapeshiftStore.LookupEntry(2);\n\
      int flags = form->GetFlags();\nif (flags & SHAPESHIFT_FLAG_STANCE) {\n    //\
      \ This form represents a stance\n}\nif (flags & SHAPESHIFT_FLAG_NO_LEAVE) {\n\
      \    // Player cannot leave this form easily\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flags returned by this method are typically defined in the game's constants
    or configuration files. Developers should be aware that flag values may change
    between different versions of TrinityCore, and it's recommended to use named constants
    rather than hardcoded integers for better maintainability.
  warnings: Be cautious when interpreting the returned integer value as a bitmask.
    Incorrect bitwise operations can lead to unexpected behavior. Always verify that
    the SpellShapeshiftFormEntry pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid
    null pointer dereferences.
