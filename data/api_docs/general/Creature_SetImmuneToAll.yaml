documentation:
  brief: Sets creature to be immune to all attacks and effects.
  description: This method makes the creature become completely immune to all incoming
    attacks, spells, and effects. It effectively prevents the creature from taking
    any damage or being affected by any negative status effects. The method is typically
    used for NPC creatures that should not be able to take damage or be controlled
    by players. This behavior is commonly seen in boss NPCs or special event creatures
    where immunity is required.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetImmuneToAll(true);

      // Creature is now immune to all attacks and effects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the creature's combat behavior and can be used in conjunction
    with other immunity-related methods. It should be used carefully as it may interfere
    with normal game progression if applied incorrectly.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause creatures to become unresponsive
    to player actions, potentially leading to game-breaking situations or preventing
    proper quest completion.
