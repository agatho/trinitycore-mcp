api:
  class: PaladinAI
  method: IsValidTarget
  signature: bool PaladinAI::IsValidTarget(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a target is suitable for the paladin AI to engage in combat
    or perform actions.
  description: The IsValidTarget method checks if a specified target is valid for
    the PaladinAI to interact with. It evaluates various conditions such as target
    existence, faction alignment, health status, and distance to determine if the
    target meets the criteria for engagement. This method is crucial for ensuring
    that the AI does not attempt to attack invalid or inappropriate targets, which
    could lead to undesirable behavior in combat scenarios. The method typically returns
    true if the target is valid and false otherwise, contributing to the overall stability
    and effectiveness of the paladin's AI behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or index
      within the AI system. This value should correspond to a valid unit in the game
      world.
  returns: Returns true if the target is valid and suitable for the paladin AI to
    engage, false otherwise. A return value of false indicates that the target either
    does not exist, is out of range, or fails other validation checks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Target Validation
    code: "if (paladinAI->IsValidTarget(&targetId)) {\n    // Proceed with attack\
      \ or spell casting\n    paladinAI->Attack(targetId);\n} else {\n    // Find\
      \ a new target\n    paladinAI->SelectNewTarget();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsValidTarget in Combat Loop
    code: "void PaladinAICore::UpdateAI() {\n    if (IsValidTarget(&currentTarget))\
      \ {\n        // Perform combat actions\n        DoCombatAction(currentTarget);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Re-evaluate target selection\n        currentTarget\
      \ = FindBestTarget();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely performs checks on target health, distance, faction, and
    visibility. Developers should be aware that this function may be called frequently
    during combat updates, so performance is important. The implementation might also
    consider the paladin's current state (e.g., if they are stunned or rooted).
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid unit before calling
    this method; passing an invalid pointer can lead to undefined behavior. Also,
    be cautious about using this method outside of combat contexts where its logic
    may not apply.
