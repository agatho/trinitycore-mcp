  class: MovementInfo
  method: ResetJump
  signature: void MovementInfo::ResetJump()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the jump-related movement data in the MovementInfo structure.
  description: The ResetJump method clears all active jump parameters and resets the
    jump state within the MovementInfo object. This function is typically invoked
    when a character's jump animation or physics need to be terminated or reinitialized,
    such as during movement interruptions, landing, or when transitioning between
    different movement states. It ensures that any pending jump calculations are cleared
    and the jump-related fields are set to their default values, preventing incorrect
    jump behavior in subsequent movement updates.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset jump state during movement update
    code: "void Player::UpdateMovementInfo()\n{\n    // ... other movement logic ...\n\
      \    if (m_movementInfo.HasJumpData())\n    {\n        m_movementInfo.ResetJump();\n\
      \    }\n    // ... continue with movement processing ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal jump state variables within MovementInfo.
    It should be called carefully during movement state transitions to avoid inconsistent
    physics behavior. The method does not interact with the game server's network
    layer or send updates to clients.
  warnings: Calling ResetJump without proper context may lead to incorrect jump-related
    movement calculations. Ensure that this function is only invoked when it's safe
    to clear jump data, such as after landing or before initiating a new jump sequence.
