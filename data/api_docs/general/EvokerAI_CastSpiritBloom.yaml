documentation:
  brief: Casts the Spirit Bloom spell on the specified target.
  description: The CastSpiritBloom method is responsible for executing the Spirit
    Bloom ability within the EvokerAI class. This method selects a target from the
    provided list and casts the Spirit Bloom spell, which is a key healing ability
    for evokers in World of Warcraft. The spell typically heals the target and may
    have additional effects such as restoring mana or providing beneficial buffs.
    The method operates within the AI framework of TrinityCore, ensuring proper targeting
    and spell execution according to game mechanics and cooldowns.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier for the
      Spirit Bloom spell. This value should correspond to a valid unit in the game
      world.

    code: 'int targetId = 12345;

      EvokerAI* evoker = new EvokerAI();

      evoker->CastSpiritBloom(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the target is valid and within casting range. The
    actual spell execution logic may involve additional checks for mana, cooldowns,
    and target validity which are not explicitly detailed in this signature.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid game object before
    calling this method, as invalid targets could lead to undefined behavior or errors
    during spell casting.
