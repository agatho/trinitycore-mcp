documentation:
  brief: Returns the delay in seconds before mail is sent for quest completion
  description: This method retrieves the time delay in seconds that is applied to
    the mail reward system for completed quests. It determines how long a player must
    wait before receiving quest rewards via mail, which typically occurs after completing
    a quest and having the reward sent to their mailbox. The delay value is usually
    set to 0 seconds, meaning the reward is sent immediately upon completion, but
    can be configured to delay sending rewards by a specified number of seconds. This
    method is part of the Quest class and provides access to the quest's mail delay
    configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the delay in seconds for quest mail rewards, typically 0 seconds
    for immediate delivery or a positive value for delayed delivery
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 delay = quest->GetRewMailDelaySecs();\nif (delay == 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Quest rewards sent immediately\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Quest rewards sent after\
      \ delay seconds\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest reward methods
    to determine when mail rewards are sent. The delay value can be configured through
    database settings or quest scripts, and affects the timing of quest completion
    rewards.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with other quest-related methods like
    GetRewMoney or GetRewXP. The delay value may vary between different quest types
    and is usually set to 0 for immediate delivery unless specified otherwise.
