  method: OptimizeInterruptTiming
  signature: void WarriorAI::OptimizeInterruptTiming()
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the timing of interrupt abilities for the warrior AI to maximize
    effectiveness during combat.
  description: The OptimizeInterruptTiming method adjusts the timing and execution
    of interrupt abilities within the WarriorAI class to ensure optimal use of crowd
    control spells such as Pummel, Shield Slam, or other interrupt mechanics. This
    method evaluates the current combat state, target threat levels, and available
    cooldowns to determine the most effective moment to apply an interrupt. It is
    typically called during the AI's update cycle to dynamically adapt interrupt usage
    based on evolving battlefield conditions. The method does not directly cast spells
    but prepares the internal state for when an interrupt should be executed next.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic\
      \ ...\n    OptimizeInterruptTiming();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal AI decision-making process and should
    not be called manually unless implementing a custom warrior AI behavior. It relies
    on the AI's understanding of target positioning, threat levels, and spell cooldowns
    to make decisions.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of the normal AI update loop may lead to inconsistent
    interrupt timing or unexpected behavior in combat. Ensure that all relevant combat
    state variables are properly initialized before invoking this function.
