  brief: Moves ownership of a GameObjectAI instance to another GameObjectAI instance
  description: The move assignment operator for GameObjectAI transfers all resources
    and state from the source GameObjectAI object to the current object. This operation
    is typically used when moving GameObjectAI objects between containers or when
    reassigning AI behavior to different game objects. The method ensures proper cleanup
    of the source object's resources while transferring ownership of any dynamically
    allocated memory or references. This is a fundamental part of C++ move semantics
    and helps optimize resource management in TrinityCore's AI system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current GameObjectAI object after the move assignment
    has been completed, allowing for chaining of operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'GameObjectAI ai1;

      GameObjectAI ai2 = std::move(ai1); // Move ai1''s resources to ai2

      // ai1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Container Context
    code: 'std::vector<GameObjectAI> aiContainer;

      aiContainer.emplace_back();

      GameObjectAI newAI = std::move(aiContainer[0]); // Move first element to newAI

      // aiContainer[0] is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically auto-generated by the compiler when no user-defined
    move assignment operator is provided. In TrinityCore's context, GameObjectAI objects
    may contain pointers to game object data structures that need proper ownership
    transfer during move operations. The implementation should ensure no double-free
    errors occur and that all internal state is properly transferred.
  warnings: After a move assignment, the source object should not be used in any way
    that might access its former resources, as those resources have been transferred
    to the target object. This can lead to undefined behavior if the source object's
    methods are called afterward.
