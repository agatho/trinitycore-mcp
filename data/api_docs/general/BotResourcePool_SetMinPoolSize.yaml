  class: BotResourcePool
  method: SetMinPoolSize
  signature: void BotResourcePool::SetMinPoolSize(uint32 minSize)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the minimum size of the bot resource pool to the specified value.
  description: The SetMinPoolSize method configures the minimum number of resources
    that must be maintained within the bot resource pool. This ensures that the system
    always has a baseline amount of available resources for bot operations, preventing
    shortages during peak usage periods. The method updates an internal configuration
    parameter that governs resource allocation behavior. Changes to this value may
    affect performance and resource availability depending on the current pool utilization
    and demand.
  parameters:
  - name: minSize
    description: The desired minimum size for the bot resource pool. Must be a non-negative
      integer representing the number of resources to maintain in the pool.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Minimum Pool Size
    code: 'BotResourcePool pool;

      pool.SetMinPoolSize(100);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Pool Size Based on Server Load
    code: 'BotResourcePool pool;

      uint32 loadFactor = GetServerLoad();

      uint32 minSize = 50 + (loadFactor * 10);

      pool.SetMinPoolSize(minSize);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state and should be called before the pool
    is actively used. The actual implementation may involve locking mechanisms to
    ensure thread safety during updates. Modifying this value while bots are actively
    using resources might lead to temporary inconsistencies until the next resource
    refresh cycle.
  warnings: Setting an excessively high minimum size can lead to resource waste and
    memory pressure. Ensure that the specified value aligns with available system
    resources and actual usage patterns to avoid performance degradation.
