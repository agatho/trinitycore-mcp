  brief: Checks whether the Black Market system is enabled in the game
  description: The IsEnabled method determines if the Black Market feature is currently
    active within the TrinityCore server. This functionality allows developers and
    administrators to programmatically verify the operational status of the Black
    Market auction house system, which is typically used for selling rare and unique
    items through a special bidding process. The method returns a boolean value indicating
    the overall state of the system's availability.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Black Market system is enabled and functional; otherwise
    returns false when the system is disabled or not available.
  examples:

    code: "if (blackMarketMgr->IsEnabled()) {\n    // Proceed with Black Market operations\n\
      \    SendBlackMarketAuctionList(player);\n} else {\n    // Handle disabled state\n\
      \    player->SendNotification(\"Black Market is currently disabled.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks configuration settings or database flags that control
    the Black Market availability. It may be called frequently during player interactions
    to ensure proper system state handling.
