  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: SetRareHunting
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::SetRareHunting(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables rare hunting behavior for the advanced behavior manager.
  description: The SetRareHunting method controls whether the AdvancedBehaviorManager
    should activate rare hunting mechanics. When enabled, the AI will prioritize targeting
    and hunting rare or elite mobs based on configured parameters. This setting affects
    the overall behavior pattern of the NPC's AI system, particularly in scenarios
    where rare mob encounters are desired for quest progression or loot distribution.
    The change takes effect immediately and influences subsequent AI decision-making
    processes.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      rare hunting behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Rare Hunting
    code: 'AdvancedBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = ...;

      behaviorManager->SetRareHunting(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Rare Hunting Conditionally
    code: 'AdvancedBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = ...;

      bool isQuestActive = player->GetQuestStatus(12345) == QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE;

      behaviorManager->SetRareHunting(!isQuestActive);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal AI state flags and should be called before
    or during AI initialization. Changes to this setting may not immediately affect
    already processed AI cycles but will take effect in the next decision cycle.
  warnings: Calling this method repeatedly without checking current state may cause
    unnecessary overhead in AI processing. Ensure that rare hunting is only enabled
    when appropriate for the current game scenario or quest state.
