  class: BotActionExtended
  method: UseConsumable
  signature: BotActionExtended BotActionExtended::UseConsumable(int bot, uint32 itemId,
    uint32 timestamp)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the use of a consumable item by a bot, returning a BotActionExtended
    object for further action handling.
  description: The UseConsumable method is designed to trigger the consumption of
    a specified item by a bot character within the TrinityCore framework. It takes
    the bot's identifier, the item's unique ID, and a timestamp as inputs to determine
    when the action should occur. This method is typically used in AI-driven bot systems
    where automated actions need to be scheduled or executed. The returned BotActionExtended
    object allows for chaining of additional actions or tracking of the consumable
    usage within the bot's behavior system.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: The identifier of the bot character that will use the consumable
      item. This is typically a unique integer value representing the bot instance
      in the game world.
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the consumable item to be used. This corresponds
      to the item's entry ID in the game database, such as health potions or mana
      potions.
  - name: timestamp
    description: A Unix timestamp indicating when the consumable usage should take
      place. This allows for scheduling actions at specific times within the bot's
      AI execution cycle.
  returns: Returns a BotActionExtended object which represents the scheduled or executed
    consumable usage action. This object can be used to chain additional actions,
    track completion status, or manage the sequence of bot behaviors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: BotActionExtended action = botAction.UseConsumable(12345, 18839, time(nullptr));
      // Use a health potion by bot ID 12345 at current time
    language: cpp
  - title: Scheduling Future Consumption
    code: 'uint32 futureTime = time(nullptr) + 30; // 30 seconds from now

      BotActionExtended action = botAction.UseConsumable(12345, 18839, futureTime);
      // Schedule potion usage'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the specified bot and item exist in the game world.
    The timestamp should be a valid Unix timestamp; using an invalid or past timestamp
    may result in immediate execution or unexpected behavior. The returned BotActionExtended
    object must be properly managed to avoid memory leaks or dangling references.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot has sufficient permissions and inventory space for
    the consumable item before calling this method. Using invalid bot IDs or non-existent
    item IDs can lead to undefined behavior or crashes in the AI system. Be cautious
    when scheduling actions with very short time intervals as it may overload the
    bot's action queue.
