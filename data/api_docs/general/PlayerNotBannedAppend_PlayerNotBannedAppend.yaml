  signature: void PlayerNotBannedAppend::PlayerNotBannedAppend(const std::string &
    playerName)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new player not banned append instance with the specified player
    name.
  description: The PlayerNotBannedAppend class constructor initializes an instance
    for handling player unbanning operations. This method sets up internal state to
    track a specific player by their name, preparing for subsequent unbanning logic
    or validation checks within the TrinityCore framework. The implementation likely
    integrates with the authentication and account management systems to ensure proper
    access control and security protocols are maintained when processing unbanning
    requests.
  parameters:
  - name: playerName
    description: The unique identifier of the player to be processed for unbanning.
      This should be a valid string representing the player's name in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'PlayerNotBannedAppend unbanningHandler("Gandalf");

      // Initializes an instance to handle unbanning of player ''Gandalf'''
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely performs minimal initialization. Actual unbanning
    logic would typically be implemented in separate methods rather than within the
    constructor itself. The class may require additional setup or method calls to
    complete the unbanning process.
