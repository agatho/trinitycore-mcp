documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the IcicleTracker class with default values.
  description: The IcicleTracker constructor initializes a new instance of the IcicleTracker
    class. This method sets up the internal state and data members required for tracking
    icicles in the game environment. The constructor typically handles memory allocation,
    default value initialization, and any necessary setup for the tracking functionality.
    In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this class likely manages the
    behavior and state of icicle objects, such as their position, duration, or interaction
    with players. This method is automatically invoked when a new IcicleTracker object
    is created using the 'new' operator or when declared as a local variable.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic instantiation of IcicleTracker
    code: 'IcicleTracker* tracker = new IcicleTracker();

      // Or alternatively:

      IcicleTracker tracker;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The constructor may perform initialization that is essential for the proper
    functioning of the IcicleTracker class. Developers should be aware that any custom
    initialization logic within this method will execute upon object creation, potentially
    affecting performance if it involves expensive operations.
