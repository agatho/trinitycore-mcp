  signature: uint32 ItemTemplate::GetMap() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the map identifier associated with the item template.
  description: The GetMap method retrieves the unique map identifier (ID) that is
    associated with an item template. This value determines in which game map or instance
    the item can be used, spawned, or interacted with. The returned value corresponds
    to the Map.dbc entry ID and is crucial for determining valid locations for item
    usage, such as quest items, loot, or world objects. This method does not perform
    any validation on the map ID; it simply returns the stored value from the item
    template data structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 representing the map identifier (Map ID) associated with this
    item template. A value of 0 typically indicates that the item is not restricted
    to a specific map or instance, while non-zero values correspond to valid Map.dbc
    entry IDs.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and log the map ID for an item
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nif (itemTemplate)\n\
      {\n    uint32 mapId = itemTemplate->GetMap();\n    sLog->outString(\"Item 12345\
      \ is associated with map ID: %u\", mapId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses a cached value from the ItemTemplate data structure.
    It is safe to call from any thread context, assuming the ItemTemplate object itself
    is properly synchronized or immutable during access.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this value for map-specific logic; ensure that
    the map ID returned actually corresponds to a valid map in the game world, as
    invalid IDs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect item interactions.
