documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BattlefieldControlZoneHandler instance and releases all associated
    resources.
  description: The destructor for the BattlefieldControlZoneHandler class is responsible
    for cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the object's lifetime. This method ensures proper resource deallocation when the
    handler object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this handler likely manages control zone data for battlefield
    systems such as Wintergrasp or Tol Barad, where it may handle player interactions,
    zone boundaries, and control state tracking. The destructor typically performs
    cleanup operations like removing references to game objects, unregistering event
    handlers, or releasing internal data structures.

  - title: Basic Destruction of BattlefieldControlZoneHandler
    code: 'BattlefieldControlZoneHandler* handler = new BattlefieldControlZoneHandler();

      // ... use the handler ...

      delete handler; // Triggers ~BattlefieldControlZoneHandler()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime when an object
    goes out of scope or is deleted. Developers should not manually invoke destructors
    unless implementing custom memory management patterns. The destruction process
    may involve calling base class destructors and cleaning up any internal containers
    or pointers.
