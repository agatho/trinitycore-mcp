  method: GetShapeshiftForm
  signature: int Unit::GetShapeshiftForm() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current shapeshift form of the unit.
  description: The GetShapeshiftForm method retrieves the active shapeshift form currently
    being used by the unit. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework to determine what form a player or creature is currently in, such as
    cat form, bear form, or other shapeshift states. The returned value corresponds
    to specific form identifiers that are defined within the game mechanics and can
    be used for various gameplay purposes including checking if a unit is in a specific
    form, determining valid spell usage, or implementing conditional logic based on
    current form state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the shapeshift form ID. This value corresponds
    to predefined form identifiers (e.g., 1 for cat form, 2 for bear form, 3 for travel
    form, etc.) and can be used to determine which form is active or to check if a
    specific form is currently active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int form = unit->GetShapeshiftForm();\nif (form == 1)\n{\n    // Unit is\
      \ in cat form\n}\nelse if (form == 2)\n{\n    // Unit is in bear form\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other form-related methods
    like GetShapeshiftForm() and can be affected by various game mechanics including
    spell effects, buffs, and debuffs. The return value may vary depending on whether
    the unit is a player or NPC, and should be used carefully when checking for specific
    forms.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a unit is in a certain
    form without considering other factors such as aura effects or spell restrictions.
    It's important to note that this method may return zero if no shapeshift form
    is active, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about the unit's current
    state.
