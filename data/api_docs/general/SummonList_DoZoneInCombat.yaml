  class: SummonList
  method: DoZoneInCombat
  signature: void SummonList::DoZoneInCombat(int entry)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates combat for all summons in the zone matching the specified entry
    ID.
  description: The DoZoneInCombat method triggers combat behavior for all summoned
    creatures or NPCs within the current zone that match the provided entry ID. This
    function is typically used in AI scripts to engage enemies or initiate combat
    scenarios when a specific condition is met. It iterates through all summons associated
    with the summoner and activates their combat state, causing them to attack nearby
    hostile targets. The method does not directly handle damage or target selection
    but rather initiates the combat state for eligible summons.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The creature entry ID to match against summoned creatures. Only summons
      with this exact entry ID will be affected by the combat activation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Script
    code: "void BossAI::JustEngagedWith(Unit* who)\n{\n    // Engage all summoned\
      \ wolves with entry ID 12345\n    summons.DoZoneInCombat(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Dynamic Entry IDs
    code: "void EventAI::OnEventReceived(uint32 eventId)\n{\n    if (eventId == 1001)\n\
      \    {\n        // Activate summons based on dynamic entry from event\n    \
      \    uint32 summonEntry = GetSummonEntryForEvent(eventId);\n        summons.DoZoneInCombat(summonEntry);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the summons are already present in the zone and
    properly registered with the SummonList. The combat state change affects only
    those summons that are currently alive and within the zone boundaries. It's commonly
    used in boss encounters where summoned minions should engage enemies upon the
    boss entering combat.
  warnings: Ensure that the entry ID passed matches exactly with the summon entries
    to avoid unintended behavior. This method does not validate if summons are already
    in combat, so calling it multiple times may cause unexpected results. The function
    operates on all summons in the zone, which could impact performance if there are
    many summoned creatures.
