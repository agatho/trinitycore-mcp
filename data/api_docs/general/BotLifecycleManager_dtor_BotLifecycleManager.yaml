  method: ~BotLifecycleManager
  signature: void BotLifecycleManager::~BotLifecycleManager()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BotLifecycleManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotLifecycleManager class is responsible for
    releasing all allocated memory and cleaning up any internal data structures or
    references managed by this class. In the context of TrinityCore's bot system,
    this method ensures that all bot-related lifecycle management resources are properly
    disposed of when the manager instance is destroyed. This typically includes cleaning
    up bot instances, canceling pending operations, and ensuring no dangling pointers
    remain in the system. The destructor is automatically invoked when the BotLifecycleManager
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of BotLifecycleManager instance
    code: 'BotLifecycleManager* manager = new BotLifecycleManager();

      // ... perform operations with the manager ...

      delete manager; // Triggers ~BotLifecycleManager()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless managing memory manually.
    It's typically invoked automatically by the C++ runtime when an object goes out
    of scope or is explicitly deleted. Ensure that all bot references are properly
    cleaned up before this destructor runs to avoid resource leaks.
