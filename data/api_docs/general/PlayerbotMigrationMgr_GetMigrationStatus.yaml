  class: PlayerbotMigrationMgr
  method: GetMigrationStatus
  signature: MigrationStatus PlayerbotMigrationMgr::GetMigrationStatus()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current migration status of player bot functionality within
    the TrinityCore server.
  description: The GetMigrationStatus method returns the MigrationStatus enum value
    that indicates whether player bot migration is currently enabled, disabled, or
    in progress. This status affects how player bots are handled by the server and
    determines if they should be created, updated, or removed from the game world.
    The method provides a way for other systems to query the current state of player
    bot migration without directly manipulating internal flags. It is typically used
    during server startup, configuration changes, or when checking the readiness of
    player bot systems before performing operations that depend on their presence.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a MigrationStatus enum value indicating the current state of player
    bot migration. Possible values include MIGRATION_STATUS_DISABLED, MIGRATION_STATUS_ENABLED,
    and MIGRATION_STATUS_IN_PROGRESS depending on the server's configuration and operational
    state.
  examples:
  - title: Check Migration Status Before Initializing Bots
    code: "MigrationStatus status = sPlayerbotMigrationMgr->GetMigrationStatus();\n\
      if (status == MIGRATION_STATUS_ENABLED)\n{\n    // Proceed with initializing\
      \ player bots\n    sPlayerbotAIInit->Initialize();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    migration status may change during runtime based on server configuration updates
    or administrative commands, so callers should be prepared to handle different
    states appropriately.
