  class: ObstacleUtils
  method: DoCirclesIntersect
  signature: bool ObstacleUtils::DoCirclesIntersect(const int & center1, float radius1,
    const int & center2, float radius2)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether two circles intersect in 2D space based on their centers
    and radii.
  description: The DoCirclesIntersect method calculates if two circles defined by
    their center points and radii overlap or touch each other in a two-dimensional
    plane. This utility function is commonly used in game mechanics such as area-of-effect
    spell calculations, collision detection for obstacles, or determining if entities
    are within proximity of each other. The method performs geometric computations
    to compare the distance between circle centers against the sum of their radii.
    It returns true if the circles intersect (including touching), and false otherwise.
    This function assumes that both center parameters represent valid 2D coordinates
    and that radius values are non-negative.
  parameters:
  - name: center1
    description: Reference to an integer representing the first circle's center point.
      In TrinityCore context, this typically refers to a GUID or coordinate identifier
      used for positioning.
  - name: radius1
    description: Float value specifying the radius of the first circle. Must be non-negative;
      negative values may lead to undefined behavior.
  - name: center2
    description: Reference to an integer representing the second circle's center point.
      In TrinityCore context, this typically refers to a GUID or coordinate identifier
      used for positioning.
  - name: radius2
    description: Float value specifying the radius of the second circle. Must be non-negative;
      negative values may lead to undefined behavior.
  returns: Boolean value indicating whether the two circles intersect. Returns true
    if the circles overlap or touch, and false if they are completely separate.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Circle Intersection Check
    code: 'int playerGuid = 12345;

      int targetGuid = 67890;

      float playerRadius = 5.0f;

      float targetRadius = 3.0f;

      bool intersects = ObstacleUtils::DoCirclesIntersect(playerGuid, playerRadius,
      targetGuid, targetRadius);

      // Returns true if the circles defined by player and target GUIDs with given
      radii intersect'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Spell Area Effects
    code: 'uint32 spellId = 12345;

      float radius = 10.0f;

      int casterGuid = 54321;

      int targetGuid = 98765;

      bool isAffected = ObstacleUtils::DoCirclesIntersect(casterGuid, radius, targetGuid,
      0.0f);

      // Checks if a target is within the area of effect of a spell cast by the caster'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs geometric calculations using integer-based center identifiers
    and floating-point radii. The implementation likely uses squared distance comparisons
    for performance optimization to avoid expensive square root operations. Ensure
    that the center identifiers correspond to valid positions in the game world or
    coordinate system being used.
  warnings: The method assumes that center parameters are valid identifiers (e.g.,
    GUIDs) and that radius values are non-negative. Passing invalid or uninitialized
    data may result in incorrect results or undefined behavior. Be cautious when using
    this function with very large coordinate values, as floating-point precision might
    affect accuracy.
