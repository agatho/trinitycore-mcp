  class: ReputationMgr
  method: ApplyForceReaction
  signature: void ReputationMgr::ApplyForceReaction(uint32 faction_id, int rank, bool
    apply)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a forced reputation rank to a specified faction for the player.
  description: The ApplyForceReaction method sets or removes a forced reputation state
    for a given faction. When applied, it overrides the normal reputation system behavior,
    forcing the player's standing with that faction to a specific rank regardless
    of normal progression. This is commonly used in quest rewards, scripted events,
    or temporary faction modifications. The method operates on the player's ReputationMgr
    instance and modifies internal faction data structures to reflect the forced reaction.
    It does not affect the underlying faction template or permanent reputation values,
    but rather creates a temporary override that persists until explicitly removed.
  parameters:
  - name: faction_id
    description: The unique identifier of the faction to modify. This must correspond
      to a valid faction entry in the game's database.
  - name: rank
    description: The reputation rank to force. Valid values are typically 0-7 (Hated,
      Hostile, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Honored, Revered, Exalted). A value
      of -1 removes any forced reaction.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the forced reaction. When false and rank is -1, all forced reactions for the
      faction are cleared.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Force Exalted Reputation with Stormwind
    code: 'ReputationMgr* repMgr = player->GetReputationMgr();

      repMgr->ApplyForceReaction(72, 7, true); // Force Exalted with Stormwind (faction
      ID 72)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove Forced Reputation
    code: 'ReputationMgr* repMgr = player->GetReputationMgr();

      repMgr->ApplyForceReaction(72, -1, false); // Remove any forced reaction with
      Stormwind'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal reputation state and should be
    used carefully. It bypasses normal faction progression mechanics, so it's typically
    reserved for quest scripting or special game events. The forced reaction will
    persist until explicitly removed or until the player logs out.
  warnings: Using this method with invalid faction IDs or rank values can cause undefined
    behavior. Be cautious when applying forced reactions during active quests or events
    as it may interfere with normal reputation progression. Removing a forced reaction
    with rank -1 and apply=false will clear all forced states for that faction, not
    just one specific rank.
