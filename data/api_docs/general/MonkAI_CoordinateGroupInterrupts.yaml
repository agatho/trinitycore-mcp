documentation:
  brief: Coordinates group interrupt handling for the Monk AI, managing when and how
    interrupts are applied to the player's current target.
  description: The CoordinateGroupInterrupts method in the MonkAI class is responsible
    for managing the logic that determines when a monk should interrupt enemy spellcasters
    within its group or raid context. This method evaluates the current combat situation,
    including target threat levels, available cooldowns, and group coordination settings
    to decide whether an interrupt should be executed. It ensures that interrupts
    are used strategically rather than randomly, preventing wasted resources and optimizing
    the monk's contribution to group combat effectiveness. The method typically checks
    if the target is casting a dangerous spell and if the monk has sufficient mana
    or energy to perform the interrupt without disrupting other important abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n\
      \    CoordinateGroupInterrupts();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and relies on
    the monk's current target state, threat level, and group settings. It assumes
    that the AI has already determined that an interrupt may be beneficial based on
    other factors such as spell casting detection.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without proper target validation can lead
    to unnecessary resource expenditure or missed interrupt opportunities. The method
    should only be called when the monk is in a combat situation where interrupts
    are relevant.
