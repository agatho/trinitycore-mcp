  method: OnConfigLoad
  signature: void ScriptMgr::OnConfigLoad(bool reload)
documentation:
  brief: Executes configuration loading logic for all registered scripts when server
    configuration is reloaded or initially loaded.
  description: The OnConfigLoad method is a callback function invoked by the TrinityCore
    script manager to notify all registered scripts that the server configuration
    has been loaded or reloaded. This method allows script modules to perform initialization
    tasks, apply settings, or update internal states based on the current configuration
    values. It is typically called during server startup and whenever the /reload
    config command is executed. The reload parameter indicates whether this is an
    initial load (false) or a reload operation (true). Scripts can use this hook to
    ensure their behavior aligns with the latest configuration settings without requiring
    manual intervention.
  parameters:
  - name: reload
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the configuration is being reloaded (true)
      or loaded for the first time (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Implementation in a Script Module
    code: "class MyScript : public ScriptObject\n{\npublic:\n    MyScript() : ScriptObject(\"\
      MyScript\") {}\n\n    void OnConfigLoad(bool reload) override\n    {\n     \
      \   // Load configuration values\n        if (reload)\n            sLog->outString(\"\
      MyScript configuration reloaded.\");\n        else\n            sLog->outString(\"\
      MyScript configuration loaded.\");\n        \n        // Apply settings to internal\
      \ variables\n        // ... implementation details ...\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called from the main server thread and should not perform
    long-running operations. It's typically used for lightweight initialization or
    configuration updates that don't require heavy processing. The method may be invoked
    multiple times during server lifetime, especially when using /reload config command.
  warnings: Avoid performing expensive operations or blocking calls within this method
    as it can impact server startup time and reload performance. Do not assume that
    all configuration values are available immediately after this call; some may require
    additional processing or validation.
