  class: WorldSession

  signature: void WorldSession::HandleQueuedMessagesEnd(const WorldPackets::Auth::QueuedMessagesEnd
    & queuedMessagesEnd)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the end of queued authentication messages during client-server handshake.
  description: The HandleQueuedMessagesEnd method processes the final packet in a
    sequence of queued authentication messages sent by the client. This method is
    typically invoked during the initial connection phase when the client has finished
    transmitting its authentication data. It serves as a synchronization point to
    indicate that all pending authentication messages have been received and processed.
    The method ensures proper state management for the session and may trigger further
    authentication steps or connection completion logic. It's part of TrinityCore's
    secure authentication protocol implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: queuedMessagesEnd
    description: The queued messages end packet containing client authentication state
      information. This parameter represents the final message in a sequence of authentication
      packets that the client sends to the server during connection establishment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in authentication flow
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleQueuedMessagesEnd(const WorldPackets::Auth::QueuedMessagesEnd\
      \ & queuedMessagesEnd)\n{\n    // Process final authentication message\n   \
      \ _authenticated = true;\n    SendAuthResponse();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the secure authentication handshake and should only
    be called during initial connection setup. It's typically invoked by the network
    handler when a QueuedMessagesEnd packet is received from a client.
