documentation:
  brief: Compares two SpellCastVisual objects for inequality.
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this SpellCastVisual
    instance and another SpellCastVisual object to determine if they are not equal.
    This comparison typically evaluates the underlying data members of both objects,
    such as visual identifiers, spell effects, or animation sequences. In the context
    of TrinityCore's spell system, this operator is used to check whether two spell
    cast visuals differ in their presentation properties, which can be important for
    determining when to update or reapply visual effects during spell casting. The
    method returns true if the objects are not identical and false if they are equal.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current SpellCastVisual object is not equal to the
    provided right-hand side object; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Inequality Check
    code: 'SpellCastVisual visual1;

      SpellCastVisual visual2;

      bool result = (visual1 != visual2); // Returns true if visuals differ

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Conditional Logic
    code: "if (player->GetSpellCastVisual() != target->GetSpellCastVisual()) {\n \
      \   // Apply different visual effects for spell cast\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely uses a member-wise comparison of the SpellCastVisual's
    internal data members. It is commonly used in containers or comparisons where
    object equality needs to be checked efficiently. The implementation may be optimized
    for performance by comparing only key identifiers rather than entire structures.
