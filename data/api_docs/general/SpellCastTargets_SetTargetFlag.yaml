  method: SetTargetFlag
  signature: void SpellCastTargets::SetTargetFlag(SpellCastTargetFlags flag)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the target flag for a spell cast, defining the type of target being
    cast upon.
  description: The SetTargetFlag method configures the target flags for a spell cast
    operation within the TrinityCore framework. This method is used to specify how
    the spell's target should be interpreted, such as whether it targets an enemy,
    friend, or self. The target flags determine the validation and processing logic
    applied during spell execution. This method typically works in conjunction with
    other SpellCastTargets functionality to properly define the casting context for
    spells. It modifies internal state that affects how the spell system handles targeting
    and validation.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: The SpellCastTargetFlags value to set for this spell cast target.
      This flag defines the type of target being specified, such as TARGET_FLAG_UNIT,
      TARGET_FLAG_ITEM, etc.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Unit Target Flag
    code: 'SpellCastTargets targets;

      targets.SetTargetFlag(TARGET_FLAG_UNIT);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Multiple Target Flags
    code: 'SpellCastTargets targets;

      targets.SetTargetFlag(TARGET_FLAG_UNIT | TARGET_FLAG_PLAYER);

      // This would indicate a target that is both a unit and a player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal state of the SpellCastTargets object.
    It should be called before spell execution to ensure proper targeting behavior.
    The flag parameter should be one or more valid SpellCastTargetFlags values combined
    using bitwise OR operations.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting target flags can lead to invalid spell targeting,
    causing spells to fail or target unintended entities. Ensure that the target flags
    match the intended casting context and that appropriate validation is performed
    before calling this method.
