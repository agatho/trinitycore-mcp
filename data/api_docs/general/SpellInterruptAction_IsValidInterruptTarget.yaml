  class: SpellInterruptAction
  method: IsValidInterruptTarget
  signature: bool SpellInterruptAction::IsValidInterruptTarget(::Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a target unit is a valid candidate for spell interruption.
  description: The IsValidInterruptTarget method evaluates whether a given Unit target
    is eligible to be interrupted by a spell interrupt action. This validation typically
    checks if the target is an enemy, is currently casting a spell, and meets other
    game-specific conditions required for spell interruption. The method is commonly
    used in spell processing logic to ensure that only appropriate targets are considered
    for interruption effects such as silence, interrupt spells, or other debuffs that
    prevent spellcasting.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target unit is a valid candidate for spell interruption;
    otherwise returns false. A valid target must typically be an enemy unit that is
    currently casting a spell and not immune to interruption effects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Processing
    code: "if (spellInterruptAction.IsValidInterruptTarget(targetUnit)) {\n    //\
      \ Proceed with interrupting the target's spell\n    targetUnit->InterruptSpell(CurrentSpellTypes::SPELL_INTERRUPT_TYPE_CHANNELED);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks such as verifying that the target is not
    dead, not immune to interruption effects, and is within range or line of sight.
    It may also consider faction relationships to ensure only hostile units are interrupted.
