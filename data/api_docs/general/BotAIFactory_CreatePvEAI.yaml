  signature: int BotAIFactory::CreatePvEAI(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a PvE AI behavior for the specified bot player.
  description: The CreatePvEAI method is responsible for setting up and configuring
    the PvE (Player versus Environment) artificial intelligence behavior for a given
    bot player. This method typically assigns appropriate AI strategies, movement
    patterns, and combat behaviors that allow the bot to effectively engage in solo
    or group PvE content such as questing, dungeon exploration, and monster combat.
    The method ensures that the bot's AI is properly initialized with necessary parameters
    and state tracking to function within the game environment. It may also perform
    validation checks to ensure the player is eligible for PvE AI assignment and handle
    any required setup before the AI becomes active.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the AI creation
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful creation, while non-zero
    values may represent various error conditions such as invalid player state, insufficient
    resources, or AI system unavailability.
  examples:
  - title: Basic PvE AI Creation
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is a valid Player pointer\nint result\
      \ = BotAIFactory::CreatePvEAI(bot);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // AI successfully\
      \ created for the bot\n    printf(\"PvE AI created successfully for bot\\n\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Handle error case\n    printf(\"Failed to create PvE AI\
      \ for bot, error code: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during bot initialization or when a bot needs
    to switch to PvE behavior mode. The implementation may involve setting up internal
    AI state machines, assigning default behavior trees, and configuring combat parameters
    based on the bot's level and class. Developers should ensure that the Player object
    passed to this method is valid and properly initialized before calling.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or uninitialized Player pointer can
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the bot player has been properly
    created and configured in the game world before attempting to assign PvE AI. Additionally,
    repeated calls without proper cleanup may result in resource leaks or inconsistent
    AI states.
