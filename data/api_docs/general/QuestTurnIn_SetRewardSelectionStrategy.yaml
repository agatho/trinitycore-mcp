  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: SetRewardSelectionStrategy
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::SetRewardSelectionStrategy(uint32 botGuid, RewardSelectionStrategy
    strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the reward selection strategy for a quest turn-in operation involving
    a bot player.
  description: The SetRewardSelectionStrategy method configures how rewards are selected
    when a bot player turns in a quest. This method allows developers to define the
    behavior of reward distribution, such as selecting the highest value reward, a
    random reward, or a specific reward based on criteria. It is typically used in
    AI-driven quest completion systems where automated players need to make decisions
    about which rewards to accept during quest turn-ins. The strategy parameter determines
    the logic applied when multiple reward options are available for selection.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot player who will be turning
      in the quest. This identifies which AI-controlled character is performing the
      action.
  - name: strategy
    description: The reward selection strategy to apply. This defines how rewards
      are chosen when multiple options are available, such as selecting the highest
      value, random choice, or specific criteria-based selection.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Bot to Select Highest Value Reward
    code: QuestTurnIn::SetRewardSelectionStrategy(12345, RewardSelectionStrategy::HIGHEST_VALUE);
    language: cpp
  - title: Configure Bot for Random Reward Selection
    code: QuestTurnIn::SetRewardSelectionStrategy(67890, RewardSelectionStrategy::RANDOM);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI quest turn-in system and should be called before
    initiating a quest turn-in process. The strategy parameter must correspond to
    valid reward selection enums defined in the QuestTurnIn class or related systems.
  warnings: Incorrect GUID values may result in undefined behavior or no effect on
    the bot's reward selection. Ensure that the bot is properly initialized and registered
    before calling this method.
