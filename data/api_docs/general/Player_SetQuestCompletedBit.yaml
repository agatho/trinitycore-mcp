  method: SetQuestCompletedBit
  signature: void Player::SetQuestCompletedBit(uint32 questId, bool completed)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the completion status of a quest for the player.
  description: This method updates the quest completion status for a specific quest
    ID within the player's quest log. It marks whether a quest has been completed
    or not, allowing developers to control quest progression and completion state.
    The method affects the player's quest log and can influence quest-related gameplay
    mechanics such as quest rewards and objective tracking.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to update. This must be a valid
      quest ID present in the game database.
  - name: completed
    description: A boolean value indicating whether the quest should be marked as
      completed (true) or not completed (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Completion
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetQuestCompletedBit(12345, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Quest Completion with Conditional Logic
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nif (player->GetQuestStatus(12345) == QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE)\n\
      {\n    player->SetQuestCompletedBit(12345, true);\n}\nelse\n{\n    player->SetQuestCompletedBit(12345,\
      \ false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's quest log and should be used carefully
    when dealing with quest progression. It does not trigger any automatic reward
    distribution or quest completion checks; it simply updates the internal state
    of the quest. The method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related
    methods to manage quest progress.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect quest status tracking,
    potentially causing issues with quest rewards or objective completion. It should
    only be called with valid quest IDs that exist in the database. Using invalid
    quest IDs may result in undefined behavior or errors.
