documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new RuneSystem instance with default configuration and state.
  description: The RuneSystem constructor initializes a new instance of the RuneSystem
    class, setting up internal data structures required for managing player runes
    in World of Warcraft. This method is typically invoked during player creation
    or when a new rune system context needs to be established. It configures default
    rune states, cooldowns, and initializes any necessary tracking variables for rune
    regeneration mechanics. The constructor ensures that all rune-related systems
    are properly initialized before the player can utilize rune-based abilities such
    as those found in Death Knight specializations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic RuneSystem Initialization
    code: 'RuneSystem* system = new RuneSystem();

      // Initializes a new rune system with default settings

      // Ready for use in player rune management'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when creating player instances. Developers should not directly instantiate RuneSystem
    objects unless implementing custom rune mechanics or extending core functionality.
    The initialization process includes setting up internal rune arrays, cooldown
    timers, and state tracking variables.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of RuneSystem should only be performed in specialized
    circumstances. Improper use may lead to undefined behavior or inconsistent rune
    states. This constructor is not intended for general use outside of core framework
    components.
