  class: RangedPositionStrategy
  method: RangedPositionStrategy
  signature: void RangedPositionStrategy::RangedPositionStrategy(Map * map)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a RangedPositionStrategy object with the specified map for positioning
    calculations.
  description: The RangedPositionStrategy constructor initializes the strategy object
    with a given Map instance. This allows the strategy to perform positioning calculations
    based on the map's terrain, objects, and other spatial data. The initialized strategy
    is typically used by AI systems or movement planners that need to determine optimal
    ranged attack positions or patrol routes within a specific game world area. The
    map parameter is essential for calculating valid positions and avoiding obstacles.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object that defines the spatial context for positioning
      calculations. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Map* myMap = sMapMgr->FindMap(0, 0);

      RangedPositionStrategy strategy(myMap);

      // Strategy is now ready to calculate ranged positions on the specified map'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in AI Context
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override {\n        if (me->IsWithinMeleeRange(target)) {\n            //\
      \ Use ranged strategy for positioning\n            Map* map = me->GetMap();\n\
      \            RangedPositionStrategy strategy(map);\n            // Perform positioning\
      \ logic here\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or caching.
    The map reference is stored for later use in position calculations, but no immediate
    processing occurs. Ensure that the Map pointer remains valid throughout the lifetime
    of the strategy object.
  warnings: Passing a null map pointer will likely cause undefined behavior or crashes
    during subsequent positioning operations. Always verify that the map is loaded
    and valid before creating a RangedPositionStrategy instance.
