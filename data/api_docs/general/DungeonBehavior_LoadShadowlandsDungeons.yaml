  brief: Initializes and loads all Shadowlands dungeon data into the DungeonBehavior
    system
  description: The LoadShadowlandsDungeons method is responsible for loading and initializing
    all dungeon-related data specific to the Shadowlands expansion. This method ensures
    that all Shadowlands dungeons are properly registered within the DungeonBehavior
    system, making them available for player encounters, loot distribution, and quest
    progression. The method typically handles database queries or configuration file
    parsing to retrieve dungeon definitions, difficulty settings, and reward structures
    associated with Shadowlands content. It is designed to be called during server
    initialization or when expansion data needs to be refreshed in memory.

  notes: This method is typically invoked during server startup or expansion activation.
    It may perform database operations and should be called before any dungeon-related
    gameplay logic is executed. The method assumes that the database connection and
    Shadowlands content definitions are properly configured.
