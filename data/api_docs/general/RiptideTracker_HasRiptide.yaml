  method: HasRiptide
  signature: bool RiptideTracker::HasRiptide(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has the Riptide spell active on their unit.
  description: The HasRiptide method determines whether a specific unit, identified
    by its GUID, currently has the Riptide spell applied to it. This method is typically
    used in the context of shaman class abilities within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    server implementation. Riptide is a healing spell that applies a periodic healing
    effect over time. The method performs a lookup in the internal RiptideTracker
    data structure to verify if the specified unit is currently affected by this spell.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit with the specified GUID has the Riptide spell
    active; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a target has Riptide
    code: "if (riptideTracker->HasRiptide(targetGuid)) {\n    // Target is affected\
      \ by Riptide\n    // Perform some action\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using HasRiptide in a shaman's spell logic
    code: "void ShamanSpellHandler::HandleHealingSpell(Unit* caster, Unit* target)\
      \ {\n    if (HasRiptide(target->GetGUID())) {\n        // Apply additional healing\
      \ or modify the spell effect\n        // Riptide is active, so increase healing\
      \ amount\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the RiptideTracker has been properly initialized
    and populated with valid GUIDs of units affected by Riptide. The implementation
    likely uses a hash map or similar data structure for efficient lookup. This method
    should only be called on units that are valid and currently in the game world.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method corresponds to a valid unit
    in the current game session, as passing an invalid or non-existent GUID may lead
    to undefined behavior or incorrect results. The method does not perform any validation
    of the GUID itself.
