api:
  class: DeathKnightAI
  method: DetectSpecialization
  signature: void DeathKnightAI::DetectSpecialization()
documentation:
  brief: Detects and sets the Death Knight's specialization based on current talent
    configuration.
  description: The DetectSpecialization method analyzes the Death Knight's current
    talent tree and class-specific abilities to determine which specialization is
    active. This method is typically invoked during AI initialization or when a player
    switches talents, ensuring that the AI behavior aligns with the selected specialization.
    The detection process involves checking for specific talent nodes, ability presence,
    and other class-specific indicators to accurately identify whether the Death Knight
    is playing as Blood, Frost, or Unholy. This information is crucial for the AI
    to select appropriate spells, abilities, and strategic behaviors that match the
    chosen specialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Initialization
    code: "void DeathKnightAI::Initialize()\n{\n    DetectSpecialization();\n    //\
      \ AI now knows which specialization to use for behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage After Talent Change
    code: "void Player::OnTalentChange()\n{\n    if (GetAI() && GetAI()->IsType<DeathKnightAI>())\n\
      \    {\n        static_cast<DeathKnightAI*>(GetAI())->DetectSpecialization();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the Death Knight's talent configuration
    is stable and fully loaded. It may have performance implications if invoked too
    frequently during gameplay, as it requires checking multiple talent nodes and
    abilities. The method assumes that all relevant talent data has been properly
    initialized in the player's character state.
  warnings: This method does not validate whether the player actually has a valid
    specialization; it simply detects what talents are present. If a player has an
    incomplete or corrupted talent tree, the detection may return incorrect results.
    Avoid calling this method during combat when the player's talent state is being
    modified.
