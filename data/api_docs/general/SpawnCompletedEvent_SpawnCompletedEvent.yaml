  class: SpawnCompletedEvent
  method: SpawnCompletedEvent
  signature: void SpawnCompletedEvent::SpawnCompletedEvent(int guid, bool succeeded,
    std::string info)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new spawn completion event with specified GUID, success status,
    and informational string.
  description: The SpawnCompletedEvent constructor initializes a new instance of the
    SpawnCompletedEvent class. This method sets up the internal state of the event
    object with a unique identifier (guid), a boolean flag indicating whether the
    spawn operation succeeded or failed, and an informational string that can contain
    additional details about the spawn result. The event is typically used within
    TrinityCore's AI and creature spawning systems to track and communicate the outcome
    of various spawn operations, such as when creatures, game objects, or other entities
    are successfully spawned or fail during the process. This constructor does not
    perform any validation on the input parameters but assumes valid inputs for proper
    operation.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the entity that was spawned. This
      is typically a numeric value used to uniquely identify creatures, game objects,
      or other in-game entities within the TrinityCore system.
  - name: succeeded
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the spawn operation completed successfully.
      True indicates success, false indicates failure.
  - name: info
    description: A string containing additional information about the spawn event.
      This can include error messages, debug information, or other relevant details
      about the spawn process.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic SpawnCompletedEvent Initialization
    code: SpawnCompletedEvent event(12345, true, "Creature spawned successfully");
    language: cpp
  - title: Failed Spawn Event with Error Information
    code: 'SpawnCompletedEvent event(67890, false, "Failed to spawn creature: Invalid
      position");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the SpawnCompletedEvent class and should be used
    in conjunction with other methods of this class to manage spawn completion events.
    The GUID parameter must be a valid identifier for an existing entity within the
    TrinityCore world, otherwise behavior is undefined.
