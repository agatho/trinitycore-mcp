  brief: Initializes the AB (Arathi Basin) strategy for the battleground AI.
  description: The InitializeABStrategy method sets up the strategic behavior and
    decision-making logic specific to the Arathi Basin battleground type. This method
    is typically called during the initialization phase of a battleground to configure
    the AI's approach to objectives, resource management, and team coordination. It
    establishes the foundational strategy that guides NPC and player behavior within
    the context of capturing flags, defending bases, and achieving victory conditions
    in Arathi Basin.

  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'BattlegroundAI* bgAI = new BattlegroundAI();

      bgAI->InitializeABStrategy();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked internally by the battleground system during
    setup. Developers should not call this method directly unless implementing custom
    battleground AI logic. The strategy configuration may vary based on the current
    battleground state and game rules.
