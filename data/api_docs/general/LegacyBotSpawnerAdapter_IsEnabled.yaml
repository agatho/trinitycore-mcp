documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the legacy bot spawner adapter is enabled and active.
  description: The IsEnabled method determines if the LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter instance
    is currently enabled and operational within the TrinityCore framework. This functionality
    is typically used to control the activation state of legacy bot spawning mechanisms,
    which may be part of a larger system for managing NPC or player bot behavior in
    World of Warcraft emulation environments. The method returns a boolean value indicating
    the current operational status of the adapter.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter is enabled
    (true) or disabled (false).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (spawner.IsEnabled()) {\n    // Proceed with bot spawning logic\n  \
      \  spawner.SpawnBots();\n} else {\n    // Handle disabled state\n    LOG_INFO(\"\
      world\", \"Legacy bot spawner is currently disabled.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a simple state check against an internal flag
    or configuration setting. It's important to note that the adapter's enabled state
    may be influenced by external configuration files, server settings, or runtime
    conditions.
