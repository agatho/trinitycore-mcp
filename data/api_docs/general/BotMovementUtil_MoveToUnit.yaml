  class: BotMovementUtil
  method: MoveToUnit
  signature: bool BotMovementUtil::MoveToUnit(int * bot, int * unit, float distance,
    int pointId)
documentation:
  brief: Moves a bot unit toward a target unit within a specified distance.
  description: The MoveToUnit method instructs a bot to navigate its movement towards
    a specified target unit, maintaining a given distance from it. This method is
    typically used in AI behavior scripting for bots to approach or follow other units.
    The function utilizes the bot's movement system and pathfinding capabilities to
    achieve the desired positioning. It returns true upon successful initiation of
    movement, or false if the operation fails due to invalid parameters or movement
    constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot unit identifier (GUID) that will perform the movement
      action.
  - name: unit
    description: Pointer to the target unit identifier (GUID) toward which the bot
      will move.
  - name: distance
    description: The minimum distance the bot should maintain from the target unit
      during movement. Must be a positive value.
  - name: pointId
    description: An optional identifier for a specific point or waypoint in the movement
      path. Zero or negative values may indicate default behavior.
  returns: Returns true if the bot successfully begins moving toward the target unit
    with the specified distance constraint; otherwise, returns false if parameters
    are invalid or movement cannot be initiated.

    code: "int botGuid = 12345;\nint targetGuid = 67890;\nfloat dist = 5.0f;\nint\
      \ pointId = 0;\nbool result = BotMovementUtil::MoveToUnit(&botGuid, &targetGuid,\
      \ dist, pointId);\nif (result) {\n    // Movement initiated successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Bot Following with Specific Waypoint
    code: "int botGuid = 12345;\nint targetGuid = 67890;\nfloat dist = 3.0f;\nint\
      \ pointId = 42;\nbool result = BotMovementUtil::MoveToUnit(&botGuid, &targetGuid,\
      \ dist, pointId);\nif (!result) {\n    // Handle failure case\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to initiate bot movement\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying TrinityCore movement system and pathfinding
    engine. The actual movement behavior may be affected by terrain, obstacles, or
    unit state (e.g., if the bot is in combat). Ensure that both bot and target units
    are valid and exist before calling this method.
  warnings: Passing null pointers for bot or unit parameters will likely cause undefined
    behavior or crashes. Also, very small distance values may result in erratic movement
    patterns due to pathfinding limitations.
