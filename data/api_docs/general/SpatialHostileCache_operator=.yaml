  signature: SpatialHostileCache & SpatialHostileCache::operator=(const SpatialHostileCache
    & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one SpatialHostileCache object to another
  description: The operator= method performs a deep copy of all elements from the
    source SpatialHostileCache object to the target object. This assignment operator
    ensures that both objects maintain independent copies of the cached hostile targets,
    preventing shared state issues. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    this is typically used when updating or replacing the set of hostile units within
    a spatial cache, such as when a creature's threat list changes or when moving
    between different spatial regions. The method returns a reference to the target
    object to allow for chaining assignments.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source SpatialHostileCache object whose contents will be copied
      to this object
  returns: A reference to the current SpatialHostileCache object, enabling chained
    assignment operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment
    code: 'SpatialHostileCache cache1;

      SpatialHostileCache cache2 = cache1; // Uses operator=

      // or

      SpatialHostileCache cache3;

      cache3 = cache1; // Uses operator='
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment
    code: 'SpatialHostileCache cache1, cache2, cache3;

      // ... populate caches ...

      cache1 = cache2 = cache3; // Chained assignment using operator='
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a deep copy operation, meaning that all internal data
    structures and cached hostile targets are duplicated. The implementation should
    be efficient to avoid performance bottlenecks during frequent updates. Since this
    is a core caching mechanism in TrinityCore's AI system, proper memory management
    is crucial when handling large numbers of hostile targets.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning very large SpatialHostileCache objects as it
    may cause temporary memory spikes or performance degradation. Ensure that the
    source object remains valid throughout the assignment operation to prevent undefined
    behavior.
