documentation:
  brief: Initializes the BotPacketRelay system to handle packet relaying for bot clients.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the internal state and resources required
    for the BotPacketRelay class to function properly. It typically configures necessary
    data structures, registers event handlers, and prepares the system to intercept
    and forward packets between bot clients and the game server. This method should
    be called once during the initialization phase of the bot subsystem before any
    packet relay operations are performed. The method ensures that all internal components
    are ready to process incoming and outgoing packets for bot communication.

  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'BotPacketRelay relay;

      relay.Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the startup sequence of bot-related
    systems. It may perform operations that require access to global game state or
    server configurations. The initialization process might involve creating internal
    buffers, setting up thread-safe queues, or registering callbacks with the core
    TrinityCore networking system.
