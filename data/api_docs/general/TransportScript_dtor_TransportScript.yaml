documentation:
  brief: Destroys a TransportScript instance and releases associated resources.
  description: The TransportScript destructor is called automatically when a TransportScript
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any resources allocated by the TransportScript instance, including
    memory deallocation and removal from internal tracking structures. In the context
    of TrinityCore's scripting system, this destructor plays a crucial role in preventing
    memory leaks and maintaining stable server performance when transport-related
    scripts are unloaded or destroyed. The destructor does not take any parameters
    and performs no special operations beyond standard object cleanup.

  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of TransportScript instance
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    TransportScript* script = new TransportScript();\n\
      \    // ... use the script ...\n    delete script; // Destructor called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-based TransportScript destruction
    code: "void AnotherExample()\n{\n    TransportScript script; // Constructor called\n\
      \    // ... use the script ...\n    // Destructor automatically called when\
      \ script goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The TransportScript destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime
    when objects are destroyed. Developers should not manually call this destructor
    unless implementing custom memory management patterns. The destructor is expected
    to be a no-op in most cases, as TransportScript typically doesn't hold complex
    resources that require special cleanup.
