documentation:
  brief: Adds a player to the battleground's free slot queue for potential slot assignment.
  description: The AddToBGFreeSlotQueue method is responsible for placing a player
    into the free slot queue of a battleground instance. This mechanism allows the
    battleground system to efficiently manage player allocation when slots become
    available. The method typically gets invoked when a player joins a battleground
    and there are no immediate available slots, or when a player leaves a battleground
    and their slot becomes free. It ensures that players are queued in an orderly
    fashion to be assigned to open battleground slots as soon as they become available.
    This is part of the core matchmaking and slot management system within TrinityCore's
    battleground framework.

  - title: Basic Usage in Player Join Logic
    code: "void Player::JoinBattleground(Battleground* bg)\n{\n    if (bg->HasFreeSlots())\n\
      \    {\n        bg->AddPlayer(this);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        bg->AddToBGFreeSlotQueue();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the battleground system when
    a player needs to be queued for a slot. It's part of the asynchronous queue management
    that helps maintain balanced and fair battleground matchmaking. The implementation
    likely uses internal data structures like linked lists or priority queues to manage
    the order of players waiting for slots.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by external code unless you
    understand the internal state management of the battleground. Improper usage can
    lead to inconsistent queue states or player assignment issues.
