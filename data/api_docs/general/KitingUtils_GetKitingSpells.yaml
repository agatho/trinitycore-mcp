  signature: int KitingUtils::GetKitingSpells(uint8 playerClass)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the kiting spell ID associated with a specified player class
  description: 'The GetKitingSpells method returns the unique identifier of the kiting
    spell that is applicable to a given player class. Kiting is a gameplay mechanic
    in World of Warcraft where players maintain distance from enemies while dealing
    damage, often using specific spells or abilities. This method serves as a lookup
    utility for retrieving the correct kiting spell based on the player''s class.
    The returned value typically corresponds to an entry in the spell database and
    may be used by AI systems or game logic to determine appropriate actions during
    combat. Precondition: The input playerClass must be a valid class identifier (0-11)
    as defined by TrinityCore''s class constants.'
  parameters:
  - name: playerClass
    description: 'The numeric identifier representing the player''s class. Valid values
      range from 0 to 11, corresponding to the following classes: 0=Warrior, 1=Paladin,
      2=Hunter, 3=ROGUE, 4=PRIEST, 5=Death Knight, 6=Shaman, 7=Mage, 8=Warlock, 9=Monk,
      10=Druid, 11=Demon Hunter.'
  returns: Returns an integer representing the spell ID of the kiting ability for
    the specified class. If no kiting spell exists for the given class or if the input
    is invalid, the method may return 0 or a negative value indicating an error condition.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve kiting spell for Hunter class
    code: int hunterKitingSpell = KitingUtils::GetKitingSpells(2); // Returns spell
      ID for Hunter's kiting ability
    language: cpp
  - title: Validate kiting spell existence before usage
    code: "uint8 playerClass = 7; // Mage\nint kitingSpellId = KitingUtils::GetKitingSpells(playerClass);\n\
      if (kitingSpellId > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with using the kiting spell\n    //\
      \ Example: Spell::CastSpell(player, kitingSpellId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ invalid or missing kiting spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal class-to-spell mappings defined within
    the TrinityCore codebase. It is intended for use in AI logic, spell selection
    systems, and game mechanics that require dynamic determination of kiting abilities
    based on player class. The implementation may cache results for performance optimization.
  warnings: Ensure that the input parameter 'playerClass' is validated before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior or incorrect spell lookups. Invalid class
    IDs could lead to unexpected return values or crashes depending on how the internal
    mapping is implemented.
