  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: GetNextQuestLocation
  signature: int DynamicQuestSystem::GetNextQuestLocation(Player * bot, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the next quest location for a player in the dynamic quest system.
  description: The GetNextQuestLocation method determines and returns the identifier
    of the next quest location that a player should visit within the dynamic quest
    system. This method is typically used by AI-controlled bots or automated quest
    progression systems to guide players toward upcoming quest objectives. It evaluates
    the current state of the player's quest log, available quests in the dynamic system,
    and ensures that the returned location corresponds to a valid quest destination.
    The method assumes that the player has already been initialized with relevant
    quest data and that the dynamic quest system is active.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or player whose
      next quest location is being retrieved.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the current quest for which the next location
      is being determined.
  returns: An integer value representing the identifier of the next quest location.
    A return value of -1 typically indicates an error or no valid next location was
    found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume player is initialized\nuint32 currentQuestId\
      \ = 12345;\nint nextLocation = DynamicQuestSystem::GetNextQuestLocation(bot,\
      \ currentQuestId);\nif (nextLocation != -1) {\n    // Proceed to the next quest\
      \ location\n    printf(\"Next quest location: %d\\n\", nextLocation);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // No valid next location found\n    printf(\"No next quest location\
      \ available.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking of the dynamic quest system
    and assumes that all relevant quest data is loaded and synchronized for the given
    player. It should only be called when the dynamic quest system is active and properly
    initialized.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring the player's quest log is up-to-date
    or the dynamic quest system is enabled may result in incorrect behavior or errors.
    Always validate that the player object is valid before calling.
