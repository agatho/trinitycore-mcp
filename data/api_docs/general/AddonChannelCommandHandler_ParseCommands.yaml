  class: AddonChannelCommandHandler
  method: ParseCommands
  signature: bool AddonChannelCommandHandler::ParseCommands(int str)
documentation:
  brief: Parses incoming addon channel commands and processes them accordingly.
  description: The ParseCommands method within the AddonChannelCommandHandler class
    is responsible for interpreting and executing commands received through the addon
    channel. This method typically handles communication between client-side addons
    and the server, parsing command strings and routing them to appropriate handlers.
    It ensures that addon-related messages are properly validated and processed according
    to game mechanics and security protocols. The method may be invoked when an addon
    sends a command to the server, such as configuration changes or gameplay-related
    requests.
  parameters:
  - name: str
    description: An integer parameter representing the command string or identifier
      to be parsed. This value is typically used to determine which specific command
      should be executed within the addon channel system.
  returns: Returns true if the command was successfully parsed and processed, false
    otherwise. A return value of false may indicate an invalid command, malformed
    input, or processing failure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Command Parsing
    code: "bool result = handler.ParseCommands(12345);\nif (result)\n{\n    // Command\
      \ processed successfully\n    printf(\"Command executed\\n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n\
      \    // Failed to process command\n    printf(\"Failed to execute command\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the addon communication system in TrinityCore and
    should only be called when a valid addon channel message is received. It's important
    to ensure that all commands are properly validated before processing to prevent
    security vulnerabilities.
  warnings: Improper handling of command parameters can lead to unexpected behavior
    or security issues. Always validate inputs and ensure proper error handling within
    this method to avoid crashes or unauthorized access.
