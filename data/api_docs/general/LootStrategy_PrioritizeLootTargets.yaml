documentation:
  brief: Prioritizes loot targets for a bot AI based on strategic criteria.
  description: 'The PrioritizeLootTargets method evaluates and ranks potential loot
    targets for a bot AI, determining the optimal order in which items should be looted.
    This method is crucial for efficient resource management in automated gameplay
    scenarios. It considers factors such as item value, rarity, and relevance to the
    bot''s current needs or objectives. The method returns an integer representing
    the prioritized target index or a special value indicating no valid targets. Precondition:
    The AI must be initialized with valid target data. Postcondition: The loot target
    list is reordered according to strategic priority.'
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance managing the bot's behavior and decision-making
      process.
  - name: targets
    description: Reference to an integer representing the number of potential loot
      targets available for prioritization.
  returns: Returns an integer indicating the index of the highest-priority loot target.
    A negative value may indicate no valid targets or an error condition.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: int priority = strategy.PrioritizeLootTargets(botAI, 5);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using result in loot decision logic
    code: "int targetIndex = strategy.PrioritizeLootTargets(ai, numTargets);\nif (targetIndex\
      \ >= 0) {\n    // Proceed with looting the prioritized target\n    ai->LootItem(targetIndex);\n\
      } else {\n    // No valid targets found\n    ai->Log(\"No suitable loot targets.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the loot processing phase of bot AI
    execution. It may interact with internal loot tables and item valuation systems
    to determine optimal priorities. The method assumes that target data has been
    properly populated in the AI instance before invocation.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI instance passed to this method is fully initialized
    with valid target information; otherwise, results may be unpredictable or erroneous.
    The method does not validate input parameters beyond basic type checking.
