documentation:
  brief: Visualizes the creature's AI boundary with optional duration, owner, and
    fill settings.
  description: The VisualizeBoundary method is used to render a visual representation
    of the creature's AI boundary in the game world. This functionality is typically
    employed for debugging or development purposes to understand how the AI perceives
    its environment and movement constraints. The method allows specifying a visualization
    duration, an optional owner reference, and whether the boundary should be filled.
    It returns an integer identifier that can be used to track or manage the visual
    effect instance. The implementation likely interacts with the game's rendering
    system to display boundary markers such as circles or polygons around the creature.
  parameters:
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the visualization should remain
      visible. A value of 0 typically means the visualization persists indefinitely
      until manually cleared.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the owner identifier of the boundary
      visualization. This can be used to associate the visualization with a specific
      entity or context. If null, no owner is assigned.
  - name: fill
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the boundary should be visually filled
      (true) or outlined only (false). This affects how the boundary is rendered in
      the game world.
  returns: Returns an integer identifier for the created visualization effect. This
    ID can be used later to modify or remove the visualization. A negative value may
    indicate an error during creation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Boundary Visualization
    code: "int visualId = creatureAI->VisualizeBoundary(5000, nullptr, false); //\
      \ Show outline for 5 seconds\nif (visualId >= 0) {\n    // Successfully created\
      \ visualization with ID: visualId\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Filled Boundary with Owner Reference
    code: "int ownerId = 12345;\nint visualId = creatureAI->VisualizeBoundary(3000,\
      \ &ownerId, true); // Show filled boundary for 3 seconds\nif (visualId >= 0)\
      \ {\n    // Visualization created with owner ID 12345 and filled style\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for debugging and development environments.
    In production builds, this functionality may be disabled or have no effect. The
    visualization uses the game's internal rendering system and may not be visible
    in all client configurations. Performance impact is minimal when used sparingly.
  warnings: Do not call this method excessively in performance-critical code paths
    as it may cause unnecessary overhead. Ensure that the owner pointer is valid if
    provided, otherwise undefined behavior might occur. The returned ID must be stored
    and managed properly to avoid visual artifacts or memory leaks.
