  class: BotMemoryManager
  method: AnalyzeAllocationPatterns
  signature: void BotMemoryManager::AnalyzeAllocationPatterns()
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes memory allocation patterns used by bot instances to optimize resource
    usage and identify potential memory leaks.
  description: The AnalyzeAllocationPatterns method performs a comprehensive review
    of memory allocation activities within the BotMemoryManager. It examines how bots
    allocate and manage memory resources, identifying trends in usage patterns, detecting
    anomalies such as memory leaks or excessive allocations, and providing insights
    into overall memory efficiency. This method is typically invoked during bot lifecycle
    management or system maintenance to ensure optimal performance and prevent resource
    exhaustion. The analysis may involve tracking allocation sizes, frequencies, and
    lifetimes of allocated memory blocks across all active bot instances.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotMemoryManager* memoryManager = BotMemoryManager::Instance();

      memoryManager->AnalyzeAllocationPatterns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called periodically during system operation to maintain
    awareness of memory usage patterns. It may have performance implications during
    execution as it analyzes all active allocations. The analysis results are typically
    logged or stored for later review by system administrators.
  warnings: Invoking this method while bots are actively processing may temporarily
    impact performance due to the overhead of memory scanning and pattern analysis.
    Ensure sufficient system resources are available when running this analysis on
    large bot populations.
