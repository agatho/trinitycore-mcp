  class: GuildBankRightsAndSlots
  method: GuildBankRightsAndSlots
  signature: void GuildBankRightsAndSlots::GuildBankRightsAndSlots(uint8 _tabId, int8
    _rights, int32 _slots)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes guild bank tab rights and slot configurations with specified
    parameters.
  description: The GuildBankRightsAndSlots constructor initializes a new instance
    of the GuildBankRightsAndSlots class, setting up the tab ID, access rights, and
    number of slots for a specific guild bank tab. This method is used internally
    by TrinityCore to manage permissions and storage capacity for different tabs within
    the guild bank system. The tab ID identifies which tab this configuration applies
    to, the rights parameter defines what actions members can perform on that tab
    (such as deposit, withdraw, or modify items), and the slots parameter determines
    how many item slots are available in that tab.
  parameters:
  - name: _tabId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild bank tab (0-6). Valid values range
      from 0 to 6 representing the different tabs in a guild bank, where 0 is typically
      the first tab and 6 is the last.
  - name: _rights
    description: Access rights for the guild bank tab. Values typically represent
      permission levels such as 0 (no access), 1 (view only), 2 (deposit/withdraw),
      or higher values for administrative privileges depending on TrinityCore implementation.
  - name: _slots
    description: Number of item slots available in the guild bank tab. Must be a non-negative
      integer; negative values may cause undefined behavior or errors in the system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize Guild Bank Tab Rights and Slots
    code: 'GuildBankRightsAndSlots tabConfig(0, 2, 90);

      // Sets tab ID 0 with deposit/withdraw rights (2) and 90 slots'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configure Multiple Guild Bank Tabs
    code: "GuildBankRightsAndSlots tabs[7];\nfor (int i = 0; i < 7; ++i)\n{\n    tabs[i]\
      \ = GuildBankRightsAndSlots(i, i % 3, 45 + i * 10);\n}\n// Initializes all 7\
      \ tabs with varying rights and slot counts"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal guild bank management system in TrinityCore.
    It's typically called during server initialization or when loading existing guild
    bank configurations from the database. The class likely stores these values in
    member variables for later retrieval and application to actual guild bank operations.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values may lead to unexpected behavior in guild bank
    functionality. Ensure that _tabId is within valid range (0-6), _rights are appropriate
    permission levels, and _slots are non-negative integers. Improper usage could
    result in broken guild bank access or storage issues.
