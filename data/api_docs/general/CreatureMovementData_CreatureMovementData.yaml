documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the CreatureMovementData class with default
    values.
  description: The CreatureMovementData constructor initializes all internal data
    members to their default states. This method sets up the basic structure required
    for storing and managing movement-related data for creatures within the TrinityCore
    framework. It ensures that all member variables are properly initialized before
    any movement operations are performed on the creature. The initialization includes
    setting default values for movement flags, speed parameters, and other related
    attributes necessary for proper creature behavior in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic instantiation of CreatureMovementData
    code: 'CreatureMovementData movementData;

      // movementData is now initialized with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called automatically when creating a new CreatureMovementData
    object. Developers should not need to explicitly invoke this constructor unless
    performing manual object creation. The initialization process ensures that all
    movement data is in a valid state from the beginning, preventing undefined behavior
    during creature AI operations.
