  method: SwitchToOptimalAspect
  signature: void MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::SwitchToOptimalAspect()
documentation:
  brief: Switches the marksmanship hunter to the most optimal aspect based on current
    combat state and available aspects.
  description: The SwitchToOptimalAspect method determines and applies the best available
    aspect for a marksmanship hunter in the current combat situation. This method
    evaluates factors such as enemy threat level, player health, mana availability,
    and the hunter's current set of unlocked aspects to select the most beneficial
    one. It is typically used during combat to dynamically adjust the hunter's buff
    configuration for maximum effectiveness. The method does not require any parameters
    and modifies the hunter's active aspect state directly.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void MyCombatAI::Update()\n{\n    if (m_hunter->IsInCombat())\n    {\n\
      \        m_hunter->SwitchToOptimalAspect();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the hunter is in a valid combat state.
    It may internally check for aspect availability and player conditions before applying
    changes. The selection logic might vary depending on the specific implementation
    of the MarksmanshipHunterRefactored class.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of combat or in inappropriate states may result
    in unexpected behavior or invalid aspect application. Ensure that the hunter has
    sufficient resources (mana, etc.) to support aspect switching if required by the
    internal logic.
