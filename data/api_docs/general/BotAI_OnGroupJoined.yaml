  class: BotAI
  method: OnGroupJoined
  signature: void BotAI::OnGroupJoined(int * group)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a bot joins a group in the World of Warcraft instance
  description: The OnGroupJoined method is invoked when a bot character successfully
    joins a player group. This method is part of the BotAI class and is responsible
    for initializing or updating the bot's behavior within the context of the group.
    It typically sets up internal state, registers the bot with group-related systems,
    and may trigger additional AI logic to adapt the bot's actions based on group
    composition or objectives. The method ensures that the bot integrates properly
    into the group dynamics and can respond appropriately to group commands or events.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the group identifier. This value
      is used internally by TrinityCore to track group membership and may be used
      to access group data structures.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot AI initialization
    code: "void BotAI::OnGroupJoined(int* group)\n{\n    if (!group)\n        return;\n\
      \n    // Initialize bot's group-specific behavior\n    m_groupId = *group;\n\
      \    // Additional setup logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the TrinityCore framework when a bot joins
    a group, and should not be invoked manually unless implementing custom group joining
    logic. The parameter 'group' points to an identifier that may be used to query
    group information from the server's internal data structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer is valid before dereferencing it. Improper
    handling of this parameter can lead to segmentation faults or undefined behavior
    in the AI system.
