  class: Player
  method: SetLootSpecId
  signature: void Player::SetLootSpecId(uint32 id)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the loot specialisation ID for the player.
  description: This method assigns a specific loot specialisation ID to the player,
    which determines the loot distribution rules and preferences for the player's
    character. The loot spec ID is used in conjunction with the player's class and
    specialization to determine what loot items are eligible for the player to receive
    during loot distribution. This method is typically used in conjunction with the
    SetLootSpecId() method to ensure proper loot distribution mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The loot specialisation ID to assign to the player. This ID corresponds
      to a specific specialization and class combination, and determines the loot
      distribution rules for the player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetLootSpecId(1);

      // Assigns loot spec ID 1 to the player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other loot-related methods
    and should be called during appropriate game events or when the player's specialization
    changes. It does not directly affect the player's inventory, but rather influences
    how loot is distributed to the player.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player's specialisation has
    changed, as changing the loot spec ID without proper context can cause incorrect
    loot distribution rules. Care must be taken to ensure that the ID corresponds
    to a valid specialisation.
