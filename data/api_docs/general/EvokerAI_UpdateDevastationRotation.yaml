  class: EvokerAI
  method: UpdateDevastationRotation
  signature: void EvokerAI::UpdateDevastationRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the evoker's devastation rotation logic based on current target and
    spell availability.
  description: The UpdateDevastationRotation method manages the core combat behavior
    for an Evoker AI character during the devastation phase of their rotation. This
    method evaluates the current target state, available spells, and cooldowns to
    determine the optimal sequence of abilities to cast. It typically handles spell
    selection, targeting logic, and ensures proper resource management during high-damage
    output phases. The method is called regularly during combat to maintain an effective
    rotation strategy.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target's current health or status value that influences
      rotation decisions. Used to determine if the target is at a vulnerable state
      for devastation spells.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateDevastationRotation(int* target)\n{\n    if (!me->IsInCombat()\
      \ || !target)\n        return;\n\n    // Logic to determine and execute devastation\
      \ rotation\n    DoDevastationSpellSelection(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Update Cycle
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        int targetHealth = GetTargetHealth();\n        UpdateDevastationRotation(&targetHealth);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently during combat to maintain optimal
    rotation performance. The target parameter is expected to reflect current combat
    state and may be updated by other AI components.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    dereferencing a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. This method assumes
    proper initialization of spell cooldowns and resource tracking.
