  class: PositionUtils
  method: GetMaxRange
  signature: float PositionUtils::GetMaxRange(Player * bot, Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the maximum attack range of a bot player against a target unit.
  description: The GetMaxRange method determines the furthest distance at which a
    bot player can effectively engage a target unit, taking into account the bot's
    current weapon range, spell range capabilities, and any applicable combat mechanics.
    This value is typically used by AI systems to decide when to approach or maintain
    distance from enemies. The calculation considers both melee and ranged attack
    capabilities of the bot, including any buffs, debuffs, or special abilities that
    might affect reach. The method returns a float representing the maximum range
    in yards.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the maximum effective range in yards at which
    the bot can engage the target unit. Returns 0.0f if either parameter is invalid
    or if no valid range can be determined.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized\nUnit* target = ...; //\
      \ Assume target is initialized\nfloat maxRange = PositionUtils::GetMaxRange(bot,\
      \ target);\nif (maxRange > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Bot can engage target at this range\n\
      \    printf(\"Max range: %.2f yards\\n\", maxRange);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: AI Decision Making Example
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nUnit* target = ...;\nfloat maxRange = PositionUtils::GetMaxRange(bot,\
      \ target);\nfloat currentDistance = bot->GetDistance(target);\nif (currentDistance\
      \ > maxRange)\n{\n    // Move closer to target\n    bot->GetMotionMaster()->MoveChase(target);\n\
      }\nelse if (currentDistance < maxRange * 0.5f)\n{\n    // Move away from target\n\
      \    bot->GetMotionMaster()->MoveBackward(target, maxRange * 0.5f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in AI decision-making logic for bots to determine
    optimal positioning during combat. The range calculation may vary depending on
    the bot's equipped weapons, spell casting capabilities, and any temporary modifiers
    such as movement speed or reach buffs. This function does not account for terrain
    or line-of-sight obstructions; it only calculates based on raw distance metrics.
  warnings: Ensure that both Player and Unit pointers are valid before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior. The returned range value may be zero if the
    bot has no valid attack capability against the target, which could indicate a
    misconfiguration or invalid target state.
