  class: HunterAI
  method: GetCurrentAspect
  signature: int HunterAI::GetCurrentAspect()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the identifier of the currently active aspect spell for the hunter
    AI.
  description: The GetCurrentAspect method retrieves the spell ID of the aspect currently
    applied to the hunter's pet. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    hunters can apply various aspects such as Aspect of the Hawk, Aspect of the Monkey,
    etc., which modify their pet's behavior and stats. This method allows the AI to
    determine which aspect is currently active, enabling conditional logic based on
    the aspect in use. The return value corresponds to the SpellEntry ID of the aspect
    spell, or 0 if no aspect is active. This functionality is crucial for AI decision-making
    processes that depend on the current pet state and applied buffs.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the spell ID of the currently active aspect. Returns
    0 if no aspect is active. Common aspect spell IDs include 13165 (Aspect of the
    Hawk), 13161 (Aspect of the Monkey), and 13159 (Aspect of the Pack).
  examples:
  - title: Check Current Aspect Before Casting
    code: "if (hunterAI->GetCurrentAspect() != 13165) {\n    // Cast Aspect of the\
      \ Hawk if not already active\n    hunterAI->CastSpell(13165);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Aspect-Based Pet Behavior Logic
    code: "int currentAspect = hunterAI->GetCurrentAspect();\nswitch (currentAspect)\
      \ {\n    case 13165: // Aspect of the Hawk\n        // Modify pet attack logic\
      \ for increased accuracy\n        break;\n    case 13161: // Aspect of the Monkey\n\
      \        // Modify pet movement and evasion behavior\n        break;\n    default:\n\
      \        // Default pet behavior when no aspect is active\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the AI's internal tracking of the pet's active aspects.
    The implementation assumes that aspects are properly applied and tracked through
    the spell system. Developers should ensure that the hunter AI has proper access
    to pet state information for accurate results.
  warnings: The method may return 0 if no aspect is actively applied, which could
    be confused with an error condition. Always validate the return value against
    known aspect spell IDs rather than assuming 0 means failure. Additionally, aspects
    might not be immediately reflected in the AI's state during spell casting or transition
    periods.
