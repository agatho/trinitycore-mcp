    npcGUID, bool autoLaunched, bool displayPopup)
documentation:
  brief: Sends quest details to the player's client for display in the quest giver
    interface.
  description: The SendQuestGiverQuestDetails method is responsible for transmitting
    quest information from the server to the player's client, enabling the display
    of detailed quest data within the quest giver window. This includes quest title,
    description, objectives, rewards, and other relevant metadata. The method handles
    formatting and serialization of quest data into a protocol-compatible message
    that the client can render. It is typically invoked when a player interacts with
    a quest giver NPC to view quest details, or when the quest state changes and updates
    need to be sent to the client. This method does not directly modify any quest
    state on the server; it only facilitates communication of existing quest data
    to the client.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object containing the details to be sent to
      the player's client. Must not be null.
  - name: npcGUID
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the NPC quest giver. Used
      to associate the quest with the correct NPC in the client interface.
  - name: autoLaunched
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the quest should be automatically
      launched or displayed as a standard quest detail window. True typically triggers
      automatic quest acceptance or initiation.
  - name: displayPopup
    description: Boolean flag that controls whether a popup notification should be
      shown to the player when the quest details are sent. If true, a visual popup
      may appear in the client interface.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PlayerMenu* menu = player->GetPlayerMenu();

      Quest const* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);

      menu->SendQuestGiverQuestDetails(quest, npcGUID, false, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Auto-Launch with Popup
    code: 'PlayerMenu* menu = player->GetPlayerMenu();

      Quest const* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12346);

      menu->SendQuestGiverQuestDetails(quest, npcGUID, true, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the client's quest detail UI rendering capabilities.
    The quest object passed must be valid and fully initialized with all required
    data fields. Performance considerations include serialization overhead for large
    quest descriptions or reward lists. This method is typically called from within
    NPC interaction handlers or quest state update logic.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the quest parameter will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the quest object is valid and loaded before
    calling this method. The npcGUID must correspond to an actual NPC in the world;
    otherwise, client-side UI may display incorrectly or fail to render properly.
