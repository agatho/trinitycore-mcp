  class: PvPCombatAI
  method: CalculateThreatScore
  signature: float PvPCombatAI::CalculateThreatScore(int * player, int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the threat score for a player-target pair in PvP combat.
  description: The CalculateThreatScore method computes a numerical threat value that
    represents how much aggro a player generates against a specific target during
    PvP encounters. This value is used internally by the AI system to determine targeting
    priority and threat management. The method takes two integer pointers representing
    player and target identifiers, and returns a float indicating the calculated threat
    level. It's typically invoked during combat calculations when evaluating which
    opponent to prioritize for attacks or when determining threat distribution among
    multiple targets.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer identifier representing the player generating
      threat
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer identifier representing the target receiving
      threat
  returns: A float value representing the calculated threat score. Higher values indicate
    greater threat generation, with typical ranges varying based on combat mechanics
    and player attributes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Score Calculation
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      int targetId = 67890;

      float threatScore = ai->CalculateThreatScore(&playerId, &targetId);

      printf("Threat Score: %.2f\n", threatScore);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PvP combat AI system and relies on internal player
    and target state data. The actual calculation logic likely considers factors such
    as player level, damage dealt, spell type, weapon damage, and other PvP-specific
    mechanics. The method should only be called during active combat scenarios where
    both player and target are valid entities.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and target pointers point to valid identifiers
    before calling this method, as invalid or null pointers may lead to undefined
    behavior. This method is not thread-safe and should only be used from within the
    main game thread or appropriate AI execution context.
