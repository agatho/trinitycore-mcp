  class: AuraApplication
  method: SetRemoveMode
  signature: void AuraApplication::SetRemoveMode(AuraRemoveMode mode)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the removal mode for an aura application, determining how and when the
    aura will be removed from a unit.
  description: The SetRemoveMode method configures the removal behavior of an AuraApplication
    by specifying the AuraRemoveMode. This determines the context in which the aura
    is removed, such as due to expiration, cancellation, or specific game events.
    The removal mode affects how the aura's removal is processed and reported to subscribers.
    This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework when managing
    aura lifecycles, but can also be invoked directly to alter removal behavior during
    aura application logic. Setting an invalid removal mode may lead to unexpected
    behavior in aura handling.
  parameters:
  - name: mode
    description: The AuraRemoveMode enum value specifying how the aura should be removed.
      Valid values include AURA_REMOVE_BY_DEFAULT, AURA_REMOVE_BY_CANCEL, AURA_REMOVE_BY_EXPIRE,
      AURA_REMOVE_BY_DISPEL, AURA_REMOVE_BY_AURA_BREAK, and others defined in the
      AuraRemoveMode enumeration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Removal Mode to Expire
    code: "AuraApplication* app = unit->GetAura(12345);\nif (app)\n{\n    app->SetRemoveMode(AURA_REMOVE_BY_EXPIRE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Removal Mode Based on Condition
    code: "AuraApplication* app = unit->GetAura(67890);\nif (app)\n{\n    if (someCondition)\n\
      \        app->SetRemoveMode(AURA_REMOVE_BY_DISPEL);\n    else\n        app->SetRemoveMode(AURA_REMOVE_BY_CANCEL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the AuraApplication.
    It should be called before the aura is actually removed to ensure proper handling.
    The removal mode affects callbacks and event notifications related to aura removal,
    so changing it mid-lifecycle may cause inconsistencies in event processing.
  warnings: Modifying the removal mode after an aura has already begun its removal
    process can lead to undefined behavior or inconsistent aura state. Always verify
    that the aura is still active before calling this method.
