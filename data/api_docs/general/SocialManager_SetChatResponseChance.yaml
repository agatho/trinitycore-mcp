  class: SocialManager
  method: SetChatResponseChance
  signature: void SocialManager::SetChatResponseChance(uint32 percent)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the percentage chance for a creature or NPC to respond to player chat
    messages.
  description: The SetChatResponseChance method configures the probability that an
    NPC or creature will reply to a player's chat message. This setting is typically
    used in AI behavior scripting to control how often non-player characters engage
    in dialogue with players. The chance is expressed as a percentage value, where
    0% means no response and 100% means always respond. This method affects the social
    interaction behavior of NPCs within the game world and can be used to fine-tune
    NPC responsiveness for different scenarios such as quest givers, vendors, or general
    dialogue participants.
  parameters:
  - name: percent
    description: The percentage chance (0-100) that an NPC will respond to player
      chat messages. A value of 0 disables responses entirely, while 100 ensures a
      response every time.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set NPC to Always Respond
    code: SocialManager->SetChatResponseChance(100);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable NPC Chat Responses
    code: SocialManager->SetChatResponseChance(0);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal AI state variables that control NPC
    social behavior. Changes take effect immediately for subsequent chat interactions
    and may persist across server sessions depending on implementation details.
  warnings: Setting very high percentages (e.g., 90-100) might lead to spammy or disruptive
    NPC behavior in crowded areas. Ensure appropriate values are used based on game
    balance requirements.
