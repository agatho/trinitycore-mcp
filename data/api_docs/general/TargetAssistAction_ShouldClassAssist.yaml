documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot should assist a target based on class-specific
    rules.
  description: The ShouldClassAssist method evaluates if a bot player should provide
    assistance to a target unit according to predefined class-based logic. This method
    is typically used in AI behavior systems where different classes have distinct
    rules for when they should engage or support targets. The evaluation considers
    factors such as the bot's current class, target type, and game context to determine
    appropriate assistance behavior. It serves as a core decision-making function
    within the target assist action system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot should assist the target based on class rules;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (action->ShouldClassAssist(bot)) {\n    // Perform class-specific assistance\
      \ logic\n    bot->CastSpell(target, SPELL_ASSISTANCE, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's AI system and relies on internal
    class configuration data. It should be called within appropriate game context
    where target and bot states are valid.
