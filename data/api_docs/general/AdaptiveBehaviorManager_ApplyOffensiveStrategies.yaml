  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::ApplyOffensiveStrategies(const CombatMetrics
    & metrics)
documentation:
  brief: Applies offensive AI strategies based on combat metrics to optimize enemy
    engagement.
  description: The ApplyOffensiveStrategies method evaluates the provided CombatMetrics
    data to determine and execute appropriate offensive behaviors for an AI-controlled
    unit. This includes selecting optimal attack patterns, timing of abilities, and
    targeting priority based on real-time combat conditions such as health percentages,
    threat levels, and enemy positioning. The method integrates with the adaptive
    behavior system to dynamically adjust tactics during combat encounters. It is
    typically invoked during combat update cycles when new metrics are available for
    analysis.
  parameters:
  - name: metrics
    description: A const reference to CombatMetrics containing current combat data
      including health, threat, positioning, and enemy status information used to
      determine offensive strategy execution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat update loop
    code: "void AIUpdate()\n{\n    CombatMetrics metrics = GetCombatMetrics();\n \
      \   adaptiveBehaviorManager.ApplyOffensiveStrategies(metrics);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom AI behavior system
    code: "class CustomAI : public UnitAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override\n    {\n        if (me->IsInCombat())\n        {\n            CombatMetrics\
      \ metrics = GetCombatMetrics();\n            adaptiveBehaviorManager.ApplyOffensiveStrategies(metrics);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the CombatMetrics object contains valid and up-to-date
    information. The implementation may involve multiple internal strategy evaluations
    and ability selections, which could have performance implications during high-frequency
    combat updates.
  warnings: Ensure that CombatMetrics data is properly initialized before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior. This method modifies AI state directly
    and should not be called concurrently from multiple threads without proper synchronization.
