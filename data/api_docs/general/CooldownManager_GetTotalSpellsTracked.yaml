  class: CooldownManager
  method: GetTotalSpellsTracked
  signature: uint32 CooldownManager::GetTotalSpellsTracked() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of spells currently tracked in the cooldown manager.
  description: The GetTotalSpellsTracked method provides a count of all spells that
    are currently being managed by the cooldown system. This includes spells that
    have active cooldowns, as well as any spells that may be registered for tracking
    even if they are not yet on cooldown. The method is typically used for debugging,
    performance monitoring, or to determine the current load of the cooldown manager.
    It does not modify any internal state and is safe to call at any time during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of spells currently tracked
    by the CooldownManager instance. This count includes all spells in cooldown or
    registered for tracking, regardless of their current cooldown status.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 trackedSpells = player->GetCooldownManager()->GetTotalSpellsTracked();

      TC_LOG_INFO("misc", "Player has {} spells currently tracked in cooldown manager.",
      trackedSpells);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Example
    code: "CooldownManager* cm = player->GetCooldownManager();\nuint32 totalTracked\
      \ = cm->GetTotalSpellsTracked();\nif (totalTracked > 1000)\n{\n    TC_LOG_WARN(\"\
      misc\", \"High cooldown tracking count detected: {}\", totalTracked);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple count operation on an internal data structure.
    It is generally fast but may involve locking if the cooldown manager uses thread-safe
    operations internally. The returned value reflects only spells actively tracked
    by this specific CooldownManager instance.
