  class: BotSpawner
  method: CreateBotSession
  signature: bool BotSpawner::CreateBotSession(uint32 accountId, int characterGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new bot session for the specified account and character.
  description: The CreateBotSession method initializes a new bot session within the
    TrinityCore framework, associating it with a given account ID and character GUID.
    This method is typically used in conjunction with bot management systems to establish
    connections between virtual player characters and their controlling scripts or
    AI logic. The method performs necessary setup operations such as initializing
    session data structures, validating account and character existence, and preparing
    the environment for bot interaction. It ensures that the bot can properly communicate
    with the game server and execute commands within the context of the specified
    character.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: The unique identifier of the account to which the bot session will
      be associated. Must correspond to an existing account in the database.
  - name: characterGuid
    description: The global unique identifier of the character that the bot will control.
      A value of -1 indicates no specific character, allowing for dynamic selection
      or creation of a character.
  returns: Returns true if the bot session was successfully created and initialized;
    otherwise returns false if the operation failed due to invalid parameters, account/character
    not found, or system resource limitations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Session Creation
    code: "BotSpawner spawner;\nbool success = spawner.CreateBotSession(12345, 67890);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Bot session created successfully\n    printf(\"Bot session\
      \ initialized for account 12345 and character 67890\\n\");\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Handle failure case\n    printf(\"Failed to create bot session\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Session with Default Character
    code: "BotSpawner spawner;\n// Using -1 for characterGuid to indicate automatic\
      \ character selection\nbool success = spawner.CreateBotSession(12345, -1);\n\
      if (success) {\n    printf(\"Bot session initialized for account 12345 with\
      \ default character\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the underlying TrinityCore database is properly
    configured and accessible. The method may perform database queries to validate
    account and character existence, so performance could be affected by database
    load. It's recommended to call this method from a thread-safe context when dealing
    with concurrent bot operations.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid account IDs or non-existent character
    GUIDs will result in a failed session creation. Ensure that all parameters are
    validated before calling the method. Avoid calling this method repeatedly in tight
    loops as it may cause database contention issues.
