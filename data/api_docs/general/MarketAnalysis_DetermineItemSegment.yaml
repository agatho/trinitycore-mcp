  signature: MarketSegment MarketAnalysis::DetermineItemSegment(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the market segment category for a given item ID based on its properties
    and value.
  description: The DetermineItemSegment method analyzes the provided item ID to classify
    it into a predefined market segment category. This classification is typically
    used for in-game economic modeling, pricing strategies, or market analysis systems
    within TrinityCore. The method evaluates various attributes of the item such as
    its quality, type, level, and potential value to assign it to a specific segment.
    It's commonly utilized by auction house systems, vendor pricing algorithms, or
    player economy tools to categorize items for statistical reporting or automated
    pricing decisions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a MarketSegment enum value indicating the determined market category
    for the item. Possible values may include SEGMENT_COMMON, SEGMENT_UNCOMMON, SEGMENT_RARE,
    SEGMENT_EPIC, SEGMENT_LEGENDARY, or other custom segments defined by the server
    configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "MarketSegment segment = marketAnalysis.DetermineItemSegment(12345);\nif\
      \ (segment == SEGMENT_EPIC) {\n    // Handle epic item pricing\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"This is an epic item\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Auction House
    code: "void ProcessAuctionItem(uint32 itemId) {\n    MarketSegment segment = marketAnalysis.DetermineItemSegment(itemId);\n\
      \    switch (segment) {\n        case SEGMENT_COMMON:\n            // Apply\
      \ common item pricing rules\n            break;\n        case SEGMENT_EPIC:\n\
      \            // Apply epic item premium pricing\n            break;\n      \
      \  default:\n            // Handle unknown segments\n            break;\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal lookups in item databases or caches
    to determine segment classifications. It may be computationally intensive if called
    frequently without caching. The exact segmentation logic is determined by server
    configuration and may vary between different TrinityCore builds or custom modifications.
  warnings: The method assumes valid item IDs are passed; invalid or non-existent
    item IDs might return unexpected segment values or cause undefined behavior. Ensure
    proper validation of item IDs before calling this method in performance-critical
    code paths.
