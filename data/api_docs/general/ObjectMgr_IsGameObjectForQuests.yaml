documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a game object entry is associated with any quest in the
    database.
  description: The IsGameObjectForQuests method checks if a specified game object
    entry is linked to any quest within the TrinityCore database. This functionality
    is essential for determining which game objects are relevant to quest systems,
    such as quest objectives or quest-giving items. The method typically queries internal
    data structures that map game object entries to quest requirements or rewards.
    It's commonly used during quest validation, quest tracking, and dynamic quest
    system operations. The check ensures that only game objects that actually participate
    in quest mechanics are considered when evaluating player progress or quest availability.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified game object entry is associated with at least
    one quest in the database; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a game object is quest-related
    code: "if (sObjectMgr->IsGameObjectForQuests(176345)) {\n    // This game object\
      \ is used in quests\n    sLog->outString(\"Game object 176345 is quest-related\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // This game object is not used in any quests\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Game object 176345 is not quest-related\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a lookup in internal quest-related data structures.
    It may cache results for performance, especially since game objects are frequently
    checked during quest operations. The method assumes that all quest-related game
    object entries have been properly loaded into the database and indexed by the
    ObjectMgr.
