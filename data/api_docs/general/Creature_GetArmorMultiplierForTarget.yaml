documentation:
  brief: Calculates the armor multiplier for a target based on creature's armor statistics
  description: This method computes the armor multiplier that a creature uses when
    targeting a specific player or creature. It takes into account the creature's
    armor value and applies appropriate calculations to determine how much armor affects
    the target's damage reduction. The method is typically used in combat calculations
    where armor values influence attack effectiveness. This function is part of the
    core game mechanics for determining damage mitigation in World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target creature or player that the armor multiplier
      is calculated for. This parameter represents the entity being targeted by the
      creature.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the armor multiplier, which determines
    how much armor affects damage reduction when attacking the target. Values typically
    range from 0.0 to 1.0, where higher values indicate greater armor influence on
    damage calculation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "float multiplier = creature->GetArmorMultiplierForTarget(&target);\nif\
      \ (multiplier > 0.0f) {\n    // Use the multiplier in combat calculations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during combat calculations and requires proper
    target validation before execution. The implementation may involve complex armor
    calculations based on creature's level and target's level difference.
  warnings: The method may return zero or negative values if the target is invalid
    or if armor calculations result in no damage reduction. Ensure proper target validation
    before calling this method.
