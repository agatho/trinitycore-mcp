  class: AuraEventBus
  method: PublishEvent
  signature: bool AuraEventBus::PublishEvent(const AuraEvent & event)
documentation:
  brief: Publishes an aura event to all registered listeners in the event bus.
  description: The PublishEvent method dispatches a given AuraEvent to all subscribers
    currently registered with the AuraEventBus. This mechanism allows various subsystems
    within TrinityCore to react to aura-related occurrences such as application, removal,
    or modification of auras on units. The method returns true if the event was successfully
    published to at least one listener, and false otherwise. It is typically used
    internally by the aura system to notify components when an aura's state changes.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The AuraEvent object containing details about the aura event that
      occurred. This includes information such as the aura's ID, caster, target, and
      the type of event (e.g., apply, remove, update).
  returns: True if the event was successfully published to one or more listeners;
    false if no listeners were registered or if the publication failed for any reason.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of PublishEvent
    code: "AuraEvent auraEvent;\nauraEvent.Type = AuraEventType::AURA_APPLIED;\nauraEvent.Caster\
      \ = casterGuid;\nauraEvent.Target = targetGuid;\nauraEvent.SpellId = spellId;\n\
      \nbool success = auraEventBus.PublishEvent(auraEvent);\nif (success)\n{\n  \
      \  // Event was published successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a publish-subscribe pattern used internally by TrinityCore's
    aura system. It is designed to be efficient and thread-safe where possible, though
    care should be taken when using it from different threads. The event bus may not
    immediately process events depending on its internal implementation.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or malformed AuraEvent might lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes if listeners do not properly validate incoming
    data. Ensure all required fields in the event are initialized before publishing.
