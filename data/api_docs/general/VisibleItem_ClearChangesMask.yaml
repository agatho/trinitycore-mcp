  class: VisibleItem
  method: ClearChangesMask
  signature: void VisibleItem::ClearChangesMask()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the visible item, resetting its modification state.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask of a VisibleItem
    object, effectively marking the item as no longer having any pending modifications.
    This is typically used in the context of packet serialization and network updates,
    where the server tracks which fields of an item have changed since the last update
    to the client. By clearing the mask, the system ensures that subsequent updates
    will not include unnecessary data for this item. The method does not modify the
    actual item data itself, only the tracking mechanism used for synchronization.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing Changes Mask After Sending Update
    code: "VisibleItem* visibleItem = player->GetVisibleItem(slot);\nif (visibleItem)\n\
      {\n    // Perform some operations that may modify the item\n    visibleItem->SetEntry(12345);\n\
      \    \n    // Send update packet to client\n    player->SendUpdateToPlayer();\n\
      \    \n    // Clear the changes mask after sending the update\n    visibleItem->ClearChangesMask();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called after an item's state has been synchronized
    with the client. It's important to ensure that all relevant changes are applied
    before calling this method, as clearing the mask will discard any pending updates
    that haven't yet been sent.
