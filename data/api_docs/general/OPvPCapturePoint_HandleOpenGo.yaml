  class: OPvPCapturePoint
  method: HandleOpenGo
  signature: int OPvPCapturePoint::HandleOpenGo(Player * player, GameObject * go)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the opening of a game object during an OPvP capture point event,
    returning a status code indicating success or failure.
  description: The HandleOpenGo method is responsible for managing the interaction
    when a player attempts to open a GameObject associated with an OPvP (Open Player
    versus Player) capture point. This typically occurs when a player interacts with
    a door, chest, or other interactive object that is part of the capture point mechanics.
    The method validates the player's eligibility and the game state before proceeding
    with the opening logic. It returns an integer status code indicating whether the
    operation was successful or if an error occurred. This method plays a crucial
    role in OPvP gameplay by controlling access to objectives and ensuring proper
    state transitions during capture events.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object that is attempting to open the GameObject.
      Must be a valid player instance with proper permissions and in a valid game
      state.
  - name: go
    description: Pointer to the GameObject that is being opened. This should be a
      valid GameObject associated with the OPvP capture point, such as a door or interactive
      object.
  returns: 'Returns an integer status code: 0 for success, negative values for various
    error conditions (such as invalid player, invalid game object, or insufficient
    permissions). Positive non-zero values may indicate specific success states or
    special conditions related to the capture point logic.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in OPvP event handling
    code: "void MyOPvPCapturePoint::OnPlayerEnter(Player* player)\n{\n    GameObject*\
      \ go = GetGameObject();\n    if (go)\n    {\n        int result = HandleOpenGo(player,\
      \ go);\n        if (result == 0)\n        {\n            // Successfully opened\
      \ the object\n            SendObjectiveComplete(player);\n        }\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling different return codes for game logic
    code: "int OPvPCapturePoint::HandleOpenGo(Player* player, GameObject* go)\n{\n\
      \    if (!player || !go)\n        return -1; // Invalid parameters\n    \n \
      \   if (player->GetTeam() != GetTeam())\n        return -2; // Wrong team\n\
      \    \n    // Perform the actual opening logic\n    go->SetGoState(GO_STATE_ACTIVE);\n\
      \    \n    // Return success code\n    return 0;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the broader OPvP capture point
    system and should only be invoked when a player interacts with a valid GameObject
    in the context of an active capture point. The implementation may vary between
    different OPvP types, so developers should check specific subclass implementations.
    Consider thread safety implications if this method is called from multiple threads
    simultaneously.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and GameObject parameters are valid before calling
    this method to avoid crashes or undefined behavior. This method might be called
    during critical game state transitions, so improper handling could lead to inconsistent
    capture point states or exploit opportunities.
