  class: CombatEventBus
  method: SetBatchSize
  signature: void CombatEventBus::SetBatchSize(uint32 size)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the batch size for combat event processing in the CombatEventBus.
  description: The SetBatchSize method configures the maximum number of combat events
    that can be processed together in a single batch within the CombatEventBus. This
    parameter affects how frequently and how many events are handled during each processing
    cycle, which can influence performance and responsiveness of combat-related systems.
    The batch size determines the efficiency of event handling and can be adjusted
    based on server load and performance requirements. This method does not return
    any value and directly modifies the internal state of the CombatEventBus instance.
  parameters:
  - name: size
    description: The maximum number of combat events to process in a single batch.
      Valid values are positive integers representing event count. Higher values may
      improve throughput but could increase latency.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Batch Size to 100 Events
    code: 'CombatEventBus* bus = CombatEventBus::Instance();

      bus->SetBatchSize(100);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Batch Size Based on Server Load
    code: "CombatEventBus* bus = CombatEventBus::Instance();\nif (serverLoad > HIGH_LOAD_THRESHOLD)\n\
      {\n    bus->SetBatchSize(50);\n}\nelse\n{\n    bus->SetBatchSize(200);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal processing behavior of CombatEventBus.
    It's recommended to set this value before combat events begin occurring to avoid
    inconsistent batch handling. The optimal batch size depends on server performance,
    number of concurrent players, and combat complexity.
  warnings: Changing the batch size during active combat processing may lead to inconsistent
    event handling or dropped events. Avoid frequent changes to this setting in production
    environments without thorough testing.
