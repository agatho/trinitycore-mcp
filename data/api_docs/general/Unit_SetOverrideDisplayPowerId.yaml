  method: SetOverrideDisplayPowerId
  signature: void Unit::SetOverrideDisplayPowerId(uint32 powerDisplayId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the override display power ID for a unit, which affects how power bars
    are displayed in the game.
  description: This method allows developers to override the default display power
    ID for a Unit object, changing how power bars appear visually on the unit. The
    override display power ID determines which power bar type is shown when displaying
    the unit's power, such as mana, rage, focus, or energy. This functionality is
    particularly useful for customizing visual effects or implementing special abilities
    that require different power display types. The method affects the unit's visual
    representation in-game and can be used to modify how power bars are displayed
    during specific events or animations.
  parameters:
  - name: powerDisplayId
    description: The display ID that overrides the default power display type. This
      value determines which power bar type is shown for the unit, such as mana (ID
      0), rage (ID 1), focus (ID 2), or energy (ID 3). Valid values are typically
      from 0 to 3, representing different power types.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetOverrideDisplayPowerId(2);

      // This sets the unit''s power display to focus (ID 2)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetOverrideDisplayPowerId(3);

      // This sets the unit''s power display to energy (ID 3)

      // Used for custom abilities that require energy bar display'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it affects visual representation
    of units in-game. The override display power ID is typically set during specific
    events or animations, and may not persist beyond the current context unless explicitly
    maintained. Implementation details include that this method modifies the unit's
    visual state rather than its actual power values.
  warnings: This method should only be used when necessary as it can affect game balance
    and visual representation of units. Improper use may lead to incorrect power bar
    display or visual inconsistencies in-game. Avoid setting this value without understanding
    the implications for power types and display mechanics.
