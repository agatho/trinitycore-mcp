documentation:
  brief: Returns the override radius for GameObject interaction.
  description: The GetInteractRadiusOverride method retrieves the custom interaction
    radius defined for a specific game object template. This value determines how
    close a player must be to interact with the object, overriding the default radius.
    The returned value is typically used in client-side interaction checks and can
    be set via database entries or through scripting. If no override is defined, the
    method may return a default value or zero, depending on implementation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 representing the interaction radius override in game units (typically
    in yards or pixels). Returns 0 if no override is set or if the object does not
    support override behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve interaction radius for a GameObject
    code: "GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(12345);\n\
      uint32 radius = goTemplate->GetInteractRadiusOverride();\nif (radius > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Use custom radius for interaction logic\n    printf(\"Custom interaction\
      \ radius: %u\\n\", radius);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Fall back to default behavior\n\
      \    printf(\"Using default interaction radius\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with player interaction systems
    and may affect how the client renders hover effects or enables interaction prompts.
    The value returned should be validated against expected ranges to prevent unexpected
    behavior during gameplay.
  warnings: Ensure that any override radius values are reasonable for gameplay balance;
    extremely large or small values can cause unintended user experience issues or
    break interaction mechanics.
