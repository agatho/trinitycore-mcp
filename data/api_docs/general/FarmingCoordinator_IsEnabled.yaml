  signature: bool FarmingCoordinator::IsEnabled(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the farming coordinator is enabled for the specified player
  description: The IsEnabled method determines whether the farming coordinator system
    is active or available for a given player. This functionality is typically used
    in World of Warcraft TrinityCore servers to control whether players can utilize
    farming-related mechanics, such as crop management, resource gathering, or other
    agricultural systems within the game world. The method takes a pointer to a player
    object and evaluates the internal state of the farming coordinator system for
    that specific player. It returns true if the system is enabled and operational,
    false otherwise. This check is essential for maintaining game balance and ensuring
    that farming features are only accessible when appropriate.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which the farming coordinator state
      is being checked. This parameter must not be null for valid results.
  returns: Returns true if the farming coordinator system is enabled for the specified
    player, false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that farming mechanics
    are currently active and accessible to the player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if farming is enabled
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player object is initialized\nif (farmingCoordinator.IsEnabled(&player))\
      \ {\n    // Farming features are enabled for this player\n    // Proceed with\
      \ farming operations\n} else {\n    // Farming features are disabled\n    //\
      \ Handle accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a game event handler
    code: "void OnPlayerLogin(Player* player) {\n    if (farmingCoordinator.IsEnabled(&player))\
      \ {\n        // Enable farming UI elements or notifications\n        player->SendNotification(\"\
      Farming system is now active.\");\n    } else {\n        // Disable farming\
      \ features or show message\n        player->SendNotification(\"Farming system\
      \ is currently disabled.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a simple state check against internal flags or
    configuration settings. It's important to note that the farming coordinator may
    have different states based on server configuration, player permissions, or game
    events. The parameter is passed by pointer and should be validated before use
    in production code.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null to avoid undefined behavior. This method might be called frequently during
    gameplay, so performance considerations should be taken into account if used in
    tight loops or high-frequency operations.
