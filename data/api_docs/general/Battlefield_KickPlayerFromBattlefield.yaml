  signature: void Battlefield::KickPlayerFromBattlefield(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from the battlefield by their GUID.
  description: The KickPlayerFromBattlefield method removes a specified player from
    the current battlefield instance using their unique identifier (GUID). This function
    is typically used to eject players who have violated battlefield rules, are inactive,
    or are being removed for administrative reasons. The method ensures that the player
    is properly removed from the battlefield's internal tracking systems and may trigger
    necessary cleanup operations such as updating player states, removing buffs, or
    redistributing resources. It is important to note that this action should only
    be performed when the battlefield is in a state where modifications can safely
    occur without disrupting ongoing gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to be removed from the
      battlefield. This value must correspond to an active player currently participating
      in the battlefield instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(12345);\n\
      if (bf)\n{\n    bf->KickPlayerFromBattlefield(54321);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid player
    currently in the battlefield. It does not perform any validation on whether the
    player is actually present, so calling this method with an invalid or non-existent
    GUID may result in undefined behavior or internal inconsistencies.
  warnings: Calling this method while the battlefield is actively processing events
    or during critical gameplay moments may cause synchronization issues or client-side
    desynchronization. Always ensure that the battlefield state allows for safe modifications
    before invoking this function.
