documentation:
  brief: Returns the filesystem path associated with the module reference.
  description: The GetModulePath method retrieves and returns the filesystem path
    that corresponds to the module referenced by this ModuleReference object. This
    path typically points to the directory or file location where the module is stored
    within the TrinityCore installation. The returned path is immutable and represents
    the canonical location of the module, which may be used for loading, configuration,
    or resource access purposes. This method does not perform any validation on the
    existence of the path, and it's the caller's responsibility to ensure that the
    path is valid before attempting to use it in file operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a boost::filesystem::path object representing the
    filesystem path associated with this module reference. The returned path is guaranteed
    to be valid and non-empty, though it may not necessarily correspond to an existing
    file or directory on the filesystem.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ModuleReference modRef("MyModule");

      const boost::filesystem::path& modulePath = modRef.GetModulePath();

      std::cout << "Module path: " << modulePath.string() << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Path in File Operations
    code: "ModuleReference modRef(\"DataModule\");\nconst boost::filesystem::path&\
      \ path = modRef.GetModulePath();\nif (boost::filesystem::exists(path)) {\n \
      \   std::cout << \"Module exists at: \" << path.string() << std::endl;\n} else\
      \ {\n    std::cerr << \"Module not found at: \" << path.string() << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned boost::filesystem::path object is a constant reference, meaning
    that modifications to the path through this method are not possible. The path
    may contain platform-specific separators and should be treated as an opaque handle
    to the module location. This method is typically used in conjunction with other
    module management APIs to locate and load resources.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned path directly in file operations without
    verifying its existence or accessibility, especially in multi-threaded environments
    where the filesystem state might change between the time the path is retrieved
    and when it's accessed. The path may be relative or absolute depending on how
    the ModuleReference was initialized.
