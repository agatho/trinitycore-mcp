  class: Battlefield
  method: HandlePlayerLeaveZone
  signature: void Battlefield::HandlePlayerLeaveZone(Player * player, int zone)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from a battlefield zone and handles associated cleanup operations.
  description: The HandlePlayerLeaveZone method is responsible for removing a player
    from a battlefield zone and performing necessary cleanup tasks. This includes
    updating internal battlefield state tracking, removing the player from active
    battlefield participants, and potentially triggering related events or notifications.
    The method ensures that when a player leaves a battlefield zone, their participation
    status is properly updated and any resources allocated to them within the battlefield
    context are released. It typically gets invoked when a player exits a battlefield
    area, either through natural movement or by leaving the game.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object that is leaving the battlefield zone.
      Must be a valid player instance; null pointers will cause undefined behavior.
  - name: zone
    description: Integer identifier representing the specific battlefield zone from
      which the player is leaving. This corresponds to a defined zone ID in the game's
      zone system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage when player leaves battlefield
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByZoneId(4132);\nif (bf)\n\
      {\n    bf->HandlePlayerLeaveZone(player, 4132);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the battlefield management
    system when a player's position changes. Developers should ensure that any custom
    battlefield logic properly handles player removal before calling this method to
    avoid inconsistent state.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid player pointer or incorrect zone ID
    may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate inputs before invoking
    this method.
