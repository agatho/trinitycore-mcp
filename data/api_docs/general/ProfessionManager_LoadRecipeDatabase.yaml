documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads the complete recipe database for all professions into
    memory
  description: The LoadRecipeDatabase method is responsible for initializing and loading
    the entire recipe database from the game's data sources into memory. This method
    typically executes during server startup or when the profession system needs to
    be refreshed, ensuring all crafting recipes are available for player use. It reads
    recipe data from database tables, processes the information, and populates internal
    data structures that store recipe details such as required skills, materials,
    and crafting outcomes. The method handles loading recipes for all professions
    including primary and secondary skills, and may also initialize any associated
    metadata or caching mechanisms needed for efficient recipe lookups during gameplay.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeProfessionSystem()\n{\n    sProfessionManager->LoadRecipeDatabase();\n\
      \    // Recipe database is now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called once during server initialization and should
    not be invoked repeatedly. The loading process may take several seconds depending
    on the number of recipes in the database. It's recommended to call this method
    before any player attempts to craft items to ensure all recipes are available.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate recipe entries. This method should only be called during
    initialization phases and not during active gameplay when players are crafting.
