  class: Unit
  method: GetVehicleKitWeakPtr
  signature: int Unit::GetVehicleKitWeakPtr() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the vehicle kit weak pointer identifier for the unit.
  description: This method retrieves the vehicle kit weak pointer associated with
    the unit, which represents a reference to a vehicle object in the game world.
    The returned value is typically used to identify and access vehicle-related data
    or functionality within the TrinityCore framework. This method is commonly used
    when dealing with vehicle mechanics and player interactions with vehicles in World
    of Warcraft. It provides a way to obtain vehicle-specific information without
    directly accessing the vehicle object itself.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer identifier representing the vehicle kit weak pointer,
    which can be used to access vehicle-related data or functionality. The value may
    represent a unique identifier or reference to a vehicle object in the game system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int vehicleKitId = unit->GetVehicleKitWeakPtr();\nif (vehicleKitId > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Use vehicleKitId to access vehicle data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the vehicle system implementation and should be used
    carefully when dealing with vehicle-related mechanics. The returned value may
    vary depending on whether the unit is currently in a vehicle or not.
  warnings: This method may return zero or negative values if the unit is not currently
    associated with a vehicle kit, which could lead to errors if not properly handled
    in code.
