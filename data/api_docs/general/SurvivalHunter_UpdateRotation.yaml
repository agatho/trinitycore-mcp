  class: SurvivalHunter
  method: UpdateRotation
  signature: void SurvivalHunter::UpdateRotation(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the survival hunter's rotation based on the current target and combat
    state.
  description: The UpdateRotation method is responsible for determining and executing
    the optimal sequence of abilities and actions for a survival hunter during combat.
    This method evaluates the hunter's current target, available resources such as
    focus or energy, and the tactical situation to decide which abilities should be
    used next in order to maximize damage output or survivability. It typically integrates
    with the AI system to make real-time decisions about when to use abilities like
    Aimed Shot, Steady Shot, or other survival-specific mechanics. The method is called
    regularly during combat to ensure that the hunter's behavior remains adaptive
    and effective against the current target.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the current combat target.
      This parameter defines the target against which the hunter will evaluate and
      execute rotation decisions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat loop
    code: "void MyHunterAI::Update()\n{\n    if (Unit* target = GetVictim())\n   \
      \ {\n        m_hunter->UpdateRotation(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom AI logic
    code: "void SurvivalHunter::UpdateRotation(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (!target ||\
      \ !target->IsAlive())\n        return;\n\n    // Evaluate current state and\
      \ update rotation\n    if (HasFocusForAbility(AimedShot))\n    {\n        CastSpell(AimedShot);\n\
      \    }\n    else if (HasFocusForAbility(SteadyShot))\n    {\n        CastSpell(SteadyShot);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the AI system during each update cycle.
    It assumes that the target is valid and alive before attempting to process any
    rotation logic. The implementation may vary between different versions of TrinityCore
    or custom modifications.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer passed into this method is valid and not
    null, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. This method should only be called
    during active combat situations where a valid target exists.
