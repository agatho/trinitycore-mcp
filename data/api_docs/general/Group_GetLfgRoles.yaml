documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the LFG (Looking for Group) roles assigned to a group member by
    their GUID.
  description: The GetLfgRoles method retrieves the LFG (Looking for Group) roles
    that have been assigned to a specific group member identified by their GUID. This
    method is used within the TrinityCore framework to determine what role (tank,
    healer, damage dealer) a player has selected or been assigned for group content
    such as dungeons, raids, or battlegrounds. The returned value represents a bitmask
    of roles that can be interpreted using LFG role constants defined in the codebase.
    This functionality supports the grouping and matchmaking systems used by the game's
    LFG tool.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing a bitmask of LFG roles assigned to the
    group member. Each bit in the integer corresponds to a specific role (e.g., tank,
    healer, damage dealer). The exact meaning of each bit depends on the LFG role
    constants defined in the TrinityCore codebase.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve LFG roles for a group member
    code: "uint32 playerGuid = 12345;\nint roles = group->GetLfgRoles(playerGuid);\n\
      if (roles & LFG_ROLE_TANK)\n{\n    // Player is assigned as tank\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid group member.
    The implementation likely relies on internal data structures that track role assignments
    within the group. The bitmask returned should be interpreted using LFG role constants
    defined in the TrinityCore codebase.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method is valid and refers to an actual
    group member, otherwise the behavior may be undefined or result in incorrect role
    information being retrieved.
