documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the game object addon data for a specified low GUID.
  description: The GetGameObjectAddon method fetches the addon data associated with
    a specific game object identified by its low GUID. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    game object addons are used to store additional metadata or configuration settings
    that extend the base functionality of game objects. This method returns a pointer
    to an array of integers representing the addon data, which typically includes
    information such as display ID, faction, and other custom properties. The returned
    pointer should be treated as read-only and must not be modified directly. If no
    addon data exists for the given GUID, the method may return a null pointer or
    a default empty array depending on implementation details.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an integer array containing the addon data for the specified
    game object. Returns nullptr if no addon data is found for the given low GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use addon data for a game object
    code: "int lowGuid = 12345;\nconst int* addonData = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectAddon(lowGuid);\n\
      if (addonData != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process addon data\n    printf(\"Display\
      \ ID: %d\\n\", addonData[0]);\n    printf(\"Faction: %d\\n\", addonData[1]);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal game object addon storage which is typically
    populated during server startup or when loading game object templates. The returned
    integer array structure may vary based on the specific implementation and version
    of TrinityCore. Be aware that modifying the returned data directly could lead
    to unexpected behavior or corruption in the game state.
  warnings: The returned pointer points to internal memory managed by ObjectMgr. Do
    not attempt to free or reallocate the memory pointed to by this return value.
    Accessing elements beyond the expected array bounds may cause memory access violations.
    This method should only be used when you are certain that addon data exists for
    the given GUID.
