  signature: bool InventoryManager::UseFood()
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to use a food item from the player's inventory, consuming it if
    available and valid.
  description: The UseFood method checks the player's inventory for a valid food item
    and attempts to consume it. It evaluates whether the player has sufficient mana
    or health to benefit from the food, and if so, consumes the item and applies its
    effects such as restoring health or mana. This method is typically called when
    a player interacts with a food item or when automatic consumption is triggered
    by game mechanics. The method returns true if the food was successfully used,
    false otherwise. Precondition includes having at least one valid food item in
    the inventory.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a food item was successfully found and consumed; returns
    false if no valid food item exists in the inventory or if consumption conditions
    are not met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of UseFood
    code: "if (player->GetInventory()->UseFood()) {\n    // Food was consumed successfully\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Player consumed a food item.\");\n} else {\n    // No\
      \ valid food found or could not be consumed\n    sLog->outString(\"No food available\
      \ to consume.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally checks for item validity, player state (such as hunger
    level), and cooldowns. It may also trigger visual or auditory effects related
    to food consumption in the game client.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying inventory contents may lead to unexpected
    behavior if no valid food items are present. Ensure proper checks are made before
    invoking to avoid unnecessary processing.
