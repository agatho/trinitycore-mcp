  method: GetTalentsByPosition
  signature: const int & DB2Manager::GetTalentsByPosition(uint32 class_, uint32 tier,
    uint32 column) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the talent ID located at the specified class, tier, and column
    position in the talents database.
  description: 'The GetTalentsByPosition method fetches the talent identifier (ID)
    from the talents DB2 file based on the provided class, tier, and column indices.
    This method is typically used to determine which talent is assigned to a specific
    slot in a player''s talent tree. The parameters define the position within the
    talent grid: class_ specifies the player class, tier represents the row (0-based),
    and column denotes the column index (0-based). The returned value corresponds
    to the talent ID that should be displayed or applied at that specific location.
    This method assumes valid input values and relies on internal DB2 data structures
    that are pre-loaded during server startup.'
  parameters:
  - name: class_
    description: The player class identifier (e.g., 1 for Warrior, 2 for Paladin).
      Must be a valid class ID present in the talents DB2 structure.
  - name: tier
    description: The talent tier (row) index, starting from 0. Represents the vertical
      position in the talent tree grid.
  - name: column
    description: The talent column index, starting from 0. Represents the horizontal
      position in the talent tree grid.
  returns: Returns a constant reference to an integer representing the talent ID at
    the specified class, tier, and column position. If no talent exists at that location,
    it may return 0 or a default value depending on DB2 data structure.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Talent ID for Warrior at Tier 2, Column 1
    code: uint32 warriorTalentId = DB2Manager::GetTalentsByPosition(1, 2, 1); // Class
      1 = Warrior, Tier 2, Column 1
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterate Through All Talent Positions for a Class
    code: "for (uint32 tier = 0; tier < MAX_TALENT_TIERS; ++tier)\n{\n    for (uint32\
      \ col = 0; col < MAX_TALENT_COLUMNS; ++col)\n    {\n        int talentId = DB2Manager::GetTalentsByPosition(3,\
      \ tier, col); // Class 3 = Mage\n        if (talentId > 0)\n        {\n    \
      \        // Process valid talent ID\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses pre-loaded DB2 data structures and is optimized for
    performance. It should not be called during high-frequency operations without
    caching results. The internal implementation likely uses a lookup table or hash
    map for fast access to talent data.
  warnings: Ensure that class_, tier, and column parameters are within valid ranges
    to avoid accessing invalid memory locations. Invalid indices may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect talent assignments.
