  signature: void CalendarMgr::SendCalendarClearPendingAction(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a calendar clear pending action message to the specified player.
  description: The SendCalendarClearPendingAction method is responsible for notifying
    a player's client that any pending calendar events or invitations should be cleared
    from their interface. This typically occurs when a player's calendar data needs
    to be reset or refreshed, such as after logging in or when certain calendar operations
    are completed. The method takes a GUID parameter which identifies the target player
    whose calendar pending actions will be cleared. It is part of the TrinityCore's
    calendar management system and ensures synchronization between server-side calendar
    state and client-side UI.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose calendar pending
      actions should be cleared. This value typically represents a player's account
      or character GUID.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clear pending calendar actions for a specific player
    code: 'uint32 playerGuid = 12345;

      CalendarMgr::SendCalendarClearPendingAction(playerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely sends a packet to the client that triggers UI updates
    on the calendar interface. It may be called internally by other calendar functions
    or manually during specific game state transitions.
