  signature: void FeralDruid::UpdateBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Updates all active buff states for the feral druid character.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing all
    active buffs that are currently applied to a Feral Druid character in the TrinityCore
    environment. This includes checking the validity of existing buffs, applying new
    buffs based on current game state or player actions, and removing expired or invalid
    buffs. The method ensures that the druid's buff status remains synchronized with
    the game mechanics, such as aura durations, stacking rules, and class-specific
    abilities. It typically gets invoked during character updates, combat events,
    or when specific buff conditions are met.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void CombatUpdate()\n{\n    // ... other combat logic ...\n    m_feralDruid->UpdateBuffs();\n\
      \    // ... continue with combat processing ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage After Ability Activation
    code: "void OnShredCast()\n{\n    // Apply the shred ability effect\n    m_feralDruid->ApplyBuff(SHRED_BUFF);\n\
      \    \n    // Update all buffs to reflect new state\n    m_feralDruid->UpdateBuffs();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core game loop or during
    specific event triggers. Developers should be aware that this method may trigger
    additional callbacks or updates to related systems such as stat recalculations,
    visual effects, or combat log entries.
  warnings: Improper invocation of UpdateBuffs outside of appropriate game state contexts
    can lead to inconsistent buff states or unexpected behavior in the druid's gameplay
    experience. Avoid calling this method during initialization or in scenarios where
    the character is not fully loaded.
