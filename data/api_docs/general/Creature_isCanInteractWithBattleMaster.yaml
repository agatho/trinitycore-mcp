documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can interact with a battle master creature.
  description: This method checks if a player is allowed to interact with a battle
    master creature, typically used for determining if a player can access battleground
    related services or quests. The method evaluates the player's current state and
    the creature's interaction conditions, including whether the player has the necessary
    quest requirements or is in a valid state to interact with the creature. It is
    commonly used in conjunction with other methods that handle player interaction
    with battle masters to ensure proper gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object that is attempting to interact with
      the creature. This parameter must be valid and cannot be null.
  - name: msg
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether to send a message to the player
      if interaction is not allowed. If true, the method will send an appropriate
      message to the player explaining why they cannot interact with the creature.
  returns: Returns true if the player can interact with the battle master creature,
    false otherwise. The method returns false when the player does not meet the requirements
    or conditions needed for interaction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (creature->isCanInteractWithBattleMaster(player, true))\n{\n    // Player\
      \ can interact with the battle master\n    // Proceed with interaction logic\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Player cannot interact with the battle master\n    // Handle\
      \ accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other methods that check
    player state, quest requirements, or battleground related conditions. It may be
    called during interaction events to validate whether a player can proceed with
    battle master interaction.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly without checking the player's
    current state and quest requirements. If used incorrectly, it can lead to players
    being unable to interact with battle masters even when they should be able to.
