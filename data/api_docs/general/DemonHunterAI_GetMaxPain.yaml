  class: DemonHunterAI
  method: GetMaxPain
  signature: int DemonHunterAI::GetMaxPain() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum pain value for the Demon Hunter AI.
  description: The GetMaxPain method retrieves the current maximum pain value associated
    with the Demon Hunter AI instance. This value typically represents the highest
    pain level that can be reached or the maximum pain threshold for the AI's pain
    mechanics. The method is const, indicating it does not modify any internal state
    of the AI. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, this could
    relate to pain-based abilities or mechanics specific to Demon Hunters, such as
    managing pain resources or determining pain-related behavior thresholds.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the maximum pain value. This value is typically
    used to determine pain thresholds, resource limits, or ability cooldowns related
    to Demon Hunter pain mechanics within the AI system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int maxPain = demonHunterAI.GetMaxPain();\nif (maxPain > 0) {\n    // Use\
      \ the maximum pain value for some logic\n    std::cout << \"Maximum Pain: \"\
      \ << maxPain << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the DemonHunterAI class and is designed to be a read-only
    accessor. It should not be called during AI state modifications as it's marked
    as const. The actual implementation details depend on how pain values are managed
    internally within the TrinityCore framework for Demon Hunter NPCs or players.
