api:
  class: Player
  method: SetSkillLineId
  signature: void Player::SetSkillLineId(uint32 pos, uint16 skillLineId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the skill line ID at the specified position in the player's skill list.
  description: The SetSkillLineId method allows developers to assign a specific skill
    line ID to a particular position within the player's skill list. This method is
    typically used when modifying or updating a player's skill progression, particularly
    in scenarios involving skill point allocation, skill learning, or custom skill
    system modifications. The skill line ID represents the unique identifier for a
    specific skill in the game's skill system, which can be used to track and manage
    player skill progress. This method directly affects the player's skill list structure
    and should be used carefully as it may influence gameplay mechanics related to
    skill acquisition and progression.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position in the skill list where the skill line ID will be set.
      This represents the index of the skill entry within the player's skill list
      array, typically ranging from 0 to 199 for standard skill slots.
  - name: skillLineId
    description: The unique skill line ID that will be assigned to the specified position.
      This ID corresponds to a specific skill in the game's skill system and is used
      to identify and track skill progression within the player's skill list.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a skill line ID at position 0
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetSkillLineId(0, 129); // Set the first skill slot to skill ID 129
      (Alchemy)

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used with caution as it directly modifies player skill
    data. It may affect gameplay mechanics related to skill acquisition and progression,
    especially if used in conjunction with other skill-related methods. The method
    is typically used in custom scripts or when modifying player skill systems for
    specific game modes.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect skill progression tracking,
    potentially causing issues with skill learning or skill point allocation. Care
    should be taken when setting skill line IDs to ensure they correspond to valid
    skill entries within the game's skill system.
