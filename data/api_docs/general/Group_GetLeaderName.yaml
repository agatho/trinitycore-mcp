  class: Group
  method: GetLeaderName
  signature: const char * Group::GetLeaderName() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the name of the group leader as a null-terminated character string.
  description: The GetLeaderName method retrieves the name of the player who currently
    holds the leadership position within the group. This method is commonly used in
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation to identify the group's
    leader for various game mechanics such as loot distribution, role assignments,
    and command execution. The returned pointer points to an internal string buffer
    managed by the Group object and should not be freed or modified by the caller.
    If the group has no leader (e.g., during initialization or after all members have
    left), this method may return a null pointer or empty string depending on implementation
    details.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const char pointer to the null-terminated name of the group leader. Returns
    nullptr if there is no leader assigned to the group.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Group Leader
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    const char* leaderName\
      \ = group->GetLeaderName();\n    if (leaderName && strlen(leaderName) > 0)\n\
      \    {\n        // Process the leader name\n        sLog->outString(\"Group\
      \ leader is: %s\", leaderName);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      No group leader found.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned character pointer points to an internal buffer which is valid
    only until the next call to a Group method that might modify the leader information.
    It is recommended to copy the string if it needs to persist beyond the current
    scope. This method does not perform any locking or thread safety checks, so access
    should be synchronized in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Do not attempt to free or modify the returned pointer as it points to
    internal memory managed by the Group object. Be cautious when using this method
    in scenarios where group membership might change rapidly, as the leader could
    be reassigned between calls.
