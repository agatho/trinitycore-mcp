  class: HealerPositioning
  method: ValidateHealerPosition
  signature: bool HealerPositioning::ValidateHealerPosition(const int & pos, const
    CombatPositionContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Validates if a healer's position is appropriate within combat context.
  description: The ValidateHealerPosition method checks whether a specified healer
    position is valid based on the current combat context. It evaluates factors such
    as distance from target, line of sight, and positioning requirements for effective
    healing. This method ensures that healers maintain optimal positions during combat
    encounters to maximize their effectiveness while adhering to game mechanics and
    restrictions. The validation considers both positional constraints and contextual
    factors like threat levels and enemy proximity.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position index or identifier to validate for healer positioning.
      This typically represents a specific location within the combat area that the
      healer might occupy.
  - name: context
    description: The combat context object containing current battlefield conditions,
      target information, and other relevant factors affecting healer positioning
      validity.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is valid for a healer under the
    given combat context; otherwise returns false. A valid position typically ensures
    proper line of sight to the target, appropriate distance for healing spells, and
    avoidance of dangerous enemy positions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Position Validation
    code: "bool isValid = healerPositioning.ValidateHealerPosition(3, combatContext);\n\
      if (isValid)\n{\n    // Proceed with healer positioning\n    printf(\"Valid\
      \ healer position\\n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Find alternative position\n   \
      \ printf(\"Invalid healer position\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Position Validation in Combat Loop
    code: "void UpdateHealerPosition()\n{\n    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_POSITIONS;\
      \ ++i)\n    {\n        if (healerPositioning.ValidateHealerPosition(i, currentCombatContext))\n\
      \        {\n            // Set healer to this valid position\n            SetHealerPosition(i);\n\
      \            break;\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs distance calculations and line-of-sight checks
    against the current combat environment. It may be called frequently during combat
    updates, so performance optimization is important. The method assumes that context
    contains up-to-date information about targets, threats, and battlefield conditions.
  warnings: Ensure that the position index passed is within valid bounds to prevent
    undefined behavior. The context parameter must be properly initialized before
    calling this method; otherwise results may be unpredictable or invalid.
