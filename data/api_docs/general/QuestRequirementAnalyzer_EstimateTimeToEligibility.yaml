  class: QuestRequirementAnalyzer
  method: EstimateTimeToEligibility
  signature: uint32 QuestRequirementAnalyzer::EstimateTimeToEligibility(uint32 questId,
    Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Estimates the time required for a bot player to become eligible for a specified
    quest based on current game state and requirements.
  description: The EstimateTimeToEligibility method calculates how long a bot player
    must wait before they can accept a given quest. This estimation takes into account
    various eligibility factors such as level requirements, quest completion status,
    faction standing, item inventory, and other prerequisite conditions. The returned
    value represents the estimated time in seconds until the player meets all necessary
    criteria to begin the quest. This method is primarily used by automated questing
    systems or AI bots to determine optimal timing for quest acquisition. It does
    not modify any game state but provides a predictive value based on current player
    data and quest requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest for which eligibility time is
      being estimated. Must be a valid quest ID present in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot player whose eligibility
      status is being evaluated. The player must be valid and in a connected state.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the estimated time in seconds until
    the player becomes eligible for the specified quest. A return value of 0 indicates
    that the player is already eligible or the quest requirements are fully met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check eligibility time
    code: "uint32 timeToEligibility = analyzer.EstimateTimeToEligibility(12345, botPlayer);\n\
      if (timeToEligibility == 0) {\n    // Player is already eligible\n    printf(\"\
      Player can start the quest immediately.\");\n} else {\n    // Wait for estimated\
      \ time before attempting to accept\n    printf(\"Estimated wait time: %u seconds\"\
      , timeToEligibility);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with automated questing logic
    code: "uint32 questId = 67890;\nPlayer* bot = GetBotPlayer();\nuint32 waitTime\
      \ = analyzer.EstimateTimeToEligibility(questId, bot);\nif (waitTime > 0) {\n\
      \    // Schedule a delayed action to accept the quest\n    scheduler.AddDelayedAction(waitTime,\
      \ [questId, bot]() {\n        bot->AddQuest(questId);\n    });\n} else {\n \
      \   // Accept immediately\n    bot->AddQuest(questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a comprehensive check of all quest requirements including
    level, faction, items, and previous quest completions. It may involve database
    lookups or complex calculations depending on the quest's complexity. The estimation
    is based on current player state and does not account for dynamic changes that
    might occur during the wait period.
  warnings: The returned time estimate may become invalid if external conditions change
    (e.g., player levels up, items are acquired, or faction standings shift). Always
    re-evaluate eligibility after waiting periods. This method should not be used
    in performance-critical sections due to potential database queries and complex
    logic evaluation.
