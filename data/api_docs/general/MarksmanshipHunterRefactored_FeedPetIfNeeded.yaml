documentation:
  brief: Feeds the hunter's pet if its hunger level requires it.
  description: The FeedPetIfNeeded method checks whether the hunter's current pet
    requires feeding based on its hunger state. If the pet's food level is below a
    certain threshold, this method will automatically feed the pet using an appropriate
    item from the hunter's inventory. This functionality ensures that pets remain
    healthy and functional during combat or exploration. The method typically integrates
    with the pet management system and may interact with the player's inventory to
    locate and consume food items.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MarksmanshipHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic\
      \ ...\n    m_hunter->FeedPetIfNeeded();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called during AI update cycles or when the hunter's
    pet state changes. It assumes that the hunter has a valid pet and sufficient food
    items in their inventory to feed the pet.
  warnings: Ensure that the hunter's pet exists and is not already at full hunger
    before calling this method, as unnecessary calls may waste resources or cause
    unexpected behavior.
