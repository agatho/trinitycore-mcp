documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the priority level assigned to a specified AI action within the
    bot's decision-making framework.
  description: The GetActionPriority method returns a numeric priority value associated
    with a given AI action name. This priority determines the order in which actions
    are considered during the bot's decision-making process. Higher priority actions
    are evaluated before lower priority ones. The method is typically used internally
    by the BotAI system to manage action selection and execution based on contextual
    relevance and strategic importance. It allows for dynamic adjustment of bot behavior
    by modifying action priorities without changing core logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the priority level of the specified
    action. Higher values indicate higher priority. A return value of 0 typically
    signifies either an invalid action name or that no explicit priority has been
    assigned to the action.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Priority for Attack Action
    code: "uint32 attackPriority = botAI->GetActionPriority(\"attack\");\nif (attackPriority\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Use attack priority for decision making\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"Attack action priority: \" << attackPriority << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using a lookup table or map structure that
    stores action names and their corresponding priority values. The implementation
    may be optimized for fast lookups, potentially using hash tables or similar data
    structures. The method should be thread-safe if used in multi-threaded contexts.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid action name may return 0, which could
    be interpreted as either a valid low-priority action or an error condition. Always
    validate the returned value before using it in critical decision-making logic.
