  class: BotCharacterDistribution
  method: IsLoaded
  signature: bool BotCharacterDistribution::IsLoaded() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot character distribution data has been successfully
    loaded into memory.
  description: The IsLoaded method determines if the BotCharacterDistribution class
    has completed its initialization process and has valid data loaded. This method
    is typically used to verify that the distribution configuration for bot characters
    is ready for use before attempting to access or modify bot behavior settings.
    The method returns true if the data has been successfully loaded, and false otherwise.
    This check is important in scenarios where bot character distributions are loaded
    asynchronously or from external sources such as database tables or configuration
    files.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot character distribution data has been successfully
    loaded and is ready for use; returns false if the data is not yet loaded or failed
    to load properly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (botDistribution.IsLoaded()) {\n    // Proceed with bot character distribution\
      \ operations\n    std::cout << \"Bot distribution data is ready\" << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle case where data hasn't loaded yet\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"Bot distribution data not loaded\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a simple boolean flag check internally, making
    it very fast to execute. It's recommended to call this method before performing
    any operations that depend on the distribution data being available.
