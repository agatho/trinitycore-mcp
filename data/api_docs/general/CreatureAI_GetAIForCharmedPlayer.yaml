  method: GetAIForCharmedPlayer
  signature: PlayerAI * CreatureAI::GetAIForCharmedPlayer(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the PlayerAI instance associated with a charmed player controlled
    by this CreatureAI.
  description: The GetAIForCharmedPlayer method is used to obtain the PlayerAI instance
    that manages the behavior of a player who has been charmed by the creature. This
    method allows the CreatureAI to access and control the AI state of the charmed
    player, which is essential for implementing complex AI behaviors such as shared
    control or coordinated actions between the creature and its charmed target. The
    method typically returns a valid PlayerAI pointer when a player is charmed, or
    nullptr if no player is currently charmed or if the AI system is not properly
    initialized.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the PlayerAI instance managing the charmed player, or nullptr
    if no player is charmed or if the operation fails.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check and control a charmed player
    code: "PlayerAI* charmedPlayerAI = creatureAI->GetAIForCharmedPlayer();\nif (charmedPlayerAI)\n\
      {\n    // Control the charmed player's actions\n    charmedPlayerAI->DoAction(1);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in AI implementations where creatures can charm
    players and then coordinate their actions. The returned PlayerAI instance may
    be null if no player is currently charmed, or if the creature's AI state does
    not support charmed player management.
  warnings: Ensure that the CreatureAI has a valid charmed player before calling this
    method to avoid dereferencing a null pointer. The method should only be called
    in contexts where the creature actually controls a charmed player.
