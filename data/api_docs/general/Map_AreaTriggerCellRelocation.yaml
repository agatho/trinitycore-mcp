documentation:
  brief: Updates the cell location of an area trigger on the map
  description: The AreaTriggerCellRelocation method is responsible for updating the
    cell position of an AreaTrigger object within the game world map. This method
    ensures that area triggers are properly placed and managed in the spatial grid
    system used by TrinityCore. It handles the relocation logic when an area trigger
    moves between different cells, maintaining proper tracking and notification systems
    for players entering or leaving the trigger's affected area. The method typically
    gets invoked when an area trigger's position changes significantly enough to require
    a cell update.
  parameters:
  - name: at
    description: Pointer to the AreaTrigger object that needs its cell position updated
  - name: new_cell
    description: The new cell identifier where the area trigger should be relocated
  returns: Returns true if the area trigger was successfully relocated to the new
    cell, false otherwise. The method may return false if the relocation fails due
    to invalid parameters or internal errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic AreaTrigger Cell Relocation
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = ...; // Get a valid area trigger\nint newCellId\
      \ = 12345; // New cell identifier\nbool success = map->AreaTriggerCellRelocation(trigger,\
      \ newCellId);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Area trigger successfully relocated\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Area trigger relocated to cell %d\", newCellId);\n}\n\
      else\n{\n    // Failed to relocate area trigger\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed\
      \ to relocate area trigger to cell %d\", newCellId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal map management system and should typically
    be called automatically by the core engine when area triggers move between cells.
    Developers should not normally need to call this method directly unless implementing
    custom area trigger behavior or debugging spatial grid issues.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid parameters may cause undefined behavior
    or memory corruption. The AreaTrigger pointer must be valid and the new_cell parameter
    should represent a legitimate cell in the current map's grid system.
