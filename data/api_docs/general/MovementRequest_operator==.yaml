  method: operator==
  signature: bool MovementRequest::operator==(const MovementRequest & other) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two MovementRequest objects for equality based on their internal
    state.
  description: The operator== method performs a deep comparison between this MovementRequest
    object and another MovementRequest object to determine if they are equivalent.
    It evaluates whether all relevant fields and properties of both objects match
    exactly, including any movement data, target positions, or associated identifiers.
    This comparison is typically used in container classes or when checking for duplicate
    movement requests within the TrinityCore framework. The method returns true if
    the objects are identical, false otherwise. This functionality is essential for
    maintaining consistency in movement handling systems where duplicate requests
    must be identified and potentially filtered out.
  parameters:
  - name: other
    description: The MovementRequest object to compare against this instance. Must
      be a valid MovementRequest object; passing an invalid or uninitialized object
      may lead to undefined behavior.
  returns: True if all fields and properties of both MovementRequest objects are equal,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic equality check between two MovementRequest objects
    code: 'MovementRequest request1;

      MovementRequest request2;

      bool isEqual = (request1 == request2); // Returns true if both objects have
      identical state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using operator== in a container to find duplicates
    code: 'std::vector<MovementRequest> requests;

      MovementRequest newRequest;

      bool found = std::find(requests.begin(), requests.end(), newRequest) != requests.end();
      // Checks if duplicate exists'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely compares internal fields such as movement type, destination
    coordinates, speed values, and associated unit identifiers. The implementation
    may be performance-sensitive in high-frequency movement scenarios, so it's recommended
    to avoid unnecessary comparisons when possible.
