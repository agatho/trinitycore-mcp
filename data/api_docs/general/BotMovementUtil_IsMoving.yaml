  signature: bool BotMovementUtil::IsMoving(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a bot is currently in motion
  description: The IsMoving method determines whether a specified bot character is
    currently executing a movement action. It evaluates the bot's current state and
    movement flags to return a boolean value indicating active movement. This method
    is commonly used in AI logic to prevent conflicting actions while a bot is moving,
    such as attempting to cast spells or interact with objects during locomotion.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot's unique identifier (GUID).
      This parameter must be a valid pointer to a bot instance within the TrinityCore
      environment.
  returns: Returns true if the bot is currently moving, false otherwise. The method
    will return false if the bot is not found or if the movement state cannot be determined.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a bot is moving
    code: "int botGuid = 12345;\nif (BotMovementUtil::IsMoving(&botGuid)) {\n    //\
      \ Bot is currently moving\n    printf(\"Bot is moving\\n\");\n} else {\n   \
      \ // Bot is not moving\n    printf(\"Bot is idle\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsMoving in AI decision making
    code: "int botGuid = GetBotGUID();\nif (!BotMovementUtil::IsMoving(&botGuid))\
      \ {\n    // Only allow actions if bot is not moving\n    CastSpellOnTarget(target);\n\
      \    InteractWithObject(object);\n} else {\n    // Bot is moving, delay actions\n\
      \    ScheduleNextAction(5000); // Retry in 5 seconds\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal bot movement state tracking and may not reflect
    real-time changes immediately due to game loop timing. The implementation uses
    TrinityCore's internal movement system flags to determine if a bot is actively
    moving.
  warnings: Ensure the bot parameter points to a valid bot instance; passing an invalid
    or null pointer may result in undefined behavior or crashes. This method should
    not be called from within movement update callbacks as it may cause recursion
    issues.
