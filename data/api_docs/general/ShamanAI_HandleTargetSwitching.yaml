  class: ShamanAI
  method: HandleTargetSwitching
  signature: bool ShamanAI::HandleTargetSwitching(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the shaman AI should switch to a new target based on threat
    and combat conditions.
  description: The HandleTargetSwitching method evaluates the current target of a
    shaman's AI behavior and decides if it should switch to a different target. This
    decision is typically made based on factors such as threat levels, target validity,
    and combat priorities. The method returns true if a target switch is required,
    false otherwise. It plays a crucial role in maintaining optimal combat performance
    for shaman units by ensuring they focus on the most threatening or appropriate
    enemy.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the current target's ID. The method
      modifies this value if a target switch is needed.
  returns: Returns true if the AI should switch targets, false otherwise. A return
    of true indicates that the current target is no longer optimal and a new one should
    be selected.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in shaman AI logic
    code: "int currentTarget = ai->GetTarget();\nif (shamanAI->HandleTargetSwitching(&currentTarget))\
      \ {\n    // Switch to new target\n    ai->SetTarget(currentTarget);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with threat management system
    code: "void ShamanAI::UpdateAI() {\n    int currentTarget = GetTarget();\n   \
      \ if (HandleTargetSwitching(&currentTarget)) {\n        // Update target to\
      \ highest threat\n        currentTarget = GetHighestThreatTarget();\n      \
      \  SetTarget(currentTarget);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI decision-making loop and should be called
    regularly during combat updates. It assumes that target validity checks have already
    been performed by other systems.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer passed to this method points to a valid
    integer, as dereferencing an invalid pointer will cause undefined behavior. This
    method does not perform any safety checks on the input parameter.
