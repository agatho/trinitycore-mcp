documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the minion is a pet imp.
  description: The IsPetImp method checks if the current minion instance represents
    a pet imp, which is a specific type of summoned creature in World of Warcraft.
    This method is typically used in AI and summon management logic to differentiate
    between various types of summoned pets. The check is performed based on internal
    flags or creature template data that identifies the minion as an imp. This functionality
    is particularly relevant for warlocks and their pet management systems within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the minion is a pet imp, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a minion is a pet imp
    code: "if (minion->IsPetImp())\n{\n    // Handle imp-specific logic\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Minion is a pet imp\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal creature type identification and should only
    be called on valid minion instances. The implementation likely checks against
    predefined creature entry IDs or flags associated with imp-type summons.
