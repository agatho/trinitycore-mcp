  brief: Adds a warband scene to the player's collection.
  description: The AddWarbandScene method is used to add a specific warband scene
    to a player's collection within the TrinityCore framework. This method likely
    updates internal tracking structures or database entries to reflect that the player
    has acquired or unlocked the specified warband scene. The functionality is typically
    associated with in-game achievements, progression systems, or cosmetic unlocks
    related to warbands. It is expected that this method may trigger UI updates or
    notifications to inform the player of the newly added scene.
  parameters:
  - name: warbandSceneId
    description: The unique identifier for the warband scene to be added. This ID
      corresponds to a specific scene in the game's data files and is used to determine
      which visual or gameplay element should be unlocked for the player.

      collectionMgr->AddWarbandScene(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system managing player collections
    and unlocks. It may interact with the database to persist the change, and could
    be called during quest completion, achievement unlocking, or other progression
    events.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided warbandSceneId is valid and corresponds to an
    existing scene in the game's data. Invalid IDs might lead to silent failures or
    unexpected behavior.
