    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the Euclidean distance from the current GatheringManager
    instance to a specified gathering node.
  description: The GetDistanceToNode method computes the straight-line distance between
    the position of the GatheringManager instance (typically representing a player
    or object) and the location of a provided GatheringNode. This calculation is essential
    for determining proximity during resource gathering activities in World of Warcraft,
    such as mining, herbalism, or skinning. The method performs a simple 3D Euclidean
    distance calculation using the coordinates of both entities. It assumes that both
    the manager's position and the node's position are valid and accessible. The result
    is returned as a floating-point value representing the distance in game units
    (typically yards).
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the Euclidean distance between the GatheringManager's
    current position and the specified gathering node's location, measured in game
    units.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "GatheringNode node;\n// Assume node is initialized with valid position\
      \ data\nfloat distance = gatheringManager.GetDistanceToNode(node);\nif (distance\
      \ <= 5.0f) {\n    // Player is close enough to gather resources from this node\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal position tracking of the GatheringManager
    instance and assumes that both positions are in the same map/instance space. Performance-wise,
    it's a lightweight operation involving basic arithmetic calculations.
