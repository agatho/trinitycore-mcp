  signature: void MailDraft::MailDraft(const std::string & subject, const std::string
    & body)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new mail draft with the specified subject and body for sending
    to players.
  description: The MailDraft constructor initializes a new mail draft object with
    a given subject and body. This is the first step in creating an email that can
    be sent to players within the World of Warcraft game using the TrinityCore server
    framework. The subject and body parameters define the content of the mail, which
    can later be customized with items, money, or other attachments before being dispatched.
    This constructor sets up the basic structure for a mail message without immediately
    sending it to any recipient.
  parameters:
  - name: subject
    description: The subject line of the mail message. Must be a valid string representing
      the title or header of the email.
  - name: body
    description: The main content body of the mail message. This is where the actual
      text of the email will appear to the recipient.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Mail Draft Creation
    code: MailDraft draft("Welcome to Our Server!", "Thank you for joining our community.
      We hope you enjoy your stay.");
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Mail Draft with Dynamic Content
    code: 'std::string subject = "Quest Reward: " + questName;

      std::string body = "Congratulations! You have completed the quest and received
      your reward."

      MailDraft draft(subject, body);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any validation on the input strings. It
    is recommended to ensure that subject and body are properly sanitized before creating
    a MailDraft object to prevent potential issues with special characters or injection
    attacks. The actual sending of mail occurs through other methods like SendMailTo()
    which must be called after constructing the draft.
