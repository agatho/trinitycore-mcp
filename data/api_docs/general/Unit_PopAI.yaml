documentation:
  brief: Pop AI from the unit's stack
  description: The PopAI method removes and returns the top AI object from the Unit's
    AI stack. This operation is typically used to manage the AI state of a unit, particularly
    in the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework where units may have
    multiple AI behaviors or states. The method ensures that the AI stack is properly
    managed during gameplay mechanics such as combat or movement. It returns true
    if an AI was successfully popped from the stack, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if an AI was successfully popped from the unit's AI stack,
    false if the stack was empty or no AI was present.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* unit = new Unit();\nbool result = unit->PopAI();\nif (result) {\n\
      \    // AI was successfully popped\n}\nelse {\n    // No AI was available to\
      \ pop\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with PushAI to manage the AI
    stack. Implementation details include checking for valid AI objects before popping
    and ensuring thread safety when multiple threads may access the same unit's AI
    stack.
  warnings: This method should not be called without proper initialization of the
    AI stack. Calling PopAI on an empty stack may result in undefined behavior or
    crash if not handled properly.
