documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the value of a specified integer configuration setting from the
    World object.
  description: The getIntConfig method is used to access various integer-based configuration
    values that control different aspects of the game world behavior. These configurations
    are typically loaded at startup and define parameters such as maximum player levels,
    instance limits, respawn times, and other system-wide settings. The method takes
    a WorldIntConfigs enumeration value as input which specifies which particular
    configuration setting to retrieve. This allows for dynamic access to core game
    settings without direct memory manipulation or hardcoded values throughout the
    codebase.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the current configuration setting specified
    by the index parameter. The actual meaning of this value depends on which WorldIntConfigs
    enum value was passed in, and may represent limits, timeouts, flags, or other
    numeric game parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve maximum player level
    code: uint32 maxLevel = sWorld->getIntConfig(WORLD_MAX_PLAYER_LEVEL);
    language: cpp
  - title: Get instance limit for characters
    code: uint32 instanceLimit = sWorld->getIntConfig(WORLD_INSTANCE_LIMIT);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. The configuration
    values are typically initialized once during server startup and remain constant
    throughout runtime unless modified through administrative commands or configuration
    files.
