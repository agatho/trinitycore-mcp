  brief: Updates combat state and handles combat-related calculations
  description: The CombatManager::Update method processes combat mechanics and updates
    the current combat state based on time passed. This method is responsible for
    managing combat-related calculations such as threat generation, damage dealt,
    and combatant behavior. It typically runs during each game tick to maintain accurate
    combat information and ensure proper gameplay mechanics. The method handles both
    player and NPC combatants, ensuring that all combat-related activities are properly
    updated.

  - title: Basic Combat Update Usage
    code: 'CombatManager combatManager;

      combatManager.Update(100);

      // Updates combat state with 100ms time passed'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during game tick processing. Implementation
    details include handling of threat generation, damage calculation, and combatant
    behavior updates. Performance considerations are important as this method may
    be called frequently during combat.
  warnings: The method should not be called directly by external code unless specifically
    needed. CombatManager::Update is usually handled internally by the game engine
    during tick processing.
