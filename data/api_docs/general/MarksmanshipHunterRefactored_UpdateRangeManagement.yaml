documentation:
  brief: Updates the range management logic for the marksmanship hunter's targeting
    and shot selection.
  description: The UpdateRangeManagement method is responsible for dynamically adjusting
    the marksmanship hunter's behavior based on the current target distance. This
    includes determining optimal shot types, managing ranged weapon usage, and ensuring
    proper targeting mechanics within the game's combat system. The method evaluates
    the distance to the current target and applies appropriate adjustments to maintain
    effective ranged combat performance. It typically integrates with the hunter's
    AI state machine to ensure that ranged attacks are used efficiently according
    to the target's proximity.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MarksmanshipHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI\
      \ logic ...\n    m_hunter->UpdateRangeManagement();\n    // ... rest of AI logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and may influence
    shot selection, target prioritization, and weapon usage. It's important to understand
    that range management affects combat effectiveness and should be invoked regularly
    to maintain optimal performance.
