  class: AuctionHouse
  method: FilterAuctionResults
  signature: int AuctionHouse::FilterAuctionResults(const int & auctions, const AuctionSearchQuery
    & query)
documentation:
  brief: Filters auction house results based on a search query and returns the number
    of matching auctions.
  description: The FilterAuctionResults method processes a list of auctions and applies
    filtering logic according to the provided search query parameters. It evaluates
    each auction against criteria such as item type, quality, level range, and other
    filters defined in the AuctionSearchQuery structure. The method is typically used
    by the auction house UI or backend systems to narrow down the set of displayed
    auctions for a player's search. This filtering operation may involve database
    queries or in-memory processing depending on the implementation details. The method
    modifies internal state related to the filtered results and returns the count
    of matching auctions.
  parameters:
  - name: auctions
    description: Reference to an integer representing the total number of auctions
      to be filtered. This value is typically used as a loop counter or size indicator
      for processing auction entries.
  - name: query
    description: Reference to an AuctionSearchQuery object containing filter criteria
      such as item class, subclass, quality, level range, and other search parameters
      that define which auctions should be included in the results.
  returns: An integer representing the number of auctions that matched the specified
    search query. Returns zero if no matches are found or if an error occurs during
    filtering.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Auction Filtering
    code: "AuctionSearchQuery query;\nquery.itemClass = ITEM_CLASS_WEAPON;\nquery.minLevel\
      \ = 10;\nquery.maxLevel = 50;\nint filteredCount = auctionHouse.FilterAuctionResults(totalAuctions,\
      \ query);\nif (filteredCount > 0)\n{\n    // Process filtered auctions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Filtering by Item Quality
    code: 'AuctionSearchQuery query;

      query.quality = ITEM_QUALITY_RARE;

      int count = auctionHouse.FilterAuctionResults(totalAuctions, query);

      // Displays only rare quality items in the auction house

      std::cout << "Found " << count << " rare items" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal auction data structures and may
    perform database lookups or memory-based filtering depending on system configuration.
    It's important to ensure that the AuctionSearchQuery object is properly initialized
    before calling this method. The method assumes valid input parameters and may
    not handle invalid inputs gracefully.
  warnings: Calling this method with an uninitialized AuctionSearchQuery can lead
    to undefined behavior. Ensure all fields in the query are set appropriately before
    passing it to this function. Also, be aware that filtering large numbers of auctions
    might impact performance if not optimized.
