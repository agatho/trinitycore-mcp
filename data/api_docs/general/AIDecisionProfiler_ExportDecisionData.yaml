documentation:
  brief: Exports AI decision data to a specified file for analysis and debugging purposes.
  description: The ExportDecisionData method serializes collected AI decision-making
    information from the AIDecisionProfiler instance into a structured file format.
    This functionality is primarily used for post-mortem analysis of NPC behavior,
    performance profiling, and debugging complex AI decision trees. The exported data
    typically includes timing information, decision points, evaluated conditions,
    and outcome statistics. The method does not require any special preconditions
    but assumes that profiling data has been collected previously through active AI
    decision-making processes within the game world.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      // ... AI profiling data collected ...

      profiler.ExportDecisionData("ai_decisions.json");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server shutdown or at specific debugging
    checkpoints. The exported file format may vary depending on implementation but
    commonly uses JSON for human-readable output. Performance impact is minimal as
    the operation is usually asynchronous or batched.
