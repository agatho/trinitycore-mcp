  class: BotActionQueue
  method: Push
  signature: void BotActionQueue::Push(BotAction && action)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a new bot action to the end of the action queue for processing.
  description: The Push method enqueues a BotAction object into the BotActionQueue,
    making it available for execution by the bot's AI system. This method is typically
    used when a bot needs to schedule a new action to be performed at a later time.
    The action is moved into the queue using move semantics, which avoids unnecessary
    copying of the action object. The queue maintains actions in the order they were
    pushed, with the first action being processed first (FIFO - First In, First Out).
    This method does not block or delay execution; it simply adds the action to an
    internal data structure for later processing.
  parameters:
  - name: action
    description: An rvalue reference to a BotAction object that will be moved into
      the queue. The action represents a single unit of work that the bot should perform,
      such as moving to a location, attacking a target, or interacting with an object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotAction moveAction;

      moveAction.type = BotActionType::MOVE_TO_POSITION;

      moveAction.position = {100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f};


      // Push the action to the queue

      botActionQueue.Push(std::move(moveAction));'
    language: cpp
  - title: Pushing Multiple Actions
    code: 'BotAction attackAction;

      attackAction.type = BotActionType::ATTACK_TARGET;

      attackAction.targetGuid = PlayerGUID;


      BotAction lootAction;

      lootAction.type = BotActionType::LOOT_OBJECT;

      lootAction.objectGuid = GameObjectGUID;


      // Push multiple actions in sequence

      botActionQueue.Push(std::move(attackAction));

      botActionQueue.Push(std::move(lootAction));'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses move semantics for efficiency, so the original BotAction
    object should not be used after calling Push. The queue is designed to be thread-safe
    for single-producer, single-consumer scenarios where one thread pushes actions
    and another processes them. Performance-wise, this operation is O(1) as it simply
    appends to the end of an internal container.
  warnings: Calling Push with a moved-from BotAction object will result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the action object is not used after being moved into the
    queue. In multi-threaded contexts, ensure proper synchronization if multiple threads
    are pushing actions simultaneously.
