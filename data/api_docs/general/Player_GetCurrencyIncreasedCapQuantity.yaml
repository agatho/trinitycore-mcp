documentation:
  brief: Returns the increased cap quantity for a specific currency.
  description: This method retrieves the maximum quantity that a player can have for
    a given currency type, taking into account any bonuses or modifiers that may increase
    the cap. It is commonly used in conjunction with currency management systems to
    determine how much of a particular currency a player can hold at any given time.
    The method typically returns a value that reflects the current maximum cap for
    the currency, which may be influenced by player level, achievements, or other
    game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the increased cap quantity for the specified currency ID, representing
    the maximum amount of that currency a player can possess. The value is typically
    a uint32 that corresponds to the currency's maximum cap, which may be modified
    by various in-game factors such as level, achievements, or bonuses.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: uint32 currencyCap = player->GetCurrencyIncreasedCapQuantity(1234); // Get
      the increased cap for currency ID 1234
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often used in conjunction with other currency-related methods
    to manage player currency inventory. It may be affected by various game mechanics
    such as level-based bonuses, achievement rewards, or other modifiers that increase
    the cap.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method, as it may return values that
    are not directly related to the player's current currency holdings but rather
    reflect a modified maximum cap based on game mechanics. Incorrect usage can lead
    to misinterpretation of currency limits.
