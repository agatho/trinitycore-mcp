  class: BotLifecycleManager
  method: StopAll
  signature: void BotLifecycleManager::StopAll(bool immediate)
documentation:
  brief: Stops all active bot instances managed by the BotLifecycleManager, with optional
    immediate termination.
  description: The StopAll method terminates all currently running bot instances within
    the BotLifecycleManager. It provides an option to either perform a graceful shutdown
    or an immediate stop of all bots. When called with 'immediate' set to true, it
    forcefully terminates all bots without allowing them to complete their current
    operations. If set to false, it attempts to shut down bots in a controlled manner,
    potentially allowing for cleanup routines to execute. This method is typically
    used during server shutdown, configuration changes, or when resetting the bot
    system. The method does not return any value and operates on the global bot lifecycle
    manager instance.
  parameters:
  - name: immediate
    description: If true, forces immediate termination of all bots without graceful
      shutdown. If false, performs a controlled shutdown allowing bots to finish current
      operations before stopping.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage - Graceful Shutdown
    code: BotLifecycleManager::instance()->StopAll(false);
    language: cpp
  - title: Immediate Termination of All Bots
    code: BotLifecycleManager::instance()->StopAll(true);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects all bots managed by the singleton BotLifecycleManager
    instance. It should be called carefully during server operations to avoid unexpected
    behavior or data loss. The immediate parameter controls whether bots are terminated
    gracefully or forcefully, with immediate termination potentially causing incomplete
    actions or state corruption.
  warnings: Using immediate = true may result in bots being terminated mid-action,
    which could lead to inconsistent game state or resource leaks. Always prefer graceful
    shutdowns unless absolutely necessary. This method should not be called during
    critical operations that depend on bot behavior.
