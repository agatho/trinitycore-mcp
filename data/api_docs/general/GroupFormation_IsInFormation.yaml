  class: GroupFormation
  method: IsInFormation
  signature: bool GroupFormation::IsInFormation(uint32 memberGuid, float tolerance)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a group member is within the specified formation tolerance.
  description: The IsInFormation method determines whether a specified group member's
    current position is within an acceptable tolerance of their expected formation
    position. This method is typically used in group management systems to verify
    that players are maintaining proper positioning during group activities such as
    raids, dungeons, or PvP scenarios. The tolerance parameter defines how close the
    player must be to their designated formation spot to be considered 'in formation'.
  parameters:
  - name: memberGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group member to check. This should
      correspond to a valid player in the current group.
  - name: tolerance
    description: The maximum allowed distance from the expected formation position.
      Values are typically measured in yards or game units, with higher values allowing
      for more lenient positioning.
  returns: Returns true if the member is within the specified tolerance of their formation
    position; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (groupFormation->IsInFormation(playerGuid, 5.0f)) {\n    // Player is\
      \ within 5-yard tolerance of formation\n    SendSystemMessage(\"You are in formation.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Player is outside formation tolerance\n    SendSystemMessage(\"\
      You are out of formation.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Formation Validation for Raid
    code: "bool allInFormation = true;\nfor (auto& member : group->GetMembers()) {\n\
      \    if (!groupFormation->IsInFormation(member.GetGuid(), 3.0f)) {\n       \
      \ allInFormation = false;\n        break;\n    }\n}\nif (allInFormation) {\n\
      \    // All raid members are in formation\n    SendSystemMessage(\"All players\
      \ are properly positioned.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal group formation data structures to track
    expected positions and compare against current player locations. It may be called
    frequently during group activities, so performance is important. The tolerance
    value should be chosen based on the specific game context and required precision.
  warnings: Ensure that the memberGuid corresponds to an actual group member; otherwise
    behavior is undefined. Very small tolerance values may cause false negatives due
    to minor positional drift or network latency.
