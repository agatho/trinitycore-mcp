  brief: Determines whether the quest is a world quest.
  description: This method checks if the current quest is classified as a world quest,
    which is a special type of quest that can be completed multiple times and typically
    provides rewards for completing it. World quests are often associated with specific
    zones or areas in the game and may have unique mechanics such as being available
    only during certain events or time periods. The method returns true if the quest
    is a world quest, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest is a world quest, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the quest can be completed multiple times and has special mechanics associated
    with it.

    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely checks internal quest flags or
    properties to determine if the quest is a world quest. Performance considerations:
    No significant performance impact as this is a simple boolean check. Thread safety:
    This method is thread-safe since it only reads from existing quest data without
    modifying any shared resources.'
  warnings: 'Common mistakes: Using this method in conjunction with other quest-related
    methods that might have different behaviors for world quests versus regular quests.
    Dangerous edge cases: None specific, but be aware that world quests may have different
    reward mechanics compared to regular quests.'
