api:
  class: PlayerbotGroupScript
  method: CheckLootMethodChange
  signature: void PlayerbotGroupScript::CheckLootMethodChange(Group * group, GroupState
    & state)
documentation:
  brief: Checks and updates the loot method for a group based on current group state
    and player bot settings.
  description: The CheckLootMethodChange method evaluates the current loot distribution
    settings of a group and modifies them if necessary according to player bot configurations.
    This method is typically invoked during group operations such as member additions,
    removals, or when group loot settings need to be synchronized with bot behavior
    preferences. It ensures that the group's loot method aligns with the desired automation
    rules for player bots, particularly in scenarios involving raid groups where loot
    distribution methods like Free For All, Round Robin, or Master Looter are used.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose loot method will be checked and
      potentially updated. Must not be null.
  - name: state
    description: Reference to a GroupState structure containing current group state
      information including loot settings, member counts, and bot-specific configurations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group update context
    code: "void UpdateGroupLootMethod(Group* group, GroupState& state)\n{\n    PlayerbotGroupScript\
      \ script;\n    script.CheckLootMethodChange(group, state);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with player bot AI loop
    code: "void PlayerBotAI::Update()\n{\n    if (GetPlayer()->GetGroup())\n    {\n\
      \        GroupState state = GetGroupState();\n        CheckLootMethodChange(GetPlayer()->GetGroup(),\
      \ state);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player bot system and should only be called in
    contexts where group state changes are expected. It may modify group settings
    directly, so it's important to ensure that such modifications do not conflict
    with other systems or user-defined settings.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the Group pointer or
    GroupState can lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the group is valid and
    has members before invoking this method.
