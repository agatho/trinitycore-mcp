documentation:
  brief: Returns the current druid form of the AI-controlled druid.
  description: The GetCurrentForm method retrieves the active druid form for an AI-controlled
    druid character. This method is used to determine what form (e.g., Cat, Bear,
    Moonkin) the druid is currently in, which affects spell availability, movement
    speed, and combat behavior. The returned DruidForm enum value corresponds to the
    current transformation state of the druid. This information is crucial for AI
    decision-making processes that depend on the druid's current form, such as choosing
    appropriate spells or abilities during combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: A DruidForm enum value representing the current form of the druid. Possible
    values include FORM_NONE, FORM_CAT, FORM_BEAR, FORM_MOONKIN, FORM_TREE, FORM_TRAVEL,
    FORM_FLIGHT, FORM_SWIFT, FORM_SHADOW, FORM_STEALTH, and FORM_SPIRIT_OF_REVENGE.
  examples:
  - title: Check current druid form
    code: "DruidForm currentForm = ai->GetCurrentForm();\nif (currentForm == FORM_CAT)\n\
      {\n    // Druid is in cat form, use cat-specific abilities\n    ai->CastSpell(SPELL_RAKE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on AI-controlled druids. The returned form
    value may change dynamically during combat based on spell casting or ability usage.
    In some cases, the druid might be in FORM_NONE if not transformed.
