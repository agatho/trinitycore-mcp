  class: InterruptRotationManager
  method: FindBestInterrupter
  signature: int InterruptRotationManager::FindBestInterrupter(const ActiveCast &
    cast) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines the optimal interrupter unit for a given active cast based on
    priority and availability.
  description: The FindBestInterrupter method evaluates the current active cast and
    identifies the most suitable unit to perform an interrupt action. This method
    is typically used in AI-driven combat systems where multiple units may be capable
    of interrupting a spell or ability. It considers factors such as unit proximity,
    available mana, cooldown status, and interrupt effectiveness to determine the
    best candidate. The returned value represents the index or identifier of the chosen
    interrupter within the available interrupter list or unit pool.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the index or identifier of the best interrupter
    unit. A negative value may indicate no suitable interrupter was found, while a
    non-negative value corresponds to a valid interrupter in the system's internal
    list.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find an interrupter
    code: "InterruptRotationManager rotationManager;\nActiveCast currentCast = GetActiveCast();\n\
      int interrupterId = rotationManager.FindBestInterrupter(currentCast);\nif (interrupterId\
      \ >= 0) {\n    // Proceed with interrupting using the identified unit\n    DoInterrupt(interrupterId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI rotation management system and should only
    be called when an active cast requires interruption. The internal logic may vary
    depending on the specific implementation of the interrupter priority system, which
    could include factors like class specialization, spell type, or target threat
    level.
  warnings: Ensure that the ActiveCast object passed to this method is valid and not
    null. Calling this method without a proper active cast can lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect results. Also, be cautious of race conditions if multiple threads
    access interrupter data concurrently.
