  class: FollowMovementGenerator
  method: FollowMovementGenerator
  signature: void FollowMovementGenerator::FollowMovementGenerator(Unit * target,
    float range, int angle, int duration, bool ignoreTargetWalk, int param5)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a follow movement generator to make a unit follow a target within
    a specified range and angle.
  description: The FollowMovementGenerator constructor initializes a movement generator
    that causes a Unit to follow another Unit (the target) at a given distance and
    angle. This is commonly used for AI behavior where creatures or NPCs need to maintain
    proximity to a player or another unit. The generator can be configured to ignore
    the target's walking state, and supports optional duration control. It integrates
    with TrinityCore's movement system to handle pathfinding and positioning updates
    during the follow operation.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit that this generator will follow. Must be a valid
      Unit object; null pointers are not handled gracefully.
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance (in yards) the follower should maintain from
      the target. Should be a positive float value, typically between 0.5 and 30.0
      yards.
  - name: angle
    description: The angular offset (in degrees) relative to the target's facing direction.
      Valid range is usually -180 to 180 degrees; 0 means directly behind the target.
  - name: duration
    description: How long (in milliseconds) the follow behavior should last. A value
      of 0 means indefinite follow, while positive values will stop the generator
      after the duration elapses.
  - name: ignoreTargetWalk
    description: If true, the follower will not adjust its movement based on whether
      the target is walking or running. If false, it will attempt to match the target's
      movement speed and state.
  - name: param5
    description: Reserved parameter; currently unused in standard implementation but
      may be used for future extensions or custom behavior flags.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Follow Movement
    code: 'Unit* target = player;

      float range = 5.0f;

      int angle = 0;

      int duration = 10000; // 10 seconds

      bool ignoreTargetWalk = false;

      int param5 = 0;

      FollowMovementGenerator followGen(target, range, angle, duration, ignoreTargetWalk,
      param5);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Indefinite Follow with No Angle Offset
    code: 'Unit* target = player;

      float range = 3.0f;

      int angle = 180; // Behind the target

      int duration = 0; // Infinite follow

      bool ignoreTargetWalk = true;

      int param5 = 0;

      FollowMovementGenerator followGen(target, range, angle, duration, ignoreTargetWalk,
      param5);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This generator relies on the underlying movement system to update positions
    and handle pathfinding. It does not directly control the Unit's movement flags
    but modifies its movement behavior through the AI subsystem. The range parameter
    affects how closely the follower maintains distance, while angle controls positioning
    relative to the target.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before creating a FollowMovementGenerator,
    as invalid pointers can lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Also note that
    duration-based stopping may not work correctly if the movement generator is replaced
    or interrupted by other AI actions.
