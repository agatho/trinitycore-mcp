  class: ThreatCalculator
  method: CalculatePositionalThreat
  signature: float ThreatCalculator::CalculatePositionalThreat(Player * bot, Unit
    * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates positional threat generated by a bot player against a target unit.
  description: The CalculatePositionalThreat method computes the threat value that
    a player bot generates towards a specific target unit based on positional factors
    such as angle and distance. This calculation is used in the AI's threat management
    system to determine which targets are most threatening to the bot and influence
    decision-making for combat actions. The method considers the relative positioning
    between the bot and target, including facing direction and proximity, to provide
    an accurate measure of positional threat contribution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the calculated positional threat. Higher
    values indicate greater threat contribution from the bot's position relative to
    the target. The value is typically used in threat comparison logic within the
    AI system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "float threat = threatCalculator->CalculatePositionalThreat(botPlayer, targetUnit);\n\
      if (threat > 100.0f) {\n    // Bot should prioritize attacking this target\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the threat calculation system used by AI bots in TrinityCore.
    It's typically called during combat decision-making processes when evaluating
    target selection. The implementation likely factors in the bot's facing angle,
    distance to target, and possibly weapon range to compute a normalized threat value.
