  class: AuraEffect
  method: HandleModTargetResistance
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleModTargetResistance(const AuraApplication * aurApp,
    uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the target's resistance values by applying or removing an aura effect.
  description: The HandleModTargetResistance method is responsible for adjusting a
    target's magical resistance attributes when an aura is applied or removed. This
    method is typically invoked during aura application or removal events to modify
    the target's resistance stats, such as fire, frost, or shadow resistance. The
    modification is performed based on the aura's properties and the specified mode
    (application or removal). It directly affects how the target responds to incoming
    spells of the corresponding school of magic.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. This contains information about the aura's state, duration,
      and effects on the target.
  - name: mode
    description: Specifies the operation mode for the resistance modification. Typically
      indicates whether the effect is being applied (1) or removed (0). Values are
      usually 0 or 1, though exact values may depend on internal enum definitions.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the resistance modification. When true, resistance values are increased; when
      false, they are decreased.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Aura Application
    code: "void MyAuraEffect::HandleModTargetResistance(const AuraApplication* aurApp,\
      \ uint8 mode, bool apply) const {\n    if (apply) {\n        // Apply resistance\
      \ increase\n        target->ModifyResistance(SPELL_SCHOOL_FIRE, 10);\n    }\
      \ else {\n        // Remove resistance increase\n        target->ModifyResistance(SPELL_SCHOOL_FIRE,\
      \ -10);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the aura handling system in TrinityCore and is called
    internally by the core engine during aura application or removal. It should not
    be invoked directly unless implementing custom aura effects. The actual resistance
    modification logic may vary depending on the specific aura type and its configuration.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect resistance calculations,
    which may affect gameplay balance. Ensure that the mode and apply parameters are
    correctly set based on the aura's application state to avoid unintended behavior.
