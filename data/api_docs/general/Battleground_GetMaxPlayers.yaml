  class: Battleground
  method: GetMaxPlayers
  signature: int Battleground::GetMaxPlayers() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum number of players allowed in the battleground.
  description: The GetMaxPlayers method retrieves the upper limit of players that
    can participate in a specific battleground instance. This value is determined
    by the battleground's type and configuration, and it defines how many teams or
    individual players can join before the battleground becomes full. The returned
    value is typically used for managing player queues, determining when to start
    a battleground, and enforcing participation limits during matchmaking.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the maximum number of players allowed in the battleground
    instance. This value is usually positive and reflects the configured capacity
    for that specific battleground type.
  examples:
  - title: Check if battleground is full before adding player
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(123);\nif (bg && bg->GetPlayersCount()\
      \ >= bg->GetMaxPlayers()) {\n    // Handle case where battleground is full\n\
      \    SendSystemMessage(\"Battleground is currently full.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Log maximum players for debugging
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(456);\nif (bg) {\n\
      \    int maxPlayers = bg->GetMaxPlayers();\n    LOG_INFO(\"bg\", \"Battleground\
      \ {} has maximum of {} players.\", bg->GetName(), maxPlayers);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with GetPlayersCount() to determine
    if a battleground is at capacity. The value returned is static for a given battleground
    instance and does not change during gameplay unless the battleground is reset
    or recreated.
