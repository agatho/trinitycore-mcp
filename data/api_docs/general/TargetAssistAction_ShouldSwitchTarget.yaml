  method: ShouldSwitchTarget
  signature: bool TargetAssistAction::ShouldSwitchTarget(Player * bot, Unit * newTarget)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot should switch to a new target based on threat
    and combat conditions.
  description: The ShouldSwitchTarget method evaluates if a player bot should abandon
    its current target in favor of a new one. This decision is typically made based
    on factors such as threat level, target health, aggro status, and combat effectiveness.
    The method is used within the AI logic to ensure that bots maintain optimal targeting
    strategies during combat encounters. It considers both the existing target and
    the proposed new target to determine if switching would improve the bot's performance
    in battle.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is evaluating
      whether to switch targets.
  - name: newTarget
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that represents the potential new target
      the bot might switch to.
  returns: Returns true if the bot should switch to the new target; otherwise returns
    false. The decision is based on combat effectiveness, threat levels, and other
    AI-driven factors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (action->ShouldSwitchTarget(bot, newTarget)) {\n    bot->Attack(newTarget);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with target selection logic
    code: "Unit* currentTarget = bot->GetVictim();\nUnit* potentialTarget = GetNextBestTarget(bot);\n\
      if (potentialTarget && ShouldSwitchTarget(bot, potentialTarget)) {\n    bot->Attack(potentialTarget);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the target assist AI system and is typically invoked
    during combat decision-making loops. It may consider factors like target threat,
    distance, health, and the bot's current combat stance to make decisions.
  warnings: Ensure that both the bot and newTarget parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method to avoid segmentation faults or undefined behavior.
