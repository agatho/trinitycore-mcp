documentation:
  brief: Destroys a SoloCombatStrategy instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the SoloCombatStrategy class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used by the
    strategy object. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this typically involves
    releasing references to combat actions, behavior trees, or other AI-related data
    structures that may have been initialized during the object's lifetime. This method
    ensures proper memory management and prevents resource leaks when a SoloCombatStrategy
    instance is no longer needed. The destructor is automatically invoked when the
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of SoloCombatStrategy
    code: 'SoloCombatStrategy* strategy = new SoloCombatStrategy();

      // ... use the strategy ...

      delete strategy; // Triggers ~SoloCombatStrategy()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless the object was allocated
    on the heap. In most cases, it is automatically invoked when the object's scope
    ends or when delete is called on a pointer to the object.
