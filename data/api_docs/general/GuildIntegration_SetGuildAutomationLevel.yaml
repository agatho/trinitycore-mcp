  class: GuildIntegration
  method: SetGuildAutomationLevel
  signature: void GuildIntegration::SetGuildAutomationLevel(uint32 playerGuid, float
    level)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the automation level for a guild member specified by their player GUID.
  description: The SetGuildAutomationLevel method configures the automation behavior
    for a specific guild member within the TrinityCore framework. This function allows
    administrators or game systems to adjust how much automated action a guild member
    will perform, such as auto-accepting invites, managing loot distribution, or performing
    routine guild tasks. The level parameter typically represents a float value between
    0.0 (no automation) and 1.0 (full automation), though exact ranges may vary based
    on implementation details. This method is commonly used in custom guild management
    systems or automated guild utilities to provide flexible control over player behavior
    within guild contexts.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose guild automation
      level is being set. This value must correspond to a valid player in the game
      database.
  - name: level
    description: A floating-point value representing the desired automation level
      for the guild member. Typically ranges from 0.0 (no automation) to 1.0 (full
      automation), but implementation-specific constraints may apply.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Full Automation for a Guild Member
    code: 'GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.SetGuildAutomationLevel(123456, 1.0f); // Sets player with GUID 123456
      to full automation'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disabling Automation for a Guild Member
    code: 'GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.SetGuildAutomationLevel(789012, 0.0f); // Disables automation for player
      with GUID 789012'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild state tracking and may require
    synchronization if called from multiple threads. It's recommended to validate
    the player GUID exists in the database before calling this function to prevent
    unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Incorrect automation levels (e.g., values outside expected range) might
    cause undefined behavior or be silently clamped by the system. Ensure that player
    GUIDs are valid and correspond to active players to avoid errors.
