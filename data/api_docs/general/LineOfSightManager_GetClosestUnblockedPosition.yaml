  method: GetClosestUnblockedPosition
  signature: int LineOfSightManager::GetClosestUnblockedPosition(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the closest unblocked position relative to a target
    unit for line of sight purposes.
  description: The GetClosestUnblockedPosition method determines the nearest valid
    position around a specified target unit that does not block line of sight. This
    is commonly used in AI behavior and spell targeting to ensure that abilities or
    attacks can properly reach their intended targets without being obstructed by
    terrain, objects, or other units. The method evaluates potential positions in
    the vicinity of the target and selects the closest one where a direct line of
    sight exists from the caller's position to the target. It is particularly useful
    for determining optimal positioning for ranged attacks, spell casting, or movement
    decisions in combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the index or identifier of the closest
    unblocked position. A return value of -1 typically indicates that no valid unblocked
    position could be found within the search radius, while positive values correspond
    to specific positions in a predefined list or grid used for pathfinding and positioning
    calculations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = ...; // Assume target unit is already defined\nint result\
      \ = lineOfSightManager.GetClosestUnblockedPosition(target);\nif (result >= 0)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with using the unblocked position for movement or targeting\n\
      \    // result contains the index of the valid position\n}\nelse\n{\n    //\
      \ No valid position found, handle accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal raycasting or pathfinding operations
    to determine line of sight validity. It may be computationally expensive depending
    on the complexity of the environment and the number of potential positions evaluated.
    The exact algorithmic approach (e.g., grid-based search, radial sampling) is implementation-specific
    but generally optimized for real-time performance in game environments.
  warnings: The method assumes that the target unit is valid and accessible. Calling
    this method with a null or invalid target may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    Additionally, the returned position index should be validated against any predefined
    bounds to prevent out-of-bounds access errors.
