  signature: void MonkBaselineRotation::ApplyBuffs(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Applies buffs to the monk bot based on current combat state and resource
    levels.
  description: The ApplyBuffs method is responsible for determining and applying appropriate
    buffs to a Monk bot within the TrinityCore framework. This includes managing the
    application of various monk abilities such as Tiger Palm, Blackout Kick, and other
    beneficial effects that enhance the character's performance in combat. The method
    evaluates the current state of the bot including health, mana, energy, and combat
    situation to decide which buffs should be applied. It typically integrates with
    the broader rotation system to ensure optimal timing and resource management during
    gameplay.

  - title: Basic Usage in Rotation Logic
    code: "void MyMonkAI::Update()\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n    ApplyBuffs(&bot);\n\
      \    // ... rest of rotation logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of a larger rotation system and should
    be invoked at appropriate intervals during combat. The implementation may vary
    based on the specific monk class specialization (Windwalker, Mistweaver, Brewmaster)
    and could involve checking for cooldowns, resource availability, and combat state
    before applying buffs.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called during critical combat moments where
    immediate action is required, as it might introduce slight delays in buff application.
    Also, verify that the bot parameter points to a valid monk instance to prevent
    undefined behavior.
