documentation:
  brief: Handles the application of an aura to a bot character within the EnhancedBotAI
    system
  description: The OnAuraApplied method is invoked when an aura effect is applied
    to a bot controlled by the EnhancedBotAI system. This method serves as a callback
    mechanism that allows the AI to react to changes in the bot's aura state, such
    as buffs, debuffs, or status effects. It processes the aura data and may trigger
    appropriate AI behaviors, strategy adjustments, or logging mechanisms based on
    the applied aura type and properties. The method is typically called by the TrinityCore
    framework when aura events occur within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: aura
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the aura identifier or index.
      This value typically corresponds to a specific aura entry in the game's aura
      database, allowing the AI to identify and process different types of auras applied
      to the bot.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Aura Application Handling
    code: "void EnhancedBotAI::OnAuraApplied(const int* aura)\n{\n    if (aura &&\
      \ *aura > 0)\n    {\n        // Log the applied aura\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Bot %u has aura %d applied\", GetBot()->GetGUID().GetCounter(), *aura);\n  \
      \      \n        // Trigger AI behavior based on aura type\n        HandleAuraEffect(*aura);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the EnhancedBotAI's event-driven architecture and
    should be implemented to handle aura application efficiently without blocking
    the main game thread. The aura parameter may be null or zero, so proper validation
    is required before processing.
  warnings: Ensure that the aura pointer is properly validated before dereferencing
    it. Improper handling of aura data can lead to undefined behavior or crashes in
    the AI system.
