  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: GetMetrics
  signature: const MechanicMetrics & MechanicAwareness::GetMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the mechanic metrics associated with the current awareness state
  description: The GetMetrics method returns a constant reference to the MechanicMetrics
    object that contains detailed statistics and data about the mechanical behaviors
    and interactions within the current awareness context. This method provides access
    to performance-related data, such as processing times, event counts, and other
    diagnostic information that helps developers understand how mechanics are being
    handled in the system. The returned metrics object is immutable, ensuring thread
    safety when accessed from multiple contexts. This functionality is particularly
    useful for debugging, performance monitoring, and optimizing game behavior logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a MechanicMetrics object containing diagnostic
    data about mechanical behaviors and processing statistics
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Mechanic Metrics for Debugging
    code: "MechanicAwareness awareness;\nconst MechanicMetrics& metrics = awareness.GetMetrics();\n\
      LOG_INFO(\"mechanics\", \"Processing time: {}ms, Events handled: {}\", \n  \
      \      metrics.processingTime, metrics.eventCount);"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned MechanicMetrics reference is guaranteed to be valid for the
    lifetime of the MechanicAwareness object. This method is designed to be lightweight
    and should not cause performance degradation during normal operation. The metrics
    data is updated incrementally as mechanics are processed.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned MechanicMetrics object as it's const-ref; attempting
    to do so will result in compilation errors. Ensure that the MechanicAwareness
    instance remains valid while using the returned reference.
