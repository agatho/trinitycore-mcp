  class: ChaseMovementGenerator
  method: Finalize
  signature: void ChaseMovementGenerator::Finalize(Unit * param0, bool param1, bool
    param2)
documentation:
  brief: Completes the chase movement behavior for a unit, handling cleanup and state
    transitions.
  description: The Finalize method in ChaseMovementGenerator is responsible for cleaning
    up resources and finalizing the chase movement behavior when the movement generator
    is being deactivated or destroyed. This method ensures proper state management
    for the chasing unit, including releasing any held references, resetting movement
    flags, and notifying the AI system of the completion of the chase sequence. It
    typically gets called during the movement generator's destruction phase or when
    transitioning to a different movement behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is being chased. This represents
      the target unit for which the chase movement was generated.
  - name: param1
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the chase should be interrupted or
      completed normally. If true, the chase is forcefully stopped; if false, it completes
      naturally.
  - name: param2
    description: Boolean flag controlling whether to reset the unit's movement state.
      When true, resets movement flags and clears any chase-related data from the
      unit's AI context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Finalize Usage
    code: 'ChaseMovementGenerator* generator = new ChaseMovementGenerator();

      generator->Finalize(targetUnit, false, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Interrupting a Chase Movement
    code: "if (player->IsInCombat()) {\n    generator->Finalize(chaseTarget, true,\
      \ false);\n    // Forcefully stop the chase\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the AI system and should not
    be called directly unless implementing custom movement logic. The method assumes
    that all necessary preconditions for movement cleanup have been met, such as ensuring
    no other references to the unit exist during destruction.
  warnings: Calling this method with incorrect parameters may lead to undefined behavior
    or memory leaks. Ensure that param0 points to a valid Unit object before calling
    Finalize. Avoid calling Finalize multiple times on the same generator instance.
