  brief: Updates the quest turn-in state based on elapsed time
  description: The Update method processes the internal state of a QuestTurnIn object,
    typically handling time-based events or state transitions. This method is called
    periodically by the game loop to ensure that quest turn-in conditions are properly
    evaluated and updated. It may handle cooldowns, time-sensitive quest requirements,
    or other temporal aspects of quest completion. The method takes a delta time parameter
    representing milliseconds since last update, which is used to determine if any
    time-based quest conditions should be triggered or reset.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'QuestTurnIn* questTurnIn = new QuestTurnIn();

      questTurnIn->Update(1000); // Update with 1 second elapsed time'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game loop or update system.
    It's important to ensure that this method is called regularly to maintain proper
    quest state management. The implementation likely handles internal timers and
    state transitions related to quest completion.
