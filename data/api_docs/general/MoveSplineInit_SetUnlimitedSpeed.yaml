  signature: void MoveSplineInit::SetUnlimitedSpeed()
documentation:
  brief: Sets the movement spline to unlimited speed mode, bypassing normal speed
    limitations.
  description: The SetUnlimitedSpeed method configures the MoveSplineInit object to
    operate in a mode where movement speed is not constrained by standard limits.
    This is typically used for special movement scenarios such as teleportation, instant
    movement, or other game mechanics that require bypassing regular physics-based
    speed calculations. When this method is invoked, subsequent spline calculations
    will use unlimited speed parameters regardless of the entity's normal movement
    capabilities. The method does not take any parameters and modifies the internal
    state of the MoveSplineInit object to reflect this special movement mode.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Instant Movement
    code: 'MoveSplineInit splineInit;

      splineInit.SetUnlimitedSpeed();

      // Subsequent movement will use unlimited speed'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it bypasses normal movement constraints.
    It is typically called before initiating special movement sequences such as teleportation
    or instant warping. The effect only applies to the current spline initialization
    and does not persist across multiple movements.
  warnings: Using this method without proper context may result in unexpected movement
    behavior or client-server desynchronization. Ensure that unlimited speed is only
    applied during appropriate game events where such behavior is expected and handled
    correctly by both client and server logic.
