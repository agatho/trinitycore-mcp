  signature: bool BotAI::IsActionPossible(const std::string & actionName) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specified bot action is currently possible to execute
  description: The IsActionPossible method determines whether a given bot action can
    be executed based on current game state, resource availability, and contextual
    conditions. This method evaluates various factors such as player status, available
    actions, cooldowns, and environmental constraints to return a boolean value indicating
    action feasibility. It is commonly used within the BotAI system to validate potential
    actions before attempting execution, ensuring that bots only perform valid operations
    within the game mechanics framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified action can be executed under current conditions,
    false otherwise. The method may return false due to cooldowns, insufficient resources,
    invalid player state, or other contextual limitations preventing the action from
    being performed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Action Validation
    code: "if (botAI->IsActionPossible(\"attack\")) {\n    // Proceed with attack\
      \ action\n    botAI->ExecuteAction(\"attack\");\n} else {\n    // Find alternative\
      \ action\n    botAI->ExecuteAction(\"move\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Action Execution
    code: "std::string action = \"cast_spell\";\nif (botAI->IsActionPossible(action))\
      \ {\n    // Validate spell casting conditions\n    if (botAI->HasSpell(\"fireball\"\
      )) {\n        botAI->ExecuteAction(action);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs runtime checks against the current game state and may
    have performance implications when called frequently. It should be used judiciously
    in performance-critical code paths. The implementation likely caches certain state
    information to optimize repeated calls for the same action type.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method excessively in tight loops as it may impact
    performance. The method's behavior might change based on dynamic game conditions,
    so results should not be cached for extended periods without revalidation.
