  class: QuestManager
  method: IsQuestingActive
  signature: bool QuestManager::IsQuestingActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player is currently engaged in active questing activities.
  description: The IsQuestingActive method determines whether the player character
    is currently involved in active questing, including having active quests in progress
    or being in a state where quest interactions are possible. This method typically
    evaluates the player's current quest log and active quest states to return a boolean
    value indicating if questing is active. The result can be used by game systems
    to enable or disable quest-related UI elements, trigger quest-specific events,
    or manage quest progression logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has active quests in progress or is in an active
    questing state; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Status Check
    code: "if (player->GetQuestManager()->IsQuestingActive()) {\n    // Player is\
      \ currently engaged in quests\n    player->SendNotification(\"You have active\
      \ quests.\");\n} else {\n    // No active quests\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      No active quests.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Quest System Activation
    code: "QuestManager* questMgr = player->GetQuestManager();\nif (questMgr->IsQuestingActive())\
      \ {\n    // Enable quest-related UI components\n    player->SetFlag(PLAYER_FLAGS,\
      \ PLAYER_FLAG_QUEST_LOG_OPEN);\n} else {\n    // Disable quest-related UI components\n\
      \    player->RemoveFlag(PLAYER_FLAGS, PLAYER_FLAG_QUEST_LOG_OPEN);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks the internal state of the player's quest log and
    active objectives. It may consider quests that are in progress, completed but
    not turned in, or quests that have been abandoned. The implementation might also
    account for quest timers, quest gating conditions, or other temporal factors affecting
    quest availability.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a sole indicator of quest completion
    status. It primarily reflects active quest engagement rather than overall quest
    progression. Developers should consider combining this with other quest state
    checks for comprehensive quest management.
