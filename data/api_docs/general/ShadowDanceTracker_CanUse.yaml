documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can currently use the Shadow Dance ability.
  description: The CanUse method evaluates all necessary conditions to determine if
    a player is eligible to activate the Shadow Dance ability. This includes checking
    for valid target requirements, cooldown status, resource availability (such as
    energy or rage), and any state restrictions that would prevent usage. The method
    ensures that the player meets both immediate and contextual prerequisites before
    allowing the ability to be used.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all conditions are met and the Shadow Dance ability can
    be used; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (shadowDanceTracker.CanUse()) {\n    // Proceed with using Shadow Dance\n\
      \    player.CastSpell(SPELL_SHADOW_DANCE);\n} else {\n    // Handle inability\
      \ to use Shadow Dance\n    player.SendSystemMessage(\"Cannot use Shadow Dance\
      \ at this time.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called prior to attempting to use the Shadow Dance
    ability to avoid invalid actions. It is typically used in conjunction with other
    game state checks such as target validation and spell cooldowns.
