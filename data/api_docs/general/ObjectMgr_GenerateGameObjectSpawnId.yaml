  signature: int ObjectMgr::GenerateGameObjectSpawnId()
documentation:
  brief: Generates and returns a unique spawn ID for a game object.
  description: The GenerateGameObjectSpawnId method is responsible for creating a
    unique identifier that will be used to track the spawning of game objects within
    the TrinityCore world. This ID is essential for managing object instances, ensuring
    that each spawned game object can be uniquely identified and referenced throughout
    the server's lifecycle. The method typically increments an internal counter or
    retrieves the next available ID from a database sequence, guaranteeing no collisions
    in spawn identifiers. It is commonly invoked when creating new GameObject entries
    in the world, particularly during map loading or dynamic object spawning.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the newly generated unique spawn ID for a
    game object. This ID should be used immediately to assign to a GameObject instance
    before it is added to the world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in GameObject Creation
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->SetSpawnId(ObjectMgr::Instance()->GenerateGameObjectSpawnId());

      go->SetMap(map);

      go->Spawn();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and should be called before assigning the ID to
    a GameObject instance. The generated IDs are typically sequential but may have
    gaps if objects are removed or if the server restarts, as the system relies on
    internal counters or database sequences.
  warnings: Do not use this method without ensuring that the returned spawn ID is
    immediately assigned to a GameObject; otherwise, it may lead to inconsistencies
    in object tracking and potential memory leaks.
