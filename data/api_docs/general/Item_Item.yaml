  brief: Initializes a new Item object with default values and sets up its basic properties.
  description: The Item constructor initializes a new Item object, setting up its
    basic properties such as item type, quality, and default values. This method is
    typically called when creating a new item instance in the game world, ensuring
    that the item has proper initialization before being used in gameplay mechanics.
    It handles the setup of essential fields like item ID, stack count, and other
    relevant attributes that define an item's behavior within the game system. The
    constructor also ensures that the item is properly linked to its associated database
    entries and can be correctly processed by the game engine.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Item Creation
    code: 'Item* newItem = new Item();

      // This creates a new item with default values

      // The item will have default properties set

      // It can be used in gameplay operations after initialization'
    language: cpp
  notes: The constructor typically initializes internal fields such as item ID, stack
    count, and quality. It's important to note that this method is usually called
    when creating items from database entries or when generating new items during
    gameplay. The initialization process ensures that the item object is properly
    set up before being used in game mechanics.
  warnings: This constructor should not be called directly by developers unless explicitly
    required, as it's typically invoked automatically when creating items through
    other methods like Item::CreateItem() or when loading from database. Calling this
    constructor without proper context may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    item properties.
