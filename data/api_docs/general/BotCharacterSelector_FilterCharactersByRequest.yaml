  class: BotCharacterSelector
  method: FilterCharactersByRequest
  signature: int BotCharacterSelector::FilterCharactersByRequest(const int & characters,
    const int & request) const
documentation:
  brief: Filters a list of characters based on a specified request criteria and returns
    the count of matching characters.
  description: The FilterCharactersByRequest method processes a collection of characters
    and applies a filtering mechanism based on the provided request parameter. It
    evaluates each character against the request criteria, which typically represents
    a bitmask or flag indicating specific filtering conditions such as level ranges,
    class types, or account status. The method returns an integer representing the
    number of characters that meet the specified filtering requirements. This functionality
    is commonly used in bot management systems to select appropriate characters for
    automated actions based on predefined rules.
  parameters:
  - name: characters
    description: An integer reference representing the total count or identifier of
      characters to be filtered. This parameter typically holds the number of available
      characters or a bitmask identifying character properties.
  - name: request
    description: An integer reference specifying the filtering criteria or request
      type. This value is usually interpreted as a bitmask or flag that defines which
      characters should be included in the result set based on specific conditions
      like level thresholds, class restrictions, or account permissions.
  returns: Returns an integer indicating the number of characters that satisfy the
    filtering criteria defined by the request parameter. A return value of zero means
    no characters matched the specified request, while a positive integer indicates
    the count of matching characters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic character filtering example
    code: 'int totalCharacters = 10;

      int filterRequest = 0x0001; // Example bitmask for level 1-10 characters

      int matchedCount = selector.FilterCharactersByRequest(totalCharacters, filterRequest);

      // matchedCount now holds the number of characters matching the request criteria'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced filtering with multiple conditions
    code: "int totalCharacters = 25;\nint filterRequest = 0x0007; // Example bitmask\
      \ for class-specific filtering\nint matchedCount = selector.FilterCharactersByRequest(totalCharacters,\
      \ filterRequest);\nif (matchedCount > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Found \" << matchedCount\
      \ << \" matching characters\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"No\
      \ matching characters found\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in bot management systems where automated character
    selection is required. The filtering logic may be implemented using bitwise operations
    or conditional checks depending on the specific requirements of the bot system.
    Performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary iterations over large
    character sets when possible.
  warnings: Ensure that the request parameter is properly validated before calling
    this method, as invalid bitmasks or flags could lead to unexpected filtering results.
    Be cautious with large character sets as repeated calls may impact performance
    if not optimized.
