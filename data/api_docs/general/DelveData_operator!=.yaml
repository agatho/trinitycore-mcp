documentation:
  brief: Compares two DelveData objects for inequality and returns true if they are
    not equal.
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this DelveData
    object and another DelveData object provided as a parameter. It evaluates whether
    the two objects differ in any of their data members, returning true if they are
    not identical and false if all corresponding data members are equal. This comparison
    is typically used to determine if two delve operations or delve-related data structures
    have different configurations or states. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore, this method would be essential for identifying differences in delve
    data such as quest progress, exploration records, or other player-specific delve
    information that may need to be synchronized or updated.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The DelveData object to compare against this instance. This parameter
      represents another delve data structure that will be compared for equality with
      the current object.
  returns: Returns true if the two DelveData objects are not equal, false otherwise.
    The comparison checks all relevant data members of both objects and returns false
    if all members match exactly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic inequality check between two DelveData objects
    code: "DelveData data1;\nDelveData data2;\nbool areDifferent = (data1 != data2);\
      \ // Returns true if data1 and data2 have different values\nif (areDifferent)\
      \ {\n    // Handle the case where delve data differs\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using inequality operator in conditional logic for delve state management
    code: "DelveData playerDelveData;\nDelveData savedDelveData;\n\n// Assume these\
      \ objects are populated with relevant delve information\nif (playerDelveData\
      \ != savedDelveData) {\n    // Update saved data or trigger a synchronization\
      \ process\n    // This might be used when checking if a player's delve progress\
      \ has changed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented as a member function that compares
    all relevant fields of the DelveData class. The implementation likely uses a combination
    of field-by-field comparisons or a hash-based comparison to determine equality.
    Performance-wise, this operation should be relatively fast since it's usually
    a simple comparison of data members.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this operator in performance-critical sections
    as it may involve comparing multiple data fields. If DelveData contains large
    containers or complex nested structures, the comparison could become expensive.
    Also ensure that both objects are properly initialized before comparison to avoid
    undefined behavior.
