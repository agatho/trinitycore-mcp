  class: LavaSurgeTracker
  method: IsActive
  signature: bool LavaSurgeTracker::IsActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the Lava Surge aura is currently active on the player.
  description: The IsActive method determines whether the Lava Surge buff is currently
    applied to the player. This aura typically grants increased critical strike chance
    for spell casts and is commonly associated with shaman class abilities. The method
    returns true when the aura is active and false otherwise. This check is essential
    for gameplay mechanics that depend on the presence of this temporary buff, such
    as determining if certain spells can benefit from its effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Lava Surge aura is currently active on the player;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (player->GetLavaSurgeTracker()->IsActive()) {\n    // Apply Lava Surge\
      \ effects\n    player->CastSpell(target, LAVA_SURGE_SPELL_ID, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spell Casting
    code: "if (player->GetLavaSurgeTracker()->IsActive() && player->CanCastSpell(spell))\
      \ {\n    // Cast spell with enhanced critical strike chance\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ ENHANCED_SPELL_ID, true);\n} else {\n    // Cast normal version of the spell\n\
      \    player->CastSpell(target, NORMAL_SPELL_ID, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on player objects that have a valid LavaSurgeTracker
    instance. The underlying aura tracking mechanism relies on proper event handling
    and state management within the TrinityCore framework.
