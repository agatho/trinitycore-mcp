  method: CalculateRelevance
  signature: StrategyRelevance Strategy::CalculateRelevance(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the relevance of a strategy for the current bot AI
    context.
  description: The CalculateRelevance method assesses how applicable or effective
    a given strategy is within the current game state and AI context. It takes into
    account various factors such as player level, available resources, enemy presence,
    and situational awareness to determine a relevance score. This score helps the
    AI system prioritize which strategies to execute next during bot behavior planning.
    The method is typically called by the AI decision-making engine to dynamically
    select the most appropriate strategy based on real-time conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A StrategyRelevance object that encapsulates the calculated relevance level
    of the strategy, indicating how strongly the strategy should be considered for
    execution in the current context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "StrategyRelevance relevance = myStrategy.CalculateRelevance(botAI);\nif\
      \ (relevance > StrategyRelevance::LOW) {\n    // Execute the strategy\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called frequently during AI processing cycles,
    so performance considerations are important. The relevance calculation may involve
    complex game state checks and should not be computationally expensive.
