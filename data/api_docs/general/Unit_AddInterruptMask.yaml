  class: Unit
  method: AddInterruptMask
  signature: void Unit::AddInterruptMask(int flags, int flags2)
documentation:
  brief: Adds an interrupt mask to the unit's ability to be interrupted during spell
    casting.
  description: The AddInterruptMask method allows a Unit to specify which types of
    interrupts should be allowed or prevented during spell casting. This is particularly
    useful for controlling how spells can be interrupted by external effects such
    as crowd control abilities, or for setting up custom interrupt behavior in game
    mechanics. The method modifies the unit's internal interrupt mask, which determines
    whether certain interruptible actions are allowed to proceed. This functionality
    is essential for implementing complex spell mechanics and managing combat behavior
    in World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: The first interrupt mask flag value that defines the type of interrupt
      being added. Valid values typically include various interrupt types like 'interrupt'
      or 'spell interrupt'.
  - name: flags2
    description: The second interrupt mask flag value, used for additional interrupt
      control. This parameter allows for more granular control over specific interrupt
      behaviors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->AddInterruptMask(1, 2);

      // This sets up the unit to allow specific types of interrupts during spell
      casting'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->AddInterruptMask(0x01, 0x02);

      // This adds interrupt mask for specific spell types, such as those with "interrupt"
      or "spell interrupt" flags'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    to control how interrupts are handled during combat. It may affect performance
    if used excessively, particularly in high-frequency spell casting scenarios. The
    method is thread-safe and should not be called from multiple threads simultaneously
    unless properly synchronized.
  warnings: Improper use of interrupt masks can lead to unexpected behavior in spell
    casting or combat mechanics. Care must be taken when setting flags, as incorrect
    values may prevent legitimate interrupts from occurring. Also, this method does
    not directly affect the unit's ability to cast spells; it only controls whether
    those spells can be interrupted.
