  signature: void GuildAchievementMgr::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all guild achievement data for the associated guild.
  description: The Reset method clears all recorded guild achievements and their progress
    for the guild managed by this GuildAchievementMgr instance. This operation typically
    occurs during a guild reset event, such as when a guild is disbanded or when achievements
    are manually cleared by an administrator. The method ensures that all achievement
    criteria, completion timestamps, and related metadata are removed from the system.
    It does not affect the guild's structure or other non-achievement data. This method
    is generally called internally by the core systems but may also be invoked externally
    under specific administrative conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset Guild Achievements
    code: "GuildAchievementMgr* mgr = sGuildMgr->GetGuildAchievementMgr(guildId);\n\
      if (mgr)\n{\n    mgr->Reset();\n    // All guild achievements have been cleared\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during administrative operations or system
    maintenance. It may trigger database updates and should be used carefully in performance-sensitive
    contexts. The reset operation is not reversible without re-adding achievements
    manually.
  warnings: Calling this method will permanently delete all achievement data for the
    guild, including completed criteria and timestamps. Ensure that this action is
    intended before execution, especially in production environments where data loss
    could occur.
