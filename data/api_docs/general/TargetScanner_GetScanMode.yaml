  class: TargetScanner
  method: GetScanMode
  signature: ScanMode TargetScanner::GetScanMode() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current scan mode configuration of the target scanner instance.
  description: The GetScanMode method returns the ScanMode enumeration value that
    defines how the TargetScanner performs its target detection and evaluation. This
    mode determines the scanning behavior, such as whether it scans for all targets,
    only enemies, or specific types of units within its range. The returned scan mode
    is typically set during the initialization or configuration phase of the scanner
    and influences the logic used in subsequent targeting decisions. Understanding
    this mode is essential for developers working with AI target selection systems
    in TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ScanMode enumeration value indicating the current scanning behavior of
    the TargetScanner. Possible values may include modes like SCAN_ALL, SCAN_ENEMIES,
    or SCAN_FRIENDS depending on the implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Log Current Scan Mode
    code: "ScanMode mode = scanner.GetScanMode();\nswitch (mode)\n{\n    case SCAN_ALL:\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Scanner is set to scan all targets.\");\n       \
      \ break;\n    case SCAN_ENEMIES:\n        sLog->outString(\"Scanner is set to\
      \ scan only enemies.\");\n        break;\n    default:\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Unknown scan mode.\");\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other TargetScanner configuration
    methods to determine how targeting logic should behave. It's a read-only accessor
    and does not modify the internal state of the scanner.
