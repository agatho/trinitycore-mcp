documentation:
  brief: Saves the player's friend list to the database
  description: The SaveFriendList method persists the current state of a player's
    social friend list to the database. This ensures that any additions, removals,
    or modifications to the friend list are permanently stored and will be available
    when the player logs in again. The method typically operates within the context
    of a player session and is often called automatically during logout or at regular
    intervals to maintain data consistency. It handles the serialization and database
    update operations required to store the social relationships.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'void SaveFriendList();

      // Called internally by the SocialManager when a player''s friend list changes

      SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();

      socialMgr->SaveFriendList();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the core system during
    player logout or session cleanup. It may also be called manually when immediate
    persistence is required. The operation is generally non-blocking but can cause
    database I/O delays depending on server load and database performance.
  warnings: Calling this method manually in high-frequency scenarios may impact performance
    due to database operations. It should not be called excessively without proper
    throttling or batching logic.
