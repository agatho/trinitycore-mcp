  class: CharacterCache
  method: UpdateCharacterData
  signature: void CharacterCache::UpdateCharacterData(const int & guid, const std::string
    & name, int gender, int race)
documentation:
  brief: Updates cached character data including name, gender, and race for a given
    GUID.
  description: The UpdateCharacterData method is responsible for updating the in-memory
    cache of character information within the CharacterCache class. It takes a character's
    globally unique identifier (GUID), name, gender, and race as parameters and stores
    this information in an internal data structure for quick retrieval. This method
    is typically called when character data changes in the game world or when new
    character data needs to be loaded into the cache. The update operation ensures
    that subsequent lookups for the character using their GUID will return the most
    recent information. This caching mechanism helps reduce database queries and improve
    performance for frequently accessed character data.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The globally unique identifier of the character. This is a unique
      integer value assigned to each character in the game world that serves as their
      primary key for identification.
  - name: name
    description: The current name of the character. This is a string value representing
      the display name of the character in the game.
  - name: gender
    description: The gender of the character. Typically represented as an integer
      where 0 = male, 1 = female, and potentially other values for special cases or
      custom implementations.
  - name: race
    description: The race of the character. This is an integer value that corresponds
      to predefined race constants in the game's data structures, identifying which
      racial type the character belongs to.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Character Data Update
    code: 'CharacterCache* cache = CharacterCache::Instance();

      int guid = 12345;

      std::string name = "Aelarion";

      int gender = 1; // Female

      int race = 2; // Human


      cache->UpdateCharacterData(guid, name, gender, race);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Character Data After Name Change
    code: 'CharacterCache* cache = CharacterCache::Instance();

      int guid = 12345;

      std::string newName = "Aelarion the Brave";

      int gender = 1;

      int race = 2;


      // Update character name in cache after a rename event

      cache->UpdateCharacterData(guid, newName, gender, race);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs an in-memory update only and does not persist changes
    to the database. The cache is typically maintained per realm or server instance
    and may be cleared or refreshed during server maintenance or when new data becomes
    available from the database. Thread safety should be considered if multiple threads
    access the cache simultaneously.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID parameter corresponds to an actual existing character
    in the game world, as updating non-existent characters may lead to inconsistent
    state. The method does not validate parameter values, so invalid gender or race
    values could cause unexpected behavior in downstream systems that rely on this
    cached data.
