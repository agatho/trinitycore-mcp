  signature: void EvokerAI::OptimizeEssenceUsage()
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes essence usage for the evoker AI by determining the most efficient
    ability to cast based on current resource levels and combat state.
  description: The OptimizeEssenceUsage method is responsible for calculating and
    selecting the optimal essence-based ability for an evoker AI to cast. This method
    evaluates the current state of the evoker's essence resources, available abilities,
    and combat situation to determine which ability will provide the greatest benefit
    in terms of damage output, survivability, or utility. It considers factors such
    as essence cost, cooldown status, and the urgency of the situation. The method
    is typically called during the AI's decision-making cycle to ensure that essence
    is used efficiently without waste. This optimization helps maintain high performance
    for evoker NPCs in various combat scenarios.

  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    OptimizeEssenceUsage();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI decision-making process and should be
    called regularly during the AI update cycle. It assumes that the evoker's essence
    state and available abilities are properly initialized before execution.
