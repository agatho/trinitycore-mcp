documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the archetype classification of the player profile
    based on character attributes and gameplay data.
  description: The ClassifyArchetype method analyzes various aspects of a player's
    profile, including class, specialization, playstyle indicators, and other relevant
    character data to assign a standardized archetype. This classification is used
    internally by TrinityCore for balancing, content recommendation, and gameplay
    analytics. The method does not modify any state and is purely informational. It
    relies on the current state of the player profile at the time of invocation and
    may return different results if the underlying data changes between calls.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A PlayerArchetype enum value representing the determined archetype classification
    of the player. Possible values include but are not limited to: ARCHETYPE_TANK,
    ARCHETYPE_HEALER, ARCHETYPE_DAMAGE_DEALER, or ARCHETYPE_UNKNOWN if classification
    cannot be determined.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Archetype Retrieval
    code: "PlayerProfile* profile = player->GetPlayerProfile();\nPlayerArchetype archetype\
      \ = profile->ClassifyArchetype();\nswitch (archetype)\n{\n    case ARCHETYPE_TANK:\n\
      \        // Handle tank archetype logic\n        break;\n    case ARCHETYPE_HEALER:\n\
      \        // Handle healer archetype logic\n        break;\n    case ARCHETYPE_DAMAGE_DEALER:\n\
      \        // Handle DPS archetype logic\n        break;\n    default:\n     \
      \   // Handle unknown or unclassified\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve performance considerations if called frequently in
    tight loops. The classification algorithm might evolve over time with game updates,
    so relying on specific archetype values for gameplay logic should be done carefully.
    The returned archetype is computed from static and dynamic player data, so calling
    this method after significant changes to the player's state (e.g., level up, spec
    change) will yield updated results.
  warnings: Do not assume that archetype classifications remain constant across different
    game versions or patches. The internal logic for determining archetypes may be
    adjusted by Blizzard/TrinityCore developers, potentially changing behavior without
    notice. Avoid hardcoding archetype-specific behaviors based solely on this classification
    unless absolutely necessary.
