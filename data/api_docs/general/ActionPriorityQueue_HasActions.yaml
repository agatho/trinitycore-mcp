documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the action priority queue contains any queued actions.
  description: The HasActions method determines if there are any pending actions within
    the ActionPriorityQueue. This is a crucial check for AI systems and behavior logic
    that need to know whether the queue has items ready to be processed. The method
    returns true if at least one action exists in the queue, and false otherwise.
    It does not modify the queue's contents or state, making it safe for use in conditional
    checks without side effects. This functionality is commonly used in TrinityCore's
    AI framework to control execution flow based on queued actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ActionPriorityQueue contains one or more actions; returns
    false if the queue is empty.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (actionQueue.HasActions()) {\n    // Process queued actions\n    actionQueue.ExecuteNextAction();\n\
      } else {\n    // No actions to process\n    DoIdleBehavior();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Logic
    code: "class EnemyAI {\npublic:\n    void Update() {\n        if (actionQueue.HasActions())\
      \ {\n            actionQueue.ExecuteNextAction();\n        } else {\n      \
      \      // Queue is empty, determine next action\n            DecideNewAction();\n\
      \        }\n    }\nprivate:\n    ActionPriorityQueue actionQueue;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a constant-time check by examining the internal state
    of the queue. It is optimized for frequent calls and does not involve expensive
    operations like sorting or filtering. The implementation assumes thread safety
    for read operations, though modifications to the queue should be synchronized
    if accessed from multiple threads.
