  class: MarksmanshipHunterRefactored
  method: IsInDeadZone
  signature: bool MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::IsInDeadZone(int * param0) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the marksmanship hunter is within the dead zone range
    of a target.
  description: The IsInDeadZone method evaluates if the MarksmanshipHunterRefactored
    instance is positioned within a specific 'dead zone' area relative to its current
    target. This functionality is commonly used in AI decision-making logic for hunters
    to determine optimal positioning for ranged attacks. The method typically checks
    spatial proximity and angle constraints to decide whether the hunter's position
    is considered ineffective or unsafe for certain abilities. It may be used in conjunction
    with other movement or targeting behaviors to ensure proper tactical positioning
    during combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the hunter is within the defined dead zone range of the
    target, false otherwise. The exact definition of 'dead zone' depends on game mechanics
    and may include distance thresholds, angle restrictions, or environmental factors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision logic
    code: "if (hunter.IsInDeadZone()) {\n    // Move away from target or change positioning\n\
      \    hunter.MoveAwayFromTarget();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with targeting system
    code: "if (hunter.IsInDeadZone() && hunter.HasLineOfSight()) {\n    // Execute\
      \ fallback behavior when in dead zone but can still attack\n    hunter.UseAutoShot();\n\
      } else if (hunter.IsInDeadZone()) {\n    // Attempt to reposition\n    hunter.AttemptRepositioning();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal state tracking of the hunter's position
    and target location. The dead zone definition may vary based on hunter specialization,
    gear, or current game state. Consider caching results if this method is called
    frequently in tight loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the hunter's target is valid before calling this method to
    avoid unexpected behavior. The method may return inconsistent results if called
    during movement transitions or when target position updates are pending.
