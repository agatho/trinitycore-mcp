  brief: Displays a text emote in the game world
  description: The TextEmote method allows a Unit (such as a player or creature) to
    display a text emote in the game world. This method is used to show textual messages
    above the unit's head, typically for communication purposes. The textId parameter
    specifies which emote to display, while the target parameter can specify a specific
    player or group to send the emote to. The isBossEmote parameter determines whether
    the emote should be displayed as a boss emote (with special formatting). This
    method is commonly used in World of Warcraft for displaying communication messages,
    quest-related text emotes, or other game mechanics involving textual displays.
  parameters:
  - name: textId
    description: The identifier of the text emote to display. This corresponds to
      a specific emote in the game's database, typically related to communication
      or quest-related messages.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer array specifying target players or groups to
      send the emote to. If NULL, the emote is displayed to all nearby players. If
      set, it specifies a specific player or group.
  - name: isBossEmote
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether this emote should be displayed as
      a boss emote. When true, the emote will have special formatting and may be displayed
      differently than regular text emotes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Text Emote Usage
    code: 'Unit* unit = player;

      unit->TextEmote(123, nullptr, false);

      // Displays emote 123 to all nearby players'
    language: cpp
  - title: Boss Emote Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = creature;

      unit->TextEmote(456, &target, true);

      // Displays emote 456 as a boss emote to specific target'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other World of Warcraft
    APIs for displaying communication messages. It should be used carefully as it
    can affect performance if overused. The method is thread-safe and can be called
    from any thread context.
  warnings: The textId parameter must correspond to valid emote IDs in the game database,
    otherwise the emote may not display correctly or may cause errors. Using NULL
    for target can lead to performance issues if too many players are nearby. Avoid
    using this method during combat or high-frequency events to prevent potential
    performance degradation.
