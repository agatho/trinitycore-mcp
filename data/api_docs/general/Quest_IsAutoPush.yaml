  method: IsAutoPush
  signature: bool Quest::IsAutoPush() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a quest is automatically pushed to the player's quest
    log.
  description: The IsAutoPush method checks if a quest will be automatically added
    to the player's quest log without requiring manual interaction. This method is
    commonly used in quest scripts and event handling to determine if a quest should
    be automatically triggered or if it requires player interaction to start. It typically
    returns true for quests that are designed to be automatically accepted by players,
    such as those with automatic acceptance conditions or those that are part of a
    chain that automatically progresses without requiring player action.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest is set to automatically push to the player's
    quest log, false otherwise. This indicates whether the quest will be automatically
    accepted and added to the player's quest log upon entering the game world or triggering
    specific conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (quest->IsAutoPush()) {\n    // Quest will automatically be added to\
      \ player's quest log\n    // No manual acceptance required\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    like IsFinished or IsAvailable. The implementation may vary depending on how the
    quest was defined in the database, and it's important to note that this method
    only applies to quests that are designed to be automatically accepted by players.
  warnings: Be careful when using this method as it can affect quest progression and
    player experience. If a quest is marked as auto push but shouldn't be, it may
    cause unexpected behavior in quest progression or trigger unwanted events.
