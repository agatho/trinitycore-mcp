  class: World
  method: IsGuidWarning
  signature: bool World::IsGuidWarning()
documentation:
  brief: Checks if GUID warning functionality is enabled in the world configuration.
  description: The IsGuidWarning method determines whether the server is configured
    to issue warnings when invalid or suspicious GUIDs are encountered during operation.
    This functionality helps developers and administrators identify potential issues
    with object references in the game world. The method typically checks a configuration
    setting or internal flag that controls this behavior. When enabled, it can help
    detect problems such as dangling pointers, incorrect object management, or invalid
    data in the server's object database.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if GUID warnings are enabled, false otherwise. A return value
    of true indicates that the system will log warnings when invalid GUIDs are detected
    during runtime operations.
  examples:
  - title: Check if GUID warnings are enabled
    code: "if (sWorld->IsGuidWarning())\n{\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL,\
      \ \"GUID warning system is active\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL,\
      \ \"GUID warning system is disabled\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely reads from a configuration value or internal flag that
    can be modified at runtime or through server configuration files. The actual implementation
    may involve checking a boolean member variable or configuration setting within
    the World class instance.
  warnings: The warning system should not be relied upon for security purposes as
    it's primarily intended for debugging and development. Disabling this feature
    in production environments may hide important diagnostic information about object
    reference issues.
