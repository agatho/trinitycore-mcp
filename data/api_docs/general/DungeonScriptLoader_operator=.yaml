documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one DungeonScriptLoader object to another
  description: The assignment operator for the DungeonScriptLoader class performs
    a deep copy of all member data from the source object to the target object. This
    method is typically used when creating a new DungeonScriptLoader instance based
    on an existing one, ensuring that all script loading configurations and state
    information are properly transferred. In the context of TrinityCore's World of
    Warcraft emulation, this operation allows for the duplication of dungeon-specific
    script loader configurations, which may include registered scripts, event handlers,
    or other runtime data needed for dungeon management. The operator follows standard
    C++ copy assignment semantics, returning a reference to the assigned object to
    allow for chaining operations.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source DungeonScriptLoader object whose contents will be copied
      to this instance
  returns: A reference to the current DungeonScriptLoader object after the assignment
    has been completed, enabling method chaining
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Usage
    code: 'DungeonScriptLoader loader1;

      DungeonScriptLoader loader2 = loader1; // Uses copy constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      loader2 = loader1; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Method Chaining Example
    code: 'DungeonScriptLoader loader1;

      DungeonScriptLoader loader2;

      DungeonScriptLoader loader3;


      // Chaining assignments

      loader1 = loader2 = loader3; // Each assignment returns a reference to the left-hand
      side'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely performs deep copying of internal data structures such
    as script registries or configuration maps. It's important to note that while
    this is a standard C++ operator, developers should be aware of potential performance
    implications when dealing with large script configurations or complex dungeon
    setups.
