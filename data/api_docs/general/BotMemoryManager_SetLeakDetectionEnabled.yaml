  signature: void BotMemoryManager::SetLeakDetectionEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables memory leak detection for bot memory management.
  description: The SetLeakDetectionEnabled method controls whether memory leak detection
    is active within the BotMemoryManager. When enabled, the system will monitor and
    report potential memory leaks in bot-related allocations. This feature is typically
    used during development and debugging to identify memory issues in bot behavior
    and resource usage. The setting persists until explicitly changed, affecting all
    subsequent memory operations managed by this instance of BotMemoryManager.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Memory Leak Detection
    code: 'BotMemoryManager* manager = BotMemoryManager::Instance();

      manager->SetLeakDetectionEnabled(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Memory Leak Detection
    code: 'BotMemoryManager* manager = BotMemoryManager::Instance();

      manager->SetLeakDetectionEnabled(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the global memory leak detection state for all bots managed
    by this instance. Enabling it may introduce performance overhead during intensive
    bot operations. The feature is primarily intended for developers and debugging
    purposes.
  warnings: Enabling memory leak detection in production environments may cause performance
    degradation. This setting does not affect the actual memory allocation behavior,
    only the monitoring of potential leaks.
