  class: AfflictionWarlockRefactored
  method: AfflictionWarlockRefactored
  signature: void AfflictionWarlockRefactored::AfflictionWarlockRefactored(Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new Affliction Warlock bot instance with the specified player
    character.
  description: This constructor initializes an AfflictionWarlockRefactored AI class
    instance for a player character, setting up the bot's core functionality and behavior
    specific to the Affliction warlock specialization. The method configures the bot's
    spell selection, targeting logic, and combat strategies based on the Affliction
    talent tree and gameplay mechanics. It ensures that the bot is properly integrated
    into the TrinityCore AI system and ready to execute warlock-specific abilities
    such as Drain Soul, Corruption, and Unstable Affliction. This initialization process
    also sets up necessary internal state tracking for managing pet behavior, cooldowns,
    and resource management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Get player reference

      AfflictionWarlockRefactored warlockBot(bot);

      // Bot is now initialized and ready for AI processing'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The Player
    parameter must not be null, and the player must be a valid warlock character with
    the Affliction specialization. The method assumes that the TrinityCore AI system
    is properly initialized before calling.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor multiple times on the same object as it may
    lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks. Ensure that the Player pointer remains
    valid throughout the lifetime of the AfflictionWarlockRefactored instance.
