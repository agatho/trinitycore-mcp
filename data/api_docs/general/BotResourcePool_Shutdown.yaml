  method: Shutdown
  signature: void BotResourcePool::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the bot resource pool, releasing all allocated resources and cleaning
    up internal state.
  description: The Shutdown method is responsible for gracefully terminating the operation
    of a BotResourcePool instance. It ensures that all allocated resources such as
    memory, file handles, or network connections are properly released. This method
    typically clears internal data structures, stops any active threads, and performs
    necessary cleanup operations to prevent memory leaks or resource starvation. The
    shutdown process is essential for maintaining system stability when the bot system
    is being disabled or during server shutdown sequences.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'BotResourcePool* pool = new BotResourcePool();

      // ... initialize and use the pool ...

      pool->Shutdown();

      delete pool;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when no other threads are actively using
    the resource pool. Calling Shutdown while resources are still in use may result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. The method is typically invoked during server
    shutdown or when disabling bot functionality.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown on a pool that is currently being accessed by other threads
    can lead to race conditions and memory corruption. Always ensure exclusive access
    to the pool before invoking this method.
