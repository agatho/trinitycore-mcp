documentation:
  brief: Destroys the GuildMgr instance and performs cleanup operations for all managed
    guild data.
  description: The GuildMgr destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up all
    resources associated with the guild management system. When invoked, it ensures
    that all active guilds are properly terminated, memory allocated for guild data
    structures is released, and any pending operations related to guild management
    are completed or canceled. This method typically gets called automatically when
    a GuildMgr instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. The destructor
    plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the game's guild system by
    preventing memory leaks and ensuring proper shutdown of guild-related subsystems.

  - title: Automatic destruction of GuildMgr instance
    code: "void Cleanup() {\n    // GuildMgr instance goes out of scope\n    {\n \
      \       GuildMgr* guildMgr = new GuildMgr();\n        // ... use guildMgr ...\n\
      \    } // Destructor called here automatically\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called manually unless you have a specific reason
    to do so. It is typically invoked by the C++ runtime when an object goes out of
    scope or is explicitly deleted. The cleanup process may involve database transactions,
    memory deallocation, and notification of other subsystems about guild shutdown.
