documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the reputation value awarded for completing a given
    quest.
  description: The CalculateReputationValue method determines the amount of reputation
    points a player will gain upon completing a specific quest. This calculation takes
    into account various factors such as the quest's level, faction requirements,
    and any reputation modifiers defined within the quest's data. The returned float
    value represents the base reputation reward before any multipliers or bonuses
    from player traits, gear, or achievements are applied. This method is typically
    invoked during quest completion processing to update the player's reputation with
    the appropriate faction.
  parameters: []
  returns: A floating-point number representing the base reputation value awarded
    for completing the quest. This value may be positive or negative depending on
    whether the quest rewards or penalizes reputation with the associated faction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Quest Completion
    code: "void Player::OnQuestComplete(Quest const* quest)\n{\n    float repValue\
      \ = sObjectMgr->GetQuestManager()->CalculateReputationValue(quest);\n    ModifyFactionReputation(quest->GetFactionReputation(),\
      \ repValue);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not apply any player-specific multipliers or bonuses; it
    only returns the base reputation value as defined in the quest data. The actual
    reputation gain may be modified by factors such as player level, faction standing,
    and quest completion bonuses.
