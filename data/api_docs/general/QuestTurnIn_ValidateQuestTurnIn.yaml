  signature: bool QuestTurnIn::ValidateQuestTurnIn(Player * bot, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Validates if a player can turn in a specified quest
  description: The ValidateQuestTurnIn method checks whether a given player is eligible
    to turn in a specific quest. It evaluates various conditions such as quest completion
    status, required items, quest objectives, and player state to determine if the
    quest turn-in is valid. This method is typically used by the AI system or quest
    handling logic to ensure that a quest can be properly turned in before proceeding
    with reward distribution or quest advancement. The validation includes checking
    if the quest is active, if the player has met all prerequisites, and if the quest
    requirements are satisfied.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player attempting to
      turn in the quest
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest being turned in
  returns: Returns true if the quest can be successfully turned in by the player,
    false otherwise. The method returns false when the player does not meet the requirements
    for turning in the quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Turn-In Validation
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player object\nuint32 questId = 12345;\nif\
      \ (QuestTurnIn::ValidateQuestTurnIn(player, questId)) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ quest turn-in logic\n    player->CompleteQuest(questId);\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Handle invalid quest turn-in attempt\n    player->SendNotification(\"You cannot\
      \ turn in this quest at this time.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI quest handling system and should be called
    before attempting to process a quest turn-in. The validation includes checking
    quest state, item requirements, and player conditions. It's important to note
    that this method does not perform the actual quest turn-in; it only validates
    whether the turn-in is allowed.
  warnings: This method assumes that the player object and questId are valid. Passing
    null pointers or invalid quest IDs may lead to undefined behavior. The validation
    logic might vary depending on the specific quest type and its requirements.
