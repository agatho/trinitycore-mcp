api:
  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: SetCommunicationLevel
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::SetCommunicationLevel(uint32 groupId, uint32
    level)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the communication level for a specified group within the instance coordination
    system.
  description: The SetCommunicationLevel method configures the communication behavior
    between players in a specific group during instance encounters. This method is
    used to control how much information or interaction is allowed between group members,
    typically managing synchronization of events, loot distribution, or encounter
    mechanics. The groupId parameter identifies the target group, while the level
    parameter defines the communication rules that apply to that group. This functionality
    is crucial for maintaining proper game balance and preventing issues such as desynchronization
    or unfair advantages during group content.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: Unique identifier of the group for which to set the communication
      level. This value typically corresponds to a group's internal ID within the
      instance coordination system.
  - name: level
    description: The communication level to apply to the specified group. Valid values
      are implementation-specific but generally represent different tiers of interaction,
      such as no communication, basic coordination, or full synchronization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Communication Level for a Group
    code: 'InstanceCoordination* coord = sObjectAccessor->GetInstanceCoordination();

      coord->SetCommunicationLevel(12345, 2); // Sets group 12345 to level 2 communication'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal game state tracking and may affect
    how instance events are processed or synchronized. It is recommended to call this
    method only when necessary, as frequent changes could impact performance during
    active encounters.
