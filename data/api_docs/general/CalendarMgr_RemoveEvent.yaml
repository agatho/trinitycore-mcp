  method: RemoveEvent
  signature: void CalendarMgr::RemoveEvent(CalendarEvent * calendarEvent, int remover)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a calendar event from the calendar manager and notifies affected
    players.
  description: The RemoveEvent method removes a specified calendar event from the
    calendar manager's internal data structures. It handles the cleanup of event references,
    updates related player invitations, and broadcasts removal notifications to all
    involved parties. This method ensures that the calendar system remains consistent
    after an event is deleted. The remover parameter indicates which entity (player
    or system) initiated the removal, affecting how notifications are formatted and
    who receives them. The method does not validate whether the calendarEvent pointer
    is valid before attempting removal, so callers should ensure proper null checking.
  parameters:
  - name: calendarEvent
    description: Pointer to the CalendarEvent object that needs to be removed from
      the system. Must not be null or an invalid memory address.
  - name: remover
    description: Identifier indicating who initiated the removal of the event. Typically
      represents a player GUID or system identifier. Used for notification purposes
      and determining access rights.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Removal
    code: "CalendarEvent* myEvent = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(12345);\nif (myEvent)\n\
      {\n    sCalendarMgr->RemoveEvent(myEvent, player->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: System-initiated Event Removal
    code: "CalendarEvent* systemEvent = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(98765);\nif (systemEvent)\n\
      {\n    sCalendarMgr->RemoveEvent(systemEvent, 0); // System remover\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the calendarEvent parameter is valid and properly
    initialized. It does not perform any validation on the event's existence in the
    manager before attempting removal. The actual removal process may involve multiple
    internal steps including database updates, packet sends to players, and cleanup
    of associated data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null or invalid calendarEvent pointer will
    likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify that the event exists
    and is valid before calling RemoveEvent. Be cautious when removing events that
    have active invitations or ongoing participation from players.
