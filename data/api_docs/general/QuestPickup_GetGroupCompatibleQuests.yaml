  class: QuestPickup
  method: GetGroupCompatibleQuests
  signature: int QuestPickup::GetGroupCompatibleQuests(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of quests compatible with the specified group for pickup.
  description: The GetGroupCompatibleQuests method determines how many quests from
    the current quest pickup object are compatible with the given group. This is typically
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to check which quests can be offered to
    a player or group based on their level, quest requirements, and other conditions.
    The method evaluates each quest in the pickup list against the group's members
    to ensure compatibility before counting them. It returns an integer representing
    the total number of compatible quests that can be picked up by the group.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the count of quests in the current quest
    pickup object that are compatible with the specified group. Returns zero if no
    compatible quests exist or if the group is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check group compatibility
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nint compatibleQuests = questPickup->GetGroupCompatibleQuests(group);\n\
      if (compatibleQuests > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with quest pickup logic\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Found %d compatible quests for the group.\", compatibleQuests);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal quest compatibility checks that consider player
    levels, quest flags, and group member conditions. It should only be called when
    a valid group is present to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid Group pointer may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure the group exists and has members before invoking this
    function.
