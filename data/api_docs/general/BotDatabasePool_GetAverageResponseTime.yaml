  class: BotDatabasePool
  method: GetAverageResponseTime
  signature: uint32 BotDatabasePool::GetAverageResponseTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the average response time of database queries executed
    by the bot database pool.
  description: The GetAverageResponseTime method computes the average duration (in
    milliseconds) that database operations take to complete within the bot database
    pool. This metric is useful for monitoring performance and identifying potential
    bottlenecks in database interactions. The value is typically updated periodically
    as queries are executed and their timing information is collected. This method
    does not modify any internal state but provides a read-only view of the current
    average response time across all tracked operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the average database query response
    time in milliseconds. A return value of 0 may indicate no queries have been executed
    or timing data is not yet available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 avgTime = botDatabasePool.GetAverageResponseTime();

      TC_LOG_INFO("bot", "Average database response time: {} ms", avgTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring
    code: "void MonitorBotDatabasePerformance()\n{\n    uint32 avgTime = botDatabasePool.GetAverageResponseTime();\n\
      \    if (avgTime > 1000) // 1 second threshold\n    {\n        TC_LOG_WARN(\"\
      bot\", \"High database latency detected: {} ms\", avgTime);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal timing mechanisms that track query execution
    times. The accuracy of the returned value depends on how frequently timing data
    is updated and stored. The implementation may use a moving average or similar
    statistical approach to maintain an up-to-date metric.
