  class: InterruptRotationManager
  method: ScheduleDelayedInterrupt
  signature: void InterruptRotationManager::ScheduleDelayedInterrupt(int bot, int
    target, uint32 spellId, uint32 delayMs)
documentation:
  brief: Schedules a delayed interrupt for a bot targeting a specific spell.
  description: The ScheduleDelayedInterrupt method sets up a timed interrupt action
    for a specified bot character, targeting a particular spell on a given target.
    This functionality is typically used in AI-driven gameplay scenarios where bots
    need to perform actions with a delay, such as casting interrupts or applying debuffs
    after a certain time period. The method schedules the interrupt to occur after
    the specified delay, allowing for more complex and realistic bot behavior patterns.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: The identifier of the bot character that will perform the interrupt
      action. This is typically a unique identifier or index within the game's AI
      system.
  - name: target
    description: The identifier of the target character on which the interrupt will
      be applied. This can represent any valid in-game entity such as players, NPCs,
      or creatures.
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell that will be interrupted. This
      corresponds to a specific spell entry in the game's database.
  - name: delayMs
    description: The delay time in milliseconds before the interrupt action is executed.
      This determines how long the bot waits before performing the interrupt.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: InterruptRotationManager::ScheduleDelayedInterrupt(123, 456, 789, 2000);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Variable Delay
    code: 'uint32 delay = 3000 + urand(0, 1000);

      InterruptRotationManager::ScheduleDelayedInterrupt(botId, targetId, spellId,
      delay);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates asynchronously and relies on the game's internal timer
    system. The actual execution of the interrupt will occur at or near the scheduled
    time, but may be subject to minor timing variations due to server load or other
    factors. Ensure that all identifiers are valid before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid bot or target identifiers can lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. Make sure that the spellId corresponds to a valid
    interrupt spell in the game database. The delay value should be non-negative and
    reasonable for gameplay purposes.
