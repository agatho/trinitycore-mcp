  method: InitializeForGroup
  signature: void BotPacketRelay::InitializeForGroup(Player * bot, Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot packet relay system for a specified bot and group
  description: The InitializeForGroup method sets up the packet relay mechanism that
    allows a bot player to communicate with its group members through the TrinityCore
    server. This method establishes the necessary connections and configurations required
    for the bot to receive and send packets within the context of a specific group.
    It typically initializes internal data structures and registers the bot with the
    group's packet handling system, ensuring proper synchronization and communication
    between the bot and its group members.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will be initialized
      for group communication
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group the bot will be
      associated with for packet relay purposes
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Group Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Bot player instance

      Group* myGroup = ...; // Group instance

      BotPacketRelay relay;

      relay.InitializeForGroup(myBot, myGroup);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Bot in a Group Context
    code: "void SetupBotGroup(Player* bot, Group* group)\n{\n    if (bot && group)\n\
      \    {\n        BotPacketRelay relay;\n        relay.InitializeForGroup(bot,\
      \ group);\n        // Bot is now ready to communicate with group members\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after the bot has been properly added to the
    group but before any packet communication occurs. The method assumes that both
    the bot and group parameters are valid and non-null pointers.
  warnings: Calling this method with null pointers will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the bot player is actually part of the specified
    group before initialization.
