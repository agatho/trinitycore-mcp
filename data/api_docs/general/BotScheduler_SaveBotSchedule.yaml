documentation:
  brief: Saves the current bot schedule state to persistent storage
  description: The SaveBotSchedule method serializes and stores the current state
    of the bot scheduler's schedule configuration. This includes all active bots,
    their assigned schedules, time slots, and operational parameters. The method ensures
    that scheduled bot activities persist across server restarts or maintenance periods.
    It typically interacts with the database to update schedule records and may trigger
    notifications to affected players or administrators about schedule changes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Schedule Saving
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler;

      BotScheduleState state = scheduler.GetScheduleState();

      scheduler.SaveBotSchedule(state);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database I/O operations which may impact performance
    during high-traffic periods. It should be called sparingly and ideally during
    maintenance windows or when schedule changes are confirmed. The implementation
    may use transactional database updates to ensure data consistency.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the BotScheduleState
    parameter may result in corrupted schedule data. Ensure that all bot schedules
    are properly validated before saving to prevent runtime errors or inconsistent
    scheduling behavior.
