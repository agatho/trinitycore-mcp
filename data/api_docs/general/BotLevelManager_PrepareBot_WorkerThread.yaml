  signature: void BotLevelManager::PrepareBot_WorkerThread(std::shared_ptr<BotCreationTask>
    task)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a bot creation task in a worker thread, preparing the bot for spawning.
  description: The PrepareBot_WorkerThread method is responsible for executing the
    core logic of bot preparation within a dedicated worker thread. It takes a shared
    pointer to a BotCreationTask object and performs all necessary operations to initialize
    and configure the bot before it can be spawned into the game world. This includes
    setting up character attributes, inventory, skills, and other essential properties
    based on the task's configuration. The method is designed to run asynchronously
    to prevent blocking the main thread and ensure smooth gameplay performance. It
    typically handles database interactions, data validation, and state transitions
    required for bot creation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'std::shared_ptr<BotCreationTask> task = std::make_shared<BotCreationTask>(playerGuid,
      botClass);

      botLevelManager->PrepareBot_WorkerThread(task);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended to be called from a thread pool or worker thread
    context. It should not be invoked directly from the main game loop to avoid potential
    performance issues. The method assumes that the BotCreationTask has been properly
    initialized with valid parameters before being passed in.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from the main game thread as it may cause
    performance degradation or deadlocks. Ensure that the BotCreationTask parameter
    is valid and fully initialized before passing it to this method.
