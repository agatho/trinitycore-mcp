  method: SmartGameObjectAI
  signature: void SmartGameObjectAI::SmartGameObjectAI(GameObject * go, uint32 scriptId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a SmartGameObjectAI instance with the provided GameObject and
    script ID.
  description: The SmartGameObjectAI constructor initializes the AI behavior for a
    GameObject by storing references to the GameObject itself and its associated script
    ID. This method sets up the internal state required for smart AI functionality,
    allowing the GameObject to respond to events and execute scripted behaviors. The
    initialization process typically occurs when a GameObject is spawned or loaded
    into the game world, ensuring that the AI system can properly manage the object's
    interactions with players and other game entities. The script ID determines which
    specific script logic will be executed by the AI system.
  parameters:
  - name: go
    description: Pointer to the GameObject instance this AI will control. Must not
      be null.
  - name: scriptId
    description: Unique identifier for the script associated with this GameObject.
      Used to determine which AI behaviors and events should be triggered.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic SmartGameObjectAI Initialization
    code: 'SmartGameObjectAI* ai = new SmartGameObjectAI(gameObj, 12345);

      // This creates a new AI instance for the game object with script ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing AI During GameObject Creation
    code: "void OnSpawn(GameObject* go) {\n    uint32 scriptId = go->GetScriptId();\n\
      \    new SmartGameObjectAI(go, scriptId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when a GameObject with an associated smart script is created. The AI instance
    will automatically register itself with the smart script system and begin listening
    for relevant events. Developers should not manually instantiate SmartGameObjectAI
    objects unless implementing custom AI logic or extending existing functionality.
  warnings: Never call this constructor directly on already initialized GameObjects,
    as it may cause memory leaks or duplicate AI instances. Always ensure that the
    GameObject pointer is valid and that the script ID corresponds to an existing
    smart script definition in the database.
