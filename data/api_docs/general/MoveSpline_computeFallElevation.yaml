  class: MoveSpline
  method: computeFallElevation
  signature: void MoveSpline::computeFallElevation(int32 time_point, float & el) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the elevation change during a fall animation at a given time point.
  description: The computeFallElevation method determines the vertical displacement
    (elevation) of a falling object or character at a specific time point within a
    spline-based movement animation. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with movement splines to accurately simulate gravity-assisted falling behavior
    in World of Warcraft's physics engine. It takes into account the current spline's
    fall parameters, such as initial velocity and gravitational acceleration, to compute
    the precise vertical position at the specified time. The result is stored in the
    provided float reference parameter 'el'. This method is part of the MoveSpline
    class which handles complex movement animations including jumps, falls, and other
    non-linear motion paths.
  parameters:
  - name: time_point
    description: The time point (in milliseconds) at which to compute the fall elevation.
      This represents the elapsed time since the start of the fall animation.
  - name: el
    description: Reference to a float where the computed elevation value will be stored.
      This represents the vertical displacement from the starting height at the given
      time point.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of computeFallElevation
    code: 'MoveSpline spline;

      int32 currentTime = 500; // 500ms into the fall

      float elevation;

      spline.computeFallElevation(currentTime, elevation);

      // elevation now contains the vertical position at 500ms'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using computeFallElevation in a movement update loop
    code: "void UpdateMovement()\n{\n    MoveSpline spline;\n    int32 elapsedTime\
      \ = GetElapsedTime();\n    float currentElevation;\n    spline.computeFallElevation(elapsedTime,\
      \ currentElevation);\n    // Apply elevation to character position\n    SetPosition(GetX(),\
      \ GetY(), currentElevation);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the movement system during
    animation updates. The time_point parameter should be within the valid range of
    the spline's fall duration. The method assumes that the MoveSpline object has
    been properly initialized with fall parameters before calling this function.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the MoveSpline object
    may result in undefined behavior or incorrect elevation calculations. Ensure that
    the spline contains valid fall data before invoking computeFallElevation.
