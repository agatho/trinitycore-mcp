  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: Update
  signature: void CombatBehaviorIntegration::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the combat behavior integration state based on elapsed time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and maintaining the
    current state of combat behaviors within the TrinityCore framework. It typically
    handles AI decision-making, action execution, and state transitions based on the
    time delta provided. This method is called regularly by the game loop to ensure
    that combat behaviors remain synchronized with the passage of time and current
    game conditions. The implementation may involve checking for target validity,
    updating cooldowns, managing spell casting queues, or triggering behavior-specific
    logic.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time delta in milliseconds since the last update call. This value
      is used to determine how much time has passed and influences timing-sensitive
      behaviors such as spell cooldowns, attack timing, and AI decision intervals.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void SomeAI::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    combatBehaviorIntegration.Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Update with Additional Logic
    code: "void CombatAI::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n    {\n\
      \        combatBehaviorIntegration.Update(diff);\n        // Additional AI logic\
      \ here\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game loop or AI update routines.
    It's important to ensure that diff values are accurate and consistent for proper
    behavior timing. The method should be lightweight to avoid performance degradation
    in combat scenarios.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly without ensuring valid game context,
    as it may rely on internal state variables that are only properly initialized
    during normal gameplay flow.
