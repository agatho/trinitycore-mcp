  class: OutdoorPvP
  method: SendRemoveWorldStates
  signature: void OutdoorPvP::SendRemoveWorldStates(Player * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a message to remove world states for the specified player in the OutdoorPvP
    system.
  description: The SendRemoveWorldStates method is responsible for removing specific
    world states from a player's client interface when they are no longer part of
    an OutdoorPvP zone or when the PvP zone state changes. This method ensures that
    visual indicators, such as flags, timers, or other UI elements related to the
    OutdoorPvP zone are properly cleared from the player's screen. It is typically
    invoked during zone transitions, player logout, or when the OutdoorPvP zone becomes
    inactive. The method operates on a single Player object and sends the appropriate
    network packets to update the client-side world state information.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A pointer to the Player object for whom the world states should be
      removed. This parameter must not be null, as attempting to send world state
      removals to a null player will result in undefined behavior or crashes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing World States for a Player
    code: "void RemovePlayerFromOutdoorPvP(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player && outdoorPvPZone)\n\
      \    {\n        outdoorPvPZone->SendRemoveWorldStates(player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing World States During Zone Transition
    code: "void HandlePlayerEnterZone(Player* player, OutdoorPvP* oldZone)\n{\n  \
      \  if (oldZone)\n    {\n        oldZone->SendRemoveWorldStates(player);\n  \
      \  }\n    // Proceed with new zone logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core OutdoorPvP system and should only be called
    when a player's presence in an OutdoorPvP zone is no longer valid. It directly
    manipulates client-side UI elements and must be used carefully to avoid visual
    glitches or inconsistencies in the game world.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null Player pointer will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that all Player pointers are validated before invoking
    this method. Additionally, calling this method outside of appropriate OutdoorPvP
    state transitions may result in incorrect UI states for players.
