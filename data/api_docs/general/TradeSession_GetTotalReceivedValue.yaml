  signature: uint64 TradeSession::GetTotalReceivedValue() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total value of items received in the trade session.
  description: The GetTotalReceivedValue method computes the cumulative monetary value
    of all items that have been accepted by the player in the current trade session.
    This value is typically used to determine the worth of goods being traded, especially
    when calculating refunds or balancing trades between players. The method aggregates
    item values based on their vendor prices or market rates within the game's economy
    system. It does not include any gold pieces that may have been offered directly
    as part of the trade.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the total monetary worth of all items received
    in this trade session, expressed in copper coins (the base currency unit in World
    of Warcraft).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Trade Value
    code: 'TradeSession* session = player->GetTradeData();

      uint64 totalValue = session->GetTotalReceivedValue();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("trade", "Total received value: %u copper", totalValue);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only accounts for items that have been successfully accepted
    into the trade window. Items that are still pending or rejected will not contribute
    to the returned value. The calculation may involve complex item valuation logic
    depending on whether items are bound, stackable, or have special properties.
