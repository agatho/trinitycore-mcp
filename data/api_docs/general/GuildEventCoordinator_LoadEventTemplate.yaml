documentation:
  brief: Loads and returns a guild event template by its name.
  description: The LoadEventTemplate method retrieves a pre-defined guild event template
    from the system based on the provided template name. This function is typically
    used during guild event initialization or when creating new guild events that
    should adhere to a specific predefined structure. The returned GuildEvent object
    contains all the configuration data, timing information, and rules associated
    with the specified template. It's important to note that this method assumes the
    template exists; otherwise, it may return an invalid or default event object.
  parameters:
  - name: templateName
    description: The unique identifier string for the guild event template to be loaded.
      This name must match exactly with a predefined template in the system's database
      or configuration files.
  returns: A GuildEvent object representing the loaded template. If the template is
    not found, this method may return an invalid or default GuildEvent object, which
    should be checked for validity before use.
  examples:
  - title: Load a standard guild raid event template
    code: "GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;\nstd::string templateName = \"WeeklyRaidTemplate\"\
      ;\nGuildEvent event = coordinator.LoadEventTemplate(templateName);\nif (event.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with event usage\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handle potential invalid template loading
    code: "GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;\nGuildEvent event = coordinator.LoadEventTemplate(\"\
      NonExistentTemplate\");\nif (!event.IsValid()) {\n    // Log error or handle\
      \ missing template case\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to load guild event template:\
      \ NonExistentTemplate\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using internal caching mechanisms to avoid
    repeated database lookups. The template names are expected to be case-sensitive
    and must exactly match entries in the system's event template registry. Performance-wise,
    subsequent calls with the same template name will be faster due to caching.
  warnings: Calling this method with a non-existent template name may result in an
    invalid GuildEvent object that could cause runtime errors if not properly validated
    before use. Always check the validity of the returned object before attempting
    to utilize it.
