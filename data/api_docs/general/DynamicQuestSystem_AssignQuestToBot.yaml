  method: AssignQuestToBot
  signature: bool DynamicQuestSystem::AssignQuestToBot(uint32 questId, Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns a specified quest to a bot player within the dynamic quest system.
  description: The AssignQuestToBot method is responsible for assigning a specific
    quest to a given bot player in the TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft emulation
    environment. This function integrates with the dynamic quest system to manage
    quest distribution and tracking for automated player characters (bots). It ensures
    that the quest state is properly initialized for the bot, including updating relevant
    quest tables and notifying the game engine of the new assignment. The method performs
    validation checks on both the quest ID and the bot player reference before proceeding
    with the assignment process.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to be assigned to the bot. Must
      correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will receive
      the quest. Must be a valid player instance and must be registered as a bot within
      the system.
  returns: Returns true if the quest was successfully assigned to the bot, or false
    if the assignment failed due to invalid parameters, missing quest data, or other
    internal errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Assignment
    code: "uint32 questId = 12345;\nPlayer* bot = ...; // Valid bot player reference\n\
      bool success = dynamicQuestSystem.AssignQuestToBot(questId, bot);\nif (success)\n\
      {\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"playerbots\", \"Quest %u assigned to bot successfully.\"\
      , questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Quest Assignment with Error Handling
    code: "uint32 questId = 12345;\nPlayer* bot = ...; // Valid bot player reference\n\
      if (bot && bot->IsInWorld())\n{\n    bool success = dynamicQuestSystem.AssignQuestToBot(questId,\
      \ bot);\n    if (!success)\n    {\n        TC_LOG_ERROR(\"playerbots\", \"Failed\
      \ to assign quest %u to bot %s.\", questId, bot->GetName().c_str());\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot player has already been initialized and
    is properly registered within the dynamic quest system. The assignment process
    may involve updating internal quest tracking structures and potentially triggering
    quest-related events or callbacks in the game engine.
  warnings: Ensure that the quest ID exists in the database and that the bot player
    reference is valid before calling this method. Passing invalid parameters can
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes within the dynamic quest system.
