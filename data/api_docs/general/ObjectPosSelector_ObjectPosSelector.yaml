  class: ObjectPosSelector
  method: ObjectPosSelector
  signature: void ObjectPosSelector::ObjectPosSelector(float x, float y, float size,
    float dist)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an ObjectPosSelector with specified position, size, and distance
    parameters for object placement calculations.
  description: The ObjectPosSelector constructor initializes a selector used for calculating
    valid positions around a given point. This class is typically employed in game
    mechanics where objects need to be placed in a circular area around a central
    location, such as during spell effects, creature spawning, or loot distribution.
    It takes into account the size of the object being positioned and the distance
    from the center point to determine valid placement coordinates. The selector maintains
    internal state for calculating positions based on angular distribution and collision
    detection.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the center point around which objects will be
      positioned
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the center point around which objects will be
      positioned
  - name: size
    description: The size (radius) of the object being positioned, used for collision
      calculations and spacing
  - name: dist
    description: The maximum distance from the center point to consider for valid
      object placement positions
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize ObjectPosSelector for spell effect
    code: 'ObjectPosSelector selector(100.0f, 200.0f, 2.0f, 15.0f);

      // Used to calculate positions for area-of-effect spell targets around position
      (100, 200)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialize ObjectPosSelector for creature spawning
    code: 'float centerX = player->GetPositionX();

      float centerY = player->GetPositionY();

      ObjectPosSelector selector(centerX, centerY, 1.5f, 10.0f);

      // Used to find valid spawn positions around player for summoned creatures'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a constructor method that initializes the internal state of the ObjectPosSelector
    object. The class likely maintains an internal array or list of calculated angles
    and positions that are used during subsequent calls to GetNextPos() or similar
    methods. The size parameter affects collision detection, while dist determines
    the search radius for valid positions.
  warnings: The constructor does not validate input parameters. Invalid values for
    x, y, size, or dist may lead to unexpected behavior in position calculations.
    Ensure that size and dist are positive values to avoid division by zero or negative
    radius issues.
