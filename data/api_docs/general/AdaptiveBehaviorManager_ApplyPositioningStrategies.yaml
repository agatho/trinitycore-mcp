  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: ApplyPositioningStrategies
  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::ApplyPositioningStrategies(CombatSituation
    situation)
documentation:
  brief: Applies positioning strategies based on the current combat situation to adjust
    NPC behavior.
  description: The ApplyPositioningStrategies method evaluates the provided CombatSituation
    and applies appropriate positioning behaviors to the AI-controlled unit. This
    includes adjusting movement patterns, distance management, and positioning relative
    to targets or allies. The method is typically invoked during combat decision-making
    processes to ensure optimal tactical positioning. It modifies internal state variables
    that influence how the NPC moves and interacts with its environment. The behavior
    applied depends on factors such as target proximity, threat level, and available
    cover.
  parameters:
  - name: situation
    description: The current combat situation enum that determines which positioning
      strategies to apply. This parameter defines the tactical context for positioning
      decisions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n    {\n\
      \        CombatSituation situation = GetCombatSituation();\n        adaptiveBehaviorManager.ApplyPositioningStrategies(situation);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the adaptive AI system and should be called regularly
    during combat updates. It modifies internal positioning state and may affect movement
    speed or pathfinding behavior. The method assumes that CombatSituation has been
    properly evaluated before calling.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid CombatSituation parameter may result
    in undefined behavior. Ensure that the situation is updated before invoking this
    method to avoid stale positioning decisions.
