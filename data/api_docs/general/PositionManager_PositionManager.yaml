  class: PositionManager
  method: PositionManager
  signature: void PositionManager::PositionManager(Player * bot, BotThreatManager
    * threatManager)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a PositionManager instance with the specified bot player and
    threat manager.
  description: The PositionManager constructor initializes a new instance of the PositionManager
    class, associating it with a specific bot player and its corresponding threat
    manager. This setup is essential for managing positional data and threat calculations
    within the bot's AI system. The method configures internal references to both
    the player object and the threat manager, enabling accurate position tracking
    and threat assessment during combat scenarios. The initialization process ensures
    that all subsequent position-based operations have access to the necessary contextual
    information about the bot's current state and surrounding threats.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which this
      position manager is being created. Must be a valid player instance, typically
      representing an AI-controlled character in the game world.
  - name: threatManager
    description: Pointer to the BotThreatManager object responsible for tracking threat
      levels and managing combat-related threat data for the bot. This parameter must
      not be null and should correspond to the same bot instance provided in the 'bot'
      parameter.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic PositionManager Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get reference to bot player

      BotThreatManager* threatMgr = ...; // Get reference to threat manager

      PositionManager posMgr(myBot, threatMgr); // Initialize position manager'
    language: cpp
  - title: PositionManager in Bot AI Context
    code: "class BotAI {\nprivate:\n    PositionManager positionManager;\npublic:\n\
      \    BotAI(Player* bot, BotThreatManager* threatMgr) : positionManager(bot,\
      \ threatMgr) {}\n    // Other AI methods using positionManager\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during bot initialization or when a
    new bot instance is created. The PositionManager relies on the provided Player
    and BotThreatManager objects remaining valid throughout the lifetime of the PositionManager
    instance. It's important to ensure that both parameters are properly initialized
    before calling this constructor to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing null pointers for either parameter will likely result in crashes
    or undefined behavior. The bot and threat manager must be valid instances that
    correspond to the same AI character. Avoid creating multiple PositionManager instances
    for the same bot without proper cleanup, as this could lead to memory leaks or
    inconsistent state management.
