  signature: void GroupFormation::PerformFormationSmoothing()
documentation:
  brief: Performs smoothing of group member positions to maintain formation during
    movement.
  description: The PerformFormationSmoothing method adjusts the positions of group
    members to ensure they maintain a consistent formation while moving. This method
    is typically invoked during group movement updates to prevent individual players
    from straying too far from their designated formation positions. It calculates
    optimal positioning based on the group's current state and member roles, applying
    corrections to maintain cohesion. The method operates on the group's internal
    formation data structure and modifies member positions in-place without requiring
    external input.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Group Update Loop
    code: "void Group::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    PerformFormationSmoothing();\n\
      \    // ... continue with other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the group management system
    during movement updates. It should not be invoked manually unless implementing
    custom group behavior. The smoothing algorithm considers factors such as player
    speed, distance from leader, and formation type to determine optimal positioning.
  warnings: Invoking this method outside of the normal update cycle may cause unexpected
    behavior or position desynchronization. Do not call this method during combat
    or high-frequency updates without proper throttling.
