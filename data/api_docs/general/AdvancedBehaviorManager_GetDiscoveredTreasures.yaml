documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of discovered treasures associated with the advanced behavior
    manager.
  description: The GetDiscoveredTreasures method retrieves the total number of treasures
    that have been discovered within the context of the AdvancedBehaviorManager. This
    method is typically used in World of Warcraft AI scripting to track player progress
    or quest completion related to treasure hunting mechanics. The returned value
    represents a cumulative count and may be influenced by various game states such
    as player exploration, quest status, or specific behavior triggers. The method
    does not modify any internal state and is safe for repeated calls.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of discovered treasures. A return value
    of zero indicates no treasures have been discovered, while positive values indicate
    the count of discovered items.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Treasure Count
    code: "int discoveredCount = behaviorManager->GetDiscoveredTreasures();\nif (discoveredCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Player has found some treasures\n    printf(\"Player has discovered\
      \ %d treasures\\n\", discoveredCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger treasure discovery system and may
    be used in conjunction with other behavior manager methods to control AI decision-making
    based on player progress. The implementation should be thread-safe if accessed
    from multiple contexts.
