documentation:
  brief: Initializes a SpellPeriodicAuraLogInfo object with aura effect and damage
    details for periodic aura logging.
  description: The SpellPeriodicAuraLogInfo constructor initializes a structure used
    to log information about periodic aura effects in World of Warcraft. This includes
    damage values, absorption, resistance, and critical hit status. The structure
    is typically used by the TrinityCore server to track and report periodic aura
    events such as DoT (damage over time) or HoT (heal over time) effects. It aggregates
    data from an AuraEffect object along with various damage metrics to provide a
    complete picture of the aura's impact on the target.
  parameters:
  - name: _auraEff
    description: Pointer to the AuraEffect object that triggered this periodic log
      entry. Must not be null.
  - name: _damage
    description: The actual damage amount dealt by the periodic aura effect.
  - name: _originalDamage
    description: The original damage amount before any modifiers or reductions.
  - name: _overDamage
    description: The amount of damage that exceeded the target's health (if applicable).
  - name: _absorb
    description: Amount of damage absorbed by protective effects such as spell shields
      or damage reduction auras.
  - name: _resist
    description: Amount of damage resisted due to target's resistance or immunity.
  - name: _multiplier
    description: Damage multiplier applied to the base aura effect (e.g., from critical
      strikes or buffs).
  - name: _critical
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether this periodic aura hit was a critical
      strike.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Aura Application
    code: 'SpellPeriodicAuraLogInfo logInfo(auraEffect, damage, originalDamage, overDamage,
      absorb, resist, multiplier, isCritical);

      // Used to log periodic aura effects like Shadow Word: Pain or Holy Nova

      // This structure would then be passed to logging or reporting systems'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by TrinityCore's aura system
    when processing periodic effects. The parameters should reflect the actual computed
    values from the spell and target interaction, including all applicable modifiers,
    resistances, and absorption effects.
