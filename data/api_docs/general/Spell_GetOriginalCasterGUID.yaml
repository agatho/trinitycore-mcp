documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the original caster who initiated the spell
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of the entity that
    originally triggered the spell, which may differ from the current caster if the
    spell was redirected or modified during execution. The method is commonly used
    in spell handling to track the source of effects and maintain proper game mechanics
    such as aura tracking and combat logging. It ensures accurate identification of
    the initiating entity for various gameplay scenarios including pet summoning,
    spell redirection, and player-based spell effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the GUID of the original caster, which
    can be used to identify the source of the spell in game mechanics and combat logging.
    The value may represent different types of entities such as players, pets, or
    NPCs depending on the context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: int originalCasterGUID = spell->GetOriginalCasterGUID();
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method typically returns a GUID value that
    is stored in the spell''s internal data structure. It should be used carefully
    when dealing with spell redirection or when checking for original caster information
    during spell processing.'
  warnings: This method may return different values depending on how the spell was
    initiated; it's important to understand that the original caster might not always
    be the same as the current caster, especially in cases involving spell redirection
    or pet summoning.
