  class: AllFriendlyCreaturesInGrid
  method: AllFriendlyCreaturesInGrid
  signature: void AllFriendlyCreaturesInGrid::AllFriendlyCreaturesInGrid(const int
    * obj)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and processes all friendly creatures within the grid of the specified
    object.
  description: The AllFriendlyCreaturesInGrid method searches through the game grid
    surrounding a given object to locate all creatures that are considered friendly
    (non-hostile) to that object. This method is typically used in AI behavior systems
    where NPCs need to identify nearby allies or non-threatening entities for decision-making
    purposes. The method iterates through the creature list in the grid and applies
    specific logic to filter out hostile creatures, focusing only on those that are
    either neutral or allied with the reference object. It's commonly employed in
    pathfinding, group coordination, and threat assessment systems within TrinityCore's
    AI framework.
  parameters:
  - name: obj
    description: Pointer to an object (typically a Creature or Unit) used as the reference
      point for grid search. The method will find all friendly creatures within the
      same grid cell(s) as this object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override {\n        if (Creature* target = me->SelectNearestTarget(50.0f))\
      \ {\n            // Find friendly creatures around the target\n            AllFriendlyCreaturesInGrid\
      \ friendlyList;\n            friendlyList.AllFriendlyCreaturesInGrid(&target);\n\
      \            // Process the list of friendly creatures\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the TrinityCore's grid-based spatial partitioning
    system. The object parameter must be a valid Creature or Unit instance, otherwise
    behavior is undefined. Performance can be affected by the number of creatures
    in the grid cell(s) being searched.
  warnings: Using an invalid pointer for the obj parameter will cause undefined behavior
    and likely crash the server. This method should not be called from within a grid
    traversal loop to avoid potential infinite recursion or stack overflow.
