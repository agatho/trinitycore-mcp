  signature: bool InterruptUtils::IsSpellInterruptible(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified spell can be interrupted by incoming damage
    or other interruptible effects.
  description: The IsSpellInterruptible method checks if a given spell ID is eligible
    to be interrupted by external effects such as damage, movement, or other interrupt
    triggers. This utility function is commonly used in spell handling logic within
    TrinityCore's core systems to determine whether a spell's casting can be disrupted.
    It evaluates the spell's properties and flags to decide if it supports interruption
    mechanics. The method does not validate the existence of the spell ID directly
    but relies on internal spell data structures that define interruptible behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell is interruptible, false otherwise.
    A return value of true indicates that the spell can be interrupted by effects
    like damage or movement during its casting phase.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a Spell is Interruptible
    code: "if (InterruptUtils::IsSpellInterruptible(12345)) {\n    // Spell can be\
      \ interrupted\n    // Perform interrupt-related logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in Spell Casting Logic
    code: "void OnSpellCast(Spell* spell) {\n    if (InterruptUtils::IsSpellInterruptible(spell->m_spellInfo->Id))\
      \ {\n        // Apply interruptible behavior\n        spell->SetCanInterrupt(true);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Spell is not interruptible\n        spell->SetCanInterrupt(false);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spell flag definitions and may vary based
    on custom spell modifications or core patches. It should be used carefully in
    performance-critical code paths as it accesses spell data structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell ID passed to this method is valid and exists in
    the spell database, otherwise behavior may be undefined. This function does not
    perform spell existence validation internally.
