  method: isLooted
  signature: bool Loot::isLooted() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the loot has been previously opened and claimed by players.
  description: The isLooted() method checks the internal state of a Loot object to
    determine if it has already been looted. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, loot
    objects are created when an enemy is defeated or a container is opened. Once any
    player claims items from this loot, the loot is marked as looted and subsequent
    attempts to loot it will fail. This method returns true if the loot has been claimed
    by at least one player, and false otherwise. The method is commonly used in loot
    processing logic to prevent duplicate item distribution or to update the game
    state accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the loot has been looted (i.e., items have been claimed
    by players), and false if no items have been claimed yet.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Loot is Already Claimed
    code: "if (loot->isLooted()) {\n    // Handle case where loot has already been\
      \ claimed\n    SendLootAlreadyClaimedMessage(player);\n} else {\n    // Allow\
      \ player to loot items\n    player->SendLoot(loot);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other loot-related functions
    such as AddItem(), GetLoot(), and ClearLoot(). It's important to note that a loot
    object may be marked as looted even if the items were not actually distributed
    due to game rules (e.g., group loot where no one in the group has permission).
