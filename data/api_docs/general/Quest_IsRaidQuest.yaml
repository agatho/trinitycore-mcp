documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a quest is classified as a raid quest based on its difficulty.
  description: The IsRaidQuest method checks if a given quest is designated as a raid
    quest by examining its difficulty level. This method is commonly used in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to distinguish between normal and raid content,
    particularly for quests that are intended for group play or require higher difficulty
    levels. The function returns true when the quest is categorized as a raid quest,
    indicating it should be handled according to raid-specific rules or requirements.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest is classified as a raid quest based on its difficulty
    level; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (quest->IsRaidQuest(Difficulty::NORMAL_10))\n{\n    // Handle raid-specific\
      \ quest logic\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle normal quest logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal quest data structures and may not be directly
    accessible in all contexts. It is typically used within the context of quest handling
    and game mechanics.
  warnings: The method might not behave as expected if the quest's difficulty level
    is not properly set or if it's not correctly categorized as a raid quest.
