  class: BotPriorityManager
  method: UpdatePriorityForBot
  signature: void BotPriorityManager::UpdatePriorityForBot(Player * bot, uint32 currentTime)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the priority level for a specified bot based on current game conditions
    and time.
  description: The UpdatePriorityForBot method adjusts the priority assigned to a
    specific player bot within the TrinityCore system. This function is typically
    invoked during game loop updates to ensure that bots are prioritized appropriately
    according to their role, activity, or strategic importance. It takes into account
    the current time to determine if any priority adjustments should be made, such
    as re-evaluating task assignments or responsiveness to player actions. The method
    does not return a value but modifies internal bot priority states directly.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose priority
      will be updated. Must not be null.
  - name: currentTime
    description: Current timestamp in milliseconds used to determine when priority
      adjustments should occur. Typically obtained from WorldTimer or similar system
      clock.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void UpdateBotPriorities()\n{\n    uint32 currentTime = getMSTime();\n\
      \    for (auto& bot : botList)\n    {\n        if (bot)\n            sBotPriorityManager->UpdatePriorityForBot(bot,\
      \ currentTime);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the automated AI system and should be called regularly
    during game ticks to maintain accurate bot behavior. It may trigger internal recalculations
    of bot task queues or group assignments depending on priority changes.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this function, as passing an invalid pointer can lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes.
