  class: BotAI
  method: GetPerformanceMetrics
  signature: const PerformanceMetrics & BotAI::GetPerformanceMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves performance metrics for the bot AI instance.
  description: The GetPerformanceMetrics method returns a constant reference to the
    PerformanceMetrics structure that contains various performance-related statistics
    and measurements for the BotAI instance. These metrics typically include timing
    data, resource usage, and other diagnostic information that can be used to monitor
    and optimize the behavior of the AI. The returned metrics are updated periodically
    as the bot performs its operations and can be used by developers or monitoring
    systems to assess the efficiency and responsiveness of the AI implementation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a PerformanceMetrics object containing performance
    statistics such as execution times, resource consumption, and other diagnostic
    data for the BotAI instance. The reference is guaranteed to be valid for the lifetime
    of the BotAI object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'const PerformanceMetrics& metrics = botAI.GetPerformanceMetrics();

      std::cout << "Average update time: " << metrics.averageUpdateTime << "ms" <<
      std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Bot Performance
    code: "void LogBotPerformance(BotAI& botAI) {\n    const auto& metrics = botAI.GetPerformanceMetrics();\n\
      \    LOG_INFO(\"ai.bot\", \"Bot Performance - Update Time: {}ms, Memory Usage:\
      \ {}KB\",\n             metrics.averageUpdateTime, metrics.memoryUsage);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned PerformanceMetrics reference is valid only while the BotAI instance
    exists. The metrics are updated incrementally as the AI performs its operations
    and may not reflect real-time values if accessed between update cycles. This method
    is thread-safe for read operations.
  warnings: Accessing performance metrics from multiple threads simultaneously without
    proper synchronization may lead to inconsistent readings. The metrics should not
    be modified through this reference, as it's a constant reference.
