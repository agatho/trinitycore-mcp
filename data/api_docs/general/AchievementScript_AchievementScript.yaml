  class: AchievementScript
  method: AchievementScript
  signature: void AchievementScript::AchievementScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an achievement script with the specified name for use in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore server.
  description: The AchievementScript constructor initializes a new achievement script
    instance with the provided name. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore
    framework to register custom achievement behaviors or logic that can be triggered
    during gameplay events. The name parameter serves as a unique identifier for the
    script, allowing the game engine to associate specific achievement conditions
    and rewards with this implementation. When called, this constructor sets up internal
    data structures necessary for tracking achievement progress and handling related
    callbacks. This method should be invoked during server initialization or module
    loading to ensure proper registration of custom achievements.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated string representing the unique name identifier
      for this achievement script. This name is used by the TrinityCore framework
      to register and reference the script within the achievement system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Achievement Script Initialization
    code: "class MyCustomAchievement : public AchievementScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyCustomAchievement()\
      \ : AchievementScript(\"MyCustomAchievement\")\n    {\n        // Additional\
      \ initialization logic here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering Custom Achievement with Specific Logic
    code: "class KillBossAchievement : public AchievementScript\n{\npublic:\n    KillBossAchievement()\
      \ : AchievementScript(\"KillBossAchievement\")\n    {\n        // Register achievement\
      \ event handlers\n        // Set up conditions and rewards\n    }\n\n    void\
      \ OnPlayerKill(Player* player, Creature* creature) override\n    {\n       \
      \ // Custom logic for tracking boss kills\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the base AchievementScript class and should not
    be called directly by game developers unless implementing custom achievement types.
    The name parameter must be unique across all registered achievement scripts to
    prevent conflicts in the TrinityCore achievement system.
  warnings: Incorrectly naming achievement scripts can lead to conflicts or unregistered
    achievements. Ensure that each achievement script has a globally unique name to
    avoid runtime issues with the achievement tracking system.
