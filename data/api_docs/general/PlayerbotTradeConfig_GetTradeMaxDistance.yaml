documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum distance allowed for trade interactions in player bot
    AI.
  description: The GetTradeMaxDistance method retrieves the configured maximum distance
    threshold that player bots will consider when attempting to trade with other players.
    This value determines how far away a potential trading partner can be before the
    bot considers the trade invalid or too risky. The returned float value represents
    the distance in yards, and is typically used within the context of AI decision-making
    for trade-related actions such as initiating trades, evaluating trade partners,
    or determining whether to pursue a trade opportunity based on proximity. This
    configuration value directly influences the behavior of player bots in terms of
    their trading range and can be adjusted through configuration files or runtime
    settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the maximum distance (in yards) that a player
    bot will consider for trade interactions. Values are typically positive floats,
    with common defaults around 10-20 yards depending on server configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use trade max distance
    code: "float maxDistance = playerbot->GetTradeMaxDistance();\nif (maxDistance\
      \ > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Use the maximum distance for trade logic\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Maximum trade distance: \" << maxDistance << \" yards\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player bot AI configuration system and may be
    affected by server-side settings or bot behavior modifications. The returned value
    should be validated before use in distance calculations to ensure it's within
    expected ranges.
  warnings: The method returns a raw float value without validation, so developers
    should verify that the returned value is positive and reasonable for their use
    case. Negative values may indicate misconfiguration or invalid state.
