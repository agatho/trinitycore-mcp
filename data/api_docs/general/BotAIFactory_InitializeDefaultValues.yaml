documentation:
  brief: Initializes default AI behavior values for a bot instance
  description: The InitializeDefaultValues method sets up the baseline configuration
    and behavior parameters for a BotAI instance. This method is typically called
    during bot creation or initialization to ensure that all AI-related variables
    are properly configured with default settings before the bot begins executing
    its AI logic. It establishes fundamental properties such as movement patterns,
    combat behaviors, and decision-making thresholds that define how the bot will
    act in various game scenarios. The method ensures consistency across different
    bot instances by applying standardized default configurations.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that requires default value initialization.
      This parameter must not be null and should point to a valid BotAI object that
      has been allocated in memory.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic bot AI initialization
    code: 'BotAI* botAI = new BotAI();

      BotAIFactory::InitializeDefaultValues(botAI);

      // BotAI is now ready for use with default configurations'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing multiple bots in a loop
    code: "std::vector<BotAI*> botList;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {\n    BotAI*\
      \ bot = new BotAI();\n    BotAIFactory::InitializeDefaultValues(bot);\n    botList.push_back(bot);\n\
      }\n// All bots in botList now have consistent default AI configurations"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per BotAI instance during initialization.
    Repeated calls may result in overwriting custom configurations that were previously
    set. The method assumes that the BotAI object has already been allocated and is
    in a valid state for configuration.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the ai parameter will likely cause a crash or
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the BotAI instance is properly constructed before
    calling this method. Avoid calling this method after custom configurations have
    been applied, as it may reset those settings.
