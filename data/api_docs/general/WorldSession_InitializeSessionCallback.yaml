documentation:
  brief: Initializes session callback for a player connection
  description: The InitializeSessionCallback method sets up the necessary session
    callbacks and initializes the player's connection state within the TrinityCore
    server. This method is typically invoked during the login process to prepare the
    WorldSession object for handling player commands and maintaining connection state.
    It ensures that all required session data structures are properly initialized
    and that the session is ready to receive and process incoming packets from the
    client.
  parameters:
  - name: holder
    description: An integer identifier used to hold session-specific data or context
      information
  - name: realmHolder
    description: An integer identifier representing the realm or server instance where
      the session is being initialized
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Session Initialization
    code: 'WorldSession* session = new WorldSession(12345, 67890);

      // Initialize session callback

      session->InitializeSessionCallback(12345, 67890);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the server's login system and
    should not be invoked directly by external code unless implementing custom session
    handling logic. The method may perform initialization tasks such as setting up
    packet handlers, initializing player data structures, or registering callbacks
    with the network layer.
