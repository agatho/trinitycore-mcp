  class: DPSPositioning
  method: ValidateDPSPosition
  signature: bool DPSPositioning::ValidateDPSPosition(const int & pos, Player * dps,
    const CombatPositionContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a given DPS position is acceptable for the player within
    the specified combat context.
  description: The ValidateDPSPosition method checks if a provided position index
    is valid for a specific player's role as a DPS character in the current combat
    scenario. It evaluates various factors such as positioning constraints, combat
    state, and player capabilities to determine if the given position can be safely
    occupied by the DPS player. This method is typically used during combat encounters
    to ensure proper positioning of players for optimal damage output and team coordination.
    The validation considers the context provided through the CombatPositionContext
    parameter which may include information about the encounter type, current phase,
    or environmental restrictions.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position index to validate for DPS placement. This is typically
      an integer representing a specific location within a combat formation or positioning
      system.
  - name: dps
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the DPS character whose
      position validity is being checked. Must not be null.
  - name: context
    description: Reference to a CombatPositionContext structure containing contextual
      information about the current combat situation that affects positioning validation
      rules.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is valid for the DPS player under
    the given combat context, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate
    invalid position index, player not in combat, or position conflicts with current
    encounter mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Position Validation
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player reference\nCombatPositionContext context\
      \ = ...; // Set up combat context\nint position = 2;\nbool isValid = DPSPositioning::ValidateDPSPosition(position,\
      \ player, context);\nif (isValid)\n{\n    // Proceed with positioning\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in Combat Encounter
    code: "void HandleDPSPlacement(Player* player, int targetPos)\n{\n    CombatPositionContext\
      \ ctx;\n    ctx.encounterType = ENCOUNTER_BOSS;\n    ctx.combatPhase = PHASE_ACTIVE;\n\
      \    \n    if (DPSPositioning::ValidateDPSPosition(targetPos, player, ctx))\n\
      \    {\n        // Position is valid, proceed with movement\n        player->SetPosition(targetPos);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Handle invalid position case\n        player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Invalid DPS position.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against player class restrictions, combat
    phase limitations, and encounter-specific positioning rules. The implementation
    may cache validation results for performance optimization in frequently called
    scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Invalid position indices or malformed context data could lead to unexpected
    behavior or assertion failures.
