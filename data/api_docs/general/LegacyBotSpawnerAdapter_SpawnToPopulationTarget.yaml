documentation:
  brief: Spawns bots to match the configured population target for the legacy bot
    spawner adapter.
  description: The SpawnToPopulationTarget method is responsible for managing the
    spawning of bots within a legacy bot spawner adapter context. It evaluates the
    current population of spawned bots against a predefined target population and
    spawns additional bots as needed to reach that target. This method is typically
    invoked during periodic updates or when population adjustments are required. The
    behavior may depend on configuration settings such as maximum spawn limits, spawn
    rates, and bot distribution strategies. It ensures that the number of active bots
    in the system aligns with the desired population target for gameplay balance or
    testing purposes.

    code: 'LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter adapter;

      adapter.SpawnToPopulationTarget();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform database operations to track spawned bots and their
    states. It should be called in a context where the adapter's configuration is
    properly initialized. The spawning process might be throttled or delayed based
    on server load or rate limiting settings.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the spawner adapter
    may lead to undefined behavior or errors. Ensure that all required configuration
    parameters are set before invoking this method.
