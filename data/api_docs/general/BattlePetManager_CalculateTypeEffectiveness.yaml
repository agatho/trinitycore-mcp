  class: BattlePetManager
  method: CalculateTypeEffectiveness
  signature: float BattlePetManager::CalculateTypeEffectiveness(PetFamily attackerFamily,
    PetFamily defenderFamily) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the type effectiveness multiplier between a battle pet attacker
    and defender based on their families.
  description: This method determines how effective a battle pet's attack is against
    a target pet based on their respective pet family types. It implements the damage
    calculation logic used in World of Warcraft's Battle Pet system, where certain
    pet families are more or less effective against others. The method returns a float
    value representing the damage multiplier, typically ranging from 0.0 (no effect)
    to 2.0 (super effective). This calculation is essential for determining battle
    outcomes and damage dealt during pet battles.
  parameters:
  - name: attackerFamily
    description: The PetFamily enum value representing the type of the attacking pet
  - name: defenderFamily
    description: The PetFamily enum value representing the type of the defending pet
  returns: A float value representing the damage effectiveness multiplier. Values
    typically range from 0.0 (no effect) to 2.0 (super effective). A value of 1.0
    indicates normal effectiveness.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float effectiveness = battlePetManager->CalculateTypeEffectiveness(PET_FAMILY_CROCOLISK,
      PET_FAMILY_BIRD);

      // Returns the damage multiplier for a Crocolisk attacking a Bird pet'
    language: cpp
  - title: Damage Calculation Example
    code: 'float attackPower = 100.0f;

      PetFamily attacker = PET_FAMILY_WOLF;

      PetFamily defender = PET_FAMILY_CRAB;

      float effectiveness = battlePetManager->CalculateTypeEffectiveness(attacker,
      defender);

      float finalDamage = attackPower * effectiveness;

      // Calculates actual damage considering type effectiveness'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core Battle Pet combat system and should only
    be called during active pet battles. The implementation likely uses a lookup table
    or switch statement to determine effectiveness multipliers based on predefined
    type matchups. The method is const, meaning it does not modify any internal state.
  warnings: Ensure that both PetFamily values are valid enums before calling this
    method, as invalid values may result in undefined behavior or incorrect calculations.
    This method should only be used during active battle scenarios to avoid incorrect
    damage multipliers.
