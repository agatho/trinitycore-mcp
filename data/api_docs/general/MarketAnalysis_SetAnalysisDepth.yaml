  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: SetAnalysisDepth
  signature: void MarketAnalysis::SetAnalysisDepth(float depth)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the analysis depth for market data processing within the MarketAnalysis
    class.
  description: The SetAnalysisDepth method configures the depth parameter used by
    the MarketAnalysis class to determine how deeply market data should be analyzed.
    This parameter typically controls the scope or granularity of the analysis, such
    as the number of historical entries to consider or the level of detail in price
    trend evaluation. The method accepts a floating-point value representing this
    depth and stores it for use in subsequent market analysis operations. This configuration
    directly impacts the behavior of related market analysis functions and can influence
    performance and accuracy of market predictions.
  parameters:
  - name: depth
    description: A floating-point value that defines the depth of market analysis.
      Higher values typically indicate more comprehensive analysis with greater computational
      overhead, while lower values may provide faster but less detailed results. Valid
      range is generally positive numbers, though specific constraints depend on implementation
      details.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analysis;

      analysis.SetAnalysisDepth(5.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting High Analysis Depth
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analysis;

      analysis.SetAnalysisDepth(10.0f); // For detailed market trend analysis'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other market analysis parameters
    to fine-tune the behavior of the MarketAnalysis class. The depth value may affect
    memory usage and processing time, so it should be set appropriately based on system
    capabilities and required accuracy.
