documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a resource event has expired based on its internal time tracking
    mechanism.
  description: The IsExpired method determines if a ResourceEvent object has reached
    or exceeded its defined expiration time. This method is typically used in TrinityCore's
    event system to manage temporary resources, such as quest rewards, temporary buffs,
    or time-limited game objects. The check is performed against the internal timestamp
    stored within the ResourceEvent instance, comparing it with the current server
    time. When an event expires, it may no longer be active or accessible to players,
    and certain actions might be triggered automatically by the game engine. This
    method does not modify any state; it only evaluates and returns a boolean result
    indicating the expiration status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the resource event has expired (i.e., current time is greater
    than or equal to the event's expiration time), otherwise false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Event Handling
    code: "if (resourceEvent.IsExpired()) {\n    // Handle expired event logic\n \
      \   resourceEvent.OnExpired();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Events for Expiration
    code: "std::vector<ResourceEvent*> events = GetActiveResourceEvents();\nfor (auto&\
      \ event : events) {\n    if (event->IsExpired()) {\n        // Remove or process\
      \ expired event\n        ProcessExpiredEvent(event);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate server time synchronization. It is recommended
    to ensure that the system clock used for time comparisons is consistent across
    all game servers in a multi-realm environment. The internal timestamp of ResourceEvent
    objects should be set correctly during initialization or when the event is created.
  warnings: Do not rely solely on this method for critical gameplay logic without
    also checking other related state flags or conditions, as expiration may not always
    reflect the complete lifecycle of an event. Also, be cautious about race conditions
    if events are modified concurrently by different threads.
