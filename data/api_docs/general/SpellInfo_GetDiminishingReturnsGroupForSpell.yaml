documentation:
  brief: Returns the diminishing returns group identifier for a spell
  description: This method retrieves the diminishing returns group to which a spell
    belongs, allowing developers to determine how spell effects interact with diminishing
    returns mechanics. The returned value indicates the group number that controls
    whether a spell's effect is subject to diminishing returns, with higher group
    numbers typically resulting in more restrictive diminishing return behavior. This
    is essential for understanding how certain spells stack or reduce in effectiveness
    when applied multiple times.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the diminishing returns group identifier
    for the spell. A value of 0 indicates no diminishing returns group, while positive
    values represent specific group numbers that determine the behavior of diminishing
    returns application.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int group = spellInfo->GetDiminishingReturnsGroupForSpell();\nif (group\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Spell belongs to a specific diminishing returns group\n  \
      \  // Process accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related functions
    to determine how spells behave under diminishing returns mechanics. It should
    be noted that the group value returned may vary depending on the spell's specific
    properties and configuration within the TrinityCore database.
  warnings: Care must be taken when interpreting this value, as incorrect use can
    lead to misconfiguration of spell effects or inappropriate behavior in game mechanics.
    The method does not validate whether the returned group actually exists in the
    database.
