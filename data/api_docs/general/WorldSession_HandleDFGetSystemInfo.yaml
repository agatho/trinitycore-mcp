documentation:
  brief: Retrieves dungeon finder system information for the player's current session.
  description: The HandleDFGetSystemInfo method is responsible for processing a client
    request to obtain system-related information used by the Dungeon Finder feature
    in World of Warcraft. This method typically responds to a packet sent from the
    client that requests details about the dungeon finder system, such as available
    dungeons, group composition rules, or other related configuration data. The implementation
    likely retrieves and formats this information based on the player's current zone,
    level, and faction, then sends it back to the client through a dedicated response
    packet. This functionality is integral to the LFG (Looking For Group) system and
    helps maintain synchronization between the client and server regarding dungeon
    availability and rules.

  - title: Basic usage in session handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleDFGetSystemInfo(WorldPackets::LFG::DFGetSystemInfo&\
      \ dfGetSystemInfo)\n{\n    // Process the request and send system info back\
      \ to client\n    WorldPackets::LFG::DFSystemInfo systemInfo;\n    // ... populate\
      \ systemInfo with relevant data ...\n    SendPacket(systemInfo.Write());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG (Looking For Group) subsystem and directly
    interacts with the dungeon finder functionality. It should be called only when
    a valid session exists and the player has proper access to the dungeon finder
    system. The method may involve database lookups or cached data retrieval for determining
    available dungeons and their properties.
