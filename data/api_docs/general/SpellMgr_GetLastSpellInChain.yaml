  signature: uint32 SpellMgr::GetLastSpellInChain(uint32 spell_id) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the final spell ID in a spell chain for the given spell identifier.
  description: The GetLastSpellInChain method retrieves the ultimate spell in a chain
    of related spells, typically used to resolve spell upgrades or transformations.
    In World of Warcraft's spell system, certain spells are part of chains where one
    spell leads to another through upgrades or evolutions. This method ensures that
    the final spell in such a sequence is returned, which is useful for spell handling,
    effects application, and ensuring correct gameplay mechanics. The method operates
    on the internal spell chain data structure maintained by the SpellMgr class and
    does not modify any spell state. It returns the original spell ID if no chain
    exists or if the spell is already the last in its chain.
  parameters: []
  returns: The uint32 return value represents the spell ID of the final spell in the
    chain. If the input spell_id has no associated chain, or if it is already the
    last spell in its chain, the method returns the same spell_id. The return value
    will be zero if an invalid spell_id is provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: uint32 finalSpellId = sSpellMgr->GetLastSpellInChain(12345); // Returns
      the last spell in chain for spell ID 12345
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Spell Chain Resolution
    code: "uint32 originalSpell = 12345;\nuint32 finalSpell = sSpellMgr->GetLastSpellInChain(originalSpell);\n\
      if (originalSpell != finalSpell)\n{\n    // Spell was part of a chain, and we\
      \ resolved to the final spell\n    printf(\"Original: %u, Final: %u\\n\", originalSpell,\
      \ finalSpell);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spell chain definitions stored in the SpellMgr.
    It is thread-safe as long as the underlying spell data remains unchanged during
    execution. Performance is generally fast due to caching mechanisms within the
    SpellMgr, but repeated calls with different spell IDs may cause lookups in internal
    data structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided spell_id is valid before calling this method;
    invalid spell IDs may lead to unexpected behavior or return zero. The method assumes
    all spell chains are properly defined in the database and will not validate chain
    integrity at runtime.
