  class: WorldObject
  method: GetTransTime
  signature: uint32 WorldObject::GetTransTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the transport animation time for the WorldObject.
  description: The GetTransTime method retrieves the transport animation time associated
    with a WorldObject. This value represents the time in milliseconds that a GameObject
    or Unit has been in transit on a transport such as a boat, zeppelin, or other
    moving platform. The transport time is used internally by the TrinityCore server
    to synchronize movement and positioning of objects on transports, ensuring proper
    client-side rendering and interaction. This method is typically called during
    movement updates and transport synchronization processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the transport animation time in milliseconds.
    Returns 0 if the object is not currently on a transport or if no transport animation
    is active.
  examples:
  - title: Check Transport Animation Time
    code: "WorldObject* obj = player->GetVehicleBase();\nuint32 transTime = obj->GetTransTime();\n\
      if (transTime > 0)\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"Object is on transport, animation\
      \ time: %u ms\", transTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use Transport Time for Movement Logic
    code: "Unit* unit = player;\nuint32 currentTransTime = unit->GetTransTime();\n\
      if (currentTransTime > 0)\n{\n    // Adjust movement logic based on transport\
      \ animation time\n    float progress = (float)currentTransTime / 1000.0f; //\
      \ Convert to seconds\n    // Apply custom behavior based on transport progress\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used for internal server mechanics related to transport
    synchronization and movement updates. The returned value reflects the time elapsed
    since the object started moving on a transport, which may be zero if the object
    is not currently on a transport or if the transport animation has not yet begun.
