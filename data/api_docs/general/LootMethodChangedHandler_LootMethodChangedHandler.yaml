documentation:
  brief: Updates the bot's loot method configuration when the group loot settings
    change.
  description: The LootMethodChangedHandler method is responsible for processing changes
    to the group loot method in a TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft AI system. This
    handler ensures that the bot's internal loot settings are synchronized with the
    current group configuration, such as when switching between free-for-all, round-robin,
    or master loot methods. It typically gets invoked when the group leader modifies
    the loot rules, and it adjusts the bot's behavior accordingly to maintain proper
    loot distribution adherence. The method operates within the context of a BotAI
    instance, which manages the artificial intelligence behaviors for player-controlled
    bots in the game.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\n    if (m_lootMethodChanged)\n\
      \    {\n        LootMethodChangedHandler handler(this);\n        handler.LootMethodChangedHandler(this);\n\
      \        m_lootMethodChanged = false;\n    }\n    // ... rest of AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a group loot method change has been
    detected. It is typically triggered by an event or flag within the BotAI class
    that indicates a change in group settings. The handler does not directly modify
    game state but rather updates internal bot configurations to align with new loot
    rules.
  warnings: Ensure that this handler is only called after verifying that a loot method
    change has occurred, otherwise unnecessary processing may occur. Also, be aware
    that this handler assumes the BotAI instance is properly initialized and has access
    to valid group information.
