documentation:
  brief: Processes a WhoIs request packet to retrieve detailed information about a
    target player.
  description: The HandleWhoIsOpcode method is responsible for handling incoming WhoIs
    requests from players in the World of Warcraft client. When a player uses the
    /whois command, this method processes the request and retrieves relevant information
    about the specified target player, such as their online status, realm name, and
    other identifying details. The method operates within the WorldSession context
    and is part of the core communication system that manages player interactions
    with the game's social features. It ensures proper validation of the request and
    sends back an appropriate response packet containing the requested information.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic WhoIs Request Handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleWhoIsOpcode(WorldPackets::Who::WhoIsRequest& packet)\n\
      {\n    // Process the WhoIs request\n    Player* targetPlayer = sObjectAccessor->FindPlayerByName(packet.Name);\n\
      \    if (targetPlayer)\n    {\n        // Send response with player details\n\
      \        WorldPackets::Who::WhoIsResponse response;\n        response.Name =\
      \ targetPlayer->GetName();\n        response.RealmName = sWorld->GetRealmName();\n\
      \        SendPacket(response.Write());\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is part of the core session handling system and should be called
    only from within the network processing thread. The packet structure contains
    a player name field that must be validated to prevent denial-of-service attacks
    through malformed requests.
  warnings: Improper validation of the target player name in the request could lead
    to security vulnerabilities or crashes. Always verify that the target exists before
    attempting to retrieve information about them.
