  signature: const Configuration & InterruptRotationManager::GetConfiguration() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the configuration object for the interrupt rotation manager, providing
    access to its settings and parameters.
  description: The GetConfiguration method retrieves a constant reference to the internal
    Configuration object used by the InterruptRotationManager class. This configuration
    typically contains settings that define how interrupt rotations should behave,
    such as cooldown timers, priority rules, or spell selection criteria. The returned
    reference allows read-only access to these configuration values without modifying
    them directly. This method is commonly used during AI decision-making processes
    where the manager needs to consult its configured parameters to determine appropriate
    interrupt actions based on game state and player conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the Configuration object associated with this InterruptRotationManager
    instance. The configuration contains all relevant settings for controlling interrupt
    rotation behavior including timing, priority, and spell selection rules.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Configuration Settings
    code: 'InterruptRotationManager* manager = ...;

      const Configuration& config = manager->GetConfiguration();

      uint32 cooldown = config.GetInt("interrupt_cooldown", 1000);

      bool use_priority = config.GetBool("use_spell_priority", true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Configuration reference is valid only as long as the InterruptRotationManager
    instance exists. This method performs no computation or data processing; it simply
    returns a cached reference to an internal configuration object. The configuration
    object itself should not be modified through this interface, as it's meant to
    be read-only.
