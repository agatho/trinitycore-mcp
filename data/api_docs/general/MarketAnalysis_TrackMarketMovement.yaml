documentation:
  brief: Monitors and records changes in the in-game market economy for analysis purposes.
  description: The TrackMarketMovement method is responsible for observing and logging
    fluctuations in the World of Warcraft auction house and market dynamics. It collects
    data on item prices, supply and demand trends, and transaction patterns to support
    economic analysis within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically runs
    periodically or in response to specific market events such as item auctions, bids,
    or sales. The collected data may be used for generating reports, detecting inflation,
    or informing game balance decisions. It does not require any input parameters
    and operates on internal market state tracking mechanisms.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Market Analysis Module
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analyzer;

      analyzer.TrackMarketMovement();

      // This call initiates the monitoring process for current market trends.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal auction house systems and may
    have performance implications if called too frequently. It is recommended to schedule
    this method execution at appropriate intervals rather than on every game tick.
    The actual data collection mechanism might involve accessing shared memory structures
    or event queues managed by the core server.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the MarketAnalysis
    class could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all required subsystems
    like auction house data and economic models are properly loaded before invoking
    this function.
