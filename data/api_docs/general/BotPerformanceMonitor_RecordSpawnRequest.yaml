documentation:
  brief: Records a bot spawn request event for performance monitoring.
  description: The RecordSpawnRequest method logs a bot spawn request within the TrinityCore's
    performance monitoring system. This method is typically invoked when a player
    requests to spawn a bot character, allowing the server to track and analyze spawn-related
    performance metrics. The recorded data can be used for debugging, optimization,
    and ensuring that bot spawning operations do not negatively impact server performance.
    It is part of the BotPerformanceMonitor class which helps maintain game stability
    by monitoring various bot-related activities.

  - title: Basic Usage in Spawn Command Handler
    code: "void HandleSpawnBotCommand(Player* player)\n{\n    // ... bot creation\
      \ logic ...\n    sBotPerformanceMonitor->RecordSpawnRequest();\n    // ... continue\
      \ with spawn process ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely thread-safe as it's designed for performance monitoring
    and should not block the main game loop. It may internally use atomic operations
    or locks to ensure data consistency when multiple threads attempt to record spawn
    requests simultaneously.
