  class: GameObject
  method: GetTapList
  signature: const int & GameObject::GetTapList() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the list of players who have tapped the GameObject.
  description: The GetTapList method retrieves the collection of players who have
    performed a 'tap' on the GameObject, which is a game mechanic where players interact
    with the object to gain access to its contents or trigger its behavior. This method
    is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to track player
    interactions and manage GameObjects that are not directly controlled by the owner.
    The tap list typically includes players who have opened or interacted with the
    GameObject, and it can be used for various purposes such as determining loot distribution,
    managing quest objectives, or tracking player activity on the object.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a reference to an integer array containing the GUIDs of players
    who have tapped the GameObject. The array represents the list of players who have
    interacted with the GameObject and is used for tracking purposes in game mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "const int& tapList = gameObject->GetTapList();\nfor (int playerGUID : tapList)\n\
      {\n    // Process player GUID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other GameObject-related
    methods such as GetLoot(), GetQuest(), or GetOwner to manage game objects effectively.
    It may be called frequently during gameplay, especially when managing loot distribution
    or quest completion.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method because it returns a reference
    to an internal array that can change during gameplay. Modifications to the tap
    list during iteration could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
