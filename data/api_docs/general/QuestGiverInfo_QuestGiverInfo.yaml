  method: QuestGiverInfo
  signature: void QuestGiverInfo::QuestGiverInfo(uint32 guid, QuestGiverType t, const
    int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a QuestGiverInfo object with the specified GUID, type, and position.
  description: The QuestGiverInfo constructor initializes an object that represents
    a quest giver in the World of Warcraft environment. This method sets up internal
    state variables including the unique identifier (GUID) of the quest giver, its
    type (such as NPC or GameObject), and its position within the game world. The
    initialization is typically used when creating quest giver entries for quest systems,
    dialogue handling, or interaction mechanics. This constructor does not perform
    any validation on input parameters but assumes valid inputs are provided by calling
    code.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the quest giver entity, typically
      representing an NPC or GameObject in the game world.
  - name: t
    description: The type of quest giver, indicating whether it's an NPC, GameObject,
      or other entity capable of giving quests. Values are usually defined by the
      QuestGiverType enumeration.
  - name: pos
    description: A reference to an integer representing the position index or slot
      in which this quest giver is stored or referenced within a container or list.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of QuestGiverInfo
    code: QuestGiverInfo info(12345, QUEST_GIVER_TYPE_NPC, 0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Multiple QuestGiverInfo Objects
    code: 'std::vector<QuestGiverInfo> questGivers;

      questGivers.emplace_back(12345, QUEST_GIVER_TYPE_NPC, 0);

      questGivers.emplace_back(67890, QUEST_GIVER_TYPE_GAMEOBJECT, 1);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the internal quest system implementation and
    should not be called directly by most game logic code. It's primarily used during
    quest data loading or initialization phases where quest giver information needs
    to be structured for later retrieval or interaction.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid entity in the world,
    as invalid GUIDs may lead to undefined behavior when interacting with quest systems.
    The position parameter must be within expected bounds to avoid indexing errors.
