  method: GetScale
  signature: float GameObjectModelOwnerBase::GetScale() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the scale factor of the game object model.
  description: The GetScale method returns the current scale factor applied to the
    GameObjectModel. This value determines how much the model is scaled relative to
    its original size in the game world. The scale factor is typically used to adjust
    the visual size of game objects such as doors, furniture, or interactive elements
    without altering their collision geometry. It's important to note that this method
    does not modify the underlying model data but rather provides a read-only access
    to the current scaling state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the scale factor of the game object model. A
    value of 1.0 represents the original size, values less than 1.0 represent shrinking,
    and values greater than 1.0 represent magnification.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Scale Retrieval
    code: "float currentScale = gameObjectModelOwner->GetScale();\nif (currentScale\
      \ != 1.0f)\n{\n    // Handle scaled object\n    printf(\"Object is scaled to\
      \ %.2f%% of original size\\n\", currentScale * 100.0f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Scale Validation
    code: "float scale = gameObjectModelOwner->GetScale();\nif (scale > 0.0f)\n{\n\
      \    // Proceed with scale-aware calculations\n    float scaledDistance = originalDistance\
      \ * scale;\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid scale\n    LogError(\"Invalid\
      \ scale factor: %f\", scale);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other model transformation
    functions. The returned value represents a multiplicative scale factor and should
    be applied consistently across all relevant coordinate transformations. Performance-wise,
    this is a fast operation as it only returns a cached value.
  warnings: Ensure that the GameObjectModelOwnerBase instance is properly initialized
    before calling this method, as accessing an uninitialized object may lead to undefined
    behavior. Also, be aware that scale values of zero or negative numbers are not
    typical and may indicate an error in the model setup.
