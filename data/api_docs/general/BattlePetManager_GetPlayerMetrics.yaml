    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the battle pet metrics associated with a specific player.
  description: The GetPlayerMetrics method fetches the PetMetrics structure that contains
    various statistics and data related to a player's battle pets. This includes information
    such as the number of pets collected, pet battles won, and other relevant gameplay
    metrics. The method is typically used to provide players with insights into their
    battle pet progress and performance within the game. It requires a valid player
    GUID to retrieve the corresponding metrics, and will return a constant reference
    to the PetMetrics object for read-only access.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a PetMetrics object containing all relevant battle
    pet statistics for the specified player. The returned object is guaranteed to
    be valid if the player GUID corresponds to an existing player with battle pet
    data.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Player Battle Pet Metrics
    code: 'uint32 playerId = 12345;

      const PetMetrics& metrics = battlePetManager->GetPlayerMetrics(playerId);

      TC_LOG_INFO("player", "Player %u has won %u pet battles.", playerId, metrics.battlesWon);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using internal caching or lookup tables
    to efficiently retrieve player data. It should be called with a valid player GUID
    to avoid undefined behavior. The returned PetMetrics reference is read-only and
    should not be modified directly.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided playerGuid corresponds to an existing player
    in the database, otherwise the behavior is undefined. This method may throw exceptions
    or return invalid data if the player has no battle pet records.
