  class: Corpse
  method: SetFactionTemplate
  signature: void Corpse::SetFactionTemplate(int factionTemplate)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the faction template ID for this corpse object.
  description: The SetFactionTemplate method assigns a specific faction template to
    the corpse, determining how the corpse interacts with different factions in the
    game world. This is typically used during player death and corpse creation to
    ensure the corpse reflects the correct faction alignment. The faction template
    controls visibility, interaction behavior, and loot distribution for the corpse
    based on the player's original faction. This method directly modifies internal
    faction data within the corpse object without requiring additional synchronization.
  parameters:
  - name: factionTemplate
    description: The faction template ID to assign to this corpse. This value should
      correspond to a valid faction template defined in the game's faction database.
      A value of -1 or 0 typically indicates default or neutral faction behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Corpse's Faction Template
    code: "Corpse* corpse = player->GetCorpse();\nif (corpse)\n{\n    corpse->SetFactionTemplate(14);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Faction Based on Player's Original Faction
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nCorpse* corpse = player->GetCorpse();\nif (corpse)\n\
      {\n    uint32 playerFaction = player->getFaction();\n    corpse->SetFactionTemplate(playerFaction);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal faction template field of the corpse object.
    Changes made through this method will affect how other players or NPCs interact
    with the corpse, particularly regarding loot visibility and faction-based interactions.
    The method does not trigger any additional events or callbacks automatically.
  warnings: Modifying a corpse's faction template after it has been created may have
    unintended consequences for quest progression or faction reputation if the corpse
    is still in the world. Ensure that faction changes align with expected gameplay
    behavior before calling this method.
