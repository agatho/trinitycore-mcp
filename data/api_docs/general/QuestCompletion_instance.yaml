documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the QuestCompletion class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the QuestCompletion
    class, providing global access to a single, shared instance of this class. This
    is commonly used in TrinityCore's quest system to manage quest completion states
    and related data across the game world. The method ensures that only one instance
    of QuestCompletion exists throughout the application lifecycle, preventing duplicate
    or conflicting quest state management. This singleton instance can be used to
    query and modify quest completion status for players and NPCs within the game
    world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of the QuestCompletion class. The method
    will always return a valid pointer to the singleton instance, never nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'QuestCompletion* questComp = QuestCompletion::instance();

      // Use the singleton instance to access quest completion methods

      questComp->CompleteQuest(player, questId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Quest Completion Data
    code: "QuestCompletion* qc = QuestCompletion::instance();\nif (qc->IsQuestCompleted(player,\
      \ 12345)) {\n    // Handle quest completion logic\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      Quest completed!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the standard singleton pattern implementation. The QuestCompletion
    singleton is typically initialized during server startup and remains active throughout
    the server's runtime. Developers should be aware that accessing this singleton
    from multiple threads requires proper synchronization if thread safety is a concern.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, modifying state through this instance affects
    all parts of the application that use it. Be cautious when making changes to quest
    completion states as they may impact other systems that depend on quest data consistency.
