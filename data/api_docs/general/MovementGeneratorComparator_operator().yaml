documentation:
  brief: Compares two MovementGenerator objects to determine their relative ordering
    for sorting purposes.
  description: The operator() method of MovementGeneratorComparator is a comparison
    function object used to sort MovementGenerator instances. It takes two const pointers
    to MovementGenerator objects and returns true if the first should be ordered before
    the second in a sorted sequence. This comparator is typically used within STL
    containers or algorithms that require custom ordering logic for MovementGenerator
    objects, such as when managing active movement generators for a unit in the game
    world. The comparison logic is based on internal properties of the MovementGenerator
    instances, likely their priority, type, or other identifying characteristics relevant
    to movement behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the first MovementGenerator (a) should be ordered before
    the second (b), false otherwise. This determines the sort order in containers
    using this comparator.
  examples:
  - title: Sorting MovementGenerators
    code: 'std::vector<MovementGenerator*> generators;

      // ... populate generators ...

      std::sort(generators.begin(), generators.end(), MovementGeneratorComparator());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a const member function that does not modify the comparator object
    or the MovementGenerator objects being compared. The sorting behavior depends
    on the internal implementation of how MovementGenerator priorities or types are
    compared, which may vary based on game mechanics and movement system requirements.
