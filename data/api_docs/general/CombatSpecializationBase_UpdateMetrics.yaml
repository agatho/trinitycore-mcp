  class: CombatSpecializationBase
  method: UpdateMetrics
  signature: void CombatSpecializationBase::UpdateMetrics(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates combat specialization metrics based on elapsed time
  description: The UpdateMetrics method is responsible for refreshing and recalculating
    various combat-related statistics and performance indicators within a player's
    combat specialization. This method typically processes time-based updates such
    as cooldown reductions, resource regeneration rates, or buff/debuff durations
    that are tied to the player's current combat specialization. It is designed to
    be called regularly by the game loop with a delta time parameter to ensure real-time
    accuracy of specialization-specific combat data.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the last update call. This
      value is used to calculate time-based changes in combat metrics such as cooldowns,
      resource regeneration, or temporary stat modifications.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = sWorld->GetLastTickTime();\n    player->GetCombatSpecialization()->UpdateMetrics(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat System Updates
    code: "void Player::UpdateCombatSpecialization(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (HasCombatSpecialization())\n\
      \    {\n        GetCombatSpecialization()->UpdateMetrics(diff);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently, ideally every game tick or at regular
    intervals to maintain accurate combat specialization state. The implementation
    likely uses the diff parameter to scale time-based effects properly and avoid
    frame-rate dependent behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called when a valid combat specialization
    exists for the player to prevent potential null pointer dereferences or undefined
    behavior.
