  method: GetDefaultStrategy
  signature: AuctionStrategy AuctionManager::GetDefaultStrategy() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the default auction strategy used by the AuctionManager for processing
    auctions.
  description: The GetDefaultStrategy method returns the default AuctionStrategy that
    is applied when no specific strategy is provided during auction operations. This
    strategy defines how auctions are handled in terms of pricing, duration, and other
    auction-related behaviors within the TrinityCore framework. The returned strategy
    object encapsulates predefined rules and settings that govern standard auction
    behavior across the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: An AuctionStrategy object representing the default auction processing rules.
    This object contains configuration parameters such as price multipliers, duration
    settings, and other auction mechanics that are applied when no custom strategy
    is specified.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and inspect default auction strategy
    code: 'AuctionStrategy defaultStrategy = auctionManager->GetDefaultStrategy();

      printf("Default auction duration: %d seconds\n", defaultStrategy.GetDuration());

      printf("Default bid increment: %.2f\n", defaultStrategy.GetBidIncrement());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during system initialization or when setting
    up default auction configurations. The returned AuctionStrategy object should
    be treated as read-only since modifying it directly may affect global auction
    behavior.
