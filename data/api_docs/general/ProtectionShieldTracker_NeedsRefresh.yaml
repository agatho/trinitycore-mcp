  signature: bool ProtectionShieldTracker::NeedsRefresh() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the protection shield effect requires a refresh or update.
  description: The NeedsRefresh method evaluates the current state of a protection
    shield to determine if it needs to be refreshed or updated. This typically occurs
    when the shield's duration is nearing expiration or when its underlying conditions
    have changed. The method checks internal timers, buff states, and other relevant
    factors to make this determination. It is commonly used in combat systems to manage
    shield effects that provide temporary damage mitigation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the protection shield requires a refresh or update; otherwise
    returns false if the shield is still valid and does not need modification.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Shield Status Before Applying New Effect
    code: "if (shieldTracker.NeedsRefresh()) {\n    // Refresh the shield effect\n\
      \    shieldTracker.Refresh();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat updates or periodic tick events
    to ensure that protection shields remain active and effective. It may be used
    in conjunction with other shield management functions such as Apply(), Remove(),
    or Update().
