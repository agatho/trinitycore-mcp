documentation:
  brief: Finalizes spatial query optimizations at the end of each game frame
  description: The OnFrameEnd method is called at the conclusion of each game frame
    to complete and commit any pending spatial query optimizations performed by the
    SpatialQueryOptimizer. This method ensures that all spatial data structures are
    properly updated and that query results are finalized before the next frame begins.
    It typically handles cleanup operations, memory management, and synchronization
    of spatial data across multiple threads. The method is part of the core game loop
    and should not be called manually by external code.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other frame logic ...\n    spatialQueryOptimizer.OnFrameEnd();\n\
      \    // ... next frame logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically invoked by the TrinityCore framework during
    the game loop's frame end phase. Developers should not call this method directly
    unless implementing custom frame handling logic. The implementation may involve
    thread synchronization and memory cleanup operations.
