documentation:
  brief: Destroys the LineOfSightManager instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the LineOfSightManager class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the object's lifetime. This method ensures proper resource deallocation when the
    LineOfSightManager instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the
    context of TrinityCore, this manager likely handles line-of-sight calculations
    for various game entities such as NPCs, players, and objects, and its destructor
    will clean up internal data structures used for these computations. The method
    does not take any parameters and performs no return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of LineOfSightManager
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    LineOfSightManager manager;\n    // ... use\
      \ manager ...\n} // manager is automatically destroyed here"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called when the object goes out of scope or
    is deleted. It's important to ensure that no other objects hold references to
    this manager after it has been destroyed, as accessing such dangling references
    can lead to undefined behavior.
