  class: QuestPickup
  method: EnableAutoQuestPickup
  signature: void QuestPickup::EnableAutoQuestPickup(uint32 botGuid, bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables automatic quest pickup for a specified bot character.
  description: The EnableAutoQuestPickup method controls whether a bot character automatically
    picks up available quests from quest givers. When enabled, the bot will automatically
    accept and start quests without manual intervention. This functionality is typically
    used in automated bot systems or AI-driven gameplay scenarios within TrinityCore.
    The method operates on a per-bot basis using the bot's unique GUID to identify
    which character's quest pickup behavior should be modified.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character for which to enable
      or disable automatic quest pickup. This value must correspond to a valid bot
      character in the game world.
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      automatic quest pickup behavior for the specified bot.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable auto quest pickup for a bot
    code: QuestPickup::EnableAutoQuestPickup(12345, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable auto quest pickup for a bot
    code: QuestPickup::EnableAutoQuestPickup(67890, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal state flags within the QuestPickup system.
    It may not immediately affect quest pickup behavior if the bot is currently engaged
    in other activities or if quest conditions are not met. The change takes effect
    immediately upon calling the function.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid parameter refers to a valid bot character, as
    invalid GUIDs may cause undefined behavior or errors. This method should only
    be called for bot characters and not for player characters unless specifically
    designed for such use cases.
