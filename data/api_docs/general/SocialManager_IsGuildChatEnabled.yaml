documentation:
  brief: Checks whether guild chat is enabled for the player
  description: The IsGuildChatEnabled method determines if the player has enabled
    or disabled guild chat functionality in their client settings. This setting affects
    whether the player can receive and send messages to guild members through the
    in-game guild chat channel. The method returns a boolean value indicating the
    current state of the guild chat toggle. This functionality is part of the social
    communication system in TrinityCore, allowing players to control their chat preferences
    on a per-channel basis.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if guild chat is enabled for the player, false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check guild chat status
    code: "if (player->GetSocial()->IsGuildChatEnabled()) {\n    // Guild chat is\
      \ enabled\n    player->SendNotification(\"Guild chat is enabled\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Guild chat is disabled\n    player->SendNotification(\"Guild chat\
      \ is disabled\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a command handler to toggle guild chat
    code: "void HandleToggleGuildChatCommand(ChatHandler* handler) {\n    SocialManager*\
      \ social = handler->GetSession()->GetPlayer()->GetSocial();\n    if (social->IsGuildChatEnabled())\
      \ {\n        social->SetGuildChatEnabled(false);\n        handler->SendSysMessage(\"\
      Guild chat has been disabled.\");\n    } else {\n        social->SetGuildChatEnabled(true);\n\
      \        handler->SendSysMessage(\"Guild chat has been enabled.\");\n    }\n\
      }"

  notes: This method typically reflects the player's client-side setting and may be
    synchronized with server-side preferences. The implementation likely checks a
    flag stored in the player's social data structure that represents their chat channel
    preferences.
