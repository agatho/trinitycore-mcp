    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player meets the class requirements for a specified quest
  description: The ValidateClassRequirements method checks if a given player character
    satisfies the class-based prerequisites defined for a specific quest. This validation
    ensures that players can only accept quests that are appropriate for their character's
    class, as defined in the game's quest database. The method typically evaluates
    the quest's required class restrictions against the player's current class and
    returns a boolean result indicating whether the validation passes or fails. This
    check is crucial for maintaining game balance and ensuring that players follow
    the intended progression path.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to validate class requirements
      against
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose class
      requirements are being validated
  returns: Returns true if the player's class meets all requirements for the specified
    quest, false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Class Validation
    code: "uint32 questId = 12345;\nPlayer* player = ...; // Get player reference\n\
      bool isValid = QuestValidation::ValidateClassRequirements(questId, player);\n\
      if (isValid)\n{\n    // Player can accept the quest\n    player->AddQuest(questId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Accept Logic
    code: "bool CanPlayerAcceptQuest(Player* player, uint32 questId)\n{\n    // First\
      \ validate class requirements\n    if (!QuestValidation::ValidateClassRequirements(questId,\
      \ player))\n    {\n        player->SendNotification(\"You do not meet the class\
      \ requirements for this quest.\");\n        return false;\n    }\n    \n   \
      \ // Proceed with other validation checks...\n    return true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses the quest template data from the database to
    retrieve class restrictions. It's important to note that this validation occurs
    before quest acceptance, so it should be lightweight and efficient. The method
    may also consider player level requirements in conjunction with class requirements.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer will likely cause undefined behavior. Also, be aware that
    class restrictions might be combined with other requirements such as race or level,
    so this method should be part of a comprehensive quest validation system.
