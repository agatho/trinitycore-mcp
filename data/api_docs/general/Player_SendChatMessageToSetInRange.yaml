documentation:
  brief: Sends a chat message to all players within a specified range
  description: This method sends a chat message to all players in the player's set
    that are within the specified range, using the provided chat message type and
    language ID. The message is sent to players who are within the defined range and
    have the appropriate language enabled. This method is commonly used for sending
    messages to nearby players in World of Warcraft, particularly for communication
    between players in the same zone or instance.
  parameters:
  - name: chatMsg
    description: The chat message type identifier (e.g., CHAT_MSG_SAY, CHAT_MSG_YELL).
      Valid values are typically defined by the game's chat system and represent different
      message types.
  - name: lanugageId
    description: The language ID to use for the message. This should be a valid language
      identifier that corresponds to the player's language or a language that is supported
      in the current context.
  - name: text
    description: The text content of the message to send. This must be a valid string
      representing the actual message content, and should not exceed the maximum allowed
      length for chat messages.
  - name: range
    description: The range in yards within which players will receive the message.
      This determines how far away players can be from the sender to receive the message,
      with values typically ranging from 0 to 100 yards.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player;

      player->SendChatMessageToSetInRange(CHAT_MSG_SAY, 0, "Hello World!", 10.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player;

      player->SendChatMessageToSetInRange(CHAT_MSG_YELL, 1, "This is a yell message",
      50.0f);

      // This sends a message to all players within 50 yards who can hear the yell'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method uses the player''s set of nearby players
    to determine which players receive the message. The range parameter is used to
    filter players based on distance, and the language ID determines how the message
    is formatted for each recipient. Performance considerations: This method may impact
    performance if used frequently in high-traffic scenarios as it requires checking
    all players within range. Thread safety: This method should be thread-safe if
    used properly, but care must be taken when using it in multi-threaded environments.'
  warnings: Common mistakes include using invalid chat message types or language IDs
    which can cause the message to not be sent correctly. Dangerous edge cases include
    sending messages to players who are not within range or using incorrect language
    IDs that result in messages being sent with wrong formatting. The method may fail
    if the player's set is empty or if the range is set incorrectly.
