  class: LFGQueue
  method: GetJoinTime
  signature: time_t LFGQueue::GetJoinTime(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the timestamp when a player joined the LFG queue
  description: The GetJoinTime method returns the time_t value representing when a
    specific player joined the Looking For Group (LFG) queue. This timestamp is typically
    used to track how long players have been waiting in the queue, which can be important
    for queue management, player experience metrics, and balancing group compositions.
    The method takes a player's GUID as input and returns the corresponding join time.
    If the player is not found in the LFG queue, the behavior is undefined and may
    result in an invalid timestamp or assertion failure.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose join time is being
      retrieved. Must be a valid player GUID present in the LFG queue system.
  returns: A time_t value representing the Unix timestamp when the player joined the
    LFG queue. Returns 0 if the player is not found in the queue or if an error occurs
    during lookup.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve a player's join time from LFG queue
    code: "uint64 playerGuid = 123456789;\ntime_t joinTime = lfgQueue->GetJoinTime(playerGuid);\n\
      if (joinTime > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Player joined at: \" << joinTime <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n    std::cout << \"Player not found in LFG queue.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal LFG queue management system. It assumes
    that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid player currently in the LFG queue.
    The returned timestamp represents seconds since Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).
    This function should not be called with invalid or non-existent GUIDs without
    proper validation.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid GUID may lead to undefined behavior
    or assertion failures. Ensure that the player is actually in the LFG queue before
    calling this method. The returned timestamp should be validated for correctness
    before use in time-sensitive operations.
