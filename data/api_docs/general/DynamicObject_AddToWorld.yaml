documentation:
  brief: Adds the dynamic object to the game world, making it visible and active for
    players.
  description: The AddToWorld method integrates a DynamicObject into the game world's
    object management system. This method ensures that the dynamic object is properly
    registered with the map manager and becomes visible to players within its associated
    grid. It typically gets called after the object has been initialized and configured,
    but before it is expected to be interacted with by players or other game systems.
    The method performs necessary setup operations such as updating spatial positioning,
    registering with the grid system, and notifying relevant subsystems about the
    new object's presence.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell effect
    code: 'DynamicObject* dynObj = new DynamicObject();

      // Configure the dynamic object...

      dynObj->AddToWorld();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per object instance. Calling it multiple
    times may result in undefined behavior or memory issues. The object must have
    valid position and map data before calling AddToWorld.
  warnings: Do not call AddToWorld on a dynamic object that has already been added
    to the world, as this can cause double-registration issues. Ensure all required
    fields are initialized before invoking this method.
