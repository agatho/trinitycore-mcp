    & encounter)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates tank behavior during dungeon encounters by managing player positioning
    and threat distribution.
  description: The CoordinateTankBehavior method is responsible for handling the strategic
    positioning and threat management of a designated tank player within a dungeon
    encounter. This method ensures that the tank maintains proper positioning relative
    to the encounter's mechanics, manages aggro distribution among other players,
    and coordinates with the overall dungeon AI to optimize combat performance. It
    typically handles situations where the tank needs to be positioned for specific
    mechanics such as avoiding area-of-effect attacks or maintaining threat on a boss.
    The method operates within the context of TrinityCore's dungeon encounter system
    and interacts with the player's current state and the encounter's defined behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: tank
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the tank character who
      will be managed during the dungeon encounter. Must not be null and should represent
      a valid player in the current dungeon instance.
  - name: encounter
    description: Reference to the DungeonEncounter object that defines the current
      encounter mechanics, including positioning requirements, threat management rules,
      and encounter-specific behaviors that the tank must follow.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic tank coordination during boss encounter
    code: "void MyDungeonAI::OnEncounterStart(Player* tank, const DungeonEncounter&\
      \ encounter)\n{\n    dungeonBehavior.CoordinateTankBehavior(tank, encounter);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced tank coordination with custom positioning
    code: "void MyDungeonAI::HandleTankPositioning(Player* tank, const DungeonEncounter&\
      \ encounter)\n{\n    // Pre-condition: Tank must be in valid dungeon instance\n\
      \    if (!tank || !tank->GetMap() || !tank->GetMap()->IsDungeon())\n       \
      \ return;\n    \n    // Coordinate tank behavior with encounter mechanics\n\
      \    dungeonBehavior.CoordinateTankBehavior(tank, encounter);\n    \n    //\
      \ Post-condition: Tank should now be properly positioned for encounter\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's dungeon AI system and assumes that the
    DungeonEncounter object contains valid encounter data. The method may modify the
    tank's position, threat state, and behavior flags. It should only be called when
    a player is actively participating in a dungeon encounter with defined mechanics.
  warnings: Do not call this method without ensuring that both the tank player and
    encounter parameters are valid. Passing null pointers or invalid encounter data
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This method modifies the tank's state
    directly, so it should be used carefully in multi-threaded environments where
    player state changes need synchronization.
