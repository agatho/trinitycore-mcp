  method: ValidatePath
  signature: bool MovementValidator::ValidatePath(Player * bot, const MovementPath
    & path) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates a movement path for a player bot, ensuring it adheres to game mechanics
    and constraints.
  description: The ValidatePath method checks whether a given movement path for a
    player bot is valid according to World of Warcraft's movement rules and game mechanics.
    It evaluates the path for issues such as invalid waypoints, prohibited terrain,
    or movements that would violate game physics or restrictions. This method is typically
    used by AI systems to ensure bots move in a realistic and acceptable manner within
    the game world. The validation considers factors like line-of-sight, height differences,
    and proximity to obstacles or boundaries.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose movement
      path is being validated.
  - name: path
    description: Reference to a MovementPath object containing the waypoints and movement
      data to be validated.
  returns: Returns true if the movement path is valid and acceptable for the bot to
    follow, false otherwise. A return value of false indicates that at least one aspect
    of the path violates game rules or constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Validation
    code: "MovementPath path;\n// Populate path with waypoints\nif (validator.ValidatePath(playerBot,\
      \ path)) {\n    // Proceed with movement\n    playerBot->MoveTo(path);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle invalid path\n    LOG_ERROR(\"movement\", \"Invalid path\
      \ detected for bot {}\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Movement System
    code: "class BotAI {\npublic:\n    bool ExecuteMovement(const MovementPath& path)\
      \ {\n        if (!validator.ValidatePath(bot_, path)) {\n            return\
      \ false;\n        }\n        // Path is valid, proceed with execution\n    \
      \    bot_->MoveAlongPath(path);\n        return true;\n    }\nprivate:\n   \
      \ MovementValidator validator;\n    Player* bot_;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks such as collision detection, height validation,
    and boundary compliance. It may also consider the bot's current state (e.g., if
    it is flying or swimming) to adjust validation rules accordingly. The implementation
    might be computationally intensive due to complex path checking logic.
  warnings: Do not assume that a valid path will always result in successful movement;
    additional checks like target validity or resource availability may still be required.
    Passing null pointers for bot or path can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
