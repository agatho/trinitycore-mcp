  method: LogCombatMetrics
  signature: void ShamanAI::LogCombatMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Logs combat metrics for the shaman AI, including damage dealt, healing done,
    and spell usage statistics.
  description: The LogCombatMetrics method in the ShamanAI class records detailed
    combat performance data during player engagement. This includes tracking damage
    output, healing effectiveness, and spell casting efficiency for various shaman
    abilities. The method typically aggregates this information over a combat session
    or encounter and may store it for later analysis or reporting purposes. It is
    designed to support game analytics, performance optimization, and player progression
    tracking within the TrinityCore framework. The method does not require any specific
    preconditions but assumes that the AI has an active combat state with valid target
    entities.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void MyShamanAI::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    // Start combat and log initial\
      \ metrics\n    LogCombatMetrics();\n}\n\nvoid MyShamanAI::OnCombatEnd()\n{\n\
      \    // End combat and finalize metrics logging\n    LogCombatMetrics();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal combat tracking systems within
    TrinityCore. It may be called automatically during combat events or manually by
    other AI components. The actual logging mechanism (file output, database storage,
    or in-memory tracking) is not specified but would typically integrate with the
    server's performance monitoring infrastructure.
  warnings: Ensure that combat metrics are only logged when appropriate to avoid performance
    overhead during high-frequency combat scenarios. Improper use could lead to excessive
    memory consumption or disk I/O operations if not properly throttled.
