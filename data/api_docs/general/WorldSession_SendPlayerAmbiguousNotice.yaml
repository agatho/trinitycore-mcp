  method: SendPlayerAmbiguousNotice
  signature: void WorldSession::SendPlayerAmbiguousNotice(const std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a player ambiguous notice message to the client indicating that a player
    name is not unique in the game world.
  description: The SendPlayerAmbiguousNotice method sends a specific network message
    to the connected client informing them that the requested player name could not
    be uniquely identified. This typically occurs when multiple players share the
    same name or when a player name is ambiguous due to case sensitivity or other
    naming conventions. The method is used during operations such as whispering, friend
    requests, or targeting where a unique player identifier is required but cannot
    be resolved. It does not perform any validation on the input name and simply forwards
    it to the client for display purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The player name that could not be uniquely identified. This string
      is sent directly to the client without any internal processing or validation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending Ambiguous Notice for a Player Name
    code: "void HandleWhisperCommand(WorldSession* session, const std::string& targetName)\n\
      {\n    // Simulate checking if player exists and is ambiguous\n    if (IsPlayerNameAmbiguous(targetName))\n\
      \    {\n        session->SendPlayerAmbiguousNotice(targetName);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the server when a player name
    resolution fails. It's important to note that this method does not validate whether
    the name actually exists in the database or not; it simply notifies the client
    about ambiguity. The actual implementation may vary depending on how the TrinityCore
    server handles name resolution and messaging.
  warnings: This method should only be called when there is a genuine ambiguity with
    player names, otherwise it may confuse players. It's recommended to validate the
    name before calling this method to avoid unnecessary client notifications.
