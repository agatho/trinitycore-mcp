documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the Spell object associated with the specified spell ID from the
    trainer's available spells.
  description: The GetSpell method is used to retrieve a const pointer to a Spell
    object that corresponds to the given spell ID within the context of a Trainer.
    This method allows access to spell data such as spell properties, effects, and
    requirements without modifying the underlying spell definition. The returned Spell
    object is read-only and should not be modified directly. This functionality is
    commonly used in the context of NPC trainers where players can learn spells, and
    the trainer's available spell list needs to be queried for specific spell information.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the Spell object if a spell with the specified ID exists
    in the trainer's spell list; otherwise, returns nullptr if no matching spell is
    found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Spell Availability
    code: "Trainer* trainer = ...; // Assume trainer is initialized\nconst Spell*\
      \ spell = trainer->GetSpell(12345);\nif (spell != nullptr)\n{\n    // Spell\
      \ exists, proceed with logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Found spell: %u\", spell->Id);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Spell not available to this trainer\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Spell not found in trainer's list\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Spell Data for Validation
    code: "Trainer* trainer = ...;\nuint32 playerSpellId = 12345;\nconst Spell* spell\
      \ = trainer->GetSpell(playerSpellId);\nif (spell && spell->IsPassiveSpell())\n\
      {\n    // Handle passive spell logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Player attempting\
      \ to learn passive spell %u\", playerSpellId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation in the trainer's internal spell list.
    The performance is generally acceptable for typical use cases, but repeated calls
    on large trainers may impact performance if not cached appropriately. The returned
    Spell pointer is valid only as long as the trainer object exists and its spell
    list remains unchanged.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned Spell object as it is const. Modifying it could
    lead to undefined behavior or corruption of spell data. Ensure that the trainer
    object is properly initialized before calling this method, otherwise unexpected
    results may occur.
