  class: CreatureStaticFlagsHolder
  method: GetFlags4
  signature: int CreatureStaticFlagsHolder::GetFlags4() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the fourth set of static flags associated with a creature.
  description: The GetFlags4 method returns the integer value representing the fourth
    group of static flags stored within a CreatureStaticFlagsHolder object. These
    flags are typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to define specific
    behavioral or visual properties of creatures that do not change during runtime.
    The returned value is often interpreted as a bitmask, where individual bits correspond
    to specific creature attributes such as faction, movement type, or AI behavior.
    This method provides read-only access to the internal flag storage and should
    be used in conjunction with other GetFlags methods (e.g., GetFlags1, GetFlags2,
    GetFlags3) for complete creature flag enumeration.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the fourth set of static flags. The meaning
    of each bit within this integer depends on the game's internal flag definitions
    and may vary based on the creature type or specific implementation in the TrinityCore
    codebase.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieving Creature Static Flags
    code: "CreatureStaticFlagsHolder* flagsHolder = creature->GetCreatureStaticFlags();\n\
      int flags4 = flagsHolder->GetFlags4();\nif (flags4 & 0x10) // Example check\
      \ for a specific flag\n{\n    // Handle special behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the creature static flags system in TrinityCore, which
    is used to store persistent configuration data about creatures. The flags are
    typically loaded from database entries and remain constant throughout the creature's
    lifetime. Developers should be aware that flag values are not standardized across
    all creature types and may require reverse-engineering or documentation from the
    core project.
  warnings: Because this method returns raw integer flag values, it is crucial to
    understand the specific bit layout and meaning of each flag in context. Incorrect
    interpretation of flag bits can lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in creature
    AI or visual rendering. Always verify flag definitions against the TrinityCore
    source code or official documentation when possible.
