  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: GetDangerThreshold
  signature: float MechanicAwareness::GetDangerThreshold() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the danger threshold value used by the mechanic awareness system
    to determine threat levels.
  description: The GetDangerThreshold method retrieves the float value that represents
    the current danger threshold setting within the MechanicAwareness class. This
    threshold is typically used in AI behavior systems to evaluate when a unit's actions
    or presence pose a significant risk to other entities. The returned value influences
    decision-making processes related to combat engagement, avoidance, and threat
    assessment. This method does not modify any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current danger threshold. This value typically
    defines the minimum level of threat or danger required for specific AI behaviors
    to be triggered. The exact meaning and range depend on the implementation details
    of the MechanicAwareness system, but it commonly represents a normalized or scaled
    measure between 0.0 and 1.0.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float dangerThreshold = mechanicAwareness.GetDangerThreshold();\nif (dangerThreshold\
      \ > 0.7f)\n{\n    // Trigger high-threat behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Threshold Evaluation
    code: "MechanicAwareness awareness;\nfloat threshold = awareness.GetDangerThreshold();\n\
      float currentThreat = unit->GetThreat();\nif (currentThreat >= threshold)\n\
      {\n    // Initiate defensive or aggressive actions based on threshold\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is const and thread-safe, making it safe to call from multiple
    threads without synchronization. The returned value may be cached internally depending
    on the implementation, so frequent calls should not cause performance issues.
