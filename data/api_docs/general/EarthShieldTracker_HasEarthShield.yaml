documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has an active Earth Shield buff.
  description: The HasEarthShield method determines whether a specific player currently
    has the Earth Shield spell active on their character. This method is typically
    used within the context of Shaman class abilities, as Earth Shield is a shamanic
    spell that provides damage absorption and healing effects. The method performs
    a lookup in the internal tracking system to verify if the specified GUID corresponds
    to a player with an active Earth Shield buff. It returns true if the shield is
    active, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player identified by the GUID has an active Earth Shield
    buff; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (earthShieldTracker->HasEarthShield(playerGuid)) {\n    // Player has\
      \ Earth Shield active\n    SendSystemMessage(\"You have Earth Shield active.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Logic
    code: "void ShamanSpellHandler::HandleEarthShieldCast(Unit* caster, Unit* target)\
      \ {\n    if (!HasEarthShield(target->GetGUID().GetCounter())) {\n        //\
      \ Apply Earth Shield buff\n        ApplyEarthShieldBuff(target);\n    } else\
      \ {\n        // Player already has Earth Shield\n        SendSystemMessage(\"\
      You already have Earth Shield active.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of Earth Shield buffs and should
    only be called after the buff state has been properly initialized. The GUID parameter
    is expected to be a valid player identifier from the TrinityCore database system.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method corresponds to an actual player
    character, as passing invalid or non-player GUIDs may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect return values.
