  class: CellCache
  method: GetHostiles
  signature: int CellCache::GetHostiles() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of hostile units within the cached cell.
  description: The GetHostiles method returns an integer representing the count of
    hostile units currently present in the cell cache. This method is typically used
    by AI systems or game mechanics to determine the threat level or engagement status
    of a specific cell area. The returned value reflects the number of enemies that
    are considered hostile to the player or faction associated with the cell cache.
    This information can be crucial for pathfinding, combat decision-making, and threat
    assessment in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total count of hostile units found within the
    cached cell. Returns zero if no hostile units are present or if the cell cache
    is empty.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Hostile Count
    code: "CellCache cache;\nint hostileCount = cache.GetHostiles();\nif (hostileCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with combat or avoidance behavior\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Detected %d hostile units in cell.\", hostileCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on cached data and may not reflect real-time updates.
    The cell cache must be properly initialized before calling this method to avoid
    undefined behavior. Performance is generally efficient as it only returns a count
    without iterating through individual units.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or improperly populated CellCache
    instance may result in incorrect counts or undefined behavior. Ensure the cache
    contains valid data before invoking this method.
