  class: RoleAssignment
  method: OptimizeForQuesting
  signature: void RoleAssignment::OptimizeForQuesting(Group * group, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes group member roles for efficient questing by redistributing responsibilities
    based on player capabilities and quest requirements.
  description: The OptimizeForQuesting method adjusts the role assignments within
    a specified group to maximize quest completion efficiency. It analyzes each group
    member's current role, available resources, and the specific demands of the given
    quest ID to determine optimal role distribution. This process ensures that players
    are assigned roles such as main tank, healer, or damage dealer in a way that best
    supports the quest objectives. The method is typically invoked when a group begins
    a new quest or when significant changes occur in group composition or quest requirements.
    It modifies internal role assignments without requiring manual intervention from
    players.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the members whose roles will
      be optimized for questing. Must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest for which role optimization is being
      performed. Determines the required roles and capabilities needed for successful
      completion.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Optimization
    code: 'Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      RoleAssignment::OptimizeForQuesting(myGroup, questId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Optimization with Error Checking
    code: "if (player && player->GetGroup()) {\n    Group* group = player->GetGroup();\n\
      \    uint32 questId = 12345;\n    if (group->GetMembersCount() > 0) {\n    \
      \    RoleAssignment::OptimizeForQuesting(group, questId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies group member roles in-place and may trigger role change
    notifications to players. The optimization algorithm considers player class, specialization,
    gear level, and current role assignments when determining optimal distribution.
    Performance is generally low as it only processes role assignments for the specified
    group.
  warnings: Calling this method on a null group pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the group contains valid members before calling to avoid runtime errors.
    The optimization may override existing manual role assignments without warning.
