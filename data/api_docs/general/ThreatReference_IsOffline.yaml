  signature: bool ThreatReference::IsOffline() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the threat reference is marked as offline.
  description: The IsOffline method determines if a ThreatReference object represents
    an offline target. This is commonly used in AI systems to filter out inactive
    or disconnected players from threat calculations. The method typically checks
    internal state flags or connection status indicators to make this determination.
    It's important to note that this check may not reflect real-time network status
    but rather the last known state of the reference.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the threat reference is considered offline, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the target is disconnected or inactive from the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Reference Offline Check
    code: "if (threatRef.IsOffline()) {\n    // Handle offline target\n    printf(\"\
      Target is offline\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Continue with normal threat processing\n\
      \    printf(\"Target is online\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal tracking of player connection states
    rather than real-time network checks. The offline state may be updated asynchronously,
    so immediate consistency with actual network status cannot be guaranteed.
