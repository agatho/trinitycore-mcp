  method: GetSession
  signature: ProfilingSession BotProfiler::GetSession(uint64_t sessionId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a profiling session by its unique identifier from the BotProfiler
    instance.
  description: The GetSession method retrieves a specific ProfilingSession object
    associated with the provided sessionId. This method is typically used to access
    previously created or stored profiling data for analysis or debugging purposes
    within the TrinityCore framework. The method operates on a const instance, indicating
    it does not modify internal state. It assumes that the session identifier is valid
    and corresponds to an existing profiling session in the system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ProfilingSession object representing the requested profiling session.
    If the sessionId does not correspond to any existing session, behavior is undefined
    and may result in an invalid or default-constructed session object.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve a specific profiling session
    code: "uint64_t sessionId = 12345;\nProfilingSession session = botProfiler.GetSession(sessionId);\n\
      // Use the session data for analysis\nif (session.IsValid()) {\n    // Process\
      \ profiling data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using a map or similar container structure
    to store and retrieve profiling sessions by their unique identifiers. The const
    qualifier indicates that this operation does not alter the BotProfiler's internal
    state, making it safe for concurrent read access.
  warnings: Calling GetSession with an invalid or non-existent sessionId may return
    an undefined session object. Always verify the validity of returned sessions before
    using them to prevent runtime errors or unexpected behavior.
