  class: SpellInterruptAction
  method: ExecuteDeathKnightInterrupt
  signature: ActionResult SpellInterruptAction::ExecuteDeathKnightInterrupt(BotAI
    * ai, ::Unit * target, uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Interrupts a target unit's spell casting if the spell is interruptible and
    meets Death Knight-specific conditions.
  description: The ExecuteDeathKnightInterrupt method is designed to handle spell
    interruption logic specifically for Death Knights within the TrinityCore AI framework.
    It evaluates whether a given spell on a target unit can be interrupted, taking
    into account Death Knight class mechanics such as the ability to interrupt spells
    with specific properties. The method typically checks if the spell being cast
    by the target is of a type that can be interrupted and ensures the conditions
    for a successful interruption are met. This includes verifying that the spell
    ID corresponds to an interruptible spell and that the AI has sufficient resources
    or conditions to perform the action. It's commonly used in bot AI behavior trees
    to manage combat interactions where spell interruption plays a key role.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance managing the Death Knight bot's behavior
      and decision-making logic.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target whose spell casting
      is to be interrupted.
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell being cast by the target that
      may be interrupted. Used to determine if the spell is interruptible.
  returns: Returns an ActionResult indicating whether the spell interruption was successful
    or failed. Possible values include SUCCESS, FAILED, or other status codes depending
    on internal logic and conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a Death Knight AI context
    code: "ActionResult result = interruptAction.ExecuteDeathKnightInterrupt(ai, target,\
      \ 47476); // Interrupt Frost Fever\nif (result == SUCCESS) {\n    ai->GetBot()->GetMotionMaster()->Clear();\n\
      \    ai->GetBot()->CastSpell(target, 47476, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with spell type validation
    code: "if (target && target->IsInCombat()) {\n    uint32 currentSpellId = target->GetCurrentSpell(CURRENT_CHANNELED_SPELL);\n\
      \    if (currentSpellId) {\n        ActionResult result = interruptAction.ExecuteDeathKnightInterrupt(ai,\
      \ target, currentSpellId);\n        if (result == SUCCESS) {\n            ai->GetBot()->Say(\"\
      Interrupted enemy spell!\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger AI system that manages Death Knight-specific
    behaviors. It assumes the target unit has an active spell cast and that the AI
    has access to appropriate resources or cooldowns for spell interruption. The method
    may be called from within combat decision trees, and its behavior can be extended
    by overriding or modifying related spell interruption logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the target is valid and actively casting a spell before calling
    this method; otherwise, it may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also, be
    cautious when using spell IDs that are not known to be interruptible, as they
    may cause unexpected results.
