  brief: Removes the player from the game world by disconnecting the client and cleaning
    up player-related data.
  description: The RemoveFromWorld method removes the player character from the active
    game world by disconnecting the client connection and performing necessary cleanup
    operations. This method is typically invoked when a player logs out, is kicked,
    or when the server needs to remove a player from the world for various reasons
    such as server shutdown or player deletion. The method ensures that all player-related
    data is properly cleared from memory and that the player's connection is terminated
    without leaving any dangling references.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->RemoveFromWorld();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called only when the player is no longer needed in
    the game world. It performs cleanup operations such as removing the player from
    the world's object list, clearing player-related data structures, and disconnecting
    the client connection. The method is typically invoked during logout or server
    shutdown scenarios.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method can lead to memory leaks or dangling references
    if not properly handled. It should only be called when the player is no longer
    active in the game world. Avoid calling this method multiple times on the same
    player object as it may cause undefined behavior.
