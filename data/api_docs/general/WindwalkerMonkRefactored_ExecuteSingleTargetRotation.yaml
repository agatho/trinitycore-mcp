  method: ExecuteSingleTargetRotation
  signature: void WindwalkerMonkRefactored::ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the Windwalker Monk single-target rotation logic for the current
    target.
  description: The ExecuteSingleTargetRotation method implements the core single-target
    combat rotation for a Windwalker Monk class in TrinityCore. This method determines
    and executes the appropriate abilities based on the current combat state, resource
    levels, and cooldowns. It typically involves managing chi generation, applying
    damage-over-time effects, and utilizing key abilities such as Tiger Palm, Blackout
    Kick, and Spinning Crane Kick. The method assumes a valid target exists and that
    the Monk is in combat mode. This function is usually called during the AI's update
    cycle to maintain optimal rotation performance.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or index
      within the combat system. Must be a valid target that exists and is in combat.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void WindwalkerMonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target =\
      \ SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n    {\n        ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(&target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the Monk is actively engaged in combat
    with a valid target. The implementation assumes that all necessary checks for
    ability availability and resource management are handled internally or pre-checked
    before calling.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid and points to an actual combatant
    before invoking this method, as passing an invalid target may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes.
