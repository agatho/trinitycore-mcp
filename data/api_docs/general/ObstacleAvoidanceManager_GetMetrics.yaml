  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: GetMetrics
  signature: const AvoidanceMetrics & ObstacleAvoidanceManager::GetMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current avoidance metrics collected by the obstacle avoidance
    manager.
  description: The GetMetrics method provides access to a structured set of performance
    and behavior data related to obstacle avoidance calculations. This includes statistics
    such as the number of avoidance attempts, successful evasions, average processing
    time, and other relevant metrics that help monitor and optimize the AI's pathfinding
    and collision avoidance capabilities. The returned AvoidanceMetrics object is
    read-only and reflects the internal state of the manager at the time of the call.
    This method is typically used for debugging, performance analysis, or integration
    with monitoring systems to ensure the avoidance system operates efficiently.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an AvoidanceMetrics object containing detailed
    statistics about obstacle avoidance behavior and performance.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Obstacle Avoidance Metrics
    code: "const AvoidanceMetrics& metrics = obstacleAvoidanceManager.GetMetrics();\n\
      TC_LOG_INFO(\"ai\", \"Avoidance attempts: %u, Successful evasions: %u\", \n\
      \            metrics.attempts, metrics.successfulEvasions);"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to internal data managed by the ObstacleAvoidanceManager.
    It is safe to use for reading but should not be modified directly. The metrics
    are updated incrementally during avoidance calculations and may change between
    calls.
