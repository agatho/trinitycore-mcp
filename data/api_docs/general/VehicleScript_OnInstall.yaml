api:
  class: VehicleScript
  method: OnInstall
  signature: void VehicleScript::OnInstall(Vehicle * veh)
documentation:
  brief: Executes custom logic when a vehicle is installed onto a player.
  description: The OnInstall method is a callback function invoked by the TrinityCore
    framework when a vehicle is successfully installed onto a player character. This
    method allows developers to implement custom behavior such as applying buffs,
    modifying player stats, or triggering quest events when a vehicle is mounted.
    The method is part of the VehicleScript class and is typically overridden in custom
    vehicle scripts to provide specific functionality. It is important to note that
    this method is called during the vehicle installation process and should not be
    used for heavy computations as it may impact performance.
  parameters:
  - name: veh
    description: Pointer to the Vehicle object that has been installed onto a player.
      This parameter represents the vehicle instance being mounted by the player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vehicle Installation Script
    code: "class MyVehicleScript : public VehicleScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyVehicleScript()\
      \ : VehicleScript(\"MyVehicleScript\") {}\n\n    void OnInstall(Vehicle* veh)\
      \ override\n    {\n        if (!veh)\n            return;\n\n        Player*\
      \ player = veh->GetPassenger(0);\n        if (player)\n        {\n         \
      \   // Apply a custom buff when vehicle is installed\n            player->CastSpell(player,\
      \ 12345, true);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during the vehicle mounting process and should be used
    for lightweight operations. Avoid performing expensive calculations or database
    queries within this function to maintain server performance.
  warnings: Do not modify the vehicle object directly in this method as it may cause
    instability. Ensure that the vehicle pointer is valid before accessing its members
    to prevent null pointer exceptions.
