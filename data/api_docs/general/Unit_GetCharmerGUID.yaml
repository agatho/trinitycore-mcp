  method: GetCharmerGUID
  signature: int Unit::GetCharmerGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the unit's charmer, if any.
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of the entity that
    has charmed the current unit. In World of Warcraft terms, a charmer is an entity
    that controls another unit through mind control or similar effects. The method
    returns 0 if no charmer exists, making it useful for determining whether a unit
    is under mind control or similar charm effects. This function is typically used
    in conjunction with other unit-related methods to track the relationship between
    units and their controllers.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the GUID of the charmer if one exists, otherwise returns 0. The
    GUID represents the unique identifier of the entity that controls this unit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (unit->GetCharmerGUID() != 0)\n{\n    // Unit is charmed\n    // Do\
      \ something with the charmer GUID\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Unit is not charmed\n\
      \    // Perform alternative actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Unit class and should be used carefully when checking
    for charm effects. It may return 0 even if a unit is under mind control, depending
    on how the system handles such cases internally.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in conjunction with other methods that
    might modify or reset GUIDs, as it could lead to unexpected behavior if not handled
    properly.
