  class: PossessedAI
  method: UpdateAI
  signature: void PossessedAI::UpdateAI(int param0)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the possessed AI behavior based on the provided time delta parameter.
  description: The UpdateAI method is responsible for executing the core logic of
    a possessed creature's artificial intelligence. It handles decision-making, movement,
    and combat behaviors when a player possesses a creature. This method is called
    regularly by the game engine to ensure the possessed creature responds appropriately
    to changes in its environment or state. The parameter represents the time elapsed
    since the last update, allowing for smooth and consistent AI behavior regardless
    of frame rate fluctuations. This method typically manages target selection, movement
    patterns, spell casting, and other AI-driven actions specific to possessed creatures.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Time delta in milliseconds since the last AI update. Used for time-based
      calculations and smooth animation transitions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateAI Call
    code: "void MyPossessedCreature::UpdateAI(int diff)\n{\n    PossessedAI::UpdateAI(diff);\n\
      \    // Additional custom AI logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Custom AI Logic with Time Delta
    code: "void CustomPossessedAI::UpdateAI(int diff)\n{\n    if (m_updateTimer <=\
      \ 0)\n    {\n        // Perform AI actions based on time delta\n        DoCombatAction();\n\
      \        m_updateTimer = 1000; // Reset timer\n    }\n    else\n    {\n    \
      \    m_updateTimer -= diff;\n    }\n    PossessedAI::UpdateAI(diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically called by the TrinityCore framework and should
    not be invoked directly unless implementing custom AI logic. The time delta parameter
    ensures that AI behavior remains consistent across different performance conditions.
    Be aware that possessed creatures have limited AI capabilities compared to regular
    creatures, focusing primarily on basic movement and combat behaviors.
  warnings: Do not modify the time delta parameter as it's used for internal timing
    calculations. Incorrect handling of the time delta can cause erratic AI behavior
    or performance issues. This method should only be overridden in custom AI implementations,
    not called directly from other code.
