  class: InteractionManager
  method: SetInteractionDelay
  signature: void InteractionManager::SetInteractionDelay(uint32 delayMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the interaction delay for the interaction manager.
  description: The SetInteractionDelay method configures the delay period in milliseconds
    that must pass before another interaction can occur. This is commonly used to
    prevent spamming or rapid successive interactions with game objects, NPCs, or
    other entities. The delay is typically applied after an interaction has been initiated
    and before the next interaction can be processed. This mechanism helps maintain
    game balance and prevents exploitation through rapid repeated actions.
  parameters:
  - name: delayMs
    description: The delay time in milliseconds to set for interactions. Valid values
      are non-negative integers representing the time duration between interactions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a 1-second interaction delay
    code: 'InteractionManager* manager = player->GetInteractionManager();

      manager->SetInteractionDelay(1000); // 1 second delay'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disabling interaction delay
    code: 'InteractionManager* manager = player->GetInteractionManager();

      manager->SetInteractionDelay(0); // No delay'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the internal state of the InteractionManager
    and may be used in conjunction with other interaction-related methods. The delay
    value is stored internally as a uint32 and represents the minimum time interval
    between successive interactions.
