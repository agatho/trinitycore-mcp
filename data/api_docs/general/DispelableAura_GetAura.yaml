documentation:
  brief: Returns the Aura object associated with this DispelableAura instance
  description: The GetAura method retrieves and returns a pointer to the Aura object
    that this DispelableAura instance represents. This method is typically used in
    the context of aura management within TrinityCore's spell system, where DispelableAura
    serves as a wrapper or container for aura data that can be dispelled. The returned
    Aura pointer allows access to various properties and methods of the underlying
    aura, such as its duration, stack count, caster, and effects. This method is essential
    for implementing dispel mechanics and aura-specific logic in spell handlers and
    event systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Aura object associated with this DispelableAura instance.
    Returns nullptr if the DispelableAura does not contain a valid aura reference
    or if the aura has been removed/deleted.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Effect Handler
    code: "void HandleDispelEffect(Unit* caster, Unit* target)\n{\n    if (DispelableAura*\
      \ dispelAura = target->GetDispelableAura(SPELL_AURA_TYPE))\n    {\n        Aura*\
      \ aura = dispelAura->GetAura();\n        if (aura)\n        {\n            //\
      \ Process the aura for removal\n            target->RemoveAura(aura);\n    \
      \    }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Aura Validity Before Access
    code: "DispelableAura* dispelAura = player->GetDispelableAura(SPELL_AURA_POISON);\n\
      if (dispelAura)\n{\n    Aura* aura = dispelAura->GetAura();\n    if (aura &&\
      \ aura->GetCaster() == caster)\n    {\n        // Safe to proceed with dispel\
      \ logic\n        aura->SetDuration(0); // Instantly remove\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple pointer retrieval and does not modify the aura
    state. The returned Aura pointer is valid only as long as the DispelableAura instance
    remains in scope and the underlying aura has not been destroyed. Developers should
    always check for null returns before dereferencing the returned pointer to prevent
    segmentation faults.
  warnings: Never assume that the returned Aura pointer is valid without checking
    for null. The DispelableAura may be in an invalid state if the aura was already
    removed or if the instance was improperly initialized. Accessing a destroyed aura
    through this method results in undefined behavior.
