  class: BotPopulationManager
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool BotPopulationManager::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot population manager, setting up internal data structures
    and preparing for bot creation and management.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the BotPopulationManager for use by
    initializing internal data structures, loading configuration settings, and ensuring
    all necessary resources are allocated. This method should be called once during
    server startup or when the bot system is first enabled. It performs essential
    setup tasks such as validating required files, initializing random number generators,
    and preparing lookup tables for bot behavior patterns. The method returns true
    if initialization was successful, false otherwise. If initialization fails, subsequent
    calls to bot-related methods may not behave correctly until a successful re-initialization
    occurs.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initialization completed successfully and all internal
    components are ready for use; returns false if any critical error occurred during
    setup, such as missing configuration files or allocation failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "BotPopulationManager* botMgr = new BotPopulationManager();\nif (botMgr->Initialize())\
      \ {\n    // Bot system is ready for use\n    printf(\"Bot population manager\
      \ initialized successfully.\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n\
      \    printf(\"Failed to initialize bot population manager.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the application lifecycle.
    Repeated calls may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks. The method
    performs blocking operations and may take several seconds to complete depending
    on system resources and configuration complexity.
  warnings: Do not call this method from multiple threads simultaneously as it is
    not thread-safe. Failure to initialize properly can lead to crashes or corrupted
    data when attempting to create or manage bots later.
