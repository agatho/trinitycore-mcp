documentation:
  brief: Handles defensive ability usage for Demon Hunter AI during combat.
  description: The HandleDefensives method manages the application of defensive abilities
    and cooldowns for a Demon Hunter AI character. This method evaluates the current
    combat state, target threat levels, and available defensive resources to determine
    when and which defensive abilities should be activated. It integrates with the
    overall AI decision-making process to ensure optimal use of defensive mechanics
    such as Shadow Blades, Blur, or other class-specific defensive spells based on
    encounter conditions and player health status.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    HandleDefensives();\n    // Other AI logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the UpdateAI loop and should not be
    invoked manually unless implementing custom AI behavior. It relies on internal
    state tracking of health, threat, and ability cooldowns.
