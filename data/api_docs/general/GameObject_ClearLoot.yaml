documentation:
  brief: Clears all loot from the GameObject, removing any previously generated loot
    items.
  description: The ClearLoot method removes all loot entries from a GameObject's loot
    table, effectively resetting the loot system for that specific object. This method
    is typically used during game mechanics operations such as respawn events or when
    a GameObject needs to be reset for new loot generation. It ensures that no previous
    loot items remain on the GameObject, allowing for fresh loot to be generated upon
    subsequent loot attempts. The method operates on the GameObject's internal loot
    data structure, clearing all associated loot entries without affecting other GameObject
    properties.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clear Loot Example
    code: 'GameObject* go = GetGameObject();

      go->ClearLoot();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully during game events or when resetting
    GameObjects, as it removes all loot entries and may impact gameplay mechanics
    if not handled properly. Performance-wise, this operation is lightweight but can
    affect the loot system if called frequently during gameplay.
  warnings: Calling ClearLoot on a GameObject that has already been looted by players
    may result in loss of loot items that were already distributed to players. This
    method should be used with caution during active game events or when resetting
    GameObjects for new loot generation.
