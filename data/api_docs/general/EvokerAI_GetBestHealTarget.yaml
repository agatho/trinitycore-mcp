  class: EvokerAI
  method: GetBestHealTarget
  signature: int * EvokerAI::GetBestHealTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the GUID of the most beneficial target for healing
    within the Evoker's current threat list or raid composition.
  description: The GetBestHealTarget method evaluates the current state of the Evoker's
    target selection, considering factors such as health percentage, proximity, and
    threat level to identify the optimal unit to cast healing spells on. This method
    is typically used by the Evoker AI to dynamically select targets for healing abilities
    in both solo and group scenarios. It prioritizes units that are critically low
    on health or under immediate threat while ensuring that the selected target remains
    within the effective range of healing abilities. The returned GUID corresponds
    to a valid GameObject or Unit object within the game world, which can be used
    to initiate healing actions. This method does not modify any internal state but
    rather performs a read-only evaluation of the current healing priority.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID (Global Unique Identifier)
    of the most suitable target for healing. Returns NULL if no valid healing target
    is found within the specified criteria or if the AI has no valid targets available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Evoker AI Logic
    code: "void EvokerAI::DoHeal()\n{\n    int* targetGuid = GetBestHealTarget();\n\
      \    if (targetGuid != nullptr)\n    {\n        Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*me,\
      \ *targetGuid);\n        if (target && target->IsAlive())\n        {\n     \
      \       // Cast healing spell on the selected target\n            DoCast(target,\
      \ SPELL_HEALING_SPELL);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies heavily on the AI's internal threat management system
    and may return different targets based on real-time changes in health status or
    proximity. The returned GUID should always be validated before use to ensure the
    target is still valid and alive.
  warnings: Ensure that the returned GUID is not null before attempting to retrieve
    the associated Unit object, as failure to do so may result in a crash or undefined
    behavior. Additionally, this method does not account for cooldowns or mana costs
    of healing spells directly; those checks must be handled separately by calling
    code.
