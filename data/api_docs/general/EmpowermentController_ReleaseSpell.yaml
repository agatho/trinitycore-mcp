documentation:
  brief: Releases a spell from the empowerment controller, freeing up resources and
    ending its active state.
  description: The ReleaseSpell method is responsible for releasing a spell that has
    been previously acquired or activated within the EmpowermentController. This action
    typically involves cleaning up internal references, resetting spell states, and
    ensuring that any resources associated with the spell are properly freed. The
    method is commonly used when a spell's duration ends, is interrupted, or when
    the controller needs to transition to a different spell state. It ensures proper
    memory management and prevents resource leaks in the game's spell system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Release
    code: 'EmpowermentController controller;

      controller.ReleaseSpell();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after a spell has been properly initialized
    and activated within the controller. Calling it without prior activation may result
    in undefined behavior or resource access violations.
  warnings: Do not call ReleaseSpell on a spell that has already been released, as
    this could lead to double-free errors or memory corruption. Ensure proper state
    tracking before invoking this method.
