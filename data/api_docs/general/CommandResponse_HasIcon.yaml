  class: CommandResponse
  method: HasIcon
  signature: bool CommandResponse::HasIcon() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the command response has an associated icon.
  description: The HasIcon method checks if the CommandResponse object contains an
    icon identifier. This is typically used in the context of in-game command responses
    where certain commands may display visual icons alongside their text output. The
    method returns true if an icon is present, and false otherwise. This functionality
    supports the visual feedback system for game commands, allowing for richer user
    interaction within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the command response has an associated icon; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Command Response Has Icon
    code: "CommandResponse response;\n// ... populate response with data ...\nif (response.HasIcon())\
      \ {\n    // Handle case where response includes an icon\n    std::cout << \"\
      Response includes an icon.\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle case where\
      \ response does not include an icon\n    std::cout << \"Response has no icon.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the command handling system in TrinityCore and is
    typically used alongside other CommandResponse methods to build complete command
    feedback. The presence of an icon may depend on the specific command type or configuration
    settings within the game server.
