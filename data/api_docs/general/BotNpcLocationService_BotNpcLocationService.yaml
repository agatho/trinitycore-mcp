  brief: Copies the state of another BotNpcLocationService instance to this instance.
  description: This is a copy constructor for the BotNpcLocationService class. It
    initializes the current instance with the values from another BotNpcLocationService
    object. The method performs a deep copy of all relevant data members, ensuring
    that the new instance is an independent copy of the source object. This is commonly
    used when creating new instances based on existing ones, particularly in AI behavior
    systems where multiple bot NPCs need to maintain their own location data while
    sharing similar configurations. The constructor ensures proper initialization
    of internal data structures related to NPC location tracking and management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new BotNpcLocationService from an existing one
    code: 'BotNpcLocationService originalService;

      // ... initialize originalService ...

      BotNpcLocationService newService(originalService); // Copy constructor usage'
    language: cpp
  notes: This copy constructor is essential for maintaining data integrity when duplicating
    bot NPC location services. It ensures that each instance maintains its own independent
    state while preserving the configuration and data from the source object.
