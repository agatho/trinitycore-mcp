  signature: void MountManager::InitializeDraenorMounts()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes Draenor-specific mount data and configurations for the MountManager.
  description: The InitializeDraenorMounts method sets up all necessary mount-related
    data and configurations specific to the Draenor expansion within the TrinityCore
    framework. This includes loading mount templates, setting up faction-specific
    mounts, configuring mount appearance data, and ensuring proper integration with
    the player's mount collection system. The method is typically invoked during server
    initialization or when a new character is created to ensure that all Draenor-era
    mounts are properly registered and available for use. It handles internal data
    structures required for mount tracking, unlocking, and display within the game
    interface.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'MountManager mountMgr;

      mountMgr.InitializeDraenorMounts();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or character
    creation. It modifies internal mount data structures and is not thread-safe. The
    method assumes that the necessary database tables and expansion data are already
    loaded.
  warnings: Do not call this method multiple times without proper cleanup, as it may
    cause duplicate mount entries. Ensure all prerequisite data (like mount templates)
    are loaded before invoking this method.
