  brief: Resets reputation caps for all guilds in the realm
  description: The ResetReputationCaps method clears and resets the reputation cap
    limits for all guilds within the TrinityCore realm. This function is typically
    invoked during specific game events or server maintenance periods to ensure that
    guild reputation systems are properly initialized or reset. The method iterates
    through all existing guilds and resets their individual reputation tracking states,
    effectively clearing any accumulated reputation caps that may have been set previously.
    This operation affects the entire guild system and should be used carefully during
    appropriate maintenance windows.

    and should not be invoked during active gameplay sessions.
  warnings: Calling this method during active gameplay can result in unexpected behavior
    with guild reputation tracking. Ensure all guild members are notified of potential
    temporary reputation resets.
