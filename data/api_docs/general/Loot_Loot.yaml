documentation:
  brief: Moves loot data from a source loot object to the current loot instance.
  description: The Loot::Loot constructor (or assignment operator) is used to transfer
    ownership of loot data from one Loot object to another. This method performs a
    move operation, which efficiently transfers resources such as item entries, quantities,
    and loot templates from the source object to the target object without copying
    the underlying data. This is particularly useful in scenarios where temporary
    or intermediate loot objects are created during loot generation processes, allowing
    for efficient resource management and avoiding unnecessary deep copies. The method
    is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore framework during loot distribution
    logic.

  examples:
  - title: Move Loot Object
    code: 'Loot sourceLoot;

      // ... populate sourceLoot with items ...

      Loot targetLoot = std::move(sourceLoot); // Move constructor

      // sourceLoot is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method implements move semantics, which means that after the operation,
    the source object will be left in a valid but undefined state. It's important
    to not use the moved-from object afterward unless it's properly reset or reassigned.
    The implementation leverages C++11 move semantics for performance optimization.
  warnings: Using this method on an already moved-from object results in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the source object is not used after a move operation. This
    constructor should only be called with rvalue references to avoid accidental copying.
