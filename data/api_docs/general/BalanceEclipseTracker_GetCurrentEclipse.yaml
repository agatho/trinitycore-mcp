documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current eclipse state of the player
  description: The GetCurrentEclipse method returns the current eclipse state for
    a Balance Druid character. This state represents whether the druid is in solar
    eclipse, lunar eclipse, or no eclipse. The eclipse state affects spell behavior
    and damage multipliers for Balance Druid abilities. This method does not modify
    any internal state and is purely a getter function that provides read-only access
    to the current eclipse condition.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'Returns an EclipseState enum value indicating the current eclipse condition:
    SOLAR_ECLIPSE, LUNAR_ECLIPSE, or NO_ECLIPSE. The return value determines how certain
    Balance Druid spells will behave in terms of damage and effects.'
  examples:
  - title: Check Current Eclipse State
    code: "EclipseState eclipse = player->GetBalanceEclipseTracker()->GetCurrentEclipse();\n\
      if (eclipse == SOLAR_ECLIPSE)\n{\n    // Handle solar eclipse logic\n    SendChatMessage(\"\
      In Solar Eclipse!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other eclipse-related functions
    to determine spell behavior. The eclipse state can change dynamically during combat
    based on spell usage and game mechanics.
