documentation:
  brief: Sets the loot mode for the game object, determining how loot is distributed
    among players.
  description: This method configures the loot mode for a GameObject, which controls
    how loot is distributed among players when the object is looted. The loot mode
    determines whether players receive loot individually or as a group, and affects
    the distribution of items based on the game's loot system rules. This method is
    typically used during object creation or modification to set the appropriate loot
    behavior for different types of game objects.
  parameters:
  - name: lootMode
    description: The loot mode value to set for the GameObject. Valid values are 1-255,
      where 1 represents default loot mode (individual loot), and higher values represent
      various special loot modes such as group loot or roll loot.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Loot Mode to Group Loot
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->SetLootMode(2); // Sets the loot mode to group loot'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Default Loot Mode
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->SetLootMode(1); // Sets default loot mode for individual loot'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically called during GameObject creation or modification,
    and affects how loot is distributed among players. The loot mode directly influences
    the behavior of the loot system in World of Warcraft.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect loot distribution, where
    players may not receive items as intended. Care should be taken when setting loot
    modes for different types of objects.
