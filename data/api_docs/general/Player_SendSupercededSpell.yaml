documentation:
  brief: Sends a superceded spell notification to the player, indicating that an old
    spell has been replaced by a new one.
  description: This method sends a notification to the player's client informing them
    that a previously learned spell has been superseded by another spell. The method
    is typically used during spell learning or spell replacement scenarios where a
    player's old spell is replaced with a new one, such as when learning new spell
    ranks or when certain game mechanics require updating the player's spell knowledge.
    It ensures that the client receives proper updates about spell changes and maintains
    synchronization between server and client.

  notes: This method likely triggers a client-side update that modifies the player's
    spellbook or spell list. It should be used carefully to avoid sending unnecessary
    updates to players, especially during rapid spell learning sequences. The method
    may also be used in conjunction with other spell-related methods like SendSpellLearned.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to client-side inconsistencies or
    incorrect spell updates. Care should be taken when calling this method during
    spell learning processes to ensure proper sequence handling.
