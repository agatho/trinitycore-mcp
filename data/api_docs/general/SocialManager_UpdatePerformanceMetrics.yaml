documentation:
  brief: Updates internal performance metrics for social system operations
  description: The UpdatePerformanceMetrics method collects and processes timing data
    for various social system activities such as friend list operations, ignore list
    management, and communication handling. This method is typically invoked periodically
    to maintain accurate performance statistics that can be used for debugging, optimization,
    or monitoring server health. The collected metrics help identify bottlenecks in
    the social subsystem and ensure optimal resource utilization during high-traffic
    scenarios.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = sSocialMgr;

      socialMgr->UpdatePerformanceMetrics();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the server's main loop or performance
    monitoring system. It may have minimal performance impact as it only collects
    timing data without modifying any core state.
