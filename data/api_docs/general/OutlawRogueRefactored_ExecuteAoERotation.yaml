  class: OutlawRogueRefactored
  method: ExecuteAoERotation
  signature: void OutlawRogueRefactored::ExecuteAoERotation(int * target, uint32 enemyCount)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the outlaw rogue's ability rotation for AoE combat scenarios.
  description: The ExecuteAoERotation method implements the core logic for an outlaw
    rogue's ability usage during area-of-effect (AoE) encounters. This method evaluates
    the current combat environment, including enemy count and target availability,
    to determine optimal ability application. It prioritizes abilities such as Fan
    of Knives, Sinister Strike, and other AoE-capable skills based on resource management
    and cooldown states. The method is designed to maximize damage output while maintaining
    efficient energy or combo point usage in multi-target scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an array of target identifiers for the current combat
      situation. Each element represents a valid enemy unit that can be targeted by
      AoE abilities.
  - name: enemyCount
    description: The total number of enemies currently within the rogue's attack range
      and line of sight. This value determines how many targets will be processed
      during rotation execution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AoE Rotation Execution
    code: 'int targets[5] = {1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005};

      uint32 count = 5;

      rogue->ExecuteAoERotation(targets, count);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Target Management
    code: 'std::vector<int> enemies;

      // Populate enemies vector with valid target IDs

      uint32 enemyCount = static_cast<uint32>(enemies.size());

      rogue->ExecuteAoERotation(enemies.data(), enemyCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the rogue has already established a valid combat
    state and that all targets are within appropriate range. The implementation does
    not handle target selection or validity checks directly; these must be performed
    prior to calling this function. Performance is optimized for up to 10 simultaneous
    enemies, though behavior may degrade with higher numbers due to increased processing
    overhead.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper preconditions may result in invalid
    memory access or incorrect ability usage. Ensure that target pointers are valid
    and enemyCount does not exceed allocated buffer size. This function modifies internal
    rogue state variables and should not be called concurrently from multiple threads.
