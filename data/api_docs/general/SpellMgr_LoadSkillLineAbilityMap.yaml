documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes the mapping of spell abilities to skill lines for the
    TrinityCore spell system.
  description: The LoadSkillLineAbilityMap method is responsible for populating the
    internal data structures that map spell abilities to their corresponding skill
    lines within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically invoked during
    server startup or database loading phases to ensure that all spell-to-skill line
    relationships are correctly established. It processes the relevant database entries
    and builds in-memory lookup tables that allow efficient retrieval of skill line
    information for spells during gameplay. The method does not require any external
    parameters as it operates on internal database resources and configuration data.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeSpellSystem()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->LoadSkillLineAbilityMap();\n\
      \    // Additional spell system initialization\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core spell management system and should only be
    called after the database has been successfully initialized. It's typically invoked
    automatically during server startup sequence, but may also be called manually
    in specific debugging or reloading scenarios.
