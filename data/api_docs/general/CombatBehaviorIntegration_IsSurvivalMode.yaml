  method: IsSurvivalMode
  signature: bool CombatBehaviorIntegration::IsSurvivalMode() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the combat behavior integration is currently operating
    in survival mode.
  description: The IsSurvivalMode method checks if the current combat behavior integration
    instance has been configured or is currently utilizing survival mode logic. This
    mode typically affects how NPCs behave during combat, such as prioritizing evasion
    over aggression, using defensive abilities more frequently, or adjusting threat
    generation and targeting mechanics. The method returns a boolean value indicating
    the active state of this mode. It does not modify any internal state but simply
    reports the current configuration. This functionality is commonly used in custom
    AI implementations or when integrating third-party combat behaviors into the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the combat behavior integration is currently in survival mode,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (combatBehavior->IsSurvivalMode()) {\n    // Perform actions specific\
      \ to survival mode\n    DoSurvivalBehavior();\n} else {\n    // Default combat\
      \ behavior\n    DoNormalCombat();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional AI Logic
    code: "void Unit::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (IsSurvivalMode()) {\n     \
      \   // Adjust AI decisions for survival mode\n        if (GetHealthPct() < 30)\
      \ {\n            // Prioritize fleeing or defensive spells\n            CastDefensiveSpell();\n\
      \        }\n    } else {\n        // Standard offensive behavior\n        CastOffensiveSpell();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other combat behavior flags
    or modes. The implementation may rely on internal state variables that are set
    by configuration methods or during runtime based on environmental conditions.
