  class: Group
  method: GetLooterGuid
  signature: int Group::GetLooterGuid() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the player designated as the looter for the group.
  description: The GetLooterGuid method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of
    the player who is currently set as the designated looter for the group. In World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, groups (raids or parties) can have a specific
    player assigned as the looter, which determines who has the authority to distribute
    loot among group members according to the group's loot settings. This method allows
    code to query the current looter GUID without directly accessing internal group
    state variables. The returned value represents a valid player GUID if a looter
    is assigned, or 0 if no looter is designated.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the group's looter player. Returns
    0 if no looter is currently set for the group.
  examples:
  - title: Check Current Looter in a Group
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    uint32 looterGuid\
      \ = group->GetLooterGuid();\n    if (looterGuid != 0)\n    {\n        // A looter\
      \ is assigned\n        Player* looter = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player,\
      \ looterGuid));\n        if (looter)\n            sLog->outString(\"Current\
      \ looter: %s\", looter->GetName().c_str());\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      \
      \  // No looter assigned\n        sLog->outString(\"No looter assigned to group.\"\
      );\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is typically used in loot distribution logic, particularly when
    determining whether a player has permission to loot items or when checking group
    settings. The GUID returned corresponds to the player's unique identifier within
    the game world and can be used to retrieve the actual Player object via ObjectAccessor.
