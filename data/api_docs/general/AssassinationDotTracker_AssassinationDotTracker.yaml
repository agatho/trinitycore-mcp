documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the AssassinationDotTracker class for tracking
    dot effects.
  description: The AssassinationDotTracker constructor initializes a new instance
    of the AssassinationDotTracker class, which is responsible for managing and tracking
    DoT (Damage over Time) effects specific to the assassination rogue specialization
    in World of Warcraft. This tracker maintains information about active poison applications,
    their durations, damage values, and associated combat events. The initialization
    process sets up internal data structures necessary for monitoring these effects
    during combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new AssassinationDotTracker instance
    code: 'AssassinationDotTracker tracker;

      // Initializes the tracker with default values and empty effect lists'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the rogue's combat system
    when a player enters combat or when a new assassination-based ability is applied.
    The class likely maintains a list of active DoTs and their expiration times, requiring
    careful synchronization with the game's event loop.
