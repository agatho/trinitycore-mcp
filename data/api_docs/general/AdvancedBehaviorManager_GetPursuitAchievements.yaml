documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total count of pursuit achievements earned by the player
  description: The GetPursuitAchievements method returns an integer value representing
    the number of pursuit-related achievements that have been completed by the player.
    In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, pursuit achievements typically
    relate to tracking, hunting, or completing specific objectives involving creatures
    or quests that involve following or pursuing targets. This method is commonly
    used within behavior management systems to track player progress and unlock rewards
    based on achievement milestones. The returned value reflects the cumulative count
    of such achievements and may be utilized in various game mechanics including quest
    progression, reward distribution, and player statistics tracking.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of pursuit achievements earned
    by the player. Returns 0 if no pursuit achievements have been earned or if the
    player object is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check pursuit achievements
    code: "int pursuitCount = behaviorManager->GetPursuitAchievements();\nif (pursuitCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Player has earned some pursuit achievements\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player has %d pursuit achievements\", pursuitCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically part of a larger behavior management system and
    may depend on the player's current session state. The implementation likely accesses
    internal achievement tracking data structures within the TrinityCore framework.
    Performance impact is minimal as it only reads cached achievement data.
  warnings: Ensure that the AdvancedBehaviorManager instance is properly initialized
    before calling this method, as calling it on a null or invalid object may result
    in undefined behavior. This method does not perform any validation of the player's
    session state.
