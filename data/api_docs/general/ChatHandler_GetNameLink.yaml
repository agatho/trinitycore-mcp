  class: ChatHandler
  method: GetNameLink
  signature: int ChatHandler::GetNameLink(Player * chr) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the formatted name link of a player for chat messages.
  description: The GetNameLink method generates a formatted name link string for a
    given player that can be used in chat messages. This link typically includes the
    player's name with special formatting or markup that allows other players to click
    on it to whisper or target the player. The method is commonly used by game masters
    and command handlers to reference players in their responses. It ensures proper
    formatting and handles cases where the player might not be available or valid.
  parameters:
  - name: chr
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which to generate the name link.
      Must not be null.
  returns: Integer representing the length of the generated name link string, or zero
    if the player is invalid or the operation fails.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a chat command
    code: "void HandlePlayerInfoCommand(ChatHandler* handler)\n{\n    Player* target\
      \ = handler->getSelectedPlayer();\n    if (!target)\n        return;\n    \n\
      \    int length = handler->GetNameLink(target);\n    handler->PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Selected player: %s\", handler->GetOString());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with ChatHandler's output buffer
    system. The actual formatted string is stored internally and can be retrieved
    using GetOString() or similar methods. The return value indicates success and
    the length of the generated string for buffer management purposes.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null, otherwise behavior is undefined. This method may return zero if the player
    object is corrupted or invalid.
