  brief: Loads and initializes default spells for all pet types in the game.
  description: The LoadPetDefaultSpells method is responsible for loading the predefined
    set of spells that are automatically granted to pets when they are summoned or
    created. This method typically reads data from database tables or configuration
    files that define which spells each type of pet should have by default. It ensures
    that all pet types in the game have their appropriate spell sets loaded into memory,
    enabling proper gameplay mechanics where pets can cast spells without requiring
    additional setup. The method is usually invoked during server startup or database
    loading phases to ensure all pet spell data is available for use.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeServer()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n    sSpellMgr->LoadPetDefaultSpells();\n\
      \    // Continue with other initialization\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or database reload
    operations. It's important to note that this method doesn't validate spell IDs
    against the actual spell database - it simply loads what's defined in the pet
    default spell configurations. The loaded spells are usually stored in internal
    data structures for quick lookup when pets are summoned.
  warnings: This method should only be called during server initialization or database
    reload phases, not during active gameplay, as it may cause performance issues
    or inconsistent state if invoked mid-game. It's also important to ensure that
    the underlying database tables containing pet spell definitions are properly populated
    before calling this method.
