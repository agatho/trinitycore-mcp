  class: SmartAI
  method: Permissible
  signature: int32 SmartAI::Permissible(const Creature * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the permissiveness level of a SmartAI instance for a given creature.
  description: The Permissible method in SmartAI is used to evaluate how suitable
    or appropriate this AI behavior is for a specific creature. It returns an integer
    value that indicates the level of permissiveness, which helps the game engine
    decide whether to assign this AI to a creature. A higher return value typically
    means the AI is more suitable or preferred for the creature. This method is part
    of TrinityCore's AI system and allows for dynamic assignment of different AI behaviors
    based on creature properties.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to a Creature object for which the permissiveness level is
      being evaluated. This parameter determines whether the SmartAI instance should
      be considered for use with this specific creature.
  returns: Returns an int32 value representing the permissiveness level. Positive
    values indicate suitability, with higher numbers suggesting greater appropriateness.
    Zero typically means the AI is not suitable at all for the creature, while negative
    values may indicate strong disapproval or incompatibility.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check SmartAI compatibility
    code: "int32 permissibleLevel = smartAI->Permissible(creature);\nif (permissibleLevel\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Assign SmartAI to creature\n    creature->SetAIType(AI_TYPE_SMART);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Permissible in AI selection logic
    code: "class CustomSmartAI : public SmartAI {\npublic:\n    int32 Permissible(const\
      \ Creature* creature) override {\n        if (creature->GetCreatureTemplate()->Entry\
      \ == 12345)\n            return 100; // Highly suitable\n        else if (creature->GetCreatureTemplate()->Entry\
      \ == 67890)\n            return 50;  // Moderately suitable\n        else\n\
      \            return -1;  // Not suitable\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI initialization or assignment. It's
    important to note that the returned value does not directly control AI assignment
    but rather influences the decision-making process of the game engine. Implementations
    should consider creature type, faction, and other relevant properties when determining
    permissiveness.
  warnings: Ensure that the parameter passed is a valid Creature pointer; passing
    a null pointer will likely cause undefined behavior or crashes. The return values
    must be carefully chosen to avoid conflicts with other AI systems in the engine.
