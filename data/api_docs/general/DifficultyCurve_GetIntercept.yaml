  class: DifficultyCurve
  method: GetIntercept
  signature: float DifficultyCurve::GetIntercept() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the y-intercept value of the difficulty curve.
  description: The GetIntercept method retrieves the y-intercept component of a difficulty
    curve, which is typically used in game mechanics to define base values for scaling
    calculations. This value represents where the curve intersects the y-axis when
    x equals zero. The method is commonly employed in World of Warcraft's difficulty
    and scaling systems, particularly when calculating player progression, loot drops,
    or encounter difficulties based on player level or other factors. The returned
    float value is typically used as a baseline in mathematical formulas that adjust
    values according to difficulty settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: A floating-point number representing the y-intercept of the difficulty
    curve. This value serves as the base offset in calculations involving the curve's
    slope and player progression factors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'DifficultyCurve* curve = sObjectMgr->GetDifficultyCurve(123);

      float intercept = curve->GetIntercept();

      printf("Curve intercept: %f\n", intercept);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Intercept in Scaling Calculation
    code: 'DifficultyCurve* curve = sObjectMgr->GetDifficultyCurve(456);

      float baseValue = 100.0f;

      float level = player->GetLevel();

      float intercept = curve->GetIntercept();

      float scaledValue = baseValue * (intercept + (level * 0.1f));'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other curve methods like
    GetSlope() to perform complete mathematical calculations for difficulty scaling.
    The intercept value should be treated as a constant that defines the baseline
    of the curve and may vary between different difficulty levels or content types.
  warnings: Ensure that the DifficultyCurve object is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as accessing an uninitialized curve may result in undefined
    behavior. This method does not perform any validation on the curve's internal
    state.
