  class: AsyncBotInitializer
  method: CreateBotAI
  signature: BotAI * AsyncBotInitializer::CreateBotAI(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a new BotAI instance for the specified player bot.
  description: The CreateBotAI method is responsible for instantiating and setting
    up a BotAI object that governs the artificial intelligence behavior of a player-controlled
    bot within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically handles the allocation
    of AI resources, initialization of behavior trees or decision-making systems,
    and association of the AI with the provided player entity. The created BotAI instance
    is designed to manage the bot's actions, movement, combat decisions, and other
    intelligent behaviors in accordance with configured AI settings. This method should
    only be called after ensuring that the input player object is a valid bot entity
    and not a regular player character.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which the AI
      is being created. Must be a valid bot instance, not a real player character.
  returns: A pointer to the newly created BotAI instance associated with the provided
    bot player. Returns nullptr if the creation fails or if the input player is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic BotAI Creation
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this points to a valid bot\nBotAI* botAI\
      \ = asyncInitializer->CreateBotAI(myBot);\nif (botAI)\n{\n    // Successfully\
      \ created AI, can now use it\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling for BotAI Creation
    code: "Player* bot = GetBotPlayer();\nBotAI* ai = asyncInitializer->CreateBotAI(bot);\n\
      if (!ai)\n{\n    sLog->outError(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Failed to create BotAI\
      \ for player %s\", bot->GetName().c_str());\n    // Handle error appropriately\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Proceed with AI usage\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically part of an asynchronous initialization process,
    meaning it may not immediately return a fully configured BotAI object. The actual
    AI setup might be deferred to a later stage in the game loop or background thread.
    Developers should ensure that any subsequent operations on the returned BotAI
    pointer are performed only after the AI has been properly initialized.
  warnings: Calling this method with a non-bot Player instance may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always validate that the player is indeed a bot before calling
    CreateBotAI. Additionally, since this is likely part of an async initialization
    system, accessing the returned BotAI immediately might result in incomplete state
    if not properly synchronized.
