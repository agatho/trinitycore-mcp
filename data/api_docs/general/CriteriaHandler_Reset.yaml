  signature: void CriteriaHandler::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all criteria progress for the associated player or entity.
  description: The Reset method clears all completed criteria progress stored for
    a player or game entity within the CriteriaHandler. This function is typically
    invoked when a player's achievements or criteria need to be reset, such as during
    a character reset, achievement reload, or when transitioning between game states
    where previous criterion completion should no longer count. The method ensures
    that all tracked criteria data is cleared from memory and potentially persisted
    storage, allowing for clean re-evaluation of progress. It does not affect the
    underlying criteria definitions or configuration but only the recorded progress.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resetting Criteria for a Player
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      CriteriaHandler* handler = player->GetCriteriaHandler();

      handler->Reset();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may trigger internal cleanup routines that remove criterion-related
    data from the database or in-memory caches. It is recommended to call this only
    when necessary, as frequent resets can impact performance during high-traffic
    periods.
  warnings: Calling Reset() on a CriteriaHandler that is actively being updated by
    other systems may lead to inconsistent state if not synchronized properly. Ensure
    all active criterion updates are paused or completed before invoking this method.
