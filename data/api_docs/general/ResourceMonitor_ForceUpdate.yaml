  method: ForceUpdate
  signature: void ResourceMonitor::ForceUpdate()
documentation:
  brief: Immediately updates all monitored resource statistics without waiting for
    the next scheduled update interval.
  description: The ForceUpdate method in the ResourceMonitor class triggers an immediate
    refresh of all tracked resource metrics, bypassing the normal polling cycle. This
    method is typically used when urgent resource information is required, such as
    during performance debugging or when responding to specific game events that demand
    real-time resource data. The method performs a synchronous update across all registered
    resource monitors and ensures that the latest measurements are available for immediate
    consumption. It does not alter any internal state beyond refreshing the current
    readings.

  examples:
  - title: Forcing Immediate Resource Update
    code: 'ResourceMonitor* monitor = sWorld->GetResourceMonitor();

      monitor->ForceUpdate();

      // Resource statistics are now refreshed immediately'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used sparingly as it can cause performance overhead
    by forcing immediate updates. It is recommended to use this only when real-time
    resource data is critical for game logic or debugging purposes.
