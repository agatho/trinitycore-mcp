documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a rune is ready to be used.
  description: The IsReady method checks if a rune, typically associated with Death
    Knights in World of Warcraft, has completed its cooldown and can be activated.
    This method is commonly used in combat logic to determine if a player's rune is
    available for use. The check considers the rune's current cooldown state and returns
    true only when the rune is fully recharged and ready for activation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the rune is ready to be used, false otherwise. A return
    value of false typically indicates that the rune is currently on cooldown or in
    a state where it cannot be activated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Logic
    code: "if (runeInfo.IsReady()) {\n    // Use the rune for an ability\n    player.CastRuneAbility();\n\
      } else {\n    // Wait or use alternative ability\n    player.UseAlternativeAbility();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called in the context of Death Knight rune management.
    The rune's ready state is determined by its internal cooldown timer, which resets
    when the rune becomes available for use.
