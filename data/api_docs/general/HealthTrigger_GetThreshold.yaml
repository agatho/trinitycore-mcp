  class: HealthTrigger
  method: GetThreshold
  signature: float HealthTrigger::GetThreshold() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the health threshold value used for triggering health-based events
    in the HealthTrigger class.
  description: The GetThreshold method returns the configured health percentage threshold
    that determines when a health-based trigger event should be activated. This value
    is typically used in AI behavior systems where certain actions or responses are
    triggered when an NPC's health drops below a specified percentage. The returned
    float value represents a percentage (e.g., 0.3f for 30% health). The method performs
    no side effects and is safe to call from any context within the AI system. This
    threshold is usually set during initialization or configuration of the HealthTrigger
    instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the health threshold as a percentage (e.g.,
    0.5f for 50%). Values are typically between 0.0f and 1.0f, where 0.0f represents
    0% health and 1.0f represents full health.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float threshold = trigger->GetThreshold();\nif (unit->GetHealthPct() <=\
      \ threshold * 100.0f)\n{\n    // Trigger health-based event\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Threshold in AI Logic
    code: "class MyAI : public ScriptedAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override\n    {\n        if (HealthTrigger* trigger = GetHealthTrigger())\n\
      \        {\n            float threshold = trigger->GetThreshold();\n       \
      \     if (me->GetHealthPct() <= threshold * 100.0f)\n            {\n       \
      \         // Execute specific behavior when health drops below threshold\n \
      \               DoSpecificAction();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is marked as const, indicating it does not modify the object state.
    The returned value should be interpreted as a percentage between 0.0f and 1.0f,
    where 0.0f represents 0% health and 1.0f represents full health. This method is
    commonly used in conjunction with unit health checks to implement conditional
    AI behaviors.
  warnings: Ensure that the HealthTrigger instance has been properly initialized before
    calling this method, as accessing an uninitialized threshold may result in unexpected
    behavior. The returned value should not be directly compared with health percentages
    without proper conversion (multiply by 100.0f).
