  method: SetBonusDamage
  signature: void Guardian::SetBonusDamage(int32 damage)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the bonus damage value for this guardian.
  description: The SetBonusDamage method assigns a specified damage value to the guardian's
    bonus damage attribute. This method is typically used in the context of pet or
    guardian AI behavior, where guardians (such as summoned creatures or pets) may
    have additional damage applied beyond their base attack. The bonus damage is usually
    additive to the guardian's normal damage output and can be influenced by various
    game mechanics such as spell effects, buffs, or player abilities. This method
    does not validate the input value, so it should be used with appropriate bounds
    checking in calling code.
  parameters:
  - name: damage
    description: The bonus damage amount to set for this guardian. Can be positive
      (increasing damage) or negative (reducing damage).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Guardian* guardian = player->GetGuardian();

      guardian->SetBonusDamage(50);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying Negative Bonus Damage
    code: 'Guardian* guardian = player->GetGuardian();

      guardian->SetBonusDamage(-25); // Reduces damage by 25'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal bonus damage value of the guardian.
    It is recommended to use this method in conjunction with proper game state management,
    especially when dealing with temporary or conditional bonuses. The effect of this
    change will be reflected in the guardian's next attack calculation.
  warnings: Ensure that the damage value passed to this method does not cause overflow
    or underflow issues, particularly if used in combination with other damage modifiers.
    This method should only be called on valid guardian instances to avoid undefined
    behavior.
