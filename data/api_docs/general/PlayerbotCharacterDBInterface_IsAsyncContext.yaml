documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current database context is asynchronous.
  description: The IsAsyncContext method checks if the PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface
    is currently operating within an asynchronous database execution context. This
    is particularly important for player bot functionality in TrinityCore, where database
    operations may be performed either synchronously or asynchronously to avoid blocking
    the main game thread. When running in an asynchronous context, certain database
    operations might behave differently or require special handling to ensure thread
    safety and proper execution flow.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current database context is asynchronous, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether database operations are being executed in a non-blocking
    manner that allows the game loop to continue processing other events while waiting
    for database results.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Database Context is Asynchronous
    code: "if (playerbot->GetCharacterDB()->IsAsyncContext()) {\n    // Handle asynchronous\
      \ database operations\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"playerbot\", \"Database context is asynchronous\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Handle synchronous database operations\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      playerbot\", \"Database context is synchronous\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the player bot system to determine
    appropriate handling of database operations. In asynchronous contexts, player
    bots may defer certain operations or use different synchronization mechanisms
    to prevent deadlocks or performance issues. The result of this method can affect
    how database transactions are managed and whether certain operations should be
    queued for later execution.
