  signature: bool ExampleManager::IsIdle() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the ExampleManager is currently in an idle state
  description: The IsIdle method determines if the ExampleManager instance is currently
    idle, meaning it is not performing any active operations or processing. This status
    check is typically used to determine if the manager can safely accept new tasks
    or requests without interfering with ongoing processes. The method performs a
    simple state check and does not modify any internal data. It is commonly used
    in game loop synchronization and task scheduling systems within TrinityCore's
    architecture.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ExampleManager is idle and not processing any operations,
    false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic Idle State Check
    code: "ExampleManager manager;\nif (manager.IsIdle()) {\n    // Manager is free\
      \ to accept new tasks\n    manager.EnqueueTask(newTask);\n} else {\n    // Manager\
      \ is busy, defer task\n    deferredTasks.push_back(newTask);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop() {\n    static ExampleManager exampleManager;\n    \n  \
      \  if (exampleManager.IsIdle()) {\n        // Perform background processing\n\
      \        exampleManager.ProcessBackgroundTasks();\n    }\n    \n    // Continue\
      \ with main game logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented as a thread-safe read-only operation
    that checks an atomic or mutex-protected internal state flag. The idle state may
    be set by various operations including task completion, processing completion,
    or explicit state management calls.
  warnings: Be aware that the idle state might change between the time you check IsIdle()
    and when you act upon it. In high-concurrency scenarios, consider using atomic
    operations or locks to ensure consistency if the manager's state is modified by
    other threads.
