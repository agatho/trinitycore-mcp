api:
  class: QuestHubDatabase
  method: GetQuestHubsInZone
  signature: int QuestHubDatabase::GetQuestHubsInZone(uint32 zoneId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of quest hubs located within a specified zone ID.
  description: The GetQuestHubsInZone method queries the database to determine how
    many quest hub entries exist for a given zone identifier. This is typically used
    during zone loading or player interaction to dynamically adjust UI elements or
    quest availability based on the presence and count of quest hubs in that area.
    The method does not return the actual quest hub data, but rather provides a count
    which can be useful for optimization purposes such as determining whether to load
    additional quest-related resources or display relevant UI components. This function
    is part of the QuestHubDatabase class and operates under the assumption that zone
    IDs are valid and correspond to existing zones in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of quest hubs found within the
    specified zone. Returns zero if no quest hubs are found or if an error occurs
    during database query execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 zoneId = 1234;\nint hubCount = questHubDatabase.GetQuestHubsInZone(zoneId);\n\
      if (hubCount > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with loading or displaying quest hub UI\n\
      \    printf(\"Found %d quest hubs in zone %u\\n\", hubCount, zoneId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a database query and should be used judiciously to avoid
    performance degradation. It is recommended to cache the result if the same zone
    is queried multiple times within a short period. The method assumes that zone
    IDs passed to it are valid and exist in the game world's zone table.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided zoneId corresponds to an actual zone in the database;
    otherwise, unexpected behavior may occur. Avoid calling this method excessively
    during high-frequency operations like player movement updates without caching
    mechanisms.
