  method: GetPendingTaskCount
  signature: uint32 ExampleManager::GetPendingTaskCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of pending tasks managed by the ExampleManager instance.
  description: The GetPendingTaskCount method retrieves the current count of tasks
    that are awaiting processing within the ExampleManager. This method is typically
    used to monitor queue sizes, assess system load, or determine if there are any
    outstanding operations that need attention. The returned value represents a snapshot
    of the pending task state at the time of the call and may change immediately after
    the method returns. This functionality is commonly utilized in game systems where
    asynchronous operations must be tracked for performance optimization and resource
    management.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of pending tasks currently
    managed by this ExampleManager instance. Returns zero if no tasks are pending.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Task Queue Size
    code: "ExampleManager* manager = sExampleMgr->GetManager();\nuint32 pendingCount\
      \ = manager->GetPendingTaskCount();\nif (pendingCount > 0)\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      example\", \"There are %u pending tasks in the manager.\", pendingCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Task Load for Performance Tuning
    code: "ExampleManager* manager = sExampleMgr->GetManager();\nuint32 count = manager->GetPendingTaskCount();\n\
      if (count > 1000)\n{\n    TC_LOG_WARN(\"example\", \"High task load detected:\
      \ %u pending tasks.\", count);\n    // Trigger performance optimization or alerting\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a thread-safe read operation on the internal task counter.
    It is recommended to use this method sparingly in performance-critical sections
    as it may involve locking mechanisms depending on the implementation details of
    ExampleManager. The returned value is only valid at the moment of invocation and
    does not reflect real-time changes.
  warnings: Do not rely on the return value for critical decision-making without considering
    that the task count may change immediately after the method returns. In high-concurrency
    scenarios, multiple calls to this method might yield different results even within
    a short time span.
