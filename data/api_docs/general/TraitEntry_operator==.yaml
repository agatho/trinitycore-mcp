documentation:
  brief: Compares two TraitEntry objects for equality based on their internal data
    members.
  description: The operator== method performs a comparison between this TraitEntry
    object and another TraitEntry object to determine if they are equal. It typically
    compares key identifying attributes such as the trait ID, associated spell IDs,
    or other unique identifiers that define the trait's properties. This comparison
    is essential for managing trait data within the TrinityCore framework, particularly
    when checking for duplicate traits or verifying trait configurations during runtime.
    The method returns true if all relevant fields match between both objects, and
    false otherwise. It is commonly used in containers like std::set or std::map where
    equality checks are required to maintain data integrity.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current TraitEntry object is equal to the provided
    right TraitEntry object; returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Equality Check
    code: 'TraitEntry entry1;

      TraitEntry entry2;

      bool isEqual = (entry1 == entry2); // Compares two trait entries for equality'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Container Lookup
    code: 'std::set<TraitEntry> traitSet;

      TraitEntry searchEntry;

      // Insert some entries into the set

      auto it = traitSet.find(searchEntry); // Uses operator== for lookup'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented using member-wise comparison of critical
    fields such as ID, spell IDs, and other unique identifiers. It's important to
    note that the implementation may vary depending on how the TraitEntry class defines
    its equality semantics. Performance-wise, this operation should be relatively
    fast since it only compares a few key data members.
  warnings: Ensure that both objects being compared are valid and initialized before
    calling operator==, as comparing uninitialized objects might lead to undefined
    behavior. Also, if new fields are added to TraitEntry in the future, make sure
    that operator== is updated accordingly to maintain correct equality semantics.
