  class: FrostRuneRunicPowerResource
  method: Consume
  signature: bool FrostRuneRunicPowerResource::Consume(uint32 runesCost)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified number of frost runes to generate runic power
  description: The Consume method reduces the available frost rune count by the specified
    amount and generates corresponding runic power for the player. This method is
    typically used when executing frost-based abilities that require rune consumption.
    The method performs validation to ensure sufficient runes are available before
    consuming them. If the requested number of runes exceeds the available count,
    the operation will fail and return false without modifying the rune state.
  parameters:
  - name: runesCost
    description: The number of frost runes to consume from the resource pool. Must
      be a positive integer representing the required rune count for the ability being
      executed.
  returns: Returns true if the specified number of frost runes were successfully consumed,
    false otherwise. The method returns false when insufficient runes are available
    or if the input parameter is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic rune consumption
    code: "if (player->GetFrostRuneResource()->Consume(1)) {\n    // Successfully\
      \ consumed one frost rune\n    player->AddRunicPower(10.0f);\n} else {\n   \
      \ // Not enough frost runes available\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"Not enough\
      \ frost runes.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Consuming multiple runes with error handling
    code: "uint32 requiredRunes = 2;\nFrostRuneRunicPowerResource* resource = player->GetFrostRuneResource();\n\
      if (resource && resource->Consume(requiredRunes)) {\n    // Apply frost spell\
      \ effect\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_FROST_BLADE, true);\n    // Generate\
      \ runic power\n    player->AddRunicPower(25.0f);\n} else {\n    // Handle insufficient\
      \ runes\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"Insufficient frost runes to cast this\
      \ spell.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the rune management system in TrinityCore's Death
    Knight class implementation. The frost rune resource is managed separately from
    other rune types and follows specific cooldown and regeneration mechanics. The
    method does not directly handle spell casting or power generation - it only manages
    the rune consumption aspect.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking available runes may result in unexpected
    behavior if insufficient runes are present. Always verify that sufficient runes
    exist before calling Consume to avoid partial state changes or inconsistent resource
    management.
