  signature: const SoulbindConduitRankEntry * DB2Manager::GetSoulbindConduitRank(int32
    soulbindConduitId, int32 rank) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the soulbind conduit rank entry for a given conduit ID and rank.
  description: The GetSoulbindConduitRank method fetches the SoulbindConduitRankEntry
    data structure that corresponds to a specific soulbind conduit identifier and
    its associated rank. This method is used in the context of World of Warcraft's
    soulbind system, where conduits are special items that provide abilities and effects.
    The method allows for retrieving detailed information about a conduit at a specific
    rank, such as its stats, visual properties, or effects. It is typically used during
    gameplay logic when determining what benefits a player's soulbind conduit provides
    at a given level. This function assumes the DB2 files have been properly loaded
    and parsed by the DB2Manager instance.
  parameters:
  - name: soulbindConduitId
    description: The unique identifier of the soulbind conduit for which to retrieve
      rank data.
  - name: rank
    description: The rank level of the conduit for which to retrieve data. Ranks typically
      start from 1 and increase with conduit upgrades.
  returns: A pointer to a const SoulbindConduitRankEntry structure containing the
    data for the specified soulbind conduit and rank. Returns nullptr if no matching
    entry is found.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Soulbind Conduit Rank Data
    code: "const SoulbindConduitRankEntry* entry = sDB2Manager->GetSoulbindConduitRank(12345,\
      \ 3);\nif (entry)\n{\n    // Use the entry data\n    printf(\"Conduit ID: %d,\
      \ Rank: %d, Effect: %d\\n\", entry->SoulbindConduitID, entry->Rank, entry->Effect);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal DB2 data structures being fully initialized.
    It is recommended to ensure that the DB2Manager has loaded all necessary files
    before calling this method. The returned pointer is valid only as long as the
    DB2Manager instance remains alive and the data hasn't been reloaded.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-null return value means the rank is valid or
    available in-game. Some conduit ranks may be unimplemented or have no data defined.
    Always validate the returned entry's fields before use.
