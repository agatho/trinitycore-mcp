  signature: void AreaTrigger::SetOverrideMoveCurve(const int & xCurvePoints, const
    int & yCurvePoints, const int & zCurvePoints, int startTimeOffset, int interpolation)
documentation:
  brief: Sets override movement curve parameters for an area trigger.
  description: Configures the override movement curve for an AreaTrigger, allowing
    custom pathing behavior during its execution. This method sets the number of control
    points for each axis (X, Y, Z) and defines timing and interpolation parameters
    for smooth movement along the specified curve. The area trigger will follow this
    custom trajectory instead of its default path when active.
  parameters:
  - name: xCurvePoints
    description: Number of control points defining the X-axis movement curve. Must
      be a positive integer representing the number of waypoints for X coordinate
      interpolation.
  - name: yCurvePoints
    description: Number of control points defining the Y-axis movement curve. Must
      be a positive integer representing the number of waypoints for Y coordinate
      interpolation.
  - name: zCurvePoints
    description: Number of control points defining the Z-axis movement curve. Must
      be a positive integer representing the number of waypoints for Z coordinate
      interpolation.
  - name: startTimeOffset
    description: Time offset in milliseconds from the start time when this override
      curve begins to take effect. Negative values are allowed and can delay the curve
      application.
  - name: interpolation
    description: Interpolation method to use for path smoothing. Values typically
      correspond to predefined interpolation types (e.g., linear, spline) as defined
      by the TrinityCore engine's movement system.
  returns: None. This method modifies internal state of the AreaTrigger object directly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Override Curve Setup
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...; // Assume valid area trigger

      trigger->SetOverrideMoveCurve(3, 3, 3, 0, 1); // Use 3 points per axis, start
      immediately with linear interpolation'
    language: cpp
  - title: Delayed Curve with Spline Interpolation
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;

      trigger->SetOverrideMoveCurve(5, 5, 5, 1000, 2); // Start after 1 second delay,
      use spline interpolation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used for creating custom movement patterns for area
    triggers such as spell effects or cinematic sequences. The actual curve data must
    be provided separately through other means (e.g., database entries or scripting).
    Ensure that the number of control points specified matches the expected data structure
    to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values may lead to unexpected movement behavior or
    crashes. The interpolation type should match supported engine constants; invalid
    values might cause silent failures or erratic motion. This method modifies internal
    state directly and should be called before the area trigger is activated in gameplay.
