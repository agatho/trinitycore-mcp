  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateMultipleQuests
  signature: int QuestValidation::ValidateMultipleQuests(const int & questIds, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates multiple quests for a player character and returns a status code
    indicating success or failure.
  description: The ValidateMultipleQuests method checks the validity of a list of
    quest IDs for a specified player character within the TrinityCore framework. It
    evaluates whether each quest can be accepted, completed, or otherwise processed
    by the player based on game rules, prerequisites, and player state. This method
    is typically used in automated quest validation systems, botting logic, or quest
    management modules to ensure that quests are properly configured and accessible
    to players. The method may perform checks such as quest level requirements, prerequisite
    completion, faction alignment, and other conditional factors that determine quest
    eligibility. It returns an integer status code indicating the overall validation
    result across all provided quests.
  parameters:
  - name: questIds
    description: A reference to an array or container of quest identifiers (integers)
      that need to be validated for the specified player.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose quests
      are being validated. This parameter is essential for evaluating player-specific
      conditions such as level, faction, and quest state.
  returns: An integer value indicating the result of the validation process. A return
    value of 0 typically means all quests passed validation successfully, while non-zero
    values may indicate specific types of failures (e.g., invalid quest ID, missing
    prerequisites, level mismatch). The exact meaning of each error code should be
    defined within the implementation or related documentation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Validation
    code: "std::vector<int> questList = {12345, 12346, 12347};\nint result = QuestValidation::ValidateMultipleQuests(questList,\
      \ playerBot);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // All quests are valid\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"All quests are valid for this player.\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n   \
      \ // Some or all quests failed validation\n    std::cout << \"Quest validation\
      \ failed with code: \" << result << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Bot Logic
    code: "std::vector<int> botQuests = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nPlayer* bot = sObjectAccessor->FindConnectedPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player,\
      \ 12345));\nif (bot) {\n    int validationCode = QuestValidation::ValidateMultipleQuests(botQuests,\
      \ bot);\n    switch (validationCode) {\n        case 0:\n            // Proceed\
      \ with quest acceptance or progression\n            break;\n        case -1:\n\
      \            // Invalid quest ID encountered\n            break;\n        default:\n\
      \            // Other validation failure\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the input questIds parameter is a valid container
    of integers representing quest identifiers. It's recommended to ensure that the
    player object passed as 'bot' is properly initialized and connected before calling
    this function. Performance may be impacted if large numbers of quests are validated
    simultaneously, especially in high-frequency botting scenarios.
  warnings: Improper handling of the questIds parameter or passing an uninitialized
    Player pointer can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all quest
    IDs in the list are valid within the game database; otherwise, the method may
    return error codes indicating invalid entries. Avoid calling this function from
    multiple threads without proper synchronization.
