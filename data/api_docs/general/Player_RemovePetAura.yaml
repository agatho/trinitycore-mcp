documentation:
  brief: Removes a specific pet aura from the player's pet.
  description: The RemovePetAura method removes a specified pet aura from the player's
    pet, effectively eliminating the aura from the pet's active effects. This method
    is typically used during pet management operations where a specific aura needs
    to be removed from the pet's aura list. It ensures that the pet no longer has
    the specified aura active and updates the pet's aura state accordingly. The method
    operates on the pet's aura structure, allowing for precise control over which
    aura is removed.
  parameters:
  - name: petSpell
    description: Pointer to the PetAura structure that contains the aura to be removed
      from the pet. This parameter specifies which aura should be removed from the
      pet's active list.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a specific pet aura
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      PetAura* auraToRemove = new PetAura();

      player->RemovePetAura(auraToRemove);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the pet management system and should be used carefully
    to avoid removing incorrect auras. It requires that the pet has an active aura
    list before calling this method.
  warnings: This method should not be called during active combat or when the pet
    is in a state where it cannot properly manage its auras. Calling this method without
    proper context may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
