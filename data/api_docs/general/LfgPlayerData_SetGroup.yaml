  class: LfgPlayerData
  method: SetGroup
  signature: void LfgPlayerData::SetGroup(int group)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the group ID for the player's LFG (Looking for Group) data.
  description: The SetGroup method assigns a specific group identifier to the player's
    Looking for Group data structure. This is used internally by TrinityCore's LFG
    system to track which group a player belongs to, particularly during dungeon finding
    and queue management. The method updates the internal state of the LfgPlayerData
    object without any validation checks on the group ID value itself. It is typically
    called when a player joins or leaves a group during LFG operations.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier to assign to the player's LFG data. This represents
      the unique ID of the group the player is currently part of, or -1 if not in
      a group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Player's Group
    code: 'LfgPlayerData playerData;

      playerData.SetGroup(12345);

      // The player is now assigned to group with ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing a Player from a Group
    code: 'LfgPlayerData playerData;

      playerData.SetGroup(-1);

      // The player is no longer in any group'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of LfgPlayerData. It should
    only be called during appropriate LFG state transitions to maintain data consistency.
    No bounds checking is performed on the group ID value.
