documentation:
  brief: Registers a boss mechanic with the combat state analyzer for tracking and
    management.
  description: The RegisterBossMechanic method integrates a specified boss mechanic
    into the CombatStateAnalyzer's internal tracking system. This allows the analyzer
    to monitor, log, and potentially react to specific boss abilities or behaviors
    during combat encounters. The method is typically invoked when initializing or
    modifying boss encounter mechanics within the TrinityCore framework. It ensures
    that all registered mechanics are properly accounted for in the overall combat
    state evaluation.
  parameters:
  - name: mechanic
    description: A constant reference to a BossMechanic object containing the details
      of the mechanic to be registered, including its identifier, activation conditions,
      and associated effects.
  returns: null
  examples:

      fireballMechanic.activationTime = 5.0f;


      CombatStateAnalyzer analyzer;

      analyzer.RegisterBossMechanic(fireballMechanic);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called during encounter initialization or configuration
    phases. It assumes that the BossMechanic object passed in has valid data and does
    not perform validation on the input parameters.
