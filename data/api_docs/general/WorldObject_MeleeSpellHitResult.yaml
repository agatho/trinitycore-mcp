  signature: int WorldObject::MeleeSpellHitResult(Unit * victim, const SpellInfo *
    spellInfo) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines the outcome of a melee attack against a target unit.
  description: This method calculates and returns the result of a melee spell hit
    against a victim unit. It evaluates whether the attack hits, misses, or is blocked,
    and determines the specific outcome based on various factors including combat
    mechanics, spell properties, and target's resistance. The method is typically
    used in combat calculations to determine if an attack successfully connects with
    the target.
  parameters:
  - name: victim
    description: The unit that is being attacked by this WorldObject. This parameter
      determines the target against which the melee spell is being executed.
  - name: spellInfo
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure defining the specific spell being
      used for the melee attack. This parameter provides details about the spell's
      properties and effects.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the outcome of the melee attack.
    Possible values include 0 (miss), 1 (hit), 2 (block), or other numerical values
    depending on the specific combat mechanics and game context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int result = this->MeleeSpellHitResult(target, spellInfo);\nif (result\
      \ == 1) {\n    // Attack hit\n}\nelse if (result == 2) {\n    // Attack was\
      \ blocked\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core combat system in TrinityCore and should be
    used carefully during combat calculations. It may involve complex interactions
    with target's resistance, armor, and other defensive mechanisms.
  warnings: The method may not always return accurate results if the victim is not
    properly initialized or if spellInfo is invalid. Care must be taken to ensure
    that both parameters are valid before calling this method.
