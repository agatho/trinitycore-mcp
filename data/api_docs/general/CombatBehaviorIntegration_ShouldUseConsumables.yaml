  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: ShouldUseConsumables
  signature: bool CombatBehaviorIntegration::ShouldUseConsumables()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the combat behavior integration should utilize consumable
    items during combat.
  description: The ShouldUseConsumables method evaluates the current combat state
    and character conditions to decide if it's appropriate to use consumable items
    such as potions, flasks, or food. This method is typically called by the AI system
    to make dynamic decisions about resource management during encounters. It considers
    factors like health and mana levels, buff durations, and combat timing to determine
    optimal usage of consumables. The method ensures that consumables are used efficiently
    without unnecessary waste or premature consumption.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current combat situation warrants using consumable
    items; otherwise returns false. The decision is based on evaluating character
    status, available resources, and tactical requirements during active combat.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "if (combatBehavior->ShouldUseConsumables()) {\n    // Execute consumable\
      \ usage logic\n    player->UseItem(CONSUMABLE_POTION);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Decision Making
    code: "class PlayerCombatAI {\npublic:\n    bool UpdateCombat() {\n        if\
      \ (combatBehavior->ShouldUseConsumables()) {\n            // Prioritize consumable\
      \ usage before continuing attack\n            UseHealthPotion();\n         \
      \   return true;\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the combat behavior integration system and should
    be called regularly during combat updates. The implementation likely checks for
    specific thresholds (e.g., health below 30%) or buff expiration times to make
    decisions. It's designed to work in conjunction with other combat decision-making
    methods.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called too frequently without proper cooldowns,
    as excessive calls may lead to performance degradation. Also, be aware that the
    decision logic might vary based on class-specific consumable usage patterns or
    encounter-specific requirements.
