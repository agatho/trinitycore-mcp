documentation:
  brief: Updates the armor value of the totem based on its current state and properties.
  description: The UpdateArmor method recalculates and applies the armor value for
    a totem, typically invoked when the totem's stats or status changes. This method
    ensures that the totem's defensive capabilities are accurately reflected in the
    game world. It may be called internally by the core engine upon specific events
    such as totem placement, stat modifications, or periodic updates. The method does
    not take any parameters and performs its operation on the instance it is called
    from.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Totem* totem = new Totem();

      totem->UpdateArmor();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the internal update cycle for totems and may
    be invoked automatically by the game engine. Developers should not typically call
    this method directly unless implementing custom totem behavior or debugging.
  warnings: Direct invocation of UpdateArmor without proper context may lead to inconsistent
    totem states or unexpected behavior in the game world. Ensure any modifications
    to totem properties are properly synchronized.
