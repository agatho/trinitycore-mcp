  signature: void Unit::SendSpellDamageResist(Unit * target, uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Sends spell damage resist information to a target unit
  description: This method sends spell damage resist information from the current
    unit to the specified target unit. It is used in the context of World of Warcraft's
    combat system to notify players about resisted spell damage. The method typically
    occurs during spell processing when a spell is resisted by the target, and it
    handles the communication between units for proper game mechanics implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The unit that will receive the spell damage resist information. This
      must be a valid Unit object with proper ownership and connection to the current
      unit.
  - name: spellId
    description: The identifier of the spell that was resisted. This should correspond
      to a valid spell ID in the game's spell database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* target = player->GetVictim();

      uint32 spellId = 12345;

      unit->SendSpellDamageResist(target, spellId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method requires that both units be properly connected and that the target
    unit has valid combat state. Implementation details include proper handling of
    packet sending and ensuring the correct spell ID is passed to avoid game mechanics
    issues.
  warnings: This method should only be called when a spell actually gets resisted
    by the target unit, otherwise it may cause incorrect communication between units.
    The target must be properly initialized and connected to avoid potential crashes
    or undefined behavior.
