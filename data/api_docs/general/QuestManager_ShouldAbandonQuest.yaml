documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a quest should be abandoned based on current player state
    and quest requirements.
  description: The ShouldAbandonQuest method evaluates if a specific quest can be
    safely abandoned by the player. This check typically considers factors such as
    whether the quest has been completed, if it's required for progression, or if
    abandoning it would violate game mechanics like quest chains or reputation requirements.
    The method is commonly used in quest handling logic to prevent invalid abandon
    operations and maintain game integrity. It does not perform the actual abandonment
    but rather provides a validation check before allowing the operation to proceed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest can be abandoned according to current game state
    and rules; returns false if the quest cannot be abandoned due to dependencies,
    completion status, or other restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a quest can be abandoned before initiating the abandon process
    code: "if (player->GetQuestManager().ShouldAbandonQuest(12345)) {\n    player->AbandonQuest(12345);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle case where quest cannot be abandoned\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      This quest cannot be abandoned at this time.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during quest abandon operations to validate
    that the action is allowed. It may internally check for quest completion status,
    dependencies on other quests, and player state such as whether they are in a combat
    zone or have active objectives.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly to abandon a quest; it only performs
    validation. Always ensure proper UI feedback when this returns false to inform
    the player why a quest cannot be abandoned.
