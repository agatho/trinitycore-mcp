api:
  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: AnalyzeQuestReward
  signature: QuestReward DynamicQuestSystem::AnalyzeQuestReward(uint32 questId, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and returns the reward structure for a specified quest available
    to a player bot.
  description: The AnalyzeQuestReward method retrieves and evaluates the reward data
    associated with a given quest ID for a specific player bot. It processes the quest's
    reward information, including experience, gold, items, and reputation rewards,
    and returns a structured QuestReward object containing this data. This functionality
    is typically used in automated questing systems or AI-driven bots to determine
    optimal quest selection and reward prioritization. The method requires a valid
    quest ID and player reference, and performs internal validation to ensure the
    quest exists and is accessible to the bot.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to analyze for rewards. Must correspond
      to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will receive
      the quest rewards. Must be a valid player instance with access to the specified
      quest.
  returns: A QuestReward object containing structured reward data for the specified
    quest, including experience points, gold amount, item rewards, and reputation
    gains. Returns an empty or default-constructed QuestReward if the quest ID is
    invalid or inaccessible.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Reward Analysis
    code: "QuestReward reward = dynamicQuestSystem.AnalyzeQuestReward(12345, botPlayer);\n\
      if (reward.exp > 0) {\n    // Process experience reward\n    botPlayer->AddExperience(reward.exp);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Reward Evaluation for Bot Quest Selection
    code: "uint32 questId = 67890;\nQuestReward reward = dynamicQuestSystem.AnalyzeQuestReward(questId,\
      \ botPlayer);\nif (reward.gold > 1000 && reward.items.size() > 0) {\n    //\
      \ Prioritize this quest for the bot\n    botPlayer->SetPreferredQuest(questId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database lookups and reward calculations internally.
    It is recommended to cache results when analyzing multiple quests to avoid redundant
    computations. The method assumes that the provided quest ID exists in the game's
    quest database and that the bot has proper access to it.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as passing an invalid pointer may result in undefined behavior or crashes.
    Additionally, this method does not modify the actual quest state; it only analyzes
    reward data without triggering quest completion or reward distribution.
