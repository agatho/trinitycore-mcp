  class: DispelCoordinator
  method: FindBestDispeller
  signature: int DispelCoordinator::FindBestDispeller(const DebuffTarget & target)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines the optimal dispeller for a given debuff target based on available
    abilities and cooldowns.
  description: The FindBestDispeller method evaluates the current state of a DebuffTarget
    to identify which unit or ability is best suited to remove the debuff. It considers
    factors such as available dispel types, cooldown timers, mana costs, and priority
    levels for different dispel effects. This method is typically used in AI decision-making
    processes where optimal resource allocation is required to efficiently manage
    debuffs on targets. The method does not modify any internal state but returns
    an identifier indicating the recommended dispeller.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the best dispeller
    unit, or -1 if no suitable dispeller is found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "int bestDispeller = coordinator.FindBestDispeller(target);\nif (bestDispeller\
      \ != -1)\n{\n    // Proceed with dispel using the identified unit\n    DoDispelling(bestDispeller,\
      \ target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that all relevant units and their cooldowns are properly
    tracked within the DispelCoordinator instance. The method may be called frequently
    during combat, so performance is important for real-time AI behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the DebuffTarget passed to this method is valid and up-to-date;
    otherwise, incorrect dispeller recommendations may occur. This method does not
    perform any validation on the target itself.
