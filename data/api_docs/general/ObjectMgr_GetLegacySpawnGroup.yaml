  signature: const int * ObjectMgr::GetLegacySpawnGroup() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the legacy spawn group identifier used for object spawning
    in the game world.
  description: The GetLegacySpawnGroup method retrieves a constant integer pointer
    that represents the legacy spawn group identifier associated with an object manager
    instance. This identifier is typically used in TrinityCore's object spawning system
    to determine which spawn group an object belongs to, particularly for backward
    compatibility with older spawn definitions or legacy systems. The returned pointer
    should not be modified directly as it points to internal data managed by the ObjectMgr
    class. This method is commonly invoked during object creation and spawning logic
    to ensure proper grouping of creatures, game objects, or other entities within
    the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant integer pointer pointing to the legacy spawn group identifier.
    Returns nullptr if no legacy spawn group has been assigned or initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const int* legacyGroup = sObjectMgr->GetLegacySpawnGroup();\nif (legacyGroup\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    printf(\"Legacy Spawn Group ID: %d\\n\", *legacyGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal state managed by ObjectMgr and should be used
    carefully in multi-threaded environments. The returned pointer is valid only as
    long as the ObjectMgr instance remains alive and its internal data has not been
    modified. It's recommended to cache the value locally if it will be used multiple
    times within a function.
  warnings: Do not modify the value pointed to by the returned pointer, as doing so
    may corrupt internal game state. Be cautious when using this method in high-frequency
    code paths due to potential locking mechanisms in ObjectMgr implementations.
