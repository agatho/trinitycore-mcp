  signature: void NPCInteractionManager::StartPerformanceTimer()
documentation:
  brief: Starts a performance timer for NPC interaction tracking.
  description: The StartPerformanceTimer method initializes a timer used to measure
    the duration of NPC interactions within the TrinityCore framework. This functionality
    is typically employed to monitor and log how long players engage with NPCs, which
    can be useful for performance analysis, debugging, or implementing time-based
    interaction mechanics. The timer is usually started when an NPC interaction begins
    and may be stopped by a corresponding StopPerformanceTimer method. No parameters
    are required as the method operates on internal state managed by the NPCInteractionManager
    class.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'NPCInteractionManager interactionManager;

      interactionManager.StartPerformanceTimer();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses high-resolution timing functions for accurate performance
    measurement. It should be called before any NPC interaction logic to ensure proper
    tracking.
