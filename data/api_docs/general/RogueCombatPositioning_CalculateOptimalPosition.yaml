  class: RogueCombatPositioning
  method: CalculateOptimalPosition
  signature: int RogueCombatPositioning::CalculateOptimalPosition(int * target, RogueSpec
    spec)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal positioning coordinates for a rogue based
    on target and specialization.
  description: The CalculateOptimalPosition method determines the best positional
    strategy for a rogue character in combat, taking into account the target's location
    and the rogue's current specialization. This method is typically used by AI systems
    or advanced combat scripts to optimize positioning for maximum effectiveness.
    It evaluates factors such as distance, threat level, and combat mechanics specific
    to the rogue's chosen specialization (e.g., Subtlety, Combat, or Assassination).
    The returned value represents a calculated position that maximizes the rogue's
    damage output or survivability depending on their spec and current situation.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or position.
      This parameter is used to determine optimal positioning relative to the enemy.
  - name: spec
    description: RogueSpec enumeration value indicating the rogue's current specialization
      (Subtlety, Combat, or Assassination). This affects how positioning calculations
      are weighted and prioritized.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the calculated optimal position. The specific
    meaning of this value depends on the implementation but typically corresponds
    to a coordinate, direction, or movement command that should be executed by the
    rogue.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for calculating optimal positioning
    code: 'int targetId = 12345;

      RogueSpec spec = RogueSpec::Subtlety;

      int optimalPosition = rogueCombatPositioning.CalculateOptimalPosition(&targetId,
      spec);

      // Use optimalPosition to determine movement or attack strategy'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with different specializations for varied positioning
    code: "int targetId = 54321;\nRogueSpec spec = RogueSpec::Assassination;\nint\
      \ optimalPosition = rogueCombatPositioning.CalculateOptimalPosition(&targetId,\
      \ spec);\nif (optimalPosition > 0) {\n    // Move to calculated position\n \
      \   player->MoveTo(optimalPosition);\n} else {\n    // Handle error or fallback\
      \ behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs complex calculations involving distance metrics,
    threat assessment, and specialization-specific combat rules. It may be computationally
    intensive depending on the implementation details. The method assumes valid input
    parameters and does not perform explicit validation.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid entity before calling
    this method. Incorrect handling of the spec parameter could result in undefined
    behavior or suboptimal positioning decisions. This method should only be called
    during active combat scenarios where positioning is relevant.
