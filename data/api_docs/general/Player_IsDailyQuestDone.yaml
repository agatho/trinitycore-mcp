documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a daily quest has been completed by the player.
  description: This method determines if a specific daily quest has been completed
    by the player. It returns true if the quest is marked as done in the player's
    quest log, and false otherwise. Daily quests are typically those that can be repeated
    daily and are part of the game's daily quest system. The method checks the player's
    quest completion status for the specified quest ID, which must be a valid daily
    quest identifier within the game's quest system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified daily quest has been completed by the player,
    false otherwise. The return value indicates whether the quest is marked as done
    in the player's quest log.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsDailyQuestDone(12345))\n{\n    // Quest has been completed\n\
      \    // Do something\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Quest has not been completed\n    //\
      \ Do something else\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to determine player's quest progress. It may be affected by the player's quest
    log status and should be used carefully when checking quest completion status.
  warnings: This method requires a valid quest ID parameter; invalid quest IDs may
    cause undefined behavior or return incorrect results. Ensure that the quest ID
    corresponds to an actual daily quest in the game system.
