  signature: int * Creature::SelectNearestTargetInAttackDistance(float dist) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the nearest target within attack distance
  description: This method selects and returns the GUID of the nearest hostile target
    that is within the specified attack distance range. It is commonly used in AI
    behavior to determine which target to attack or follow, particularly when the
    creature's current target is out of range or has been defeated. The method operates
    under the assumption that the creature has a valid target list and will return
    NULL if no suitable targets exist within the specified distance. This functionality
    is essential for maintaining proper combat behavior in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the GUID of the nearest target within attack distance,
    or nullptr if no such target exists
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Creature* creature = new Creature;\nint* targetGUID = creature->SelectNearestTargetInAttackDistance(30.0f);\n\
      if (targetGUID != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process the target\n    // ... logic here\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other AI-related methods
    to determine combat behavior. Performance may be impacted if many targets are
    present within the attack distance range, as it requires scanning through all
    valid targets.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method in combination with other target
    selection methods, as it may lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior if not properly
    implemented. Ensure that the creature's target list is updated correctly before
    calling this method.
