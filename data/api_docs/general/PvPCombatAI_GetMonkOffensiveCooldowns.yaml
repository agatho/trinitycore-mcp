  method: GetMonkOffensiveCooldowns
  signature: int PvPCombatAI::GetMonkOffensiveCooldowns(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of offensive cooldowns currently active on the monk
    player.
  description: The GetMonkOffensiveCooldowns method is used to determine how many
    offensive abilities are currently on cooldown for a specified monk class player
    within the PvP combat AI system. This functionality is essential for managing
    AI behavior and decision-making during player versus player encounters, particularly
    when assessing available offensive options. The method takes an integer pointer
    to a player object and returns an integer representing the count of active offensive
    cooldowns. It's designed to integrate with TrinityCore's PvP combat logic and
    is typically invoked during AI update cycles to evaluate the monk's current offensive
    capability.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or data
      structure. This parameter should point to a valid monk class player object within
      the TrinityCore framework.
  returns: An integer value indicating the number of offensive cooldowns currently
    active on the monk player. Returns 0 if no offensive cooldowns are active, or
    a positive integer representing the count of active cooldowns.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int playerGuid = 12345;\nint cooldownCount = ai->GetMonkOffensiveCooldowns(&playerGuid);\n\
      if (cooldownCount == 0)\n{\n    // Monk has no offensive cooldowns, can use\
      \ abilities\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Making
    code: "class MyPvPAI : public PvPCombatAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(Unit*\
      \ target) override\n    {\n        int playerGuid = GetPlayerGUID();\n     \
      \   int cooldowns = GetMonkOffensiveCooldowns(&playerGuid);\n        \n    \
      \    if (cooldowns < 3)\n        {\n            // Use offensive ability if\
      \ less than 3 cooldowns active\n            DoOffensiveAbility();\n        }\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PvP combat AI system and assumes that the player
    object pointed to by 'player' is a valid monk class character. The implementation
    likely relies on internal cooldown tracking mechanisms within TrinityCore's AI
    framework. Performance-wise, this method should be called sparingly during AI
    update cycles to avoid unnecessary overhead.
  warnings: Ensure that the player parameter points to a valid monk class object;
    otherwise, the behavior is undefined and may cause crashes or incorrect results.
    This method should not be used outside of PvP combat scenarios where monk cooldowns
    are relevant.
