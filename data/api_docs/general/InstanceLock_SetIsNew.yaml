  class: InstanceLock
  method: SetIsNew
  signature: void InstanceLock::SetIsNew(bool isNew)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the new instance lock status flag for an instance.
  description: The SetIsNew method updates the internal flag that indicates whether
    an instance lock is newly created or has been previously accessed. This flag is
    typically used to determine if special handling is required for fresh instance
    locks, such as initializing default values or triggering specific event sequences.
    The method directly modifies the instance's internal state without returning any
    value.
  parameters:
  - name: isNew
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the instance lock should be marked
      as new (true) or not new (false). When set to true, the instance lock is considered
      a fresh creation; when false, it indicates the lock has been previously used.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Marking an Instance Lock as New
    code: 'InstanceLock* lock = new InstanceLock();

      lock->SetIsNew(true);

      // The instance lock is now marked as newly created'
    language: cpp
  - title: Resetting Instance Lock Status
    code: 'InstanceLock* lock = GetInstanceLockForPlayer(playerGuid);

      lock->SetIsNew(false);

      // The instance lock is no longer considered new'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the InstanceLock object.
    It should be called carefully to ensure proper synchronization with other systems
    that rely on this flag, especially in multi-threaded environments such as those
    found in TrinityCore's core systems.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to inconsistent instance lock states,
    potentially causing unexpected behavior during instance entry or exit sequences.
    Ensure that the isNew parameter accurately reflects the actual state of the instance
    lock to maintain game integrity.
