  class: Player
  method: AddToWorld
  signature: void Player::AddToWorld()
documentation:
  brief: Adds the player to the world object manager, making it visible to other players
    and NPCs.
  description: The AddToWorld method is responsible for registering a player character
    with the WorldObjectManager, which is essential for maintaining the player's visibility
    within the game world. This method ensures that the player becomes part of the
    global world state, allowing other players and NPCs to interact with them. It
    typically involves updating internal lists and caches that track active players
    and objects in the world. The method is commonly called during player initialization
    or when a player enters the world from being offline. This process is crucial
    for maintaining proper game mechanics such as player-to-player communication,
    object interaction, and server-side updates.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void Player::AddToWorld()\n{\n    // Implementation in TrinityCore\n  \
      \  // This method is called during player initialization\n    // and when a\
      \ player enters the world\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per player, typically during initialization
    or when entering the world. It's important to note that calling this method multiple
    times can lead to duplicate entries in the world object manager and potential
    memory leaks. The method is thread-safe as it's designed to work with TrinityCore's
    internal threading model.
  warnings: Calling AddToWorld more than once per player can cause issues with world
    object management, leading to duplicate entries or memory leaks. It should not
    be called during gameplay unless the player is being re-added to the world after
    being removed.
