  signature: int GroupFormation::GenerateArrowFormation(uint32 memberCount, float
    spacing) const
documentation:
  brief: Generates an arrow formation for a group of players in World of Warcraft.
  description: The GenerateArrowFormation method creates a specific tactical formation
    for a group of players, arranging them in an arrow-like pattern. This formation
    is typically used in group-based gameplay scenarios such as raids or dungeons
    where positioning is critical. The method takes into account the number of group
    members and spacing between them to determine optimal placement. It returns an
    identifier that represents the generated formation type or status.
  parameters:
  - name: memberCount
    description: The total number of group members to include in the arrow formation.
      Must be a positive integer representing valid player count.
  - name: spacing
    description: The distance between each member in the formation. Should be a positive
      float value that defines how spread out the players will be.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or type of formation generated.
    A return value of 0 typically signifies successful generation, while negative
    values may indicate errors such as invalid parameters or insufficient group members.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: int result = groupFormation.GenerateArrowFormation(5, 2.5f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling Example
    code: "int result = groupFormation.GenerateArrowFormation(0, 1.0f);\nif (result\
      \ < 0) {\n    // Handle error case\n    std::cout << \"Failed to generate arrow\
      \ formation\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger group management system in TrinityCore
    and may interact with AI pathfinding or player positioning logic. The actual visual
    representation of the arrow formation depends on client-side rendering and game
    mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that memberCount is greater than zero to avoid undefined behavior.
    The spacing parameter should be carefully chosen to prevent overlapping or excessive
    gaps between players in the formation.
