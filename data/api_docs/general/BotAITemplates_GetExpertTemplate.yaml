  method: GetExpertTemplate
  signature: BotAIConfig BotAITemplates::GetExpertTemplate()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the expert-level AI configuration template used for advanced bot
    behavior.
  description: The GetExpertTemplate method returns a BotAIConfig object that contains
    predefined settings and behaviors for bots operating at expert difficulty. This
    template defines advanced AI parameters such as combat strategies, spell usage
    patterns, movement behaviors, and decision-making logic optimized for challenging
    bot encounters. The returned configuration is typically used when initializing
    or upgrading bot AI to expert level, ensuring consistent behavior across all expert-level
    bots in the system. This method does not modify any existing configurations but
    provides a read-only template that can be applied to bot instances.
  parameters: []
  returns: A BotAIConfig object containing expert-level AI settings and behaviors.
    The configuration includes parameters for combat tactics, spell selection, movement
    patterns, and decision-making algorithms designed for advanced bot performance.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Expert Template for Bot Initialization
    code: 'BotAIConfig expertTemplate = botAiTemplates.GetExpertTemplate();

      // Apply the template to a new bot instance

      bot->SetAIConfig(expertTemplate);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during bot creation or configuration updates.
    The returned BotAIConfig object should be treated as immutable for direct modification;
    instead, create a copy if customization is needed. Performance-wise, this method
    performs minimal operations as it returns a pre-defined template.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned BotAIConfig directly as it may affect other
    bots using the same template. Always make a copy if you need to customize the
    configuration for specific bot instances.
