  signature: void GroupCombatTrigger::UpdateStatistics(bool assistingLeader, std::chrono::milliseconds
    engagementTime)
documentation:
  brief: Updates combat engagement statistics for a group member based on leadership
    status and time spent in combat.
  description: The UpdateStatistics method is used to record and update combat-related
    metrics for a player within a group context. It tracks how long a player has been
    engaged in combat, whether they were assisting the group leader, and updates internal
    statistics accordingly. This functionality is typically invoked during group combat
    scenarios where player engagement and leadership roles are relevant. The method
    does not return any value but modifies internal state variables that may be used
    for achievement tracking, loot distribution, or performance analysis within the
    group.
  parameters:
  - name: assistingLeader
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the player was actively assisting
      the group leader during combat. True if assisting, false otherwise.
  - name: engagementTime
    description: Duration of time spent in combat, represented as a std::chrono::milliseconds
      object. This value determines how long the player was engaged in combat activities.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GroupCombatTrigger trigger;

      trigger.UpdateStatistics(true, std::chrono::milliseconds(30000)); // Player
      assisted leader for 30 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Non-Assisting Combat Engagement
    code: 'GroupCombatTrigger trigger;

      trigger.UpdateStatistics(false, std::chrono::milliseconds(45000)); // Player
      engaged but did not assist leader for 45 seconds'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger combat tracking system that monitors
    group performance and player contributions. It may be called automatically by
    the game engine during combat events or manually by AI logic when specific conditions
    are met. The internal statistics updated by this method could influence rewards,
    achievements, or group dynamics in World of Warcraft.
  warnings: Ensure that engagementTime is accurately calculated to avoid skewing combat
    statistics. Incorrect time values may lead to inaccurate performance metrics or
    reward distributions. This method should only be called when a player is actually
    engaged in combat to maintain data integrity.
