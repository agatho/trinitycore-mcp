  class: PathGenerator
  method: UpdateFilter
  signature: void PathGenerator::UpdateFilter()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the pathfinding filter used by the PathGenerator to determine valid
    movement paths.
  description: The UpdateFilter method refreshes the internal filtering mechanism
    of the PathGenerator, which is responsible for determining valid waypoints and
    navigation paths in the game world. This method typically recalculates or reinitializes
    the filters that define what areas, objects, or conditions are considered when
    generating a path. It ensures that the pathfinding logic respects current game
    state constraints such as terrain, obstacles, creature positions, or environmental
    restrictions. The method is commonly invoked when the underlying navigation data
    changes or when the path generator needs to adapt to new movement requirements.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in pathfinding update
    code: 'PathGenerator* pathGen = new PathGenerator();

      pathGen->UpdateFilter();

      // Path filter updated, ready for new path calculations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after any significant change to the environment
    or movement constraints that affect pathfinding. It may impact performance if
    invoked too frequently without proper batching.
