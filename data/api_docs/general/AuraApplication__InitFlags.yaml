  class: AuraApplication
  method: _InitFlags
  signature: void AuraApplication::_InitFlags(Unit * caster, uint32 effMask)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the flags for an aura application based on the caster and effect
    mask.
  description: The _InitFlags method sets up internal flag states for an AuraApplication
    object, determining how the aura behaves based on the caster unit and the active
    effects. This method is typically called during aura initialization to configure
    proper behavior flags such as whether the aura is passive, temporary, or has specific
    application conditions. It ensures that the aura's properties are correctly set
    before it is applied to a target unit.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that cast the aura. This determines the
      aura's source and affects behavior such as stacking rules, duration, and effect
      application.
  - name: effMask
    description: A bitmask representing which effects of the aura are active. Each
      bit corresponds to a specific aura effect index, allowing selective activation
      of individual effects within the aura.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Aura Initialization
    code: 'AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication(caster, target, effMask);

      app->_InitFlags(caster, effMask);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Flags for Specific Effects
    code: 'uint32 effectMask = 0x01 | 0x04; // Activate effects 0 and 2

      AuraApplication* auraApp = new AuraApplication(player, target, effectMask);

      auraApp->_InitFlags(player, effectMask);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is an internal utility function used during the construction
    and setup phase of aura applications. It should not be called directly by external
    code unless implementing custom aura behavior. The flags initialized here determine
    how the aura interacts with the target unit's state and other auras.
  warnings: Calling _InitFlags without proper initialization of the AuraApplication
    object may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This method modifies internal
    state and should only be invoked during controlled setup phases.
