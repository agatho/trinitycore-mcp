  class: PerformanceWindow
  method: GetWinRate
  signature: float PerformanceWindow::GetWinRate() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the win rate percentage of the performance window.
  description: The GetWinRate method computes the ratio of successful outcomes to
    total attempts within the performance window, expressed as a floating-point value
    between 0.0 and 1.0. This value represents the probability of success for actions
    tracked by this performance window. The method is typically used in game mechanics
    that require tracking player performance or action efficiency over time. It does
    not modify any internal state and is safe to call multiple times. The calculation
    may involve various performance metrics depending on how the PerformanceWindow
    was initialized and what type of actions it monitors.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the win rate as a decimal between 0.0 (no successes)
    and 1.0 (all attempts successful). Returns 0.0 if no attempts have been recorded.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PerformanceWindow window;

      // ... populate window with data ...

      float winRate = window.GetWinRate();

      std::cout << "Win rate: " << winRate * 100 << "%" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Win Rate in Performance Analysis
    code: "void AnalyzePlayerPerformance(PerformanceWindow& window) {\n    float rate\
      \ = window.GetWinRate();\n    if (rate >= 0.9f) {\n        std::cout << \"Excellent\
      \ performance!\" << std::endl;\n    } else if (rate >= 0.7f) {\n        std::cout\
      \ << \"Good performance.\" << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        std::cout <<\
      \ \"Needs improvement.\" << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the PerformanceWindow has been properly initialized
    with valid data. If no attempts have been recorded, it will return 0.0. The implementation
    may cache results for performance reasons if called frequently.
  warnings: Ensure that the PerformanceWindow is populated with meaningful data before
    calling this method; otherwise, returned values may be misleading or zero. This
    method should not be used in performance-critical sections without considering
    potential caching strategies.
