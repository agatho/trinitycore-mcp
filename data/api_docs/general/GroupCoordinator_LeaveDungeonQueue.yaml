documentation:
  brief: Removes the group coordinator from the dungeon queue, canceling any pending
    dungeon invitations or queued requests.
  description: The LeaveDungeonQueue method is responsible for removing a group coordinator
    from the dungeon queue system within TrinityCore. This action effectively cancels
    any ongoing dungeon matchmaking attempts or queued invitations that were associated
    with the group. The method ensures that the group no longer participates in dungeon
    queue operations, freeing up resources and preventing further queue-related interactions.
    It is typically invoked when a group decides to leave a dungeon queue, either
    manually by the player or automatically due to group changes such as member disbanding
    or leaving the instance.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GroupCoordinator* coordinator = GetGroupCoordinator();

      coordinator->LeaveDungeonQueue();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on valid group coordinators that are currently
    in a dungeon queue. Calling it on a coordinator not in the queue may result in
    undefined behavior or no-op execution. The method internally handles cleanup of
    queue-related data structures and updates group state accordingly.
  warnings: Ensure that the GroupCoordinator instance is still valid before calling
    this method, as calling it on a destroyed or invalid coordinator can lead to memory
    corruption or crashes. This method does not notify other players in the group
    about the queue departure; additional communication logic may be required for
    full group coordination.
