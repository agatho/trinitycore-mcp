  signature: bool AuraScript::_IsDefaultActionPrevented() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the default action of an aura is prevented.
  description: The _IsDefaultActionPrevented method determines if the default behavior
    associated with an aura has been overridden or blocked by a script. This is commonly
    used in AuraScript implementations to control whether standard aura effects should
    proceed, such as preventing the application of a debuff or the triggering of a
    periodic effect. The method returns true if the default action has been prevented,
    and false otherwise. It is typically called within custom aura handlers to make
    conditional decisions based on script logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the default action of the aura has been
    prevented. Returns true if prevented, false if allowed to proceed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AuraScript
    code: "class MyAuraScript : public AuraScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnApply(AuraEffect\
      \ const* aurEff, AuraEffectHandleModes mode) override\n    {\n        if (_IsDefaultActionPrevented())\n\
      \        {\n            // Do not apply default aura effect\n            return;\n\
      \        }\n        // Proceed with normal application logic\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal AuraScript API and should only be used
    within custom aura implementations. It relies on the script's internal state to
    determine if default actions have been modified, typically through calls to _SetDefaultActionPrevented().
  warnings: Incorrectly using this method without proper initialization or calling
    it outside of an appropriate aura context may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure
    that the aura script is properly registered and active before checking this flag.
