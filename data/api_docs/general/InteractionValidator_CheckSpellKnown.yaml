  signature: bool InteractionValidator::CheckSpellKnown(::Player * bot, uint32 spellId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player knows a specific spell by ID
  description: Determines whether the specified player has learned the given spell.
    This method is commonly used in AI behavior scripts to validate if a bot can cast
    a particular spell before attempting to use it. The check typically involves verifying
    the player's spellbook for the presence of the spell ID, including any learned
    or innate abilities. It does not account for temporary spell effects or buffs
    that might make a spell appear known without being officially in the character's
    spellbook.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose spell
      knowledge is being checked
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to check for in the player's spellbook
  returns: True if the player knows the specified spell, false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Knowledge Check
    code: "if (validator.CheckSpellKnown(player, 12345)) {\n    // Player knows spell\
      \ with ID 12345\n    player->CastSpell(player, 12345, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spell Casting
    code: "uint32 fireballSpellId = 133;\nif (validator.CheckSpellKnown(bot, fireballSpellId))\
      \ {\n    bot->CastSpell(target, fireballSpellId, true);\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ case where spell is not known\n    bot->Say(\"I don't know how to cast Fireball!\"\
      , LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's current spellbook state and does not consider
    temporary effects or buffs that might grant spell knowledge. It is typically used
    in conjunction with other validation methods to ensure proper AI behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell ID passed is valid and corresponds to an actual
    learned spell; invalid IDs may lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if not handled
    properly.
