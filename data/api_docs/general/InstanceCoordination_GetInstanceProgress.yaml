  method: GetInstanceProgress
  signature: InstanceProgress InstanceCoordination::GetInstanceProgress(uint32 groupId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the progress status of a specific instance group within the coordination
    system.
  description: The GetInstanceProgress method fetches the current progression state
    for a given instance group identifier. This method is typically used in TrinityCore's
    instance coordination framework to track player progress through dungeon or raid
    content. The returned InstanceProgress object contains information about completion
    status, boss kills, and other relevant progression metrics for the specified group.
    The method assumes that the group ID corresponds to an active instance group managed
    by the coordination system.
  parameters: []
  returns: An InstanceProgress object containing detailed progression data for the
    specified instance group. This includes completion flags, boss kill states, and
    any relevant timing or tracking information associated with the instance group's
    progress.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "InstanceCoordination* coord = sObjectAccessor->GetPlayerByGUID(playerGuid)->GetInstanceCoordination();\n\
      InstanceProgress progress = coord->GetInstanceProgress(12345);\nif (progress.IsCompleted())\
      \ {\n    // Handle completed instance logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. It
    performs no blocking operations and returns immediately with the current progress
    state. The returned InstanceProgress object should not be modified directly as
    changes may not persist correctly.
  warnings: Ensure that the groupId parameter corresponds to an actual active instance
    group managed by the coordination system, otherwise undefined behavior may occur.
    This method does not validate the existence of the group ID before attempting
    to retrieve progress data.
