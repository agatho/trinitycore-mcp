  class: BehaviorAdaptation
  method: ShareKnowledge
  signature: void BehaviorAdaptation::ShareKnowledge(uint32_t sourceBotGuid, uint32_t
    targetBotGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Shares knowledge between two bot instances using their GUIDs.
  description: The ShareKnowledge method facilitates the transfer of learned information
    or behaviors from one bot instance to another within the TrinityCore AI system.
    This functionality allows bots to adapt and improve their performance by leveraging
    the experiences and data acquired by other bots in the same environment. The method
    operates on unique identifiers (GUIDs) that represent individual bot instances,
    ensuring precise targeting of knowledge transfer operations. It is typically used
    in multi-bot scenarios where collective learning enhances overall system intelligence.
  parameters:
  - name: sourceBotGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot from which knowledge will
      be shared. This value must correspond to a valid active bot instance within
      the system.
  - name: targetBotGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that will receive the shared
      knowledge. This value must correspond to a valid active bot instance within
      the system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Knowledge Sharing Between Bots
    code: 'BehaviorAdaptation adaptation;

      uint32_t sourceGuid = 12345;

      uint32_t targetGuid = 67890;

      adaptation.ShareKnowledge(sourceGuid, targetGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Knowledge Sharing Based on Bot State
    code: "BehaviorAdaptation adaptation;\nif (sourceBot->IsLearningComplete() &&\
      \ targetBot->IsReadyForTraining()) {\n    adaptation.ShareKnowledge(sourceBot->GetGUID(),\
      \ targetBot->GetGUID());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that both source and target bots are active and properly
    initialized within the AI subsystem. Knowledge sharing may involve synchronization
    mechanisms to prevent race conditions during concurrent access. The actual implementation
    details of how knowledge is structured and transferred are abstracted away from
    this interface.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or non-existent GUIDs can lead to undefined
    behavior or system instability. Ensure that both bots exist and are in a valid
    state before invoking this method. Avoid frequent calls in tight loops as it may
    impact performance due to potential serialization overhead.
