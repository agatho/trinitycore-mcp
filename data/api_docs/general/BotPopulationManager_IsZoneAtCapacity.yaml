  signature: bool BotPopulationManager::IsZoneAtCapacity(uint32 zoneId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the specified zone has reached its maximum bot population
    capacity.
  description: The IsZoneAtCapacity method determines if a given zone has reached
    its configured maximum limit for bot population. This is used by the TrinityCore
    bot system to prevent overpopulation in areas and maintain game balance. The method
    evaluates the current number of bots in the specified zone against the zone's
    defined capacity threshold. It typically considers factors such as zone size,
    difficulty level, and server configuration settings that control how many bots
    can exist simultaneously within a given area.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the zone has reached or exceeded its maximum bot population
    capacity; otherwise returns false. This indicates whether additional bots should
    be prevented from spawning in the specified zone to maintain system balance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check zone capacity
    code: "if (sBotPopulationManager->IsZoneAtCapacity(1234)) {\n    // Zone is at\
      \ capacity, do not spawn more bots\n    sLog->outString(\"Zone 1234 is at maximum\
      \ bot capacity.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in bot spawning logic
    code: "uint32 zoneId = player->GetZoneId();\nif (!sBotPopulationManager->IsZoneAtCapacity(zoneId))\
      \ {\n    // Spawn a new bot\n    Bot* newBot = sBotAI->CreateBot(player);\n\
      \    if (newBot) {\n        newBot->Spawn();\n    }\n} else {\n    // Zone is\
      \ full, log or handle accordingly\n    sLog->outString(\"Cannot spawn bot: zone\
      \ %u at capacity.\", zoneId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely caches zone capacity data for performance reasons and
    may be called frequently during bot spawning operations. The actual capacity limits
    are typically defined in configuration files or database entries related to bot
    population management.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a definitive check for bot spawning
    without considering other factors like player presence, difficulty settings, or
    server load. Over-reliance on this check may lead to uneven bot distribution across
    zones.
