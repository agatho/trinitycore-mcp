  class: KitingManager
  method: SetKitingAggressiveness
  signature: void KitingManager::SetKitingAggressiveness(float aggressiveness)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the kiting aggressiveness level for the KitingManager instance.
  description: The SetKitingAggressiveness method configures how aggressively a creature
    or NPC will pursue its target while using kiting behavior. This parameter controls
    the decision-making process of the AI when determining whether to chase or maintain
    distance from enemies. Higher values typically result in more aggressive pursuit,
    while lower values lead to more cautious, defensive behavior. The aggressiveness
    value is usually normalized between 0.0 (passive) and 1.0 (highly aggressive),
    though exact ranges may vary based on implementation details.
  parameters:
  - name: aggressiveness
    description: A floating-point value representing the desired kiting aggressiveness
      level, typically ranging from 0.0 (passive) to 1.0 (highly aggressive). Values
      outside this range may be clamped or result in undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set moderate kiting aggressiveness
    code: 'KitingManager* manager = player->GetKitingManager();

      manager->SetKitingAggressiveness(0.5f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Set highly aggressive kiting behavior
    code: 'KitingManager* manager = creature->GetKitingManager();

      manager->SetKitingAggressiveness(0.9f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects AI decision-making during combat and kiting
    scenarios. It should be called before engaging in combat to ensure proper behavior.
    The implementation may cache or validate the input value, so repeated calls with
    similar values may not trigger recalculations.
  warnings: Setting very high aggressiveness values (close to 1.0) may cause NPCs
    to become overly aggressive and potentially get stuck in combat situations where
    they cannot retreat. Ensure that the aggressiveness level is appropriate for the
    creature's role and difficulty setting.
