  method: GetExecutionCount
  signature: uint32 Action::GetExecutionCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of times this action has been executed.
  description: The GetExecutionCount method retrieves the total number of times an
    Action object has been executed within the AI system. This count is typically
    used to track action usage, implement cooldowns, or enforce limits on repeated
    actions. The execution count is incremented each time the action's Execute() method
    is successfully called. This value can be useful for behavior scripting, debugging
    AI logic, and implementing conditional actions based on frequency of execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of times this action has been
    executed. Returns 0 if the action has never been executed.
  examples:
  - title: Check Execution Count Before Execution
    code: "if (action->GetExecutionCount() < 5)\n{\n    action->Execute();\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Action has been executed too many times, skip or handle accordingly\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Action Execution Frequency
    code: 'uint32 count = action->GetExecutionCount();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("ai", "Action %s executed %u times", action->GetName().c_str(),
      count);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The execution count is maintained internally by the AI system and is automatically
    incremented upon successful completion of an action. This method is thread-safe
    as it only reads a stored value without modifying shared state during execution.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this value for critical game logic decisions, as
    the count may not persist across server restarts or AI state resets. Also, ensure
    that the action's execution count does not cause unintended behavior in complex
    AI decision trees.
