  method: PvPCombatReference
  signature: void PvPCombatReference::PvPCombatReference(Unit * first, Unit * second)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a PvP combat reference between two units, establishing their
    combat state and tracking their PvP engagement.
  description: The PvPCombatReference constructor initializes a PvP combat reference
    between two Unit objects, typically representing players or NPCs involved in player-versus-player
    combat. This method sets up internal tracking mechanisms to monitor the PvP engagement
    state between the specified units. The initialization process likely involves
    setting flags, updating combat timers, and registering the units with the PvP
    combat system. It is commonly used when a PvP encounter begins, such as when one
    player attacks another player or when a player enters a PvP zone while in combat
    with an opponent. This method does not return any value but modifies the internal
    state of both units to reflect their PvP combat relationship.
  parameters:
  - name: first
    description: Pointer to the first Unit object involved in the PvP combat reference.
      This typically represents one of the players or NPCs entering PvP combat.
  - name: second
    description: Pointer to the second Unit object involved in the PvP combat reference.
      This typically represents the other player or NPC in the PvP combat relationship.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic PvP Combat Reference Initialization
    code: 'Unit* player1 = ...;

      Unit* player2 = ...;

      PvPCombatReference pvpRef(player1, player2);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing PvP Combat in a Combat Handler
    code: "void HandlePlayerAttack(Player* attacker, Player* target) {\n    if (attacker->IsPvP()\
      \ && target->IsPvP()) {\n        PvPCombatReference pvpRef(attacker, target);\n\
      \        // Combat state is now established\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal flags on both Unit objects to indicate
    PvP combat status. It may also trigger updates to the player's PvP timer and faction
    status. The constructor does not perform any validation of whether the units are
    actually in a PvP state, so callers should ensure proper preconditions before
    invoking this method.
  warnings: This method assumes that both parameters are valid Unit pointers and will
    likely crash or behave unpredictably if either parameter is null. It's important
    to verify that both units are valid and in appropriate combat states before calling
    this constructor.
