  signature: SpatialGridScheduler & SpatialGridScheduler::Instance()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the SpatialGridScheduler class
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the SpatialGridScheduler
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the scheduler exists throughout the
    application lifecycle. This scheduler is responsible for managing spatial grid-based
    object positioning and updates within the game world, particularly for handling
    creature and player movement, visibility calculations, and efficient spatial queries.
    The method is thread-safe and should be used to access the global spatial grid
    management system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the single instance of the SpatialGridScheduler class. This
    reference provides access to all scheduling and spatial grid functionality without
    requiring explicit instantiation.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the SpatialGridScheduler instance
    code: 'SpatialGridScheduler& scheduler = SpatialGridScheduler::Instance();

      // Use scheduler for spatial operations

      scheduler.Update(1000); // Update with 1000ms delta time'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses the Meyers singleton pattern which is thread-safe in C++11
    and later. The instance is created on first access and destroyed at program termination.
    Developers should not attempt to manually instantiate or delete SpatialGridScheduler
    objects.
  warnings: Do not call this method from within a constructor of another singleton,
    as it may lead to undefined behavior due to initialization order issues. Avoid
    storing references to the instance in global variables that might be accessed
    before the scheduler is initialized.
