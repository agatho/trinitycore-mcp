  signature: float Quest::GetArtifactXPMultiplier() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the artifact experience points multiplier for the quest.
  description: This method retrieves the artifact experience points multiplier value
    associated with the current quest. The multiplier affects how much artifact experience
    players gain when completing the quest. It is typically used in conjunction with
    other artifact-related methods to determine the final artifact experience reward.
    The value returned represents a scaling factor that modifies the base artifact
    experience points calculation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the artifact XP multiplier for the quest.
    This value is typically greater than or equal to 0.0f and may be used to scale
    the base artifact experience points reward.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float multiplier = quest->GetArtifactXPMultiplier();

      float xpReward = baseXP * multiplier;

      // Use multiplier to calculate final artifact XP reward'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the artifact quest system in TrinityCore and should
    be used in conjunction with other artifact-related methods. The value returned
    may vary depending on quest conditions, player level, and artifact requirements.
  warnings: Be aware that this method may return 0.0f for quests that do not contribute
    to artifact experience points. Ensure proper validation before using the returned
    value in calculations.
