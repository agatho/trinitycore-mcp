documentation:
  brief: Sets a weak reference pointer for the guild object to enable safe memory
    management and prevent dangling references.
  description: The SetWeakPtr method assigns a weak reference identifier to the Guild
    object, which is used internally by TrinityCore's memory management system to
    track and manage object lifetimes. This mechanism helps prevent use-after-free
    errors when the guild object might be destroyed while other systems still hold
    references to it. The weak reference allows systems to check if the guild still
    exists before attempting to access its members or properties. This method is typically
    called during object initialization or when establishing weak references from
    other systems like player sessions or database handlers.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Setting Weak Pointer During Guild Creation
    code: 'Guild* guild = new Guild();

      guild->SetWeakPtr(12345); // Assign weak reference ID

      // Later, other systems can use this ID to safely check if the guild still exists'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Weak Pointer Management System
    code: "void InitializeGuildWeakRef(Guild* guild) {\n    static int nextWeakRef\
      \ = 1000;\n    guild->SetWeakPtr(nextWeakRef++);\n    // This weak reference\
      \ can now be used in weak pointer containers\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's internal memory management infrastructure.
    The weak reference value should typically be generated by a global counter or
    allocator to ensure uniqueness across all guild objects. The implementation relies
    on the underlying weak pointer system that tracks object lifetimes and prevents
    dangling references in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you understand the internal memory
    management system of TrinityCore. Incorrect usage can lead to memory corruption
    or undefined behavior. The weak reference value should be unique and managed properly
    to avoid conflicts with other objects.
