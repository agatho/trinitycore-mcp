  method: IsInitialized
  signature: bool BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::IsInitialized() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot world session manager has been properly initialized
    and is ready for use.
  description: The IsInitialized method determines if the BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized
    class instance has completed its initialization process. This check is crucial
    in TrinityCore's bot system to ensure that all necessary resources, configurations,
    and subsystems are correctly set up before attempting to manage or interact with
    bot sessions. The method typically verifies internal flags or state variables
    that indicate completion of setup routines such as loading configuration data,
    initializing session pools, or establishing required connections. This validation
    helps prevent runtime errors when trying to perform operations on an uninitialized
    manager.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized instance has been successfully
    initialized and is ready for use; otherwise returns false if initialization is
    incomplete or failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Check
    code: "if (botWorldSessionMgr->IsInitialized()) {\n    // Proceed with bot session\
      \ management\n    std::cout << \"Bot manager is ready\" << std::endl;\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n    std::cerr << \"Bot manager not\
      \ initialized\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Bot Command Handler
    code: "void HandleBotCommand(ChatHandler* handler, const char* args) {\n    if\
      \ (!botWorldSessionMgr->IsInitialized()) {\n        handler->PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Bot system not initialized. Please wait.\");\n        return;\n    }\n    //\
      \ Proceed with bot command execution\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used as a safety check before performing any operations
    on the bot session manager. It's recommended to call this method before invoking
    other methods in the class to avoid undefined behavior or crashes due to uninitialized
    state.
  warnings: Calling other methods on an uninitialized BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized
    instance may result in undefined behavior, memory corruption, or crashes. Always
    verify initialization status before performing operations.
