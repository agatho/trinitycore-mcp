  method: ShouldSkipScan
  signature: bool InterruptAwareness::ShouldSkipScan() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a scan operation should be skipped based on interrupt
    awareness conditions.
  description: The ShouldSkipScan method evaluates current interrupt awareness state
    to decide if a scanning operation (such as threat assessment or target selection)
    should be bypassed. This is typically used in AI behavior systems where certain
    interrupts or states may prevent normal scanning logic from executing. The method
    checks internal flags and conditions related to the entity's current state, such
    as being stunned, silenced, or under specific debuffs that would logically prevent
    scanning operations from proceeding.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the scan should be skipped due to interrupt awareness conditions;
    otherwise returns false if scanning can proceed normally.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (!unit->GetInterruptAwareness()->ShouldSkipScan()) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with normal scanning logic\n    unit->ScanForThreats();\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Skip scanning due to interrupt state\n    unit->Log(\"Skipping scan due to\
      \ interrupt awareness.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in combat AI systems to prevent redundant or
    invalid scans during interrupt states. It may be called frequently during update
    loops, so performance should be considered for high-frequency operations.
