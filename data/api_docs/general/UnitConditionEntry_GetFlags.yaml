  class: UnitConditionEntry
  method: GetFlags
  signature: int UnitConditionEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flag bits associated with the unit condition entry.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitwise
    flags that define various conditions or states for a UnitConditionEntry. These
    flags are typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server
    to determine how units behave under certain conditions, such as being rooted,
    silenced, or affected by specific spells. The returned value can be evaluated
    using bitwise operations to check for individual flag states. This method is commonly
    used during condition evaluation and spell effect processing within the game engine.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer containing the combined flag bits for the unit condition entry.
    Each bit represents a different condition or state that may apply to the unit,
    such as movement restrictions, status effects, or behavioral modifiers.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a unit has a specific condition flag
    code: "UnitConditionEntry* entry = sObjectMgr->GetUnitConditionEntry(12345);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    int flags = entry->GetFlags();\n    if (flags & UNIT_CONDITION_FLAG_SILENCED)\n\
      \    {\n        // Unit is silenced\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple getter operation and does not involve any complex
    computations or database lookups. The flag values are typically defined in the
    game's condition system and should be referenced against the official TrinityCore
    documentation for accurate interpretation.
