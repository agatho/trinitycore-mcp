documentation:
  brief: Adds a spell ability with specified priority and condition to the rotation
    priority list
  description: The AddAbility method registers a spell ability into the rotation priority
    system, allowing the AI to determine when and how often to use specific spells
    based on defined priorities and conditional logic. This method is typically used
    in AI behavior scripting to build complex spell rotation sequences for NPCs or
    player characters. The spell ID identifies which ability to add, while the priority
    value determines its placement in the rotation order. A condition parameter allows
    for contextual restrictions that must be met before the ability can be considered
    for use. This method modifies internal state and does not return any value.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: Unique identifier of the spell to add to the rotation priority list.
      Must correspond to a valid spell entry in the game database.
  - name: priority
    description: Floating-point value representing the priority level of this ability
      within the rotation. Higher values indicate higher priority for execution.
  - name: condition
    description: Integer value specifying a condition code that determines when this
      ability can be used. Negative values may indicate special conditions or disable
      flags.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: rotation.AddAbility(12345, 90.0f, 0); // Adds Fireball with high priority
      and no condition
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: rotation.AddAbility(12346, 85.0f, -1); // Adds Frostbolt with medium priority
      but disabled condition
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal rotation priority list and should
    be called during initialization or configuration phases of AI behavior. The priority
    values are used in sorting algorithms to determine execution order, so consistent
    ordering is important for predictable behavior.
  warnings: Incorrect spell IDs will result in undefined behavior or failed spell
    casting attempts. Negative priority values may cause unexpected sorting behavior
    if not properly handled by the underlying system.
