  class: SubtletyRogueRefactored
  method: ExecuteAoERotation
  signature: void SubtletyRogueRefactored::ExecuteAoERotation(int * target, uint32
    enemyCount)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the subtlety rogue's ability rotation for AoE combat scenarios.
  description: The ExecuteAoERotation method determines and applies the optimal sequence
    of abilities for a subtlety rogue when engaging multiple enemies in an area-of-effect
    scenario. This method evaluates the current combat state, enemy count, and available
    resources to select appropriate abilities such as Fan of Knives, Shadowstrike,
    or other AoE attacks. It integrates with the rogue's overall AI decision-making
    framework to maximize damage output while maintaining stealth and resource efficiency
    during group combat situations.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an array of target identifiers (GUIDs) for enemies in
      the AoE range. The method uses this to determine optimal targeting strategy
      and ability usage.
  - name: enemyCount
    description: The total number of enemies within the AoE combat area. This value
      influences which abilities are selected and how they are prioritized during
      execution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AoE Rotation Execution
    code: 'int targets[5] = {1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005};

      uint32 count = 5;

      rogue->ExecuteAoERotation(targets, count);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Target Management in Combat
    code: 'std::vector<int> enemyTargets;

      // Populate enemyTargets with valid GUIDs

      uint32 enemyCount = enemyTargets.size();

      int* targetsArray = enemyTargets.data();

      rogue->ExecuteAoERotation(targetsArray, enemyCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the rogue is already in combat and has sufficient
    energy or combo points to execute abilities. It does not handle movement or positioning
    decisions directly; those are managed by separate AI components. The method may
    modify internal state variables related to ability cooldowns and resource tracking.
  warnings: Calling this method without valid target data may result in undefined
    behavior or incorrect ability selection. Ensure that the target array contains
    valid enemy identifiers before invoking this function. Do not call this during
    stealth-breaking actions as it may conflict with existing stealth management logic.
