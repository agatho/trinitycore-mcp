  class: BotChatCommandHandler
  method: ValidateArgumentCount
  signature: bool BotChatCommandHandler::ValidateArgumentCount(const CommandContext
    & context, const ChatCommand & command)
documentation:
  brief: Validates that the number of arguments provided in a chat command matches
    the expected count for the given command.
  description: The ValidateArgumentCount method checks whether the argument count
    from the CommandContext matches the required argument count defined in the ChatCommand
    structure. This is essential for ensuring that chat commands are used correctly
    and prevents execution of commands with incorrect parameter counts. The method
    typically runs before command execution to maintain game integrity and prevent
    runtime errors caused by malformed command usage. It performs a comparison between
    the actual arguments provided by the user and the expected argument count defined
    in the command's specification.
  parameters:
  - name: context
    description: The CommandContext object containing information about the command
      execution context, including the arguments provided by the user.
  - name: command
    description: The ChatCommand object that defines the expected argument count and
      other command properties for validation.
  returns: Returns true if the number of arguments in the context matches the expected
    argument count defined in the command; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Usage
    code: "bool isValid = handler.ValidateArgumentCount(context, command);\nif (!isValid)\
      \ {\n    // Handle invalid argument count\n    SendSysMessage(\"Invalid number\
      \ of arguments.\");\n    return false;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Command Execution
    code: "class MyChatCommandHandler : public BotChatCommandHandler {\npublic:\n\
      \    bool HandleMyCommand(const CommandContext& context) {\n        ChatCommand\
      \ myCommand = {\"mycommand\", 2, \"Usage: .mycommand <arg1> <arg2>\"};\n   \
      \     if (!ValidateArgumentCount(context, myCommand)) {\n            SendSysMessage(\"\
      Invalid argument count for mycommand.\");\n            return false;\n     \
      \   }\n        // Proceed with command logic\n        return true;\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called early in the command processing pipeline
    to prevent unnecessary execution of commands with incorrect arguments. It's important
    for maintaining consistent behavior across different command types and helps prevent
    potential crashes or unexpected behavior due to argument mismatches.
  warnings: The method assumes that both context and command parameters are valid
    and properly initialized. Calling this method with null or uninitialized parameters
    may lead to undefined behavior. Additionally, the validation only checks argument
    count and does not validate argument types or content.
