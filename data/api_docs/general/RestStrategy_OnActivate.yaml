api:
  class: RestStrategy
  method: OnActivate
  signature: void RestStrategy::OnActivate(BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Activates the rest strategy for a bot AI, initializing its resting behavior
    and state management.
  description: The OnActivate method is called when the RestStrategy is initialized
    or activated within the context of a BotAI instance. This method sets up the necessary
    internal state and configurations required for the bot to begin executing rest-related
    actions such as finding suitable resting locations, managing stamina recovery,
    and handling idle states during gameplay. It ensures that all required resources
    are allocated and that the strategy's behavior is properly integrated into the
    AI's decision-making loop. The activation process typically occurs when a bot
    enters a state where resting or idling becomes necessary, such as when its health
    or mana is low, or when it has completed its primary objectives.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that owns this strategy. This parameter
      provides access to the AI's context, including player state, current actions,
      and game environment data needed for rest behavior implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Activation Usage
    code: "void example() {\n    BotAI* ai = new BotAI();\n    RestStrategy strategy;\n\
      \    strategy.OnActivate(ai);\n    // Strategy is now active and will manage\
      \ bot's resting behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per strategy instance during initialization.
    Repeated calls may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. The method assumes
    that the provided BotAI pointer is valid and properly initialized before invocation.
  warnings: Do not call OnActivate with a null BotAI pointer, as this will likely
    result in segmentation faults or access violations. Ensure that the AI instance
    has been fully constructed and configured before activating any strategies.
