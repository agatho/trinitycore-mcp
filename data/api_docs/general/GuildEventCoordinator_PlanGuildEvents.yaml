documentation:
  brief: Schedules and organizes upcoming guild events for members.
  description: The PlanGuildEvents method is responsible for coordinating and scheduling
    upcoming guild events within the World of Warcraft environment. This method likely
    evaluates available guild members, checks event availability, and sets up event
    details such as date, time, and required participation. It may also handle event
    notifications and ensure proper resource allocation for guild activities. The
    method operates on internal guild event data structures and updates the guild's
    event calendar accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier (GUID) who
      initiated the event planning process. This parameter may be used to validate
      permissions or track event creators.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Planning
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.PlanGuildEvents(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the guild's internal event management system
    and may require the calling player to have appropriate guild permissions. It might
    be invoked automatically during certain game events or manually by guild leaders.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and points to a legitimate player
    GUID before calling this method. Improper usage could lead to undefined behavior
    in the guild event system.
