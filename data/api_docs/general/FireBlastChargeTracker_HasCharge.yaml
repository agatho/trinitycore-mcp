  method: HasCharge
  signature: bool FireBlastChargeTracker::HasCharge() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the FireBlastChargeTracker has any charges remaining.
  description: The HasCharge method determines whether the FireBlastChargeTracker
    instance currently holds one or more usable charges. This is typically used in
    spell or ability systems where a player or creature can perform an action a limited
    number of times before needing to recharge. The method returns true if at least
    one charge is available, and false otherwise. This check is commonly performed
    before allowing a fire blast ability to be cast or executed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the FireBlastChargeTracker has at least one charge available;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Logic
    code: "if (fireBlastTracker.HasCharge()) {\n    // Execute fire blast spell\n\
      \    player.CastSpell(target, FIRE_BLAST_SPELL_ID);\n    fireBlastTracker.ConsumeCharge();\n\
      } else {\n    // Notify player they cannot use the ability\n    player.SendSystemMessage(\"\
      You do not have enough charges to use Fire Blast.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other charge management
    functions such as ConsumeCharge() and AddCharge(). It's important to ensure that
    the charge state is properly synchronized, especially in multi-threaded environments
    or when dealing with networked game states.
