  class: FlightMasterManager
  method: GetMemoryUsage
  signature: size_t FlightMasterManager::GetMemoryUsage() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total memory usage in bytes of all flight paths
    managed by the FlightMasterManager instance.
  description: The GetMemoryUsage method computes the cumulative memory footprint
    of all flight paths currently stored within the FlightMasterManager. This includes
    memory allocated for flight path data structures, node information, and associated
    metadata. The method is typically used for performance monitoring, debugging,
    or memory management purposes within the TrinityCore server environment. It provides
    insight into how much memory is being consumed by flight master functionality,
    which can be crucial for identifying potential memory leaks or optimizing resource
    usage in large-scale World of Warcraft servers.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a size_t value representing the total memory consumption in bytes
    of all managed flight paths. A return value of zero indicates no flight paths
    are currently loaded or managed by the instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Memory Usage Check
    code: 'FlightMasterManager* fmManager = sObjectMgr->GetFlightMasterManager();

      size_t memoryUsed = fmManager->GetMemoryUsage();

      TC_LOG_INFO("server.loading", "Flight Master Manager is using %zu bytes of memory.",
      memoryUsed);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Memory Usage Monitoring for Performance Debugging
    code: "void LogFlightMasterMemoryUsage()\n{\n    FlightMasterManager* fmManager\
      \ = sObjectMgr->GetFlightMasterManager();\n    size_t currentUsage = fmManager->GetMemoryUsage();\n\
      \    \n    if (currentUsage > 1048576) // 1 MB threshold\n    {\n        TC_LOG_WARN(\"\
      server.loading\", \"High memory usage detected in FlightMasterManager: %zu bytes\"\
      , currentUsage);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a complete traversal of all managed flight paths to
    calculate memory usage, which may have performance implications during high-frequency
    calls. The returned value includes overhead from memory allocation and may not
    reflect actual physical memory usage due to memory fragmentation. The implementation
    assumes thread safety for read operations but does not guarantee consistency if
    modifications occur concurrently.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently in performance-critical sections may introduce
    noticeable overhead. Do not rely on the exact memory values for real-time resource
    management decisions, as they include allocation overhead and may vary between
    different system configurations or TrinityCore builds.
