  signature: void ArenaTeam::LoadStatsFromDB(uint32 ArenaTeamId)
documentation:
  brief: Loads arena team statistics from the database for the specified arena team
    ID.
  description: The LoadStatsFromDB method retrieves and populates arena team statistics
    data from the database for a given arena team identifier. This method is typically
    invoked during server startup or when an arena team's data needs to be refreshed
    in memory. It ensures that the internal statistics of the arena team, such as
    rating, games played, and wins, are synchronized with the persistent database
    records. The method performs a database query to fetch the relevant stats and
    updates the arena team object's internal state accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: ArenaTeamId
    description: The unique identifier of the arena team whose statistics are to be
      loaded from the database. This ID corresponds to the arena_team.id field in
      the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Loading Arena Team Stats
    code: 'ArenaTeam* team = new ArenaTeam();

      team->LoadStatsFromDB(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the database connection is already established and
    functional. It may cause performance overhead if called frequently for many teams,
    as it involves a database query. The method should only be called after ensuring
    that the arena team object has been properly initialized.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or invalid arena team ID can lead
    to undefined behavior or database errors. Ensure that the ArenaTeamId parameter
    is valid and corresponds to an existing arena team in the database before invoking
    this method.
