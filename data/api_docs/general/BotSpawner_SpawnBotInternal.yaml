  class: BotSpawner
  method: SpawnBotInternal
  signature: bool BotSpawner::SpawnBotInternal(const int & request)
documentation:
  brief: Spawns a bot instance internally using the provided request identifier.
  description: The SpawnBotInternal method is responsible for creating and initializing
    a new bot instance within the TrinityCore framework. It takes a request identifier
    as input which determines the specific bot configuration to be spawned. This method
    handles the core logic of bot creation, including memory allocation, initial setup,
    and integration with the game world. The method ensures that all necessary components
    are properly initialized before returning control to the caller. It is typically
    invoked by higher-level systems such as bot managers or command handlers when
    a new bot instance is required.
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: An integer identifier that specifies which bot configuration to spawn.
      This value usually corresponds to a predefined bot template or profile index
      in the system.
  returns: Returns true if the bot was successfully spawned and initialized, false
    otherwise. A return value of false may indicate issues such as invalid request
    identifiers, insufficient resources, or failed initialization processes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Spawning
    code: "BotSpawner spawner;\nint requestId = 12345;\nbool success = spawner.SpawnBotInternal(requestId);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Bot successfully spawned\n} else {\n    // Handle spawn\
      \ failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling for Bot Spawning
    code: "BotSpawner spawner;\nint requestId = 99999; // Invalid request ID\nbool\
      \ success = spawner.SpawnBotInternal(requestId);\nif (!success) {\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to spawn bot with request ID %d\", requestId);\n    // Implement fallback\
      \ or error recovery logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically not called directly from external code but rather
    through wrapper functions or command interfaces. The internal spawning process
    may involve multiple subsystems including memory management, AI initialization,
    and world object registration. It's important to note that this method should
    be called on the correct thread context as specified by the TrinityCore threading
    model.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid request ID can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that all request identifiers are validated before being passed
    to this method. Additionally, repeated calls without proper cleanup may result
    in resource leaks.
