documentation:
  brief: Saves a player's personal emblem data to the database upon receiving a save
    request from the client.
  description: The HandleSavePersonalEmblem method processes a packet sent by the
    client containing updated personal emblem information for the player. This method
    is typically invoked when a player modifies their guild or character emblem and
    requests that the changes be saved. It validates the incoming data, ensures proper
    permissions, and persists the emblem details to the database. The method operates
    within the WorldSession context, associating the emblem update with the currently
    authenticated player. It does not return any value but triggers internal database
    operations to store the emblem configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: savePersonalEmblem
    description: A packet containing the updated personal emblem data sent by the
      client, including emblem details such as colors, symbols, and layout configurations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in session handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSavePersonalEmblem(const WorldPackets::Character::SavePersonalEmblem&\
      \ savePersonalEmblem)\n{\n    // Validate emblem data\n    if (!savePersonalEmblem.IsValid())\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Save emblem to database\n    _player->SetPersonalEmblem(savePersonalEmblem);\n\
      \    _player->SaveToDB();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the character customization system in TrinityCore
    and relies on proper client-server synchronization. The emblem data must be validated
    before saving to prevent corruption or invalid configurations. This function should
    only be called from within a valid WorldSession context where a player is authenticated.
  warnings: Improper handling of emblem data can lead to database inconsistencies
    or visual rendering issues in the game UI. Ensure that all emblem fields are properly
    sanitized and validated before calling this method.
