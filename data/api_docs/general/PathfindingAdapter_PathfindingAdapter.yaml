  method: PathfindingAdapter
  signature: void PathfindingAdapter::PathfindingAdapter()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the PathfindingAdapter class for AI pathfinding
    operations.
  description: The PathfindingAdapter constructor initializes the internal state and
    resources required for pathfinding functionality within the TrinityCore server.
    This adapter serves as a bridge between the core game mechanics and external pathfinding
    algorithms, enabling NPCs and creatures to navigate complex terrain and avoid
    obstacles. The initialization process sets up necessary data structures, registers
    callbacks, and prepares the environment for subsequent pathfinding requests. It
    is typically invoked during the creation of AI behavior modules or when initializing
    creature movement systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic PathfindingAdapter Initialization
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    MyAI(Creature* creature)\
      \ : CreatureAI(creature), pathfinder()\n    {\n        // PathfindingAdapter\
      \ is automatically initialized in constructor\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    PathfindingAdapter\
      \ pathfinder;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The PathfindingAdapter constructor performs minimal initialization. Actual
    pathfinding setup occurs when the first path request is made. The adapter may
    require additional configuration through setter methods before being fully functional
    for complex navigation scenarios.
