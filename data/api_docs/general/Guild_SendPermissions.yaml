documentation:
  brief: Sends guild permission information to the specified session.
  description: The SendPermissions method transmits the current guild's permission
    settings to a specific WorldSession, typically used when a player joins or reconnects
    to the game. This method ensures that the client has up-to-date information about
    what actions the player is allowed to perform within the guild context, such as
    promoting members, changing guild settings, or managing guild banks. The permissions
    are sent in a structured format that allows the client to properly display and
    enforce guild-related access controls.

    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    guild->SendPermissions(player->GetSession());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically when a player joins a guild
    or reconnects to the server. It's important to ensure that the session passed
    to this method is valid and associated with an active player who is a member of
    the guild.
