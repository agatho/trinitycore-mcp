  class: TargetSelector
  method: PassesValidation
  signature: bool TargetSelector::PassesValidation(Unit * target, TargetValidation
    validation) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether a target unit passes the validation criteria defined by
    the TargetSelector.
  description: The PassesValidation method determines if a given Unit object meets
    the specific validation conditions set by the TargetSelector instance. This method
    is typically used in AI decision-making processes to filter valid targets for
    spells, abilities, or actions. It performs checks based on predefined rules such
    as target type, faction, health status, or other criteria that may be configured
    within the selector. The method returns true if the target satisfies all validation
    requirements, and false otherwise. This functionality is essential for ensuring
    that game entities only act upon appropriate targets according to defined logic.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is being evaluated for validation.
      Must not be null.
  - name: validation
    description: TargetValidation enum value specifying the type of validation to
      perform. Defines what criteria should be checked against the target unit.
  returns: True if the target passes all validation checks defined by the TargetSelector;
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (selector->PassesValidation(target, TargetValidation::HOSTILE)) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with hostile target logic\n    CastSpellOnTarget(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Valid Healing Targets
    code: "if (selector->PassesValidation(target, TargetValidation::FRIENDLY_HEALTH_LOW))\
      \ {\n    // Select low health friendly unit for healing\n    UseHealingSpell(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in AI scripts and spell targeting systems. It's
    important to ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. The actual validation logic depends on how the TargetSelector
    was initialized and configured.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null target pointer will likely result in a
    crash or undefined behavior. Always verify that the target unit exists and is
    valid before invoking PassesValidation.
