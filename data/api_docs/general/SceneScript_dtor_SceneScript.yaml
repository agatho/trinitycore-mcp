  brief: Destroys a SceneScript instance and releases its resources
  description: The SceneScript destructor is automatically called when a SceneScript
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any allocated memory, resources, or references held by the SceneScript
    instance. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, SceneScripts
    are used to handle scripted scenes and events that occur in the game world, such
    as cinematic sequences or quest-related visual effects. The destructor performs
    necessary cleanup operations to prevent memory leaks and ensure proper resource
    management within the server's lifecycle.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of SceneScript
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    SceneScript* script = new SceneScript();\n\
      \    // ... use the script ...\n    delete script; // Destructor called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-based SceneScript destruction
    code: "void AnotherFunction()\n{\n    SceneScript script; // Constructor called\n\
      \    // ... use the script ...\n    // Destructor automatically called when\
      \ going out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The SceneScript destructor is typically implemented as a virtual function
    to ensure proper polymorphic behavior. Developers should not manually invoke this
    destructor unless explicitly managing object lifecycle through custom memory allocation.
    The destruction process handles cleanup of internal data structures and ensures
    no dangling references remain in the game world's scene management system.
  warnings: Do not call the destructor directly on stack-allocated SceneScript objects
    as it will be automatically invoked upon scope exit. Avoid manual memory management
    unless necessary, as improper handling can lead to memory leaks or undefined behavior
    in the TrinityCore server environment.
