documentation:
  brief: Initializes internal values and configuration for the solo AI strategy behavior.
  description: The InitializeValues method sets up the initial state and configuration
    parameters required for the SoloStrategy AI behavior. This method is typically
    called during the initialization phase of an AI-controlled unit to ensure all
    necessary variables, flags, and settings are properly configured before the strategy
    begins executing. It may initialize default values for decision-making parameters,
    reset internal counters, or prepare data structures needed for solo combat tactics.
    The method does not accept any parameters and performs no return operations, making
    it a pure initialization routine that prepares the object for subsequent AI processing.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'SoloStrategy strategy;

      strategy.InitializeValues();

      // Strategy is now ready for use in solo combat scenarios'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called once during object construction or
    activation. It's important to ensure that all dependencies and prerequisite data
    are available before calling this method, as it may rely on external configuration
    values or state information.
