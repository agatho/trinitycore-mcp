  method: GetScriptId
  signature: uint32 InstanceMap::GetScriptId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the script identifier associated with the instance map.
  description: The GetScriptId method retrieves the unique identifier that corresponds
    to the script assigned to this instance map. In TrinityCore, instance maps can
    be linked to specific scripts that define their behavior, such as custom event
    handling or boss encounter logic. This ID is used internally by the core to locate
    and execute the appropriate script routines when events occur within the map.
    The method does not perform any validation on the returned value and simply returns
    the stored identifier.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the script identifier assigned to this instance
    map. This ID typically corresponds to an entry in the script database or registry
    used by the core to load and manage custom scripts for instances.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InstanceMap* map = ...;

      uint32 scriptId = map->GetScriptId();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("scripts", "Instance map script ID: %u", scriptId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Script Assignment
    code: "InstanceMap* instance = player->GetInstanceMap();\nif (instance)\n{\n \
      \   uint32 id = instance->GetScriptId();\n    if (id != 0)\n    {\n        TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      scripts\", \"Map has script ID: %u\", id);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n       \
      \ TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"scripts\", \"Map has no assigned script\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The script ID returned by this method is typically set during map initialization
    or when the instance is created. It's important to note that a return value of
    zero may indicate either no script has been assigned or that the script ID is
    not yet initialized, depending on implementation details.
