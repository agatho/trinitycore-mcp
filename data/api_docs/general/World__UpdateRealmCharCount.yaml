  class: World
  method: _UpdateRealmCharCount
  signature: void World::_UpdateRealmCharCount(int resultCharCount)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the character count for the realm based on the provided result character
    count value.
  description: The _UpdateRealmCharCount method is responsible for updating the total
    number of characters registered on the realm. This internal method likely synchronizes
    the character count with the database or in-memory tracking systems to ensure
    accurate realm statistics. It is typically invoked when character creation, deletion,
    or other account-related operations occur that affect the overall character population.
    The method accepts a single integer parameter representing the updated character
    count and performs necessary updates to maintain data consistency across the server.
  parameters:
  - name: resultCharCount
    description: An integer value representing the current total number of characters
      on the realm. This value is typically calculated by counting all active characters
      in the database or tracking system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Realm Character Count After Character Creation
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterWorld(Player* player)\n{\n    // Simulate character creation\
      \ logic\n    int currentCharCount = GetRealmCharacterCount();\n    ++currentCharCount;\n\
      \    m_world->_UpdateRealmCharCount(currentCharCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Character Count During Account Cleanup
    code: "void CleanupInactiveAccounts()\n{\n    // Logic to remove inactive accounts\
      \ and their characters\n    int newCharCount = CalculateActiveCharacterCount();\n\
      \    m_world->_UpdateRealmCharCount(newCharCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is an internal implementation detail and should not be called
    directly from external modules. It's likely used in conjunction with database
    synchronization routines to maintain accurate realm statistics. The method may
    perform database writes or cache updates depending on the server configuration.
  warnings: Direct invocation of this method without proper context or validation
    may lead to inconsistent realm data. Ensure that the character count passed is
    accurate and reflects all active characters before calling this method.
