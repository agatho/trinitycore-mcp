  class: BattlegroundTemplate
  method: GetMinLevel
  signature: uint8 BattlegroundTemplate::GetMinLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the minimum required level for players to join the battleground.
  description: The GetMinLevel method returns the minimum character level required
    to participate in the battleground associated with this template. This value is
    typically defined in the battleground configuration and ensures that only players
    meeting the level requirement can queue for or join the specific battleground
    type. The returned value is a uint8 representing the level threshold, which is
    used during player validation when attempting to enter a battleground.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value indicating the minimum character level required to join the
    battleground. This value typically ranges from 1 to 80, depending on the battleground's
    design and intended player base.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve minimum level for a battleground
    code: 'BattlegroundTemplate* bgTemplate = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattlegroundTemplate(BG_TYPE_AV);

      uint8 minLevel = bgTemplate->GetMinLevel();

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_BATTLEGROUND, "Minimum level for AV: %u", minLevel);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used during battleground queue validation to ensure
    players meet the minimum level requirements before being allowed to enter a battleground.
    The value returned should be consistent with the battleground's intended difficulty
    and player accessibility.
