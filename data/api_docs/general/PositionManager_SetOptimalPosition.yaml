  class: PositionManager
  method: SetOptimalPosition
  signature: void PositionManager::SetOptimalPosition(int * target, float range)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the optimal position for a target within a specified range.
  description: The SetOptimalPosition method adjusts the positioning of a target entity
    to an optimal location within the given range. This method is typically used in
    AI behavior scripting or movement logic to ensure that entities maintain appropriate
    distances from each other or from specific points. It may be called during combat
    situations, pathfinding operations, or general NPC movement routines. The method
    modifies internal position data and does not return any value.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target identifier or index.
      This parameter specifies which entity or object should have its optimal position
      set.
  - name: range
    description: Float value defining the maximum distance within which the optimal
      position will be calculated. This determines how far from the current location
      the new position can be placed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PositionManager posMgr;

      int targetId = 42;

      float distance = 10.0f;

      posMgr.SetOptimalPosition(&targetId, distance);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Target
    code: 'PositionManager posMgr;

      int* dynamicTarget = new int(100);

      float range = 25.5f;

      posMgr.SetOptimalPosition(dynamicTarget, range);

      delete dynamicTarget;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger positioning system and may interact
    with other methods like GetPosition or UpdatePosition. It's recommended to ensure
    that the target identifier is valid before calling this function to avoid undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'target' will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the range value is positive and within acceptable bounds to prevent
    unexpected positioning logic.
