  class: LFGMgr
  method: GetTeam
  signature: uint8 LFGMgr::GetTeam(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the team identifier associated with a given player GUID in the
    LFG system.
  description: The GetTeam method retrieves the team ID (as a uint8) that a specific
    player is currently assigned to within the Looking for Group (LFG) system. This
    method is typically used to determine which group or queue a player belongs to,
    particularly in the context of dungeon finding, battlegrounds, or other group-based
    activities. The GUID parameter corresponds to the unique identifier of the player
    whose team assignment is being queried. It's important to note that this method
    may return 0 if the player is not currently part of any team or queue, or if the
    player GUID is invalid. This functionality supports the core LFG matchmaking and
    grouping mechanics in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose team assignment
      is to be retrieved. Must be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the team ID that the specified player
    belongs to. A return value of 0 typically indicates that the player is not assigned
    to any team or queue, or that the provided GUID was invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve a Player's Team
    code: "uint8 teamId = sLFGMgr->GetTeam(playerGuid);\nif (teamId != 0)\n{\n   \
      \ // Player is in a team\n    printf(\"Player belongs to team %u\", teamId);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Player is not in any team\n    printf(\"Player is not in\
      \ any team\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG system and should be used carefully within
    the context of group management or matchmaking logic. Ensure that the GUID passed
    is valid and corresponds to an active player in the game world. The return value
    of 0 may indicate either no team assignment or an invalid GUID, so additional
    validation might be necessary depending on use case.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method outside of proper LFG state checks.
    If a player's GUID is invalid or they are not registered in the LFG system, the
    returned value will be 0, which may lead to incorrect behavior if not handled
    properly.
