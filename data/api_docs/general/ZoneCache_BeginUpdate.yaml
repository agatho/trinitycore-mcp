documentation:
  brief: Begins an update operation on the zone cache, preparing it for modifications.
  description: The BeginUpdate method initializes an update session for the ZoneCache
    class. This method typically prepares internal structures or locks resources necessary
    for performing cache updates. It is commonly used in conjunction with other cache
    manipulation methods to ensure data consistency and prevent race conditions during
    concurrent access. The method does not perform any actual cache modifications
    itself but rather sets up the environment for subsequent update operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ZoneCache* cache = GetZoneCache();

      cache->BeginUpdate();

      // Perform cache updates here

      // ...'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before performing any cache modifications to
    ensure thread safety and data integrity. It may acquire internal locks or prepare
    internal buffers for the update process.
  warnings: Failure to call BeginUpdate before modifying zone cache data can result
    in undefined behavior or data corruption. Always pair this method with EndUpdate
    to properly finalize the operation.
