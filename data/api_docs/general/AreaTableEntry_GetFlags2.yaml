  signature: int AreaTableEntry::GetFlags2() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the second set of flags for the area table entry, used for additional
    area-specific properties and behaviors in World of Warcraft.
  description: The GetFlags2 method retrieves the second set of flag values associated
    with an AreaTableEntry. These flags are typically used to define additional properties
    or behaviors of areas within the game world, such as specific environmental effects,
    zone types, or gameplay mechanics that are not covered by the primary flags. The
    returned integer value is a bitmask that can be checked against specific flag
    constants to determine the presence of certain area characteristics. This method
    is commonly used in TrinityCore's area management and zone-based logic systems
    to control various aspects of player interaction within different zones.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the second set of flags for the area table entry.
    Each bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific flag that defines certain
    properties or behaviors of the area, such as whether it's an arena, battleground,
    or has special environmental effects.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if an area is flagged as a battleground
    code: "AreaTableEntry const* area = sAreaStore.LookupEntry(1234);\nif (area &&\
      \ (area->GetFlags2() & 0x100))\n{\n    // Area is flagged as a battleground\n\
      \    // Handle battleground-specific logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using flags to determine area behavior in player movement
    code: "AreaTableEntry const* area = sAreaStore.LookupEntry(player->GetMap()->GetAreaId(player->GetPositionX(),\
      \ player->GetPositionY()));\nif (area)\n{\n    int flags2 = area->GetFlags2();\n\
      \    if (flags2 & 0x400)\n    {\n        // Area has special flight restrictions\n\
      \        player->SetCanFly(false);\n    }\n    else if (flags2 & 0x800)\n  \
      \  {\n        // Area has underwater effects\n        player->SetUnderwaterEffects(true);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flags returned by GetFlags2 are defined in the AreaTableEntry structure
    and are typically loaded from the game's database or DBC files. Developers should
    be aware that flag values may vary between different versions of TrinityCore and
    that these flags are often used in conjunction with other area-related methods
    for comprehensive zone behavior management.
  warnings: Be cautious when using bitwise operations on the returned flags without
    proper validation, as incorrect flag checking can lead to unexpected behavior.
    Also note that flag constants might change between TrinityCore versions, so ensure
    compatibility when upgrading.
