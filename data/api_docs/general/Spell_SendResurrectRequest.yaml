  method: SendResurrectRequest
  signature: void Spell::SendResurrectRequest(Player * target)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a resurrection request to a target player.
  description: This method sends a resurrection request to the specified player target,
    allowing the caster to initiate a resurrection process. The method is typically
    used in scenarios where a player needs to be resurrected, such as when a player
    dies and requires assistance from another player or NPC. It handles the communication
    of the resurrection request through the game's network protocol, ensuring that
    the target receives the proper notification about the resurrection offer.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Player object that will receive the resurrection
      request. This player must be in a state where they can accept resurrection requests,
      typically when they are dead or in a state where they can be resurrected.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resurrection Request Example
    code: 'Player* target = new Player();

      Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->SendResurrectRequest(target);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely triggers a network packet to be sent to the target player's
    client, informing them of the resurrection request. It may involve checking if
    the target is in a valid state for resurrection (e.g., dead or in a state where
    they can be resurrected). The implementation might also involve handling cooldowns
    or other game mechanics related to resurrection.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the target player is in a state
    where they can accept resurrection requests. Attempting to send a request to a
    player who is not dead or cannot be resurrected may cause unexpected behavior
    or errors.
