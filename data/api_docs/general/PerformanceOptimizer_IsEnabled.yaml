  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: IsEnabled
  signature: bool PerformanceOptimizer::IsEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the performance optimizer is currently enabled.
  description: The IsEnabled method returns a boolean value indicating if the PerformanceOptimizer
    system is active and processing optimizations. This function provides read-only
    access to the internal enable state of the optimizer, which may be toggled by
    game configuration settings, admin commands, or runtime conditions. The result
    of this check can be used to conditionally execute performance-sensitive code
    paths or to determine whether optimization-related features are currently available
    for use.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the PerformanceOptimizer is enabled and actively running; false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (PerformanceOptimizer::IsEnabled()) {\n    // Execute performance-optimized\
      \ code path\n    DoOptimizedUpdate();\n} else {\n    // Fallback to standard\
      \ update logic\n    DoStandardUpdate();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple state check and is thread-safe. It does not
    modify any internal state or trigger side effects.
