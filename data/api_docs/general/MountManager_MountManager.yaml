documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new MountManager instance with default settings and internal
    state.
  description: The MountManager constructor initializes a new instance of the MountManager
    class, setting up internal data structures and default configurations required
    for managing player mounts within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically
    called when creating a new mount manager object to handle mount-related operations
    such as adding, removing, or checking mount availability for players. The initialization
    process includes preparing necessary containers for storing mount data and ensuring
    all internal references are properly configured before any mount operations can
    be performed.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a new MountManager instance
    code: 'MountManager* manager = new MountManager();

      // The manager is now ready to handle mount operations

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when creating a new MountManager object.
    It performs essential setup that must occur before any mount-related functionality
    can be used. The class likely manages a collection of mounts and their associated
    data, so proper initialization is crucial for correct operation.
