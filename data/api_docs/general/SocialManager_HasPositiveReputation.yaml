  class: SocialManager
  method: HasPositiveReputation
  signature: bool SocialManager::HasPositiveReputation(int playerGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has positive reputation with the social manager's associated
    faction.
  description: The HasPositiveReputation method determines whether a specified player
    has achieved a positive reputation level (greater than 0) with the faction associated
    to this SocialManager instance. This functionality is commonly used in World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore to control access to gossip options, quest interactions,
    or other reputation-based gameplay mechanics. The method performs a lookup using
    the provided player GUID and evaluates their current standing within the faction's
    reputation system. It returns true if the player's reputation is positive, and
    false otherwise. This check is essential for implementing faction-specific dialogue
    trees and ensuring that players can only interact with NPCs or quests that align
    with their current reputation status.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose reputation status
      is being checked. This should be a valid player GUID obtained from the game's
      entity management system.
  returns: Returns true if the specified player has positive reputation with the associated
    faction, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate either neutral
    or negative reputation status.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reputation Check
    code: "if (socialManager.HasPositiveReputation(playerGuid)) {\n    // Player can\
      \ access friendly NPC dialogue\n    SendGossipMenuFor(player, 12345);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Player cannot interact with this NPC\n    SendGossipMenuFor(player,\
      \ 12346);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Reputation-Based Quest Access
    code: "if (socialManager.HasPositiveReputation(playerGuid)) {\n    // Grant access\
      \ to quest that requires positive reputation\n    player->AddQuest(questId);\n\
      } else {\n    // Inform player they lack sufficient reputation\n    SendSystemMessage(player,\
      \ \"You must gain more reputation with this faction before you can accept this\
      \ quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal reputation tracking system of TrinityCore.
    The accuracy of the result depends on proper initialization and updating of player
    reputation data. Performance-wise, it's a lightweight lookup operation that typically
    uses cached or indexed data structures for fast retrieval.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an actual player entity in the game world. Passing invalid or uninitialized
    GUIDs may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also note that reputation status
    can change dynamically during gameplay, so cached results should not be used without
    re-evaluation.
