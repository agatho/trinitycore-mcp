  class: MLPerformanceTracker
  method: ShouldReduceMLComplexity
  signature: bool MLPerformanceTracker::ShouldReduceMLComplexity() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether machine learning complexity should be reduced based on
    performance metrics.
  description: The ShouldReduceMLComplexity method evaluates current system performance
    metrics to decide if the complexity of machine learning models should be reduced.
    This is typically used in dynamic difficulty adjustment or performance optimization
    scenarios within the game engine. The method checks various performance indicators
    such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and frame rate stability to make this determination.
    It's designed to help maintain optimal gameplay experience by automatically scaling
    down computational intensity when system resources are constrained.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if performance metrics indicate that machine learning complexity
    should be reduced to prevent system overload or maintain acceptable gameplay performance;
    returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Performance Check
    code: "MLPerformanceTracker tracker;\nif (tracker.ShouldReduceMLComplexity())\
      \ {\n    // Reduce ML model complexity\n    ApplySimplifiedAI();\n} else {\n\
      \    // Maintain full ML complexity\n    ApplyFullAI();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void GameUpdate() {\n    static MLPerformanceTracker tracker;\n    \n \
      \   if (tracker.ShouldReduceMLComplexity()) {\n        // Reduce AI complexity\
      \ for this frame\n        SetAIDifficulty(AIDifficulty::Reduced);\n    } else\
      \ {\n        // Restore normal AI complexity\n        SetAIDifficulty(AIDifficulty::Normal);\n\
      \    }\n    \n    // Continue with game update logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called periodically during the game loop to make real-time
    decisions about computational resource allocation. The decision-making process
    may involve thresholds for CPU utilization, memory pressure, or frame time measurements.
    The implementation should be lightweight to avoid impacting performance further.
  warnings: The method's behavior might change based on system load conditions, so
    relying on its return value for critical game logic could lead to inconsistent
    behavior. Ensure that reducing ML complexity doesn't negatively impact core gameplay
    mechanics or player experience.
