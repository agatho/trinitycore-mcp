  class: AchievementMgr
  method: AfterCriteriaTreeUpdate
  signature: void AchievementMgr::AfterCriteriaTreeUpdate(const CriteriaTree * tree,
    Player * referencePlayer)
documentation:
  brief: Notifies the achievement manager that a criteria tree has been updated for
    a reference player.
  description: The AfterCriteriaTreeUpdate method is invoked after a criteria tree
    has been modified or refreshed for a specific player. This method ensures that
    any dependent achievements or related systems are properly notified and updated
    to reflect the changes in the criteria tree. It typically handles internal bookkeeping
    and synchronization tasks required when criteria trees are altered, such as recalculating
    achievement progress or triggering relevant events. The method is part of the
    internal workflow within TrinityCore's achievement system and is not usually called
    directly by external code.
  parameters:
  - name: tree
    description: Pointer to the CriteriaTree object that has been updated. This represents
      the criteria tree structure containing various criteria nodes related to achievements.
  - name: referencePlayer
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which the criteria tree update is
      being processed. This player's achievement progress and related data will be
      affected by the changes in the criteria tree.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within internal TrinityCore logic
    code: '/* This method is typically called internally by the core system */

      AchievementMgr::instance()->AfterCriteriaTreeUpdate(criteriaTree, player);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal achievement management system and is
    not intended for direct public use. It is likely invoked automatically by the
    core engine when criteria trees are modified or reloaded.
