  class: BotAI
  method: LogAIDecision
  signature: void BotAI::LogAIDecision(const std::string & action, float score) const
documentation:
  brief: Logs an AI decision made by a bot with the action taken and its calculated
    score.
  description: The LogAIDecision method records information about a decision made
    by a bot's AI system. It takes the name of the action performed and the score
    associated with that decision, then logs this data for debugging, analysis, or
    performance monitoring purposes. This method is typically used internally by the
    BotAI class to track decision-making behavior and evaluate AI performance over
    time. The logging mechanism helps developers understand how bots make choices
    and identify areas where AI behavior can be improved or adjusted.
  parameters:
  - name: action
    description: The name or identifier of the action that was decided upon by the
      bot's AI system. This should be a descriptive string representing the specific
      decision made.
  - name: score
    description: A floating-point value representing the calculated score or confidence
      level assigned to the AI decision. Higher scores typically indicate more favorable
      or confident decisions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void MyBot::UpdateAI()\n{\n    // ... some logic ...\n    if (shouldAttack)\n\
      \    {\n        LogAIDecision(\"AttackTarget\", 0.85f);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Scoring
    code: "void BotAI::EvaluateCombatStrategy()\n{\n    float combatScore = CalculateCombatEffectiveness();\n\
      \    if (combatScore > 0.7f)\n    {\n        LogAIDecision(\"UseSpell\", combatScore);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        LogAIDecision(\"Flee\", 1.0f - combatScore);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for debugging and performance analysis of bot
    AI behavior. The logged data can be accessed through TrinityCore's logging system
    or specialized tools for analyzing bot decision patterns. It's important to note
    that this method may have minimal performance impact as it only logs information
    without affecting the actual AI execution flow.
  warnings: The logging output should not contain sensitive information about player
    data or game state. Ensure that any action names used are sanitized and do not
    expose internal game mechanics or player privacy details. This method is const,
    so it cannot modify any member variables of the BotAI class.
