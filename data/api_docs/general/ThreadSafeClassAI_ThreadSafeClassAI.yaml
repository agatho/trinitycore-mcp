documentation:
  brief: Copies the state of another ThreadSafeClassAI instance to this instance
  description: The ThreadSafeClassAI constructor is used to create a new instance
    of the class by copying the state from an existing ThreadSafeClassAI object. This
    copy constructor ensures that all member variables and internal state are properly
    duplicated, maintaining thread safety guarantees during the copying process. The
    method is typically invoked when creating a new AI instance based on an existing
    one, such as when spawning multiple AI entities with similar behaviors or when
    cloning AI configurations for different game objects.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source ThreadSafeClassAI object whose state will be copied to
      this instance
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Copy Construction
    code: 'ThreadSafeClassAI originalAI;

      // ... initialize originalAI ...

      ThreadSafeClassAI newAI(originalAI); // Creates a copy of originalAI'
    language: cpp
  - title: Cloning AI for Multiple Entities
    code: "ThreadSafeClassAI baseAI;\n// ... configure baseAI with desired behavior\
      \ ...\nstd::vector<ThreadSafeClassAI*> aiInstances;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 5;\
      \ ++i)\n{\n    aiInstances.push_back(new ThreadSafeClassAI(baseAI));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is designed to maintain thread safety by ensuring atomic
    copying of internal state variables. It should be used carefully in multi-threaded
    environments where AI instances may be accessed concurrently.
  warnings: Ensure that the source object being copied is in a valid state before
    calling this constructor, as invalid states may propagate to the new instance.
    Avoid copying AI objects that are actively being modified by other threads.
