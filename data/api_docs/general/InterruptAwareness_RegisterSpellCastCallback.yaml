  class: InterruptAwareness
  method: RegisterSpellCastCallback
  signature: void InterruptAwareness::RegisterSpellCastCallback(int callback)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a callback function to be invoked when a spell cast is interrupted.
  description: The RegisterSpellCastCallback method allows developers to register
    a callback function that will be executed whenever a spell cast is interrupted
    by external factors such as movement, damage, or other game events. This functionality
    is crucial for implementing custom interrupt handling logic within TrinityCore's
    spell system. The method takes an integer parameter representing the callback
    identifier which should correspond to a pre-registered callback function in the
    system. Once registered, the callback will be triggered during spell interruption
    events, enabling modders and developers to extend or modify default spell interruption
    behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: callback
    description: An integer identifier representing the callback function to register
      for spell cast interruption events. This value should correspond to a valid
      callback index previously registered with the system's callback manager.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Callback Registration
    code: InterruptAwareness::RegisterSpellCastCallback(42);
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Spell Handler
    code: "class MySpellHandler\n{\npublic:\n    void OnSpellInterrupt()\n    {\n\
      \        // Custom logic when spell is interrupted\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Spell was interrupted!\");\n    }\n};\n\n// Register the callback\nInterruptAwareness::RegisterSpellCastCallback(1001);"
    language: cpp
  notes: The callback identifier must be unique and previously registered with the
    system's callback manager. This method should typically be called during initialization
    or module loading phases. The actual callback execution will occur asynchronously
    when spell interruption events happen in the game world.
  warnings: Improper use of callback identifiers may lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes. Ensure that all registered callbacks are properly implemented and do
    not cause infinite recursion or performance bottlenecks. This method does not
    validate the callback existence at registration time, so runtime errors may occur
    if the callback is not properly set up.
