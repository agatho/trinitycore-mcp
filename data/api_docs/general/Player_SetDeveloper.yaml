  method: SetDeveloper
  signature: void Player::SetDeveloper(bool on)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the developer mode status for the player, enabling or disabling developer
    features.
  description: The SetDeveloper method toggles the developer mode status of a player
    character, allowing or disallowing access to special developer tools and features
    within the game. When enabled, this mode typically grants additional debugging
    capabilities, cheat commands, and access to restricted game content. The method
    affects the player's internal state and can be used to control whether a player
    has access to developer-specific functionality. This is commonly used for testing
    and debugging purposes during development or when enabling/disabling developer
    features for specific players.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Developer Mode
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetDeveloper(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Developer Mode
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetDeveloper(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal flags or state variables within the
    Player class, affecting how the game handles developer commands and features.
    It may be used in conjunction with other developer-related methods such as SetCheatMode
    or similar functionality. Performance impact is minimal as it only changes internal
    state flags.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unintended access to restricted
    game content or debugging tools. Developers should ensure proper testing and validation
    when enabling developer mode for players, especially in production environments.
