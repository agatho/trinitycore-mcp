  signature: void DemonHunterAI::GenerateFury(int amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates fury for the Demon Hunter character
  description: The GenerateFury method increases the Demon Hunter's fury resource
    by the specified amount. This method is typically used during combat to replenish
    fury from various abilities, talents, or passive effects. Fury is a key resource
    in the Demon Hunter's gameplay mechanics, enabling the use of powerful spells
    and abilities. The method directly modifies the AI's internal fury tracking system
    without requiring external resource management.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of fury to generate. Must be a non-negative integer value
      representing the fury points to add to the Demon Hunter's current resource pool.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Fury Generation
    code: 'DemonHunterAI* ai = ...;

      ai->GenerateFury(10); // Adds 10 fury points to the Demon Hunter'
    language: cpp
  - title: Fury Generation from Ability
    code: 'DemonHunterAI* ai = ...;

      // Called when using a fury-generating ability like Eye Beam

      ai->GenerateFury(5); // Generates 5 fury points from the ability'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the Demon Hunter's fury resource. It should
    only be called when appropriate within combat mechanics, as calling it outside
    of combat may have unintended consequences. The method does not validate if the
    resulting fury exceeds maximum limits, so callers should ensure proper bounds
    checking if needed.
  warnings: Calling this method with negative values may cause undefined behavior
    or resource depletion. Always ensure that fury generation is properly synchronized
    with game logic and combat state to avoid exploits or inconsistent gameplay states.
