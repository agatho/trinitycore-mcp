documentation:
  brief: Applies damage based on percentage of target's maximum health.
  description: This method calculates and applies damage to a target based on a specified
    percentage of their maximum health. It is commonly used in spell effects where
    damage is determined by a percentage of the target's total health pool rather
    than fixed values. The method typically executes during spell effect application,
    determining how much damage is dealt based on the configured percentage value.
    This functionality is essential for spells that utilize health-based damage mechanics,
    such as those that deal damage proportional to the target's maximum health.

    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->EffectDamageFromMaxHealthPCT();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves calculations related to target's health pool
    and may require proper handling of target's maximum health values. Performance
    considerations include potential for multiple calls during spell processing, especially
    in cases where multiple targets are involved.
  warnings: Care must be taken when implementing this method as it can lead to unexpected
    damage values if the percentage is not properly configured. The method should
    only be called when target exists and has valid maximum health values.
