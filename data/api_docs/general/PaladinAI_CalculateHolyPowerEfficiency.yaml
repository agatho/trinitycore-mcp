  class: PaladinAI
  method: CalculateHolyPowerEfficiency
  signature: float PaladinAI::CalculateHolyPowerEfficiency()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the efficiency rating of holy power usage for a paladin
    AI.
  description: The CalculateHolyPowerEfficiency method determines how effectively
    a paladin AI is utilizing its holy power resources. This calculation takes into
    account various factors such as spell priorities, cooldown management, and resource
    conservation to provide a normalized efficiency score between 0.0 and 1.0. The
    method is typically used by the AI system to make decisions about when to spend
    holy power on abilities versus saving them for more optimal moments. It considers
    the current state of the paladin's holy power, available spells, target conditions,
    and overall combat situation to compute this value.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the efficiency of holy power usage, where 0.0
    indicates completely inefficient usage and 1.0 represents optimal usage. Values
    between 0.0 and 1.0 indicate varying degrees of efficiency in holy power allocation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float efficiency = paladinAI->CalculateHolyPowerEfficiency();\nif (efficiency\
      \ > 0.8f)\n{\n    // Consider spending holy power on high-priority abilities\n\
      \    paladinAI->CastSpellOnTarget(SPELL_HOLY_WRATH);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Efficiency-Based Decision Making
    code: "float efficiency = paladinAI->CalculateHolyPowerEfficiency();\nif (efficiency\
      \ < 0.5f)\n{\n    // Low efficiency - consider saving holy power\n    paladinAI->SetActionState(ACTION_STATE_SAVE_HOLY_POWER);\n\
      }\nelse if (efficiency > 0.7f)\n{\n    // High efficiency - spend holy power\
      \ on damage abilities\n    paladinAI->CastSpellOnTarget(SPELL_CONSECRATION);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Paladin AI decision-making system and should only
    be called during active combat situations. The efficiency calculation may vary
    based on the current paladin's level, talent specialization, and equipped items.
    The method does not modify any internal state but rather provides a read-only
    efficiency assessment.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat scenarios as it may return unpredictable
    values due to missing target or spell availability data. The returned value should
    not be used directly for spell casting decisions without additional validation
    of spell readiness and target conditions.
