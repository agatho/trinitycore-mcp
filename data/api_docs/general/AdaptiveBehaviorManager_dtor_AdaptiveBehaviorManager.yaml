documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AdaptiveBehaviorManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the AdaptiveBehaviorManager class is responsible
    for releasing all dynamically allocated memory and cleaning up any internal data
    structures that were initialized during the object's lifetime. This method ensures
    proper resource deallocation when the AdaptiveBehaviorManager instance goes out
    of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system,
    this destructor likely handles cleanup of behavior trees, state machines, or other
    adaptive AI components that may have been configured for NPC or creature behavior.
    The destruction process typically involves calling destructors for member objects
    and freeing any heap-allocated memory to prevent memory leaks.

  - title: Basic Destruction of AdaptiveBehaviorManager
    code: 'AdaptiveBehaviorManager* manager = new AdaptiveBehaviorManager();

      // ... use the manager ...

      delete manager; // Triggers ~AdaptiveBehaviorManager()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically invoked when an AdaptiveBehaviorManager
    object is destroyed. Developers should not manually call this destructor unless
    implementing custom memory management patterns. The destruction order follows
    standard C++ RAII principles, ensuring all member objects are properly destroyed
    before the parent class destructor completes.
