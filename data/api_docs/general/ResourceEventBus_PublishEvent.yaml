  class: ResourceEventBus
  method: PublishEvent
  signature: bool ResourceEventBus::PublishEvent(const ResourceEvent & event)
documentation:
  brief: Publishes a resource event to all registered subscribers in the event bus.
  description: The PublishEvent method dispatches a ResourceEvent to all currently
    subscribed listeners within the ResourceEventBus. This method is used to notify
    interested components about resource-related changes or updates, such as item
    acquisition, currency modification, or quest progress. The event is delivered
    synchronously to all registered handlers, and the method returns true if at least
    one subscriber successfully processed the event. If no subscribers are registered,
    the method still returns true but the event will not be handled by any component.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The ResourceEvent object containing the event data to be published
      to all subscribers. This parameter must be a valid ResourceEvent instance with
      properly initialized fields.
  returns: True if the event was successfully published to at least one subscriber,
    false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that no subscribers
    were registered for this event type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Publishing
    code: "ResourceEvent event;\nevent.Type = ResourceEventType::ITEM_ACQUIRED;\n\
      event.Data.ItemId = 12345;\nbool success = eventBus.PublishEvent(event);\nif\
      \ (success)\n{\n    // Event was published to at least one subscriber\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Publishing Currency Change Event
    code: "ResourceEvent currencyEvent;\ncurrencyEvent.Type = ResourceEventType::CURRENCY_CHANGED;\n\
      currencyEvent.Data.CurrencyId = 123;\ncurrencyEvent.Data.Amount = 500;\nbool\
      \ result = eventBus.PublishEvent(currencyEvent);\n// Handles the case where\
      \ no subscribers are registered\nif (!result)\n{\n    // Log that no handlers\
      \ were available for this currency update\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is synchronous and will block until all registered event handlers
    have completed processing the event. It's recommended to keep event handler implementations
    lightweight to avoid performance degradation. The ResourceEventBus maintains a
    list of weak references to subscribers, so unsubscribed components are automatically
    removed from the notification list.
  warnings: Do not modify the event data after publishing it, as the event may be
    processed by multiple handlers concurrently. Avoid publishing events with invalid
    or uninitialized data which could cause undefined behavior in subscribers. Be
    cautious when using this method in performance-critical code paths due to its
    synchronous nature.
