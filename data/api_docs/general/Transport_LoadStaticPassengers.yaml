  method: LoadStaticPassengers
  signature: void Transport::LoadStaticPassengers()
documentation:
  brief: Loads static passengers for the transport, initializing their positions and
    states within the transport system.
  description: The LoadStaticPassengers method is responsible for loading and initializing
    all static passengers associated with a transport object. This includes setting
    up their initial positions relative to the transport's coordinate system, configuring
    their movement states, and ensuring they are properly integrated into the transport's
    passenger management system. The method typically executes during the transport's
    initialization phase or when the transport is loaded from the database. It handles
    the setup of passengers who are meant to remain in fixed positions on the transport
    rather than being dynamically added or removed during runtime.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Transport Initialization
    code: 'Transport* transport = new Transport();

      transport->LoadStaticPassengers();

      // Passengers are now initialized and positioned on the transport'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the transport's construction or loading
    phase. It assumes that the transport's base data (like waypoints, movement info,
    etc.) has already been loaded. The method does not handle dynamic passenger additions
    after initial load.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times on the same transport instance may
    result in duplicate passenger entries or inconsistent states. Ensure this method
    is only called once during transport initialization to avoid undefined behavior.
