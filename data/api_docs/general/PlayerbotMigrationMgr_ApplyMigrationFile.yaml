  method: ApplyMigrationFile
  signature: bool PlayerbotMigrationMgr::ApplyMigrationFile(const MigrationFile &
    migration)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a migration file to update player bot configurations and settings.
  description: The ApplyMigrationFile method processes a provided MigrationFile object
    to update or modify player bot behavior, settings, or data structures within the
    TrinityCore instance. This method is typically used during system upgrades, configuration
    changes, or when applying patches that alter how player bots interact with the
    game world. It ensures that all relevant player bot data is synchronized with
    the new migration specifications. The method performs validation on the input
    file and returns a success status indicating whether the migration was applied
    correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: migration
    description: A constant reference to a MigrationFile object containing the migration
      data to be applied. This includes configuration changes, behavior updates, or
      structural modifications for player bots.
  returns: Returns true if the migration file was successfully applied and all operations
    completed without errors; otherwise returns false if the migration failed due
    to invalid data, processing issues, or other internal failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of ApplyMigrationFile
    code: "MigrationFile file;\n// Assume file is populated with valid migration data\n\
      bool success = sPlayerbotMigrationMgr->ApplyMigrationFile(file);\nif (success)\
      \ {\n    // Migration applied successfully\n    LOG_INFO(\"playerbots\", \"\
      Player bot migration applied successfully.\");\n} else {\n    // Handle failure\
      \ case\n    LOG_ERROR(\"playerbots\", \"Failed to apply player bot migration.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve file I/O operations and should be called carefully
    in performance-sensitive contexts. It is recommended to validate the MigrationFile
    before calling this method to avoid unnecessary processing or errors.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or malformed MigrationFile can lead
    to unexpected behavior or data corruption. Ensure that all migration files are
    properly validated and tested before application.
