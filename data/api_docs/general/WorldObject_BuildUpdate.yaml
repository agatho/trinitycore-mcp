  class: WorldObject
  method: BuildUpdate
  signature: void WorldObject::BuildUpdate(UpdateDataMapType & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Populates an update data map with the object's current state for client synchronization.
  description: The BuildUpdate method is responsible for constructing and populating
    an UpdateDataMapType structure with the current state information of a WorldObject.
    This method is typically invoked during the game loop to prepare updates that
    will be sent to clients, ensuring that player and world objects are synchronized
    with their respective clients. The method iterates through the object's fields
    and constructs update blocks that represent the current state of the object in
    the game world. It plays a crucial role in maintaining network synchronization
    between the server and connected clients.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Reference to an UpdateDataMapType where the object's update data
      will be stored. This map contains the serialized state information that will
      be sent to clients for synchronization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in update processing
    code: 'UpdateDataMapType updateData;

      worldObject->BuildUpdate(updateData);

      // Process updateData for network transmission'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with player update system
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      WorldObject* object = ...;

      UpdateDataMapType updateData;

      object->BuildUpdate(updateData);

      player->BuildUpdate(updateData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine's update system.
    Developers should not normally call this method directly unless implementing custom
    update logic or debugging network synchronization issues. The method may perform
    different operations depending on the object type (player, creature, gameobject,
    etc.) and its current state.
  warnings: Calling BuildUpdate directly without proper context can lead to incorrect
    update data being generated. This method should only be invoked when the object
    is in a valid state for network synchronization. Improper use may cause client
    desynchronization or network errors.
