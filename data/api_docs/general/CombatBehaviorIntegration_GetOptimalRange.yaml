  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: GetOptimalRange
  signature: float CombatBehaviorIntegration::GetOptimalRange(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal combat range for the unit's current weapon
    and target.
  description: The GetOptimalRange method determines the ideal distance at which a
    unit should engage in combat with a given target based on the unit's equipped
    weapon type, attack range capabilities, and target characteristics. This calculation
    considers factors such as weapon reach, spell range limitations, and AI behavior
    settings to ensure optimal engagement distance for effective combat performance.
    The returned value represents the distance in yards that the unit should maintain
    from its target during combat operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the optimal combat range in yards. This value
    indicates the recommended distance between the unit and its target for maximum
    effectiveness during combat engagements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float optimalRange = combatBehavior->GetOptimalRange(targetUnit);\nif (optimalRange\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Use the calculated range for positioning logic\n    printf(\"\
      Optimal combat range: %.2f yards\\n\", optimalRange);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Positioning with Range Check
    code: "Unit* target = GetVictim();\nif (target)\n{\n    float range = combatBehavior->GetOptimalRange(target);\n\
      \    float currentDistance = GetDistance(target);\n    \n    if (currentDistance\
      \ < range * 0.8f)\n    {\n        // Move back to optimal range\n        MoveBackward();\n\
      \    }\n    else if (currentDistance > range * 1.2f)\n    {\n        // Move\
      \ forward to optimal range\n        MoveForward();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally accounts for various combat mechanics including weapon
    reach, spell range limitations, and AI behavior parameters. The calculation may
    vary based on the unit's current state (mounted, stealthed, etc.) and equipped
    abilities. For accurate results, ensure that the target unit is valid and accessible
    before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null or invalid target unit may result in undefined
    behavior or incorrect range calculations. Always validate the target parameter
    before invoking this method in performance-critical code paths.
