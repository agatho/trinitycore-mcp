  method: InitializeActions
  signature: void GroupCombatStrategy::InitializeActions()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes combat actions for group-based AI strategies in TrinityCore.
  description: The InitializeActions method sets up and configures all necessary combat
    behaviors and action priorities for a group-based AI strategy. This method is
    typically called during the initialization phase of a group combat behavior system,
    where it prepares the strategy to handle various combat scenarios such as targeting,
    spell casting, movement, and coordination with other group members. It establishes
    the foundation for how the group will behave in combat situations by defining
    action sequences and conditions that govern AI decision-making. The method ensures
    that all required actions are registered and properly configured before the group
    enters combat mode.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'GroupCombatStrategy strategy;

      strategy.InitializeActions();

      // Strategy is now ready to handle group combat scenarios'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization of a GroupCombatStrategy
    instance. It typically registers actions with an internal action manager and sets
    up priority queues for different combat behaviors. The method does not perform
    any actual combat logic but prepares the framework for subsequent combat operations.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in duplicate action registrations
    or unexpected behavior. Ensure that all required dependencies are initialized
    before calling this method, as it may rely on other systems being properly set
    up.
