documentation:
  brief: Determines whether Player has PvP rules enabled
  description: This method checks if the player currently has PvP rules enabled, which
    controls whether the player can engage in PvP combat and interact with other players
    in PvP zones. The method returns true when PvP rules are active and false when
    they are disabled. This functionality is crucial for managing player behavior
    in PvP zones and determining eligibility for PvP-related actions such as killing
    other players or being killed by other players.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has PvP rules enabled, false otherwise. The
    value indicates whether the player can engage in PvP combat and interact with
    other players in PvP zones.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->HasPvpRulesEnabled())\n{\n    // Player can engage in PvP combat\n\
      \    // Perform PvP-related actions\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player cannot engage\
      \ in PvP combat\n    // Player is in safe zone\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used to determine if a player is eligible for PvP
    combat or if they are in a safe zone. The implementation checks the player's current
    PvP status rather than just checking if they have PvP enabled at all times.
  warnings: This method does not account for other factors that might affect PvP eligibility
    such as being in a sanctuary zone, or having a PvP flag active. It only checks
    the basic PvP rules status.
