  class: BotLifecycle
  method: Stop
  signature: void BotLifecycle::Stop(bool immediate)
documentation:
  brief: Stops the bot lifecycle process, optionally immediately or gracefully.
  description: The Stop method terminates the bot's active lifecycle process. When
    called with immediate=true, it forcefully halts all ongoing operations and cleans
    up resources without waiting for current tasks to complete. When immediate=false,
    it attempts a graceful shutdown by allowing pending operations to finish before
    stopping. This method is typically used when a bot needs to be deactivated or
    removed from the game world. The behavior of this method may depend on the specific
    implementation within the TrinityCore framework and how the bot lifecycle manager
    handles shutdown sequences.
  parameters:
  - name: immediate
    description: If true, forces an immediate stop without waiting for current operations
      to complete. If false, performs a graceful shutdown allowing pending tasks to
      finish before stopping.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Immediate Stop
    code: 'BotLifecycle* lifecycle = GetBotLifecycle();

      lifecycle->Stop(true); // Forcefully stops the bot immediately'
    language: cpp
  - title: Graceful Stop
    code: 'BotLifecycle* lifecycle = GetBotLifecycle();

      lifecycle->Stop(false); // Stops the bot gracefully, allowing current tasks
      to complete'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on active bot lifecycle instances. Calling
    Stop on a stopped or already destroyed instance may lead to undefined behavior.
    The immediate parameter affects resource cleanup timing and should be used carefully
    in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Using immediate=true can cause data inconsistency if the bot is mid-operation.
    Ensure that no critical state changes are in progress before calling with immediate=true.
    Avoid calling Stop from within bot operation callbacks as it may lead to deadlocks
    or crashes.
