  class: Creature
  method: InheritStringIds
  signature: void Creature::InheritStringIds(const Creature * parent)
documentation:
  brief: InheritStringIds copies the string identifiers from a parent creature to
    the current creature instance.
  description: The InheritStringIds method is used to transfer string-based identifiers
    such as AI and Script names from a parent creature object to the current creature
    instance. This functionality is essential for maintaining proper creature identification
    within the TrinityCore framework, particularly when dealing with creature templates
    or instances where a child creature needs to inherit properties from its parent.
    The method ensures that all relevant string identifiers are properly propagated,
    allowing for consistent behavior across different creature types and configurations.
  parameters:
  - name: parent
    description: A pointer to the parent Creature object from which string identifiers
      will be inherited. This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid
      creature instance with existing string identifiers.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      Creature* parent = new Creature();

      parent->SetAIName("MyAI");

      parent->SetScriptName("MyScript");

      creature->InheritStringIds(parent);

      // Now creature has inherited the AI and Script names from parent'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during creature initialization or template
    inheritance processes. It should be called before any creature-specific operations
    that rely on string identifiers, ensuring proper propagation of identifiers.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect identification of creatures
    in the game world, potentially causing issues with AI behavior or script execution.
    Ensure that the parent parameter is valid and contains string identifiers before
    calling this method.
