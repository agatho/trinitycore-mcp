  class: BattlePetManager
  method: Initialize
  signature: void BattlePetManager::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the BattlePetManager instance, setting up internal data structures
    and preparing for battle pet operations.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the BattlePetManager for use by allocating
    necessary resources, loading configuration settings, and establishing internal
    state required for managing battle pets. This method is typically called during
    server startup or when a player logs in to ensure that all battle pet functionality
    is ready for use. It performs initialization tasks such as registering event handlers,
    loading pet templates, and preparing data caches needed for pet interactions.
    The method should only be called once per manager instance, and calling it multiple
    times may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'BattlePetManager* petManager = new BattlePetManager();

      petManager->Initialize();

      // Manager is now ready for battle pet operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method must be called before any other BattlePetManager methods are
    invoked. It's typically called automatically during server initialization, but
    may also be invoked manually in specific scenarios where dynamic manager creation
    is required.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times on the same instance can lead to memory
    leaks or corrupted internal state. Ensure that this method is only called once
    per manager instance.
