  class: EvokerAI
  method: IsChanneling
  signature: bool EvokerAI::IsChanneling()
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the evoker is currently channeling a spell.
  description: The IsChanneling method determines whether the evoker AI character
    is currently engaged in channeling a spell. This is typically used to prevent
    certain actions or behaviors while a spell is being channeled, ensuring proper
    game mechanics and preventing overlapping abilities. The method returns true if
    the evoker is actively channeling, and false otherwise. This functionality is
    essential for maintaining the integrity of spell casting sequences and cooldown
    management in the Evoker class.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the evoker AI is currently channeling a spell; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check channeling state
    code: "if (evokerAI->IsChanneling())\n{\n    // Prevent movement or other actions\n\
      \    return;\n}\n// Proceed with normal AI behavior"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsChanneling in combat decision making
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (IsChanneling())\n    \
      \    return; // Do not perform actions while channeling\n    \n    if (me->GetVictim()\
      \ && !me->IsMoving())\n    {\n        // Normal combat logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking of the evoker's spell channeling
    status. It should be called frequently during AI update cycles to ensure accurate
    behavior. The implementation may internally check for active spell effects or
    channeling timers.
  warnings: Do not use this method as a replacement for proper spell casting validation.
    Always verify that the spell is actually being channeled rather than relying solely
    on this flag for game logic decisions.
