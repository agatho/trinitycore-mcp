documentation:
  brief: Initializes all interaction handlers for the InteractionManager
  description: The InitializeHandlers method sets up and registers all necessary interaction
    handlers within the InteractionManager. This method is typically called during
    system initialization or when the manager needs to be reset. It ensures that all
    registered interaction types are properly configured and ready to process player
    interactions with game objects, NPCs, and other entities. The method performs
    internal setup operations including handler registration, event binding, and state
    initialization required for proper interaction processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'InteractionManager* manager = new InteractionManager();

      manager->InitializeHandlers();

      // Interaction handlers are now ready to process interactions'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the manager's lifecycle. Reinitializing
    handlers may cause conflicts or duplicate registrations. The method is typically
    invoked automatically by the core system, but can also be manually called when
    handler reset is required.
  warnings: Calling InitializeHandlers multiple times without proper cleanup may lead
    to memory leaks or duplicate handler registrations. Ensure that any existing handlers
    are properly cleaned up before reinitialization.
