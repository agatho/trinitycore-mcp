documentation:
  brief: Resets all cooldowns for the combat specialization.
  description: The ResetAllCooldowns method clears all active cooldowns associated
    with the current combat specialization. This function is typically invoked when
    switching between different combat specializations or during specific game events
    that require a complete reset of cooldown timers. It ensures that no cooldown
    effects persist across specialization changes, maintaining balance and proper
    gameplay mechanics. The method operates on the internal cooldown tracking system
    of the specialization and does not affect global or permanent cooldowns.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resetting Cooldowns When Switching Specializations
    code: "void Player::SwitchCombatSpecialization(CombatSpecialization newSpec)\n\
      {\n    // Reset all cooldowns for current specialization\n    m_combatSpecialization->ResetAllCooldowns();\n\
      \    \n    // Apply new specialization\n    m_activeSpecialization = newSpec;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player's combat specialization
    is being changed or reset. It may have performance implications if used excessively
    during active gameplay, as it iterates through all tracked cooldowns and resets
    their timers.
