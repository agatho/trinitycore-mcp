documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether a given unit is a valid target for AI behavior.
  description: The DefaultTargetSelector::operator() method serves as a predicate
    function used by AI systems to determine if a specified Unit object meets the
    criteria for being selected as a target. This method typically checks various
    conditions such as the target's health status, faction, visibility, and other
    relevant factors that influence AI decision-making in World of Warcraft. It is
    commonly employed within AI behavior trees or target selection logic to filter
    out invalid or undesirable targets. The method returns true if the target is considered
    valid for selection, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the provided Unit object meets the criteria for being a
    valid target, false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the AI system
    should consider this unit as a potential target for actions such as attacks or
    spells.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Target Selection
    code: "if (DefaultTargetSelector()(enemyUnit)) {\n    // Proceed with attack logic\n\
      \    ai->Attack(enemyUnit);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore AI framework and is typically used
    in conjunction with other target selection utilities. It's designed to be fast
    and efficient, as it may be called frequently during AI decision-making processes.
    The exact filtering criteria can vary depending on the specific AI implementation
    or behavior tree configuration.
