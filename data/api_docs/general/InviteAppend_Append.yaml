documentation:
  brief: Appends channel notification data to the provided packet for player invitations.
  description: The Append method is used to populate a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet with invitation-related data. This method is typically invoked when a player
    is invited to join a channel, such as a guild or raid channel, and ensures that
    the appropriate notification data is included in the packet sent to the client.
    It handles the serialization of invitation details into the packet structure,
    which may include the inviter's name, the target player's name, and the channel
    name. The method does not return any value but modifies the input packet in-place
    to reflect the invitation state.

  notes: This method is part of the internal channel invitation system in TrinityCore
    and should only be called during the process of sending an invitation packet to
    a player. It assumes that the packet has been properly initialized before calling.
