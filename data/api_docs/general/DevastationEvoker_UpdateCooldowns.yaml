  class: DevastationEvoker
  method: UpdateCooldowns
  signature: void DevastationEvoker::UpdateCooldowns(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown timers for the Devastation Evoker's abilities.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method is responsible for managing and updating
    the internal cooldown tracking of a Devastation Evoker instance. This method is
    typically called during each update cycle to decrement active cooldowns and manage
    ability readiness. It ensures that abilities cannot be used until their respective
    cooldown periods have expired, maintaining game balance and proper spell mechanics.
    The method processes all active cooldowns within the evoker's state and updates
    their remaining time based on the elapsed game time provided by the diff parameter.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the last update cycle. This
      value is used to decrement cooldown timers and determine when abilities become
      available again.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void DevastationEvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Update cooldowns\n\
      \    m_devastationEvoker->UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n    \n    // Other AI logic...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom ability usage
    code: "void DevastationEvoker::HandleAbilityUse()\n{\n    if (CanUseAbility())\n\
      \    {\n        // Use the ability\n        CastDevastation();\n        \n \
      \       // Reset cooldown for this ability\n        SetCooldownForAbility(ABILITY_DEVASTATION,\
      \ 10000); // 10 seconds\n        \n        // Update cooldowns to reflect the\
      \ change\n        UpdateCooldowns(0);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the AI update loop to ensure accurate
    cooldown tracking. The diff parameter is crucial for maintaining proper timing
    and synchronization with the game's time system. Cooldowns are typically stored
    internally as milliseconds and decremented by the diff value each frame.
  warnings: Do not call this method without providing a valid diff value, as it may
    cause incorrect cooldown calculations. Ensure that all ability cooldowns are properly
    initialized before calling this method for the first time to avoid unexpected
    behavior.
