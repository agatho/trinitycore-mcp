  class: LearningAnalytics
  method: GetPerformanceVariance
  signature: float LearningAnalytics::GetPerformanceVariance(uint32_t botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the performance variance metric for a specified bot
    GUID.
  description: The GetPerformanceVariance method computes a statistical measure of
    how much the learning performance of a specific bot deviates from its expected
    or average performance. This metric is typically used in AI-driven bot behavior
    analysis within the TrinityCore framework, particularly in systems that monitor
    and optimize NPC learning behaviors. The method takes a unique identifier (GUID)
    for a bot as input and returns a floating-point value representing the calculated
    variance. It's important to note that this method may rely on internal tracking
    mechanisms or historical performance data stored by the LearningAnalytics system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the computed performance variance for the specified
    bot. Higher values indicate greater deviation from average performance, while
    lower values suggest more consistent behavior. The return value is typically non-negative,
    with zero indicating perfect consistency.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "LearningAnalytics* analytics = sWorld->GetLearningAnalytics();\nfloat variance\
      \ = analytics->GetPerformanceVariance(12345);\nif (variance >= 0.0f) {\n   \
      \ printf(\"Bot performance variance: %.2f\\n\", variance);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves computational overhead due to statistical calculations
    and may require access to historical performance data for accurate results. It
    should be used judiciously in performance-critical sections of code.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid corresponds to an active bot within the
    system, as invalid or non-existent GUIDs might lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    variance calculations.
