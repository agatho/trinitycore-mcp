  method: ShouldPurify
  signature: bool BrewmasterStaggerTracker::ShouldPurify() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Brewmaster should purge their stagger effect.
  description: The ShouldPurify method evaluates the current state of the Brewmaster's
    stagger effect and returns true if the stagger level has reached a threshold that
    warrants purging. This decision is typically based on the amount of stagger damage
    accumulated and the player's current abilities, such as the Purifying Brew talent.
    The method is used by the Brewmaster AI to determine when to apply purging mechanics
    to reduce or eliminate the stagger effect.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the Brewmaster's stagger level has reached a threshold requiring
    purification; false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (brewmasterStaggerTracker.ShouldPurify()) {\n    // Trigger Purifying\
      \ Brew ability\n    player.CastSpell(PURIFYING_BREW_SPELL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Stagger Management System
    code: "class BrewmasterAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateStaggerLogic() {\n      \
      \  if (staggerTracker.ShouldPurify()) {\n            // Prioritize purifying\
      \ over other actions\n            DoPurifyAction();\n        } else {\n    \
      \        // Continue normal gameplay\n            DoNormalAction();\n      \
      \  }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the Brewmaster's update cycle or when
    stagger levels change. It may be influenced by talents such as Purifying Brew,
    which can alter the conditions under which purification should occur.
  warnings: Ensure that the method is not called in contexts where the player's stagger
    state is not properly initialized, as this could lead to incorrect purging decisions.
