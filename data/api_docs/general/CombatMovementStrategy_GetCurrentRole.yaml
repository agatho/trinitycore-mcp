  method: GetCurrentRole
  signature: FormationRole CombatMovementStrategy::GetCurrentRole() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current formation role assigned to the combat movement strategy.
  description: The GetCurrentRole method returns the FormationRole enum value that
    represents the strategic positioning or duty currently assigned to this combat
    movement strategy. This role typically defines how the unit should behave in a
    group formation, such as being a front-line fighter, support healer, or flanker.
    The returned role is determined by internal logic within the strategy and may
    change based on combat conditions, target selection, or group dynamics. This method
    is commonly used by AI systems to determine appropriate behavior for units during
    group combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: A FormationRole enum value indicating the current strategic role of this
    combat movement strategy. Possible values include FRONT_LINE, SUPPORT, FLANKER,
    TANK, and others depending on the implementation. Returns a valid role constant;
    no null or error conditions are expected.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "FormationRole currentRole = strategy->GetCurrentRole();\nif (currentRole\
      \ == FRONT_LINE)\n{\n    // Execute front-line combat behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Role-Based Decision Making
    code: "CombatMovementStrategy* strategy = unit->GetCombatMovementStrategy();\n\
      FormationRole role = strategy->GetCurrentRole();\nswitch (role)\n{\n    case\
      \ FRONT_LINE:\n        // Move to front of group\n        break;\n    case SUPPORT:\n\
      \        // Maintain distance and support allies\n        break;\n    default:\n\
      \        // Default behavior\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI decision-making cycles to determine
    appropriate movement and positioning behaviors. The returned role may be updated
    dynamically as combat conditions change, making it important for callers to re-evaluate
    the role when necessary. The implementation should be thread-safe as it's likely
    accessed from multiple AI threads.
  warnings: Do not assume that the role remains constant throughout a combat encounter;
    roles can change based on tactical circumstances. Always check the return value
    before making assumptions about unit positioning or behavior.
