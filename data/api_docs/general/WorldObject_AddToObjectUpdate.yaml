  signature: bool WorldObject::AddToObjectUpdate()
documentation:
  brief: Adds the WorldObject to the object update list for processing in the next
    update cycle.
  description: The AddToObjectUpdate method schedules a WorldObject for inclusion
    in the next object update cycle. This is typically used internally by the TrinityCore
    server to ensure that objects are properly updated and sent to clients. The method
    returns true if the object was successfully added to the update list, or false
    if it was already scheduled or if the operation failed. This functionality is
    crucial for maintaining synchronization between server state and client views
    in World of Warcraft. The method is generally called automatically by the core
    system when an object's state changes in a way that requires client notification.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the object was successfully added to the update list, false
    otherwise. The method may return false if the object is already scheduled for
    update or if it's not in a valid state to be updated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in object state change
    code: "void MyObject::OnStateChanged()\n{\n    if (AddToObjectUpdate())\n    {\n\
      \        // Object successfully scheduled for update\n    }\n    else\n    {\n\
      \        // Object was already scheduled or update failed\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework.
    Developers should not generally need to call this directly unless implementing
    custom object update logic. The method uses internal tracking mechanisms to prevent
    duplicate updates and ensure efficient processing.
  warnings: Calling this method manually can lead to unexpected behavior if not properly
    coordinated with the core update system. It's recommended to use this only when
    you understand the full implications of object update scheduling in TrinityCore.
