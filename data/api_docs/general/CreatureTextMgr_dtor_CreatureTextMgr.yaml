documentation:
  brief: Destroys the CreatureTextMgr instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the CreatureTextMgr class is responsible for cleaning
    up all dynamically allocated memory and resources used by the manager. This includes
    releasing any text entries, clearing internal data structures, and ensuring no
    memory leaks occur when the manager object goes out of scope. The destructor is
    automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when the object is destroyed, typically
    during server shutdown or when a creature with associated text is removed from
    the world. It ensures proper cleanup of all text-related data that may have been
    loaded or cached during the lifetime of the manager.

  - title: Automatic destruction of CreatureTextMgr instance
    code: "void CleanupManager()\n{\n    // CreatureTextMgr instance is created on\
      \ stack\n    CreatureTextMgr textManager;\n    \n    // When function exits,\
      \ destructor is automatically called\n    // All resources are released here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor performs cleanup operations that are essential for preventing
    memory leaks. It's important to note that this destructor should not be called
    manually unless you're explicitly managing the object's lifetime through dynamic
    allocation. The cleanup process includes clearing all internal text containers
    and releasing references to any loaded text data.
