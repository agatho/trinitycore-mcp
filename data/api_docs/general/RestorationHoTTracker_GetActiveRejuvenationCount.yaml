  signature: uint32 RestorationHoTTracker::GetActiveRejuvenationCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of active Rejuvenation HoTs on the target.
  description: The GetActiveRejuvenationCount method retrieves the number of active
    Rejuvenation periodic healing effects currently applied to the target. This is
    used primarily by restoration shaman classes and other healers who utilize the
    Rejuvenation spell. The method iterates through all active periodic healing effects
    on the target and counts those that match the Rejuvenation spell ID. It's commonly
    used for spell stacking calculations, mana efficiency checks, and ensuring proper
    spell application logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of active Rejuvenation HoTs
    currently affecting the target. Returns 0 if no Rejuvenation effects are active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 rejuvenationCount = tracker->GetActiveRejuvenationCount();\nif (rejuvenationCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Handle logic when Rejuvenation is active\n    target->ModifyHealth(-100);\
      \ // Example damage application\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Spell Stack Validation
    code: "uint32 currentRejuvs = tracker->GetActiveRejuvenationCount();\nif (currentRejuvs\
      \ < MAX_REJUVENATION_STACKS)\n{\n    // Apply new Rejuvenation\n    caster->CastSpell(target,\
      \ REJUVENATION_SPELL_ID, true);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Refresh existing Rejuvenation\
      \ instead of stacking\n    target->RemoveAurasDueToSpell(REJUVENATION_SPELL_ID);\n\
      \    caster->CastSpell(target, REJUVENATION_SPELL_ID, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only counts active Rejuvenation effects that are currently ticking.
    Effects that have been removed or are in the process of fading will not be included.
    The implementation relies on internal aura tracking and may not account for custom
    or modified spell behavior outside of standard TrinityCore mechanics.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns a count of active HoTs, which may change
    between calls if other spells are applied or removed from the target. Ensure proper
    synchronization when using this in multi-threaded environments or during spell
    processing sequences.
