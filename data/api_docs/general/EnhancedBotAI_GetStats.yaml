  class: EnhancedBotAI
  method: GetStats
  signature: const EnhancedAIStats & EnhancedBotAI::GetStats() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current statistics structure for the enhanced bot AI instance.
  description: The GetStats method provides access to a constant reference of the
    EnhancedAIStats structure, which encapsulates various performance and behavioral
    metrics for the enhanced bot AI. This method allows external systems or modules
    to query the current state of AI statistics without modifying them. The returned
    reference is guaranteed to be valid for the lifetime of the EnhancedBotAI instance
    and should not be modified directly. This functionality is essential for monitoring
    bot behavior, performance tuning, and debugging AI-related issues in TrinityCore's
    enhanced bot system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an EnhancedAIStats object containing current AI
    statistics including performance metrics, behavior flags, and internal state information.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'EnhancedBotAI* bot = ...;

      const EnhancedAIStats& stats = bot->GetStats();

      uint32 total_actions = stats.totalActions;

      uint32 successful_calls = stats.successfulCalls;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Bot Performance
    code: "EnhancedBotAI* bot = ...;\nconst EnhancedAIStats& stats = bot->GetStats();\n\
      if (stats.errorCount > 100)\n{\n    // Log performance degradation or trigger\
      \ alert\n    sLog->outString(\"EnhancedBot AI has high error count: %u\", stats.errorCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned EnhancedAIStats reference is read-only and should not be modified.
    The statistics are updated dynamically during bot operation, so repeated calls
    may return different values. This method is thread-safe as long as the underlying
    AI instance is not being modified concurrently.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the returned EnhancedAIStats structure directly
    through the reference, as it's const. Modifications should be made through appropriate
    setter methods or internal AI update mechanisms. The statistics may change between
    calls, so caching the reference for extended periods is discouraged.
