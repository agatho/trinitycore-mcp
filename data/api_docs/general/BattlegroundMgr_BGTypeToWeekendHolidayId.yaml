  signature: int BattlegroundMgr::BGTypeToWeekendHolidayId(int bgTypeId)
documentation:
  brief: Maps a battleground type ID to its corresponding weekend holiday ID used
    for seasonal or special event battlegrounds.
  description: The BGTypeToWeekendHolidayId method translates a battleground type
    identifier into a holiday identifier that corresponds to weekend events. This
    mapping is primarily used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation
    to determine if a specific battleground type should be active during certain weekend
    holiday periods. The method serves as a lookup utility for managing seasonal battleground
    availability and event-based gameplay mechanics. It ensures that battlegrounds
    are correctly enabled or disabled based on the current holiday status, particularly
    for weekend-only events such as Battleground Weekends or special holiday battlegrounds.
  parameters:
  - name: bgTypeId
    description: The unique identifier of the battleground type to map to a weekend
      holiday ID. Valid values are typically defined in the battleground type constants
      or database entries.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the corresponding weekend holiday ID for
    the given battleground type. If no mapping exists, it may return 0 or a default
    value indicating no associated weekend holiday.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int bgTypeId = 12; // Example battleground type ID\nint holidayId = BattlegroundMgr::BGTypeToWeekendHolidayId(bgTypeId);\n\
      if (holidayId != 0) {\n    printf(\"Battleground %d is active during holiday\
      \ %d\\n\", bgTypeId, holidayId);\n} else {\n    printf(\"No weekend holiday\
      \ associated with battleground type %d\\n\", bgTypeId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal mappings or database lookups to correlate
    battleground types with holiday IDs. It's commonly used in conjunction with time-based
    checks and event management systems to enable or disable battlegrounds during
    specific weekend events.
  warnings: Ensure that the bgTypeId parameter is valid and corresponds to an existing
    battleground type, as invalid inputs may result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    mappings.
