documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BotPacketSimulator instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotPacketSimulator class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the object's lifetime. This method ensures proper resource deallocation when an
    instance of BotPacketSimulator goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In
    the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this may involve releasing packet buffers,
    clearing internal state tracking, or notifying other subsystems about the simulator's
    termination. The destructor does not take any parameters and performs no return
    operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BotPacketSimulator
    code: "void exampleFunction() {\n    BotPacketSimulator simulator;\n    // ...\
      \ use simulator ...\n    // Destructor automatically called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of BotPacketSimulator pointer
    code: 'BotPacketSimulator* simulator = new BotPacketSimulator();

      // ... use simulator ...

      delete simulator; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when an object
    goes out of scope or is deleted. Developers should not manually call destructors
    unless implementing custom memory management patterns. Since this is a destructor,
    it's expected to be called only once per object instance.
