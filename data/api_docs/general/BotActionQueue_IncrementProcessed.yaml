  brief: Increments the processed action counter in the bot action queue
  description: The IncrementProcessed method increases the internal counter that tracks
    how many actions have been successfully processed by the bot. This method is typically
    called after an action has been executed or completed within the bot's action
    queue system. It helps maintain state tracking for the bot's execution flow and
    ensures proper accounting of completed operations. The increment operation is
    usually thread-safe and may be used in conjunction with other queue management
    methods to monitor bot activity and performance.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotActionQueue queue;

      // ... actions added to queue ...

      queue.IncrementProcessed(); // Increment after processing an action'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on an atomic counter to ensure thread safety
    in multi-threaded environments. It should be called after each successful action
    execution to maintain accurate processing statistics.
