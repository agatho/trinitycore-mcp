    const
documentation:
  brief: Filters items by quality level and returns the count of matching items.
  description: The FilterByQuality method filters a collection of items based on a
    specified quality threshold. It evaluates each item in the internal list against
    the provided quality value, returning the total number of items that meet or exceed
    the quality requirement. This method is typically used within bot gear management
    systems to ensure that only items meeting certain quality standards are considered
    for equipping or inventory management. The quality parameter corresponds to standard
    World of Warcraft item quality levels (0=poor, 1=common, 2=uncommon, 3=rare, 4=epic,
    5=legendary, 6=artifact).
  parameters:
  - name: items
    description: Reference to an integer representing the total number of items in
      the collection being filtered. This parameter is passed by reference and typically
      represents a count or index value used internally for iteration.
  - name: quality
    description: 'The minimum quality threshold for filtering items. Valid values
      are 0 through 6, corresponding to WoW item quality levels: 0=Poor, 1=Common,
      2=Uncommon, 3=Rare, 4=Epic, 5=Legendary, 6=Artifact.'
  returns: Returns an integer representing the count of items that meet or exceed
    the specified quality threshold. A return value of 0 indicates no items matched
    the quality requirement.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quality Filtering
    code: 'int itemCount = factory.FilterByQuality(10, 3); // Filter items with quality
      3 (Rare) or higher

      std::cout << "Found " << itemCount << " rare or better items" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Filtering for Legendary Items
    code: "int legendaryCount = factory.FilterByQuality(25, 5); // Filter items with\
      \ quality 5 (Legendary) or higher\nif (legendaryCount > 0)\n{\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Found \" << legendaryCount << \" legendary items\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on an internal collection of items managed by the BotGearFactory
    class. The filtering logic assumes that items are already loaded and accessible
    through the factory's internal data structures. Performance may be impacted when
    dealing with large item collections, as this method iterates through all items
    to determine quality matches.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'items' parameter correctly reflects the size of the collection
    being filtered to avoid out-of-bounds access or incorrect filtering results. The
    quality parameter should be validated against valid WoW quality levels (0-6) to
    prevent unexpected behavior.
