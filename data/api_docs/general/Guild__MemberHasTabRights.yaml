documentation:
  brief: Checks if a guild member has specific rights for a given guild bank tab
  description: This method determines whether a specified guild member possesses the
    required permissions to perform actions on a particular guild bank tab. It evaluates
    the member's role and assigned tab rights within the guild's bank system. The
    function is typically used internally by the game engine to validate access control
    for guild bank operations such as viewing, depositing, or withdrawing items from
    specific tabs. This method does not directly modify any data but serves as a permission
    check utility.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the guild member to check permissions
      for
  - name: tabId
    description: The index of the guild bank tab to verify rights against (0-based)
  - name: rights
    description: Bitmask value representing the specific rights being checked (e.g.,
      GuildBankRights::RIGHT_VIEW, GuildBankRights::RIGHT_DEPOSIT)
  returns: Returns true if the member has all specified rights for the tab, false
    otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a player can view a guild bank tab
    code: "if (guild->_MemberHasTabRights(playerGuid, 0, GUILD_BANK_RIGHT_VIEW)) {\n\
      \    // Player can view tab 0\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validating deposit rights for a specific tab
    code: "uint32 requiredRights = GUILD_BANK_RIGHT_DEPOSIT | GUILD_BANK_RIGHT_VIEW;\n\
      if (guild->_MemberHasTabRights(playerGuid, 2, requiredRights)) {\n    // Player\
      \ can both view and deposit in tab 2\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal guild bank management system. The rights
    parameter uses bitmasks that correspond to predefined constants like GUILD_BANK_RIGHT_VIEW,
    GUILD_BANK_RIGHT_DEPOSIT, etc. It assumes the player GUID and tab ID are valid
    indices within the guild's context.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to an actual member of the guild,
    otherwise behavior is undefined. The tabId must be within valid range (typically
    0-9 for standard WoW guild banks).
