  signature: void StrategyFactory::RegisterStrategy(const std::string & name, int
    creator)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a new AI strategy with the specified name and creator function
    pointer.
  description: The RegisterStrategy method adds a new AI strategy to the StrategyFactory's
    internal registry. This allows the game's AI system to dynamically load and utilize
    different strategies based on context or configuration. The method takes a string
    identifier for the strategy and an integer representing a creator function, which
    is typically used to instantiate strategy objects. It is commonly used during
    server initialization or when extending AI behavior with custom modules. The registration
    process ensures that strategies can be retrieved and instantiated later by their
    name.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A unique string identifier for the AI strategy being registered.
      This name will be used to retrieve and instantiate the strategy later.
  - name: creator
    description: An integer value representing a creator function or factory method
      used to instantiate the AI strategy. The exact interpretation depends on how
      the StrategyFactory implements its internal mapping.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Strategy Registration
    code: StrategyFactory::RegisterStrategy("custom_combat", 12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering Multiple Strategies
    code: 'StrategyFactory::RegisterStrategy("tank_strategy", 1001);

      StrategyFactory::RegisterStrategy("heal_strategy", 1002);

      StrategyFactory::RegisterStrategy("dps_strategy", 1003);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or module initialization
    to register available AI strategies. The creator parameter may be interpreted
    as a function pointer, index into a registry table, or an identifier for a factory
    class depending on the internal implementation of StrategyFactory.
  warnings: Registering strategies with duplicate names may lead to overwriting existing
    entries. Ensure that strategy names are unique and properly managed to avoid unexpected
    behavior in AI decision-making.
