  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the AuctionBotConfig class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the AuctionBotConfig
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the configuration object exists throughout
    the application lifecycle. This method is typically called to access global auction
    bot settings and parameters. The returned pointer provides access to all configuration
    values and methods associated with the auction bot's operational parameters. This
    implementation is thread-safe and guarantees a single point of access for auction
    bot configuration data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of AuctionBotConfig. Returns a valid
    pointer to the configuration object, or NULL if the instance could not be created
    due to initialization failure.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Auction Bot Configuration
    code: "AuctionBotConfig* config = AuctionBotConfig::instance();\nif (config)\n\
      {\n    uint32 botDelay = config->GetUIntDefault(\"AuctionBot.Delay\", 30000);\n\
      \    // Use the configuration value\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Configuration Before Usage
    code: "AuctionBotConfig* config = AuctionBotConfig::instance();\nif (config !=\
      \ nullptr)\n{\n    bool enabled = config->GetBoolDefault(\"AuctionBot.Enabled\"\
      , false);\n    if (enabled)\n    {\n        // Proceed with auction bot operations\n\
      \        uint32 maxItems = config->GetUIntDefault(\"AuctionBot.MaxItems\", 100);\n\
      \        // Process auction bot logic\n    }\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle initialization\
      \ failure\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to initialize AuctionBotConfig singleton\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the classic singleton pattern implementation. The instance
    is typically created during server startup or first access. The method is designed
    to be thread-safe and should not be called from multiple threads simultaneously
    during initialization. Configuration values are cached internally, so changes
    made after initial creation may not be immediately reflected unless explicitly
    reloaded.
  warnings: Do not call this method before the server has properly initialized the
    configuration system. Accessing the singleton instance too early in the startup
    process may return NULL or uninitialized data. The returned pointer should never
    be deleted by the caller as it is managed internally by the singleton pattern.
