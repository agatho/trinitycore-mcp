  class: LootAnalysis
  method: CalculateAuctionHouseValue
  signature: float LootAnalysis::CalculateAuctionHouseValue(const LootItem & item)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the auction house value of a given loot item.
  description: The CalculateAuctionHouseValue method determines the estimated auction
    house listing price for a specified loot item. This calculation takes into account
    various factors such as item quality, level, vendor value, and market dynamics
    within the game environment. The method is typically used during loot distribution
    processes to provide players with an accurate representation of potential auction
    earnings. It serves as a core component in TrinityCore's loot management system,
    ensuring fair and consistent pricing across the auction house interface.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: A constant reference to a LootItem structure representing the specific
      item for which the auction house value is being calculated. This parameter must
      be a valid loot item with populated attributes such as item template, stack
      count, and other relevant properties.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated auction house price for the given
    loot item. The returned value reflects the expected market price that would be
    set when listing this item on the auction house, taking into account item rarity,
    level requirements, and other economic factors within the game.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'LootItem lootItem;

      // Assume lootItem is properly initialized with valid data

      float auctionValue = LootAnalysis::CalculateAuctionHouseValue(lootItem);

      printf("Auction House Value: %.2f\n", auctionValue);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Loot Distribution System
    code: "void ProcessLootForPlayer(Player* player, Loot* loot) {\n    for (uint8\
      \ i = 0; i < loot->GetItemCount(); ++i) {\n        LootItem& item = loot->GetLootItem(i);\n\
      \        if (item.is_looted)\n            continue;\n        \n        float\
      \ auctionValue = LootAnalysis::CalculateAuctionHouseValue(item);\n        //\
      \ Display auction value to player\n        player->SendNotification(\"Estimated\
      \ Auction Value: %.2f\", auctionValue);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal game data tables and economic models that
    may vary between different World of Warcraft expansions or custom server configurations.
    The calculation algorithm considers multiple factors including item level, quality,
    vendor price multiplier, and historical auction data trends. Developers should
    be aware that the returned value might differ slightly from actual market prices
    due to dynamic pricing mechanisms in the auction house system.
  warnings: Ensure that the LootItem parameter is fully initialized before calling
    this method, as accessing uninitialized or corrupted item data may lead to incorrect
    calculations or undefined behavior. This method assumes valid item templates and
    should not be called with malformed loot items.
