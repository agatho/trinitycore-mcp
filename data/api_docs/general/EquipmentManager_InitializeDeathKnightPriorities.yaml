  brief: Initializes equipment priorities for Death Knights based on their specialization
    and combat role.
  description: The InitializeDeathKnightPriorities method sets up default equipment
    priority configurations for Death Knights within the game. This method is typically
    called during character initialization or when switching specs to ensure that
    the player's gear is optimized according to their current class specialization
    and playstyle. It configures which items should be prioritized for different combat
    scenarios, such as melee vs. ranged engagements, and accounts for the unique abilities
    and talents of Death Knights. The method does not require any parameters and modifies
    internal state within the EquipmentManager class.

    code: 'EquipmentManager* eqMgr = player->GetEquipmentManager();

      eqMgr->InitializeDeathKnightPriorities();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically during character creation or
    spec switching, but may also be manually called if custom equipment priorities
    are needed. It relies on internal data structures that define item types and their
    priority levels for Death Knight classes.
