  signature: void CalendarMgr::DeleteOldEvents()
documentation:
  brief: Removes expired calendar events from the database and clears associated data
    structures.
  description: The DeleteOldEvents method is responsible for cleaning up calendar
    events that have exceeded their validity period. It iterates through all stored
    calendar events, identifies those that are past their expiration date, and removes
    them from both the database and in-memory caches. This method ensures that old
    events do not clutter the system and helps maintain optimal performance by preventing
    accumulation of stale data. The cleanup process typically occurs during periodic
    maintenance tasks or server shutdowns to prevent memory leaks and database bloat.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Maintenance Routine
    code: "void CalendarMgr::DeleteOldEvents()\n{\n    // Implementation would iterate\
      \ through events\n    // and remove those older than configured threshold\n\
      \    // This method is typically called by server maintenance threads\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates in a background thread or during scheduled maintenance
    windows to avoid impacting gameplay performance. It may use a time-based threshold
    (e.g., 30 days) to determine which events are considered 'old'. The implementation
    probably includes proper locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions when accessing
    shared calendar data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method directly during active gameplay sessions might cause
    unexpected behavior or performance hiccups. It should only be invoked as part
    of controlled maintenance procedures or system shutdown sequences. Improper use
    could result in loss of valid event data if not properly synchronized with other
    calendar operations.
