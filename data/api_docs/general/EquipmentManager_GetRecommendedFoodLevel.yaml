  class: EquipmentManager
  method: GetRecommendedFoodLevel
  signature: uint32 EquipmentManager::GetRecommendedFoodLevel(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the recommended food level for a player based on their current
    equipment and stats.
  description: The GetRecommendedFoodLevel method calculates and returns the optimal
    food level that a player should consume to maximize their performance in combat.
    This value is derived from analyzing the player's current gear, stats, and other
    relevant factors such as their class, level, and equipped items. The returned
    level indicates the minimum food quality required to achieve peak effectiveness
    during gameplay. This method does not modify any player state but rather provides
    a computed recommendation based on internal game logic.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or index
      within the system. This parameter is used internally to retrieve player-specific
      data for calculation purposes.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value indicating the recommended food level. A higher
    number typically represents a more powerful or beneficial food item that provides
    greater stat boosts or effects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      uint32 recommendedLevel = equipmentManager->GetRecommendedFoodLevel(&playerId);

      printf("Recommended food level: %u\n", recommendedLevel);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Class
    code: "Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player,\
      \ playerId));\nif (player)\n{\n    uint32 foodLevel = equipmentManager->GetRecommendedFoodLevel(nullptr);\n\
      \    // Use foodLevel to determine what food item to recommend\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal player data structures and may be affected
    by dynamic changes in gear or stats during gameplay. It is recommended to call
    this function when the player's equipment state has stabilized before making decisions
    based on its output.
  warnings: Ensure that the player parameter points to a valid player object; otherwise,
    undefined behavior may occur. The returned value should not be used directly for
    item selection without additional validation or game logic checks.
