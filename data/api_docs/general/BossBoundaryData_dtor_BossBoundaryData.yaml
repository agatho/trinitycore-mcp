documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BossBoundaryData object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BossBoundaryData class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used to manage boss
    boundary data within the TrinityCore framework. This method ensures proper deallocation
    of internal structures such as boundary points, collision data, or other metadata
    related to boss encounter boundaries. It is automatically invoked when a BossBoundaryData
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. The destructor does not take
    any parameters and performs no return operations, as it is a cleanup function.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BossBoundaryData
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    BossBoundaryData boundaryData;\n    // Use boundaryData...\n\
      \    // Destructor is automatically called here when boundaryData goes out of\
      \ scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless explicitly managing
    object lifetime. The destruction process is handled automatically by the C++ runtime
    when objects go out of scope or are deleted.
