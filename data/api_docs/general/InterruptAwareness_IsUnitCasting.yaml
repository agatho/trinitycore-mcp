  signature: bool InterruptAwareness::IsUnitCasting(int unitGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a unit with the specified GUID is currently casting a spell.
  description: The IsUnitCasting method determines whether a unit identified by its
    GUID is currently in the process of casting a spell. This functionality is essential
    for interruptible spell systems, combat logic, and AI behavior in TrinityCore.
    The method typically checks the unit's current spell cast state and returns true
    if the unit has an active spell cast that can be interrupted, such as channeling
    or non-instant cast spells. It does not distinguish between different types of
    casts but focuses on whether any casting activity is occurring for the given unit.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit with the specified GUID is currently casting a
    spell; otherwise, returns false. This includes both instant and non-instant casts
    that are in progress.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check if Unit is Casting
    code: "if (interruptAwareness.IsUnitCasting(playerGuid)) {\n    // Player is currently\
      \ casting a spell\n    // Can be used to prevent certain actions or apply effects\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Combat AI Logic
    code: "if (IsUnitCasting(targetGuid) && !target->HasAuraType(SPELL_AURA_DISABLE_CASTING))\
      \ {\n    // Target is casting, so we might want to interrupt or delay our attack\n\
      \    DoInterruptSpell();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal unit state tracking within TrinityCore's spell
    system. It may not return accurate results for units that are not properly initialized
    or in invalid states. The GUID parameter should refer to a valid unit (player
    or creature) that has been registered with the server.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to an active unit before calling
    this method, as using an invalid or non-existent GUID may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. This function does not validate the GUID itself but assumes it's a
    valid reference to a unit in the world.
