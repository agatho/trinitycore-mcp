  class: MovementRequest
  method: GetSourceSystem
  signature: const std::string & MovementRequest::GetSourceSystem() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the source system identifier associated with the movement request.
  description: The GetSourceSystem method retrieves the string identifier of the system
    that originated the movement request. This is typically used in TrinityCore's
    movement handling subsystem to track where movement commands come from, such as
    from a player client, AI system, or game event. The returned reference points
    to an internal string member of the MovementRequest object, ensuring efficient
    access without unnecessary copying. This method is commonly called during movement
    processing to determine the origin and context of a movement command for proper
    handling and logging.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the source system identifier.
    The string represents the originating system (e.g., 'player', 'ai', 'event') that
    generated this movement request.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "MovementRequest request;\n// Assume request has been populated with data\n\
      const std::string& source = request.GetSourceSystem();\nif (source == \"player\"\
      ) {\n    // Handle player movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Movement Origin
    code: "void ProcessMovement(MovementRequest const& request) {\n    std::string\
      \ source = request.GetSourceSystem();\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL,\
      \ \"Processing movement from source: %s\", source.c_str());\n    // Continue\
      \ with movement processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned string reference is valid only as long as the MovementRequest
    object remains in scope. This method does not perform any validation or modification
    of the internal data, and should be used carefully in multi-threaded contexts
    where the MovementRequest object might be modified concurrently.
  warnings: Be cautious when storing the returned reference beyond the lifetime of
    the MovementRequest object, as it will become invalid. Also, ensure that the source
    system identifier is properly initialized before calling this method to avoid
    unexpected behavior.
