  class: QuestValidation
  method: GetMissingItems
  signature: int QuestValidation::GetMissingItems(uint32 questId, Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the number of missing required items for a specified quest from
    a player's inventory.
  description: The GetMissingItems method evaluates whether a player has all the necessary
    items required to complete a specific quest. It checks the player's inventory
    against the quest's item requirements and returns the count of items that are
    missing. This method is commonly used in automated quest completion systems or
    botting logic to determine what items need to be acquired before a quest can be
    turned in. The method does not modify any data but provides a read-only assessment
    of the player's inventory state relative to the quest requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the quest to evaluate for missing items.
      Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose inventory
      is being checked against the quest requirements. This parameter must not be
      null.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the number of required items that are
    missing from the player's inventory. A return value of 0 means all required items
    are present, while any positive integer indicates how many items are missing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Quest Requirements
    code: "uint32 questId = 12345;\nPlayer* playerBot = ...; // Assume valid player\
      \ pointer\nint missingItems = QuestValidation::GetMissingItems(questId, playerBot);\n\
      if (missingItems == 0)\n{\n    // All items present, can proceed with quest\
      \ completion\n    // ...\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Some items are missing, need to\
      \ acquire them\n    // ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Missing Item Count for Automated Quest Logic
    code: "uint32 questId = 12345;\nPlayer* playerBot = ...; // Assume valid player\
      \ pointer\nint missingItems = QuestValidation::GetMissingItems(questId, playerBot);\n\
      if (missingItems > 0)\n{\n    // Log or display how many items are missing\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Quest %u requires %d more items.\", questId, missingItems);\n\
      \    // Implement logic to gather missing items\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Proceed\
      \ with quest completion\n    // ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal quest item requirement database and player
    inventory state. It does not perform any direct modifications to the player's
    inventory or quest status. The method assumes that both the quest ID exists in
    the database and the player object is valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed as the 'bot' parameter is valid
    and not null, otherwise the behavior of this method is undefined. Also, be aware
    that quest item requirements may include quest items, currency items, or other
    special item types that might not be handled identically across all game versions.
