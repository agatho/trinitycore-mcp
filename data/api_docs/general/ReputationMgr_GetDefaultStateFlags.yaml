  signature: ReputationFlags ReputationMgr::GetDefaultStateFlags(const FactionEntry
    * factionEntry) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the default reputation state flags for a given faction entry.
  description: The GetDefaultStateFlags method returns the initial reputation state
    flags that define how a player's reputation with a specific faction is initialized.
    These flags determine whether the faction starts in a hostile, neutral, or friendly
    state and influence various gameplay mechanics such as quest availability, vendor
    access, and NPC interactions. The method takes a FactionEntry pointer as input
    and returns a ReputationFlags enum value representing the default state configuration
    for that faction.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ReputationFlags enum value indicating the default reputation state for
    the specified faction. This typically includes flags such as REPUTATION_FLAG_HOSTILE,
    REPUTATION_FLAG_NEUTRAL, or REPUTATION_FLAG_FRIENDLY, which define the initial
    relationship status between the player and the faction.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Default State Flags for a Faction
    code: "const FactionEntry* faction = sFactionStore.LookupEntry(1118); // Example\
      \ faction ID\nReputationFlags flags = reputationMgr->GetDefaultStateFlags(faction);\n\
      if (flags & REPUTATION_FLAG_FRIENDLY)\n{\n    // Handle friendly faction logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during player initialization or when loading
    faction data. The returned flags are determined by the faction's default standing
    in the game database and may be overridden by player-specific reputation changes.
