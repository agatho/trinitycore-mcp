  class: AreaTrigger
  method: SearchUnitInBoundedPlane
  signature: void AreaTrigger::SearchUnitInBoundedPlane(const int & boundedPlane,
    int & targetList)
documentation:
  brief: Searches for units within a specified bounded plane area trigger.
  description: The SearchUnitInBoundedPlane method performs a search for nearby units
    that are within the defined bounded plane area of an AreaTrigger. This functionality
    is typically used in game mechanics where certain effects or interactions need
    to target units located within a specific geometric boundary, such as a cone,
    circle, or rectangle. The method updates a provided list with the identifiers
    of found units, allowing for further processing or action execution on those targets.
    It's commonly utilized in spell effects, area-of-effect abilities, and trigger-based
    events that require unit detection within spatial constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: boundedPlane
    description: An integer identifier representing the specific bounded plane geometry
      used for unit detection. This value typically corresponds to predefined area
      shapes like cone, circle, or rectangle, and determines how the search area is
      calculated and applied.
  - name: targetList
    description: A reference to an integer variable that will be populated with the
      list of unit identifiers found within the bounded plane. The method modifies
      this parameter to contain the results of the unit search operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Area Trigger Unit Search
    code: "void MyAreaTrigger::OnTrigger() {\n    int boundedPlane = 1; // Cone-shaped\
      \ area\n    int targetList = 0;\n    SearchUnitInBoundedPlane(boundedPlane,\
      \ targetList);\n    // Process targetList to apply effects or actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AreaTrigger system and relies on internal spatial
    calculations. It's important to ensure that the boundedPlane parameter corresponds
    to valid predefined area shapes within the TrinityCore engine. The targetList
    parameter must be properly initialized before calling this method to avoid undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Incorrect boundedPlane values may result in unexpected search behavior
    or no units being detected. Ensure that the AreaTrigger is properly configured
    and active before invoking this method, as inactive triggers might not yield accurate
    results.
