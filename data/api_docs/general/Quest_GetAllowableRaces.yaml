documentation:
  brief: Returns the allowable races for a quest
  description: This method retrieves the set of races that are allowed to accept the
    quest. It returns an integer value representing the bitmask of allowable races,
    where each bit corresponds to a specific race type. The method is commonly used
    in quest system logic to determine if a player's race is valid for accepting a
    particular quest. This functionality is crucial for maintaining game balance and
    ensuring proper quest progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the bitmask of allowable races. Each
    bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific race type, allowing developers
    to determine which races can accept the quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int raceMask = quest->GetAllowableRaces();\nif (raceMask & (1 << 0))\n\
      {\n    // Player can accept quest\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to validate player eligibility. The bitmask value should be interpreted using
    bitwise operations for proper race validation.
  warnings: The returned value represents a bitmask, so developers must ensure proper
    bit manipulation when checking race eligibility. Incorrect handling can lead to
    quests being inaccessible to players who should be able to accept them.
