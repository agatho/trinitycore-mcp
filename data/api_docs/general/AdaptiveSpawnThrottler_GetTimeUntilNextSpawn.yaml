  class: AdaptiveSpawnThrottler
  method: GetTimeUntilNextSpawn
  signature: int AdaptiveSpawnThrottler::GetTimeUntilNextSpawn() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the time in milliseconds until the next spawn event
    occurs.
  description: The GetTimeUntilNextSpawn method determines how long (in milliseconds)
    remains before the next creature or game object spawn is scheduled to occur within
    an adaptive spawn system. This method is typically used by spawn managers or AI
    systems to control the timing of dynamic spawns, ensuring that creatures or objects
    appear at appropriate intervals without overwhelming the server or client. It
    evaluates internal throttling logic based on configured spawn rates, cooldowns,
    and current spawn activity to compute the next scheduled spawn time. The returned
    value can be zero or negative if a spawn is due immediately or has already passed
    its scheduled time. This method does not modify any internal state and is safe
    for repeated calls.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the time in milliseconds until the next spawn event
    occurs. A positive value indicates a future spawn, zero means the spawn should
    occur immediately, and negative values indicate that the spawn time has already
    passed or is overdue.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "AdaptiveSpawnThrottler throttler;\nint delay = throttler.GetTimeUntilNextSpawn();\n\
      if (delay <= 0)\n{\n    // Spawn is due now or overdue\n    DoSpawn();\n}\n\
      else\n{\n    // Schedule next spawn after delay\n    ScheduleSpawn(delay);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spawn Manager
    code: "class SpawnManager\n{\npublic:\n    void Update()\n    {\n        int timeUntilNext\
      \ = throttler.GetTimeUntilNextSpawn();\n        if (timeUntilNext <= 0)\n  \
      \      {\n            SpawnCreature();\n            throttler.Reset(); // Reset\
      \ after spawn\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            // Continue waiting\n\
      \        }\n    }\nprivate:\n    AdaptiveSpawnThrottler throttler;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal timing mechanisms and should be used in contexts
    where accurate time tracking is available. It is recommended to call this method
    from within a consistent update loop or timer context to avoid inconsistencies
    in spawn scheduling. The result may vary depending on the current state of the
    throttler's internal cooldown and rate limiting logic.
  warnings: Do not assume that a return value of zero means immediate spawning; it
    could also indicate an overdue spawn event. Always check for negative values which
    suggest that the spawn time has already passed, potentially indicating a scheduling
    issue or race condition in the system.
