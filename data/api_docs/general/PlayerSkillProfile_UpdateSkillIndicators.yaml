api:
  class: PlayerSkillProfile
  method: UpdateSkillIndicators
  signature: void PlayerSkillProfile::UpdateSkillIndicators(const SkillIndicators
    & indicators)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the skill indicators for the player based on the provided skill data.
  description: The UpdateSkillIndicators method is responsible for refreshing or setting
    the visual and functional skill indicators associated with a player character.
    These indicators typically represent the current state of skills, such as their
    level, progress, or whether they are active in the UI. This method likely updates
    internal player data structures and may trigger UI refreshes or network packets
    to synchronize the skill state across the game world. It is commonly invoked when
    skill levels change, when a player logs in, or during specific gameplay events
    that affect skill visibility or progression.
  parameters:
  - name: indicators
    description: A constant reference to a SkillIndicators object containing the new
      skill data to be applied to the player. This includes information such as skill
      IDs, levels, ranks, and any other relevant metadata that defines how skills
      should appear or behave in the UI.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Skill Indicators with New Data
    code: 'SkillIndicators newIndicators;

      // Populate newIndicators with skill data

      player->GetSkillProfile()->UpdateSkillIndicators(newIndicators);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may trigger UI updates and network synchronization, so it should
    be called carefully to avoid performance issues in high-frequency scenarios. It
    is recommended to batch skill updates where possible.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or malformed SkillIndicators data could
    lead to undefined behavior or UI inconsistencies. Ensure all skill IDs and values
    are valid before invoking the method.
