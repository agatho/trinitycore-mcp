documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the character loadout is intended for new characters.
  description: The IsForNewCharacter method checks if the current CharacterLoadoutEntry
    instance represents a loadout that should be applied to newly created characters.
    This flag is typically used during character creation to determine which default
    equipment, spells, or abilities should be assigned to players when they first
    enter the game. The method returns true if the loadout is designated for new characters,
    and false otherwise. This functionality supports game design requirements where
    different starting conditions are needed for various character classes or roles.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether this loadout entry is meant for new
    characters. Returns true if the loadout should be applied during initial character
    creation, false if it's not intended for new characters.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Loadout is for New Characters
    code: "CharacterLoadoutEntry* loadout = sCharacterLoadoutStore.LookupEntry(12345);\n\
      if (loadout && loadout->IsForNewCharacter())\n{\n    // Apply this loadout to\
      \ new characters\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"world\", \"Loadout ID {} is for new characters.\"\
      , loadout->ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses an internal flag or field within the CharacterLoadoutEntry
    structure that determines its applicability to new character creation. It's commonly
    used in conjunction with character creation logic and may be part of a larger
    system managing default player setups.
