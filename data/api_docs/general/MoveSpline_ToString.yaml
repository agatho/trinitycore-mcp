documentation:
  brief: Converts MoveSpline object into a human-readable string representation
  description: The ToString method provides a textual representation of the MoveSpline
    object, which is commonly used for debugging and logging purposes. This method
    typically outputs key properties of the spline such as start and end positions,
    movement type, and other relevant movement parameters. In World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore environment, MoveSpline objects are used to manage character and creature
    movement paths, making this method useful for developers who need to inspect or
    log movement data during development or troubleshooting. The returned string format
    is designed to be informative yet concise for quick diagnostics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing a formatted representation of the MoveSpline object's
    current state and properties, including movement parameters and key identifiers
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Debug Logging
    code: 'MoveSpline spline;

      // ... configure spline ...

      std::string debugInfo = spline.ToString();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("movement", "Current spline state: %s", debugInfo.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for debugging and should not be used in
    performance-critical code paths. The exact format of the returned string may vary
    between different versions of TrinityCore and should not be relied upon for programmatic
    parsing.
