documentation:
  brief: Handles spell click interactions between units, determining if a spell can
    be cast on a target based on seat and spell conditions.
  description: The HandleSpellClick method is responsible for managing spell click
    interactions between units in World of Warcraft. It determines whether a spell
    can be cast on a target unit based on various conditions including seat position,
    spell ID, and flags. This method is typically used during player interaction with
    NPCs or other players where specific spell click mechanics are involved, such
    as mounting or other special abilities requiring seat-based interaction. The method
    evaluates the provided parameters to determine if the spell click should proceed
    and returns a boolean indicating success or failure of the interaction.
  parameters:
  - name: clicker
    description: The unit that is initiating the spell click action. This could be
      a player or NPC that triggers the spell click mechanism.
  - name: seatId
    description: The seat ID where the spell click occurs, typically indicating which
      seat the spell should be applied to. Negative values may indicate specific conditions
      or positions.
  - name: spellId
    description: The spell ID that is being triggered by the spell click action. This
      determines which spell will be cast on the target unit.
  - name: flags
    description: Additional flags that control how the spell click should be processed,
      including various modifiers or conditions for the interaction.
  - name: spellClickInfo
    description: Optional pointer to a SpellClickInfo structure that contains additional
      information about the spell click behavior and conditions. This may include
      specific requirements or constraints for the spell click.
  returns: Returns true if the spell click interaction was successful, false otherwise.
    The method returns false when the spell click cannot be processed due to invalid
    parameters, missing conditions, or other constraint issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Click Usage
    code: 'Unit* target = GetTarget();

      Unit* source = GetSource();

      bool result = source->HandleSpellClick(target, -1, 32540, 0, nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Spell Click with SpellClickInfo
    code: 'Unit* target = GetTarget();

      Unit* source = GetSource();

      SpellClickInfo info;

      info.spellId = 32540;

      info.seatId = 0;

      bool result = source->HandleSpellClick(target, 1, 32540, 0, &info);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with spell click mechanics that
    require specific seat positions or conditions. It may be called during player
    interaction with NPCs or other players where special abilities are involved. Performance
    considerations include checking for valid target and source units before calling
    this method.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without proper validation of
    the target and source units. Incorrect usage can lead to invalid interactions
    or crashes if the parameters are not properly handled. The seatId parameter must
    be carefully checked, as negative values may indicate special conditions that
    could cause issues.
