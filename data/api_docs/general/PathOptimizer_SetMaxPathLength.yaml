  class: PathOptimizer
  method: SetMaxPathLength
  signature: void PathOptimizer::SetMaxPathLength(float maxLength)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum allowed path length for path optimization calculations.
  description: The SetMaxPathLength method configures the upper limit on path length
    that the PathOptimizer will consider when computing optimal routes. This parameter
    directly affects pathfinding behavior by constraining how far the optimizer will
    search for a valid path, which can improve performance and prevent excessive computation
    for very long paths. The value is typically specified in game units (such as yards
    or meters) and influences both the accuracy and efficiency of path generation.
    This setting is particularly important in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment
    where pathfinding must balance between computational cost and path quality.
  parameters:
  - name: maxLength
    description: The maximum allowed path length in game units. Must be a positive
      floating-point value. Values less than or equal to zero will typically be ignored
      or result in default behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Path Length
    code: 'PathOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.SetMaxPathLength(50.0f); // Set maximum path length to 50 game units'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Path Optimizer for Performance
    code: 'PathOptimizer* pathFinder = new PathOptimizer();

      pathFinder->SetMaxPathLength(30.0f); // Limit path length to reduce CPU usage

      // Used in AI behavior where performance is critical'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state that affects pathfinding calculations.
    It should be called before initiating any pathfinding operations for consistent
    results. The maximum path length may impact the quality of paths returned, especially
    in complex environments with many obstacles.
  warnings: Setting this value too low may result in paths being cut off prematurely,
    leading to incomplete or suboptimal navigation. Setting it too high can cause
    performance degradation due to excessive computation. Ensure this value is appropriate
    for your specific use case and environment.
