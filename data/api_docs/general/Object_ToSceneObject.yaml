documentation:
  brief: Converts an Object to a SceneObject pointer, returning the scene object representation
    of the object.
  description: The ToSceneObject method serves as a type conversion function that
    allows developers to access the SceneObject-specific properties and methods from
    a generic Object instance. This is particularly useful when working with objects
    that are part of the scene system in TrinityCore, such as game objects or creatures
    objects that have been initialized within the scene context. The method acts as
    a safe cast, ensuring that only objects which are actually SceneObjects are returned,
    preventing potential runtime errors or undefined behavior when dealing with scene-specific
    functionality. This conversion is essential for accessing scene-related data and
    methods without having to perform explicit type checking.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the SceneObject if the Object instance represents
    a scene object; otherwise returns nullptr if the Object does not represent a scene
    object. The returned pointer can be used to access scene-specific properties and
    methods, such as those related to scene positioning, visual effects, or scene-based
    interactions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic SceneObject Access
    code: "SceneObject* sceneObj = obj->ToSceneObject();\nif (sceneObj)\n{\n    //\
      \ Use sceneObj for scene-specific operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: SceneObject with Conditional Check
    code: "const SceneObject* sceneObj = obj->ToSceneObject();\nif (sceneObj != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Perform scene-specific operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other scene-related APIs
    and should be used carefully when dealing with objects that may not be scene objects.
    Performance considerations are minimal as the method simply performs a type check,
    but it's important to ensure that the object being converted is actually a SceneObject
    to avoid null pointer dereferences.
  warnings: This method should only be called on objects known to be SceneObjects;
    otherwise it will return nullptr. Using this method on non-scene objects may lead
    to undefined behavior or runtime errors if the returned pointer is used without
    checking for null.
