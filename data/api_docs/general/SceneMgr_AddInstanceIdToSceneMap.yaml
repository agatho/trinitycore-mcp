  class: SceneMgr
  method: AddInstanceIdToSceneMap
  signature: void SceneMgr::AddInstanceIdToSceneMap(uint32 sceneInstanceID, const
    SceneTemplate * sceneTemplate)
documentation:
  brief: Associates a scene instance ID with its corresponding scene template in the
    manager's internal map.
  description: The AddInstanceIdToSceneMap method registers a mapping between a unique
    scene instance identifier and its associated scene template within the SceneMgr.
    This allows the system to quickly retrieve scene template data when given an instance
    ID, which is essential for managing dynamic scenes such as those used in quests,
    events, or cinematic sequences. The method is typically invoked during scene creation
    or loading phases to maintain consistency between instance identifiers and their
    respective templates. It's important to note that this method does not validate
    whether the provided sceneInstanceID or sceneTemplate are valid; it simply stores
    the association.
  parameters:
  - name: sceneInstanceID
    description: A unique identifier for a specific scene instance. This ID is used
      to reference the scene during runtime and must be distinct within the context
      of active scenes.
  - name: sceneTemplate
    description: Pointer to the SceneTemplate object that defines the properties and
      behavior of the scene. Must not be null, as it represents the blueprint for
      the scene instance being added.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'SceneMgr* mgr = SceneMgr::Instance();

      SceneTemplate* templatePtr = sSceneMgr->GetSceneTemplate(12345);

      uint32 instanceId = 67890;

      mgr->AddInstanceIdToSceneMap(instanceId, templatePtr);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of an internal mapping system used by the SceneMgr to
    efficiently manage scene instances. It should only be called after verifying that
    both parameters are valid and non-null. The underlying map structure is assumed
    to be thread-safe, but direct access or modification outside of this method may
    lead to race conditions.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null sceneTemplate pointer will likely cause
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure all inputs are validated before calling
    this function. Also, avoid duplicate instance IDs as they can overwrite existing
    mappings and lead to unexpected results.
