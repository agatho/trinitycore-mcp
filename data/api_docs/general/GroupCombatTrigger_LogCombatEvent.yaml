  class: GroupCombatTrigger
  method: LogCombatEvent
  signature: void GroupCombatTrigger::LogCombatEvent(const std::string & event, Player
    * bot, Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Logs a combat event involving a bot player and target unit to the group's
    combat log.
  description: The LogCombatEvent method records specific combat-related actions within
    a group context. It takes an event description string, a reference to the bot
    player involved in the action, and a pointer to the target unit. This function
    is typically used by AI systems or combat modules to track and analyze combat
    behavior for strategic decision-making or logging purposes. The method does not
    return any value but contributes to maintaining internal group combat state tracking.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: A descriptive string indicating the type of combat event that occurred
      (e.g., 'attacked', 'killed', 'missed').
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot involved in the
      combat event. Must not be null.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that was targeted during the combat event.
      May be null if no target exists.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of LogCombatEvent
    code: 'GroupCombatTrigger trigger;

      Player* myBot = ...; // Assume valid player pointer

      Unit* enemyTarget = ...; // Assume valid unit pointer

      trigger.LogCombatEvent("attacked", myBot, enemyTarget);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging a kill event with null target
    code: 'GroupCombatTrigger trigger;

      Player* myBot = ...;

      trigger.LogCombatEvent("killed", myBot, nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of an AI or combat system module within TrinityCore.
    It may interact with internal logging systems or group state tracking mechanisms.
    Ensure that the bot and target pointers are valid before calling to avoid undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null bot pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Always validate input parameters before invoking LogCombatEvent.
