documentation:
  brief: Initializes class-specific interrupt handling for player abilities and spells
    in the game.
  description: The LoadClassSpecificInterrupts method is responsible for loading and
    setting up interrupt rules that are specific to different player classes within
    the TrinityCore framework. This method ensures that each class's unique interrupt
    mechanics, such as spell interrupts, movement interrupts, and ability cancellations,
    are properly configured and registered with the game's interrupt management system.
    It typically reads from configuration files or database entries to determine which
    abilities can interrupt others based on class restrictions and game balance requirements.
    The method is called during server initialization or when a new class-specific
    interrupt configuration needs to be loaded.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'InterruptManager interruptMgr;

      interruptMgr.LoadClassSpecificInterrupts();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server startup or when class-specific
    interrupt data needs to be reloaded. It is typically invoked by the core server
    initialization process and may involve database queries or file parsing operations
    that could impact performance if called frequently.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    duplicate interrupt entries or memory leaks. Ensure that any existing interrupt
    configurations are properly cleared before reloading new ones.
