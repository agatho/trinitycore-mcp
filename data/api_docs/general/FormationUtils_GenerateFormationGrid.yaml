  class: FormationUtils
  method: GenerateFormationGrid
  signature: int FormationUtils::GenerateFormationGrid(const int & center, uint32
    rows, uint32 columns, float spacing)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a grid-based formation around a specified center point for creature
    positioning.
  description: The GenerateFormationGrid method creates a structured grid layout of
    positions around a given center coordinate, typically used for grouping creatures
    or objects in a tactical formation. It calculates row and column positions based
    on the provided spacing parameter, allowing for precise placement of multiple
    entities in a battlefield or encounter scenario. The method is commonly utilized
    in AI behavior scripting and encounter design to position mobs in formations such
    as lines, squares, or rectangular grids. This functionality supports dynamic formation
    generation during combat encounters or scripted events.
  parameters:
  - name: center
    description: Reference point (GUID or identifier) that serves as the center of
      the formation grid. This is typically a creature or object that defines where
      the formation should be anchored.
  - name: rows
    description: Number of rows to generate in the grid formation. Must be a positive
      integer value, typically 1 or greater.
  - name: columns
    description: Number of columns to generate in the grid formation. Must be a positive
      integer value, typically 1 or greater.
  - name: spacing
    description: Distance between each position in the grid. This defines how far
      apart creatures or objects will be placed from one another in the formation.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success status of the operation.
    A return value of 0 typically indicates success, while negative values may indicate
    errors such as invalid parameters or insufficient memory allocation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Formation Generation
    code: int result = FormationUtils::GenerateFormationGrid(12345, 3, 4, 2.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Square Formation with Default Spacing
    code: int result = FormationUtils::GenerateFormationGrid(playerGuid, 2, 2, 1.5f);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal pathfinding and positioning systems
    within TrinityCore to ensure valid placement of entities. The grid generation
    may be influenced by terrain constraints or collision detection. Performance is
    generally efficient for small formations but could become significant with large
    grids.
  warnings: Ensure that the center parameter refers to a valid entity in the world,
    otherwise the method may fail or produce unexpected results. Large values for
    rows/columns can result in excessive memory usage or performance degradation.
