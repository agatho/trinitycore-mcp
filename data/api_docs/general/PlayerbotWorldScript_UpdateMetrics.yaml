  method: UpdateMetrics
  signature: void PlayerbotWorldScript::UpdateMetrics(uint32 updateTime)
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal metrics and tracking data for player bot behavior analysis
  description: The UpdateMetrics method is responsible for collecting and processing
    performance-related data from player bots within the TrinityCore world environment.
    This method typically runs at regular intervals to gather statistics about bot
    activities, decision-making patterns, and resource usage. It helps in optimizing
    bot behavior, identifying performance bottlenecks, and maintaining accurate analytics
    for AI development and testing purposes. The method operates on a time-based update
    cycle where it processes the elapsed time since last update to calculate relevant
    metrics.
  parameters:
  - name: updateTime
    description: The time interval in milliseconds since the last update cycle. This
      parameter determines how much time has passed since the previous metrics collection,
      allowing for accurate calculation of rates and averages.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 currentTime = getMSTime();\n    static uint32\
      \ lastUpdate = 0;\n    uint32 deltaTime = currentTime - lastUpdate;\n    \n\
      \    if (deltaTime >= MIN_UPDATE_INTERVAL)\n    {\n        playerbotWorldScript->UpdateMetrics(deltaTime);\n\
      \        lastUpdate = currentTime;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game update loop and should
    not be invoked directly by other systems. The implementation may perform heavy
    computations during metric collection, so it's recommended to call this method
    only when necessary to avoid performance impact.
  warnings: Calling UpdateMetrics too frequently can cause performance degradation
    due to intensive data processing. Ensure that the update interval is appropriate
    for your system requirements and that the method doesn't block other critical
    game operations.
