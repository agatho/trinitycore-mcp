documentation:
  brief: Destroys a SpawnedPoolData object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the SpawnedPoolData class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were managed by this object.
    In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, SpawnedPoolData typically
    represents data related to spawned game objects or creatures within a specific
    pool system. This destructor ensures proper cleanup when the object goes out of
    scope or is explicitly deleted, preventing memory leaks and maintaining the integrity
    of the server's resource management. The destruction process may involve removing
    references from internal tracking structures, notifying other systems of the object's
    removal, and releasing any held locks or resources.
  parameters: []
  returns: void

  - title: Basic Object Destruction
    code: 'SpawnedPoolData* poolData = new SpawnedPoolData();

      // ... use poolData ...

      delete poolData; // Triggers ~SpawnedPoolData()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically invoked when a SpawnedPoolData object is
    destroyed. It's important to ensure that no other objects hold references to this
    instance after deletion, as accessing freed memory can lead to undefined behavior.
    The destructor should not throw exceptions to maintain exception safety.
