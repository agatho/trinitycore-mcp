  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: HandleFormationBreaks
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::HandleFormationBreaks(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the breaking of formations within a group during instance coordination.
  description: The HandleFormationBreaks method processes and manages the dissolution
    of group formations when players leave or are removed from an instance. This method
    ensures that group coordination state is properly updated, formation data is cleared,
    and any necessary cleanup operations are performed to maintain game consistency.
    It typically gets invoked when a player's group membership changes during instance
    encounters, such as when players are teleported out of an instance or when a group
    disbands. The method operates on the provided Group object to manage internal
    formation tracking and synchronization.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose formations need to be broken. This
      parameter must not be null and should represent an active group within an instance
      context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Breaking formations for a group during instance exit
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (playerGroup)\n{\n    instanceCoordination->HandleFormationBreaks(playerGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Group object passed to it is valid and actively
    participating in an instance. It may perform internal state updates and should
    be called only when formation data needs to be cleared or reset. The implementation
    likely involves iterating through group members and updating their formation tracking
    flags.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null Group pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the group is valid and has active formation data before
    invoking this method. Improper usage may lead to inconsistent group state or client-side
    issues.
