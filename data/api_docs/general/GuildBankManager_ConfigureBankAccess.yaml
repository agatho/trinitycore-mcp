documentation:
  brief: Configures access permissions for a guild bank tab for a specific rank.
  description: The ConfigureBankAccess method sets deposit and withdrawal permissions
    for a specified guild bank tab based on the rank of guild members. This function
    is used to control which ranks can deposit items into or withdraw items from a
    particular bank tab. The method operates within the context of World of Warcraft's
    guild banking system, allowing guild leaders to manage access controls granularly
    across different tabs and ranks.
  parameters:
  - name: guildId
    description: Unique identifier of the guild for which the bank access is being
      configured. Must correspond to an existing guild in the database.
  - name: rankId
    description: Identifier of the guild rank whose access permissions are being modified.
      Ranks typically range from 0 (Guild Master) to 9 (Initiate).
  - name: tabId
    description: Index of the bank tab for which access is being configured. Tab indices
      start at 0, with 0 usually representing the first tab.
  - name: canDeposit
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether members of the specified rank can
      deposit items into the given bank tab.
  - name: canWithdraw
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether members of the specified rank can
      withdraw items from the given bank tab.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Grant Deposit Access to Rank 1 for Tab 0
    code: GuildBankManager::ConfigureBankAccess(12345, 1, 0, true, false);
    language: cpp

    code: GuildBankManager::ConfigureBankAccess(12345, 0, 2, true, true);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal database records or in-memory structures
    that track guild bank permissions. It may trigger synchronization with the client
    to update UI elements showing tab access rights.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values such as invalid guildId, rankId, or tabId could
    lead to undefined behavior or database inconsistencies. Ensure all parameters
    are validated before calling this method.
