  class: ResourceManager
  method: GetOptimalResourceThreshold
  signature: uint32 ResourceManager::GetOptimalResourceThreshold(ResourceType type)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the optimal resource threshold value for a specified resource type.
  description: The GetOptimalResourceThreshold method returns the optimal threshold
    value for a given resource type, which is used internally by the ResourceManager
    to determine when resource allocation or management actions should be triggered.
    This value typically represents a balance point between resource efficiency and
    system performance. The method accesses internal configuration data that defines
    these thresholds based on game mechanics and system requirements. It does not
    modify any state and is intended for read-only access during gameplay operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the optimal threshold for the specified
    resource type. This value indicates the point at which resource management decisions
    are made, such as when to trigger resource regeneration or allocation adjustments.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve optimal threshold for mana resources
    code: 'uint32 manaThreshold = resourceManager->GetOptimalResourceThreshold(ResourceType::MANA);

      // Use manaThreshold to determine when to trigger mana regeneration logic'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with resource management systems
    that require dynamic threshold adjustments based on player activity or game state.
    The returned values are pre-configured and should not be modified directly by
    external code.
