  signature: uint32 EnergyComboResource::GetMax() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum energy combo points value for the resource
  description: The GetMax method retrieves the upper limit of energy combo points
    that can be accumulated for this resource. This value typically represents the
    maximum number of combo points a player can have before they are reset or consumed.
    The method is commonly used in conjunction with energy-based abilities such as
    those found in Rogue class specializations, where combo points are earned through
    specific actions and consumed to activate powerful abilities. The returned value
    remains constant for the lifetime of the resource unless modified by game mechanics
    or external effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of energy combo points that
    can be stored in this resource. This value typically corresponds to the maximum
    combo point cap for the associated class or ability system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 maxPoints = player->GetEnergyComboResource()->GetMax();

      printf("Maximum combo points: %u\n", maxPoints);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Resource Limits
    code: "EnergyComboResource* resource = player->GetEnergyComboResource();\nuint32\
      \ current = resource->GetCurrent();\nuint32 maximum = resource->GetMax();\n\
      if (current >= maximum) {\n    // Handle combo point overflow or reset\n   \
      \ printf(\"At maximum combo points\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in combat calculations and ability activation
    logic. The maximum value may vary depending on the player's class, talents, and
    equipped items that modify combo point generation or storage.
