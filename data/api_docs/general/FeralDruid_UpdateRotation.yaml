  method: UpdateRotation
  signature: void FeralDruid::UpdateRotation(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the feral druid's combat rotation based on current target and game
    state
  description: The UpdateRotation method is responsible for determining and executing
    the appropriate combat actions for a feral druid character during combat. This
    method evaluates the current target, player's resource levels (such as energy
    or combo points), and situational factors to decide which abilities should be
    used next in the rotation. It typically handles the logic for spell selection,
    ability prioritization, and execution order within the feral druid's combat routine.
    The method is called regularly during combat to ensure optimal gameplay performance
    and adherence to the druid's specialization-specific rotation mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the current combat target.
      This parameter determines which enemy the feral druid will focus its attacks
      on and influences ability selection based on target health, debuffs, and other
      combat conditions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat
    code: "void FeralDruidAI::Update()\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n    {\n    \
      \    UpdateRotation(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with target validation
    code: "void FeralDruidAI::Update()\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat() && target && target->IsAlive())\n\
      \    {\n        UpdateRotation(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the AI update loop and should not be
    invoked manually unless implementing custom behavior. The rotation logic may vary
    based on the druid's current form (cat, bear) and equipped gear. Performance considerations
    include avoiding unnecessary calculations when not in combat.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is valid and alive before calling this
    method to prevent undefined behavior. This method assumes the unit is already
    in combat state; calling it outside of combat may produce unexpected results.
