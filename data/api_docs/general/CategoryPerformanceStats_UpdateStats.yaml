  method: UpdateStats
  signature: void CategoryPerformanceStats::UpdateStats(const AIDecisionRecord & record)
documentation:
  brief: Updates performance statistics based on the provided AI decision record.
  description: The UpdateStats method processes an AIDecisionRecord to update internal
    performance metrics for a category. This method is typically invoked by the AI
    system to track decision-making efficiency and effectiveness. It analyzes the
    decision data, including execution time, success rates, and resource usage, to
    maintain accurate performance statistics that can be used for optimization or
    debugging purposes. The method does not return any value but modifies internal
    state variables within the CategoryPerformanceStats object.
  parameters:
  - name: record
    description: A const reference to an AIDecisionRecord containing AI decision data
      to be processed and used for updating performance statistics. This record typically
      includes timing information, decision outcomes, and associated resource consumption
      metrics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'CategoryPerformanceStats stats;

      AIDecisionRecord record;

      // Populate record with AI decision data

      stats.UpdateStats(record);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI System
    code: "void AIController::ProcessDecision(const AIDecisionRecord& decision) {\n\
      \    // ... AI logic ...\n    performance_stats_.UpdateStats(decision);\n  \
      \  // ... continue processing ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently during AI operation, so performance
    considerations are important. The implementation should avoid heavy computations
    or blocking operations. It's recommended to call this method only after collecting
    complete decision data to ensure accurate statistics.
  warnings: Calling UpdateStats with incomplete or malformed AIDecisionRecord data
    may lead to inconsistent or corrupted performance metrics. Ensure all required
    fields in the record are properly initialized before passing it to this method.
