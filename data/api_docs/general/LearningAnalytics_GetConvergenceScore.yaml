  method: GetConvergenceScore
  signature: float LearningAnalytics::GetConvergenceScore(uint32_t botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the convergence score for a specified bot based on
    learning analytics data.
  description: The GetConvergenceScore method computes a numerical convergence score
    for a given bot identified by its GUID. This score represents how well the bot's
    learning behavior aligns with expected patterns or benchmarks within the TrinityCore
    framework. The method likely aggregates various learning metrics such as training
    progress, performance consistency, and adaptation rates to determine this value.
    It is typically used in AI-driven gameplay systems where bot behavior needs to
    be monitored and optimized for realism or efficiency. The returned score is a
    floating-point value that can be used for comparative analysis or decision-making
    in automated game systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the convergence score of the specified bot.
    Higher values typically indicate better alignment with expected learning patterns,
    while lower values may suggest inconsistencies or suboptimal behavior. The exact
    scale and interpretation depend on internal implementation details of the LearningAnalytics
    system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LearningAnalytics* analytics = sWorld->GetLearningAnalytics();

      float score = analytics->GetConvergenceScore(12345);

      printf("Bot convergence score: %.2f\n", score);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely computationally intensive as it involves processing
    multiple learning metrics. It should be called judiciously in performance-critical
    sections of code. The convergence score may vary based on the bot's training history
    and current learning state.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid corresponds to an active and properly
    initialized bot, otherwise the method may return unexpected or invalid results.
    This method might not be thread-safe if accessed from multiple threads simultaneously
    without proper synchronization.
