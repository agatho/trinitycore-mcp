  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: CheckTerrainBlocking
  signature: bool LineOfSightManager::CheckTerrainBlocking(const int & from, const
    int & to)
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether terrain blocks line of sight between two points in the game
    world.
  description: The CheckTerrainBlocking method determines if there is any terrain
    obstruction between two specified points in the World of Warcraft world. This
    function is typically used for spell casting, NPC behavior, and AI decision-making
    to ensure that actions can be performed or observed through clear paths. It evaluates
    the spatial relationship between the 'from' and 'to' coordinates, taking into
    account height differences, terrain features, and other environmental obstacles.
    The method returns true if the path between these points is blocked by terrain,
    and false if it is unobstructed. This check is crucial for gameplay mechanics
    such as determining whether a character can see another, cast spells on targets,
    or move through certain areas without interference.
  parameters:
  - name: from
    description: The starting point coordinate for the line of sight check. This represents
      the x or y position in world coordinates.
  - name: to
    description: The ending point coordinate for the line of sight check. This represents
      the x or y position in world coordinates.
  returns: Returns true if terrain blocks the line of sight between the 'from' and
    'to' points; returns false if no terrain obstruction exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for terrain blockage
    code: "bool isBlocked = LineOfSightManager::CheckTerrainBlocking(100, 200);\n\
      if (isBlocked) {\n    // Handle case where line of sight is blocked\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Line of sight is blocked by terrain.\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Proceed with actions that require clear line of sight\n    std::cout << \"\
      Line of sight is clear.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs spatial calculations using the game's internal
    terrain data structures. It may be optimized for performance by caching previous
    results or using spatial partitioning techniques. The implementation might also
    consider elevation changes and height maps to accurately determine if an obstruction
    exists.
  warnings: Be aware that this function only checks for terrain blocking and does
    not account for other potential obstructions such as NPCs, objects, or environmental
    effects. Ensure that additional checks are performed if those factors need to
    be considered for complete line of sight evaluation.
