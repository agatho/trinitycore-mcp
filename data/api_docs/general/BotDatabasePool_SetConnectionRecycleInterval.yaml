  class: BotDatabasePool
  method: SetConnectionRecycleInterval
  signature: void BotDatabasePool::SetConnectionRecycleInterval(int interval)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the interval at which database connections in the bot pool are recycled.
  description: The SetConnectionRecycleInterval method configures how frequently database
    connections managed by the BotDatabasePool are closed and reopened. This mechanism
    helps prevent connection timeouts, reduces memory leaks from long-lived connections,
    and ensures that stale connections are periodically refreshed. The interval is
    specified in seconds, with a value of zero disabling automatic recycling. This
    functionality is particularly important for long-running bot systems that maintain
    persistent database connections to avoid connection drops due to server-side timeouts
    or resource constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: interval
    description: The recycle interval in seconds. A value of 0 disables automatic
      recycling. Positive values specify how often connections should be recycled.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable connection recycling every 300 seconds
    code: BotDatabasePool::instance().SetConnectionRecycleInterval(300);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable automatic connection recycling
    code: BotDatabasePool::instance().SetConnectionRecycleInterval(0);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects all database connections managed by the BotDatabasePool
    instance. The recycling process is handled asynchronously to minimize performance
    impact on active bot operations. Changes take effect immediately for new connections,
    but existing connections will continue using their current lifecycle until they
    are closed and reopened.
  warnings: Setting the interval too low may cause excessive connection overhead and
    performance degradation. Setting it too high may result in connection timeouts
    or stale connections being used. Ensure that database servers can handle the frequency
    of connection opens/closes without impacting overall system stability.
