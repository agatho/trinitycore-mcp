  signature: void CombatBehaviorIntegration::OnCombatStart()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes combat behavior when an NPC enters combat mode
  description: The OnCombatStart method is invoked when a creature or NPC begins combat,
    typically triggered by aggro events or direct player interaction. This method
    serves as the entry point for custom combat logic and behavior implementations
    within the CombatBehaviorIntegration class. It initializes necessary state variables,
    registers combat-related callbacks, and prepares the AI for active combat engagement.
    The method is automatically called by the TrinityCore framework during combat
    initiation and should not be invoked manually unless implementing custom AI logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Combat Start Implementation
    code: "class MyCombatBehavior : public CombatBehaviorIntegration {\npublic:\n\
      \    void OnCombatStart() override {\n        // Custom combat initialization\
      \ logic\n        SendChatMessage(\"I'm ready for battle!\");\n        SetMeleeAttack(true);\n\
      \        // Additional combat setup\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called on the main game thread and should avoid heavy computations
    or blocking operations. It's recommended to defer complex logic to a separate
    task queue if performance is a concern. The method is part of the AI event system
    and integrates with TrinityCore's combat state management.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from custom code unless you understand
    the underlying framework mechanics, as it may lead to inconsistent AI states or
    unexpected behavior. Avoid performing database operations or sending packets that
    could cause race conditions in this method.
