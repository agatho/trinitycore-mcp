documentation:
  brief: Checks if the strategy is currently active for the given bot AI instance
  description: The IsActive method determines whether a specific strategy is currently
    enabled and applicable for use within the bot's AI system. This method evaluates
    internal state flags or conditions to decide if the strategy should be considered
    active. It is commonly used during AI decision-making processes to filter out
    inactive strategies before applying them. The method does not modify any state
    but purely performs a read-only check on the strategy's activation status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the strategy is currently active and can be used by the
    AI system, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision logic
    code: "if (strategy->IsActive(ai)) {\n    // Execute strategy actions\n    strategy->Execute(ai);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking multiple strategies for activation
    code: "for (auto& strat : ai->GetStrategies()) {\n    if (strat->IsActive(ai))\
      \ {\n        LOG_DEBUG(\"AI\", \"Strategy {} is active and will be executed.\"\
      , strat->GetName());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically relies on internal flags or configuration settings
    that determine strategy activation. It may be called frequently during AI processing
    loops, so performance should be considered in high-frequency scenarios.
