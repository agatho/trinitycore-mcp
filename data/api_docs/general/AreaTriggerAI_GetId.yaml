  class: AreaTriggerAI
  method: GetId
  signature: uint32 AreaTriggerAI::GetId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the area trigger AI instance.
  description: The GetId method retrieves the unique 32-bit identifier associated
    with the AreaTriggerAI instance. This identifier is typically used to distinguish
    between different area triggers within the game world, allowing for targeted operations
    such as activation, deactivation, or event handling. The returned ID corresponds
    to the area trigger's entry in the database and is essential for linking AI behavior
    to specific game objects. This method is commonly called during area trigger events
    or when managing multiple area triggers simultaneously.
  parameters: []
  returns: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the unique identifier of the area
    trigger AI instance. This ID matches the area trigger's entry in the database
    and serves as a key for identifying specific triggers within the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve area trigger ID
    code: "void MyAreaTriggerHandler(AreaTriggerAI* ai)\n{\n    uint32 triggerId =\
      \ ai->GetId();\n    // Use triggerId for further processing\n    if (triggerId\
      \ == 12345)\n    {\n        // Handle specific area trigger\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned ID is assigned at the time of area trigger creation and remains
    constant throughout its lifetime. This method is thread-safe as it only reads
    a stored value without modifying any state.
