  class: MovementIntegration
  method: IsPositionSafe
  signature: bool MovementIntegration::IsPositionSafe(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a given position is safe for movement within the game world
  description: The IsPositionSafe method evaluates whether a specified position in
    the game world is considered safe for character movement. It typically checks
    for obstacles, terrain restrictions, and other environmental factors that might
    prevent or impede movement. This method is commonly used by AI systems, pathfinding
    algorithms, and movement validation logic to ensure characters can navigate the
    game world without getting stuck or entering invalid areas. The method returns
    true if the position is deemed safe, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer representing a position identifier or index within the
      movement system. This could correspond to a specific coordinate, node in a pathfinding
      graph, or a predefined location in the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is safe for movement, false otherwise.
    A return value of false indicates that the position may be blocked by obstacles,
    invalid terrain, or other movement restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to validate a movement position
    code: "if (movementIntegration.IsPositionSafe(12345)) {\n    // Proceed with movement\
      \ to position 12345\n    player->MoveToPosition(12345);\n} else {\n    // Find\
      \ an alternative path\n    player->FindAlternativePath();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs collision detection and terrain validation checks
    internally. It may cache previous results for performance optimization, especially
    in high-frequency movement scenarios. The exact implementation details depend
    on how positions are represented within the MovementIntegration class.
  warnings: Ensure that the position parameter is valid before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. If positions are dynamically generated or derived
    from external sources, validate them against expected ranges or formats before
    passing to IsPositionSafe.
