  class: HealInfo
  method: GetSchoolMask
  signature: int HealInfo::GetSchoolMask() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the school mask associated with the heal information.
  description: The GetSchoolMask method returns an integer value representing the
    magic school mask of the healing effect. In World of Warcraft's context, school
    masks define the type of damage or healing (e.g., physical, holy, fire, nature).
    This value is used internally by the game engine to determine how the heal interacts
    with various mechanics such as resistances, absorption effects, and spell school
    interactions. The returned mask can be combined with other masks using bitwise
    operations to represent multiple schools. This method is typically called during
    healing calculations or when processing heal events in the combat system.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the school mask of the heal. Common values
    include SPELL_SCHOOL_MASK_NORMAL (0x01), SPELL_SCHOOL_MASK_HOLY (0x02), SPELL_SCHOOL_MASK_FIRE
    (0x04), etc., or combinations of these using bitwise OR operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "HealInfo healInfo;\n// ... populate healInfo with relevant data ...\nint\
      \ schoolMask = healInfo.GetSchoolMask();\nif (schoolMask & SPELL_SCHOOL_MASK_HOLY)\n\
      {\n    // This heal is of the holy school\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Schools
    code: "HealInfo healInfo;\n// ... populate healInfo with relevant data ...\nint\
      \ schoolMask = healInfo.GetSchoolMask();\nif (schoolMask & (SPELL_SCHOOL_MASK_HOLY\
      \ | SPELL_SCHOOL_MASK_FROST))\n{\n    // This heal includes holy or frost schools\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The school mask returned by this method is typically set during the initialization
    of HealInfo objects and reflects the magical school of the healing effect. Developers
    should be aware that the mask may represent multiple schools when combined using
    bitwise operations, which is common for certain spells or abilities that affect
    multiple damage types.
