documentation:
  brief: Analyzes combat trends and updates internal state based on recent combat
    events
  description: The AnalyzeCombatTrends method processes recent combat data to identify
    patterns and trends in player or creature behavior during combat. It evaluates
    damage dealt, received, ability usage, and other combat metrics to determine combat
    state changes and update the analyzer's internal tracking mechanisms. This method
    is typically invoked during combat updates or at regular intervals to maintain
    accurate combat trend analysis for AI decision making or statistical reporting.
    The method does not require any specific preconditions but assumes that combat
    data has been previously collected and stored within the class.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Combat Trend Analysis
    code: 'CombatStateAnalyzer analyzer;

      analyzer.AnalyzeCombatTrends();

      // Updates internal combat trend data based on recent events'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during active combat to maintain accurate
    trend analysis. The implementation likely processes cached combat events and may
    have performance implications if called too frequently without proper throttling.
