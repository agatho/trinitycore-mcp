  class: Unit
  method: ProcessPositionDataChanged
  signature: void Unit::ProcessPositionDataChanged(const int & data)
documentation:
  brief: Processes position data changes for the unit, updating internal state and
    notifying relevant systems of movement updates.
  description: The ProcessPositionDataChanged method is responsible for handling updates
    to a Unit's position data within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically
    gets invoked when a unit's location, orientation, or movement state has been modified,
    ensuring that all subsystems aware of the unit are properly notified and updated
    accordingly. It plays a key role in maintaining synchronization between client-side
    and server-side representations of unit positions, particularly in scenarios involving
    movement, teleportation, or dynamic position adjustments during combat or gameplay
    events. The method may trigger updates to visibility systems, threat calculations,
    and other mechanics that depend on accurate positional data.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: An integer value representing the type or identifier of the position
      data change that occurred. This parameter likely encodes information about which
      specific aspect of the unit's position has changed (e.g., x/y/z coordinates,
      orientation, movement flags). The exact interpretation depends on internal protocol
      definitions within TrinityCore.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Movement Handler
    code: "void OnUnitMove(Unit* unit, int positionChangeType)\n{\n    unit->ProcessPositionDataChanged(positionChangeType);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Movement Logic
    code: "class MyMovementSystem\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateUnitPosition(Unit* target,\
      \ float newX, float newY, float newZ)\n    {\n        target->SetPosition(newX,\
      \ newY, newZ);\n        target->ProcessPositionDataChanged(1); // Indicates\
      \ full position update\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core engine when position-related
    events occur. Developers should not generally invoke this method directly unless
    implementing custom movement or position handling logic. The internal implementation
    likely involves updating spatial partitioning systems, recalculating visibility
    for nearby players, and notifying AI subsystems of positional changes.
  warnings: Direct invocation of ProcessPositionDataChanged without proper context
    may lead to inconsistent state or unexpected behavior in the game world. Ensure
    that all related movement flags and position data are correctly set before calling
    this method.
