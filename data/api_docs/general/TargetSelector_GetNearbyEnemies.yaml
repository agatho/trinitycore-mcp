  method: GetNearbyEnemies
  signature: int TargetSelector::GetNearbyEnemies(float range) const
documentation:
  brief: Counts and returns the number of nearby enemy units within the specified
    range.
  description: The GetNearbyEnemies method calculates and returns the total count
    of hostile units (enemies) that are currently within a given range around the
    target selector's position. This method is typically used in AI decision-making
    processes to evaluate threat levels or determine optimal targeting strategies.
    The range parameter defines the maximum distance at which enemies are considered
    'nearby'. Enemies are usually evaluated based on their faction, visibility, and
    combat state. This method does not modify any internal state and is generally
    used for situational awareness in NPC behavior scripts.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of nearby enemy units found within the
    specified range. Returns zero if no enemies are detected or if the range is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: int enemyCount = targetSelector.GetNearbyEnemies(10.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional AI Behavior
    code: "if (targetSelector.GetNearbyEnemies(25.0f) > 3)\n{\n    // Initiate defensive\
      \ stance or call for help\n    unit->SetReactState(REACT_DEFENSIVE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a spatial query using the underlying game engine's collision
    detection system. It may be computationally expensive if called frequently in
    tight loops. The range parameter is typically measured in yards, and the method
    considers only units that are visible and not dead or invulnerable.
  warnings: The method assumes that the target selector has a valid position and faction
    context. Calling this method on an uninitialized or invalid target selector may
    lead to undefined behavior. Additionally, enemy detection might be affected by
    line of sight restrictions and unit stealth states.
