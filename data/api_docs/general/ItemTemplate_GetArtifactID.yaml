  signature: uint8 ItemTemplate::GetArtifactID() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the artifact ID associated with the item template.
  description: The GetArtifactID method returns the unique identifier for an artifact
    item as defined in the item template. This ID is used internally by TrinityCore
    to associate items with specific artifact properties, abilities, and progression
    mechanics. The returned value corresponds to the ArtifactID field from the item_template
    database table and is essential for determining whether an item qualifies as an
    artifact and what type of artifact it represents. This method does not perform
    any validation or lookup operations; it simply returns the pre-loaded artifact
    ID from the item template data structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the artifact ID assigned to this item template.
    A value of 0 typically indicates that the item is not an artifact, while non-zero
    values correspond to specific artifact types defined in the game's database or
    configuration files.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Artifact Status
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(itemId);\nif (itemTemplate->GetArtifactID()\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // This item is an artifact\n    printf(\"Item is artifact with\
      \ ID: %u\\n\", itemTemplate->GetArtifactID());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Artifact ID for Conditional Logic
    code: "uint8 artifactId = itemTemplate->GetArtifactID();\nswitch (artifactId)\n\
      {\n    case 1:\n        // Handle artifact type 1\n        break;\n    case\
      \ 2:\n        // Handle artifact type 2\n        break;\n    default:\n    \
      \    // Not an artifact or unknown artifact type\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses pre-loaded data from the item template cache and is
    therefore fast. The artifact ID is set during server startup when loading item
    templates from the database and remains constant for the lifetime of the server
    process. Developers should be aware that this value may be zero for non-artifact
    items, which is a valid state indicating no artifact association.
  warnings: Ensure that the ItemTemplate pointer is valid before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. While the method itself is safe, calling it on a
    null or improperly initialized template can lead to crashes or incorrect results.
