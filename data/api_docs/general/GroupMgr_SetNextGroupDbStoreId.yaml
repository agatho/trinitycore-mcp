  signature: void GroupMgr::SetNextGroupDbStoreId(int storageId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the next database storage ID to be used for group-related data persistence.
  description: The SetNextGroupDbStoreId method configures the internal counter that
    determines the next unique identifier to be assigned when storing group information
    in the database. This is typically used during server initialization or when managing
    group data to ensure proper sequential assignment of database keys. The method
    does not perform any database operations itself but updates an internal state
    variable that will be utilized by subsequent group storage mechanisms. It's important
    to note that this method should generally be called before any group data is persisted
    to the database to maintain consistency in the ID sequence.
  parameters:
  - name: storageId
    description: The integer value representing the next database storage ID to be
      used for group records. This value should typically be a positive integer greater
      than or equal to zero, and represents the starting point for sequential database
      key assignment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Next Group Database Store ID
    code: 'GroupMgr* groupMgr = sGroupMgr;

      groupMgr->SetNextGroupDbStoreId(1000); // Sets next group DB ID to 1000'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Group Manager with Custom Starting ID
    code: 'GroupMgr* groupMgr = sGroupMgr;

      uint32 startingId = sWorld->getIntConfig(CONFIG_GROUP_DB_ID_START);

      groupMgr->SetNextGroupDbStoreId(startingId); // Initialize with world config
      value'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server startup or database initialization
    phases. The internal state change is immediate and affects subsequent group creation
    operations. It's recommended to call this method before any group data is actually
    stored in the database to prevent ID conflicts.
  warnings: Calling this method after groups have already been created and persisted
    may lead to database ID conflicts or inconsistent state. Ensure that this method
    is called only during initialization or when it's safe to modify the ID sequence
    without affecting existing data.
