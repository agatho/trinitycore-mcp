documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the aura ID associated with a specific pet entry.
  description: The GetAura method retrieves the unique aura identifier (ID) that is
    linked to a given pet entry. This method is typically used in the context of pet
    management within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, where different pets
    may have specific auras applied to them for various game mechanics such as buffs,
    debuffs, or visual effects. The method takes a pet entry ID as input and returns
    the corresponding aura ID that should be applied to that pet. It is commonly used
    in pet AI logic, spell effects, or when managing pet states and behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the aura ID associated with the specified
    pet entry. If no aura is found for the given pet entry, it may return 0 or a default
    value indicating no aura is applied.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 auraId = petAura->GetAura(12345);\nif (auraId != 0)\n{\n    // Apply\
      \ the aura to the pet\n    pet->AddAura(auraId, pet);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Aura Existence
    code: "uint32 petEntry = player->GetPet()->GetEntry();\nuint32 auraId = petAura->GetAura(petEntry);\n\
      if (auraId > 0)\n{\n    // Pet has an associated aura\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"pet\"\
      , \"Pet {} has aura ID {}\", petEntry, auraId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No aura\
      \ associated with this pet\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"pet\", \"No aura found for pet entry\
      \ {}\", petEntry);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a lookup table or database system that maps
    pet entries to their respective auras. It's important to note that the returned
    aura ID should be validated before use, as invalid IDs may cause issues with spell
    application or visual effects. The method is expected to be fast and efficient
    since it's used in performance-critical pet AI systems.
  warnings: Ensure that the pet entry passed to this method is valid and exists in
    the game database. Passing an invalid or non-existent pet entry could result in
    unexpected behavior or return values. Additionally, always verify that the returned
    aura ID is valid before attempting to apply it to a pet.
