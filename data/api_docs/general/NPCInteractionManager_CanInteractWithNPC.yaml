  signature: bool NPCInteractionManager::CanInteractWithNPC(Creature * npc) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can interact with a specified NPC creature.
  description: The CanInteractWithNPC method evaluates if the current player character
    is able to initiate interaction with the given Creature object. This check typically
    considers factors such as distance, faction relationships, quest status, and NPC
    flags that determine visibility or accessibility. The method is commonly used
    in interaction logic to prevent invalid interactions or to gate access to certain
    NPCs based on game state conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player can interact with the specified NPC; otherwise
    returns false. This includes checks for proximity, faction compatibility, quest
    requirements, and other game-specific restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interaction Check
    code: "if (interactionManager.CanInteractWithNPC(npc)) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ interaction logic\n    npc->OnGossipHello(player);\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ invalid interaction attempt\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"You cannot interact\
      \ with this NPC.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often called before initiating gossip or quest interactions
    to ensure the player meets all necessary conditions for engagement. It may internally
    perform distance checks and faction validation.
