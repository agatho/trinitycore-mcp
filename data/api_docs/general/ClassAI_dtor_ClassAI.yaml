documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AI instance and performs cleanup operations for the associated
    creature or unit.
  description: The ClassAI destructor is responsible for cleaning up resources and
    releasing memory associated with an AI instance. When a creature or unit's AI
    is destroyed, this method ensures that all dynamically allocated data, internal
    references, and any registered callbacks are properly released. This is typically
    called automatically by the game engine when the creature or unit is removed from
    the world or when its AI component is replaced. The destructor may also handle
    cleanup of AI-specific state information such as target tracking, movement paths,
    or behavior flags.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction during creature removal
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      // When creature is removed from world

      // ClassAI destructor is automatically called

      // Cleanup of AI resources happens here'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the game engine and should not be
    invoked manually. It's important to ensure that all derived AI classes properly
    implement their own destructors to clean up any additional resources they may
    have allocated.
