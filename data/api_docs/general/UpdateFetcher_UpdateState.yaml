  signature: void UpdateFetcher::UpdateState(const std::string & name, const State
    state) const
documentation:
  brief: Updates the state of a specified fetcher by name with the provided state
    value.
  description: The UpdateState method is used to modify or set the current state of
    a specific UpdateFetcher instance identified by its name. This method allows for
    dynamic state management within the game's update system, enabling components
    to track and respond to various operational states such as idle, active, paused,
    or error conditions. The method takes a constant reference to a string identifying
    the fetcher and a State enum value representing the new state to be applied. It
    is typically used in conjunction with other update-related systems to ensure proper
    synchronization and state transitions across different game subsystems.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A constant reference to a string that uniquely identifies the UpdateFetcher
      instance whose state will be updated. This name should correspond to an existing
      fetcher in the system.
  - name: state
    description: The new State value to assign to the identified UpdateFetcher. The
      State enum typically represents discrete operational conditions such as IDLE,
      RUNNING, PAUSED, or ERROR.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'UpdateFetcher fetcher;

      fetcher.UpdateState("PlayerDataFetcher", State::RUNNING);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Multiple Fetchers
    code: 'UpdateFetcher fetcher;

      fetcher.UpdateState("QuestDataFetcher", State::PAUSED);

      fetcher.UpdateState("AchievementDataFetcher", State::ERROR);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger update management system in TrinityCore
    where multiple fetchers operate concurrently. The const keyword on the method
    signature indicates that it does not modify the UpdateFetcher object itself, but
    may modify internal state tracking structures. Ensure that the name parameter
    corresponds to an existing fetcher to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or non-existent name string could result in undefined
    behavior or silent failures. The State enum must be properly defined and compatible
    with the expected values within the system. Avoid calling this method from multiple
    threads without proper synchronization mechanisms.
