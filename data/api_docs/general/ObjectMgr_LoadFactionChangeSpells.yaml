  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadFactionChangeSpells()
documentation:
  brief: Loads faction change spell data from the database into memory for use in
    character faction transitions.
  description: The LoadFactionChangeSpells method initializes and populates internal
    data structures with faction change spell information retrieved from the database.
    This method is typically called during server startup or reload operations to
    ensure that all faction transition spells are available for player character modifications.
    It processes records related to faction changes, including associated spells,
    requirements, and restrictions. The loaded data supports the functionality where
    players can change their faction through specific spells or quests, with proper
    validation and enforcement of rules defined in the database.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: ObjectMgr::instance()->LoadFactionChangeSpells();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    reloading faction data. It accesses the database and may cause performance overhead
    during execution. The method assumes that the database connection is already established
    and that the relevant tables contain valid faction change spell records.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    duplicate entries in internal data structures. Ensure that no active character
    operations are occurring when invoking this method, as it modifies global state.
