documentation:
  brief: Handles changes to target icons within the group coordination system
  description: The OnTargetIconChanged method is invoked when a group member's target
    icon status is updated. This method processes the change event and updates internal
    group state accordingly. It typically occurs when players target enemies or objects,
    or when target icons are cleared from the group interface. The method ensures
    that all group members receive synchronized updates about target icon changes,
    maintaining consistency in group coordination mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: A GroupEvent structure containing details about the target icon change,
      including the player who triggered the event and the new icon state
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Processing a target icon change event
    code: "void MyGroupHandler::HandleTargetIconChange(const GroupEvent& event)\n\
      {\n    groupCoordinator.OnTargetIconChanged(event);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    target icon events are detected. Developers should not directly invoke this method
    unless implementing custom group coordination logic.
