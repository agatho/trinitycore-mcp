  signature: void QuestCompletion::RecoverFromObjectiveFailure(Player * bot, QuestObjectiveData
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to recover a bot's quest progress from an objective failure state.
  description: The RecoverFromObjectiveFailure method is designed to restore a player
    bot's quest completion status when it has previously failed to meet an objective
    requirement. This functionality allows the bot to retry or re-attempt quest objectives
    that may have been temporarily unmet due to environmental conditions, timing issues,
    or other transient factors. The method operates on a specified quest objective
    data structure and modifies the bot's internal quest state accordingly. It is
    typically invoked during quest handling logic when the system detects that a previously
    failed objective might now be completable.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose quest progress
      needs recovery. Must not be null and must represent a valid player instance
      in the game world.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing information
      about the specific quest objective that failed. This includes objective type,
      progress status, and related data needed for recovery logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Quest Handling
    code: "void HandleQuestFailure(Player* bot, QuestObjectiveData& failedObjective)\
      \ {\n    // Attempt to recover from the objective failure\n    QuestCompletion::RecoverFromObjectiveFailure(bot,\
      \ failedObjective);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot AI Logic
    code: "void BotAI::ProcessQuestRecovery(Player* bot) {\n    for (auto& objective\
      \ : bot->GetActiveQuestObjectives()) {\n        if (objective.IsFailed()) {\n\
      \            QuestCompletion::RecoverFromObjectiveFailure(bot, objective);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the quest completion system and should only be called
    when the bot's quest state indicates a recoverable failure. It assumes that the
    provided objective data is valid and corresponds to an actual active quest in
    the bot's progress. The recovery process may involve resetting objective counters,
    re-evaluating conditions, or restoring previous progress states.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the objective state may
    result in inconsistent quest progress or unexpected behavior. Ensure that the
    objective is actually in a failed state before calling this method. Also, be cautious
    about calling it during critical quest progression events as it might interfere
    with other quest handling mechanisms.
