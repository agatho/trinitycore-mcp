api:
  class: MonkAI
  method: ManageChiGeneration
  signature: void MonkAI::ManageChiGeneration()
documentation:
  brief: Manages the generation and allocation of Chi energy for the Monk AI during
    combat.
  description: The ManageChiGeneration method is responsible for handling the internal
    logic that governs how Chi energy is generated and consumed by a Monk AI character.
    This includes determining when Chi should be produced based on player actions,
    such as performing attacks or using abilities, and managing the distribution of
    Chi to appropriate skills or stances. The method ensures that the Monk AI maintains
    an optimal balance of Chi resources for effective gameplay, aligning with the
    game's mechanics where monks rely heavily on Chi for powerful abilities and defensive
    maneuvers.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other AI logic...\n    ManageChiGeneration();\n\
      \    // Continue with other updates...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked within the AI update loop and should be
    called regularly to maintain proper Chi state tracking. It does not directly interact
    with player input but responds to internal AI decisions and combat events.
  warnings: Improper invocation of this method may lead to incorrect Chi accumulation
    or depletion, affecting the Monk's ability to use key abilities. Ensure that it
    is only called when the AI is actively engaged in combat or performing actions
    that generate Chi.
