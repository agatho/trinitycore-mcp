  method: ShouldUseFieryBrand
  signature: bool VengeanceDemonHunterRefactored::ShouldUseFieryBrand() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Vengeance Demon Hunter should use the Fiery Brand
    ability based on current combat state and resource management.
  description: This method evaluates the optimal timing for using the Fiery Brand
    ability in the Vengeance Demon Hunter's rotation. It considers factors such as
    available rage, current target health, buff status, and cooldowns to determine
    if casting Fiery Brand would be beneficial. The method is typically called during
    the AI decision-making process to select the most effective ability to cast next.
    This implementation ensures that the ability is used only when it will provide
    maximum damage output or strategic advantage within the Demon Hunter's vengeance
    specialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if Fiery Brand should be used according to the current combat
    situation and resource state; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision logic
    code: "if (player->GetVengeanceDemonHunterRefactored()->ShouldUseFieryBrand())\
      \ {\n    player->CastSpell(target, FIERY_BRAND_SPELL_ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat rotation logic
    code: "class VengeanceDemonHunterAI : public ScriptedAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (me->GetVengeanceDemonHunterRefactored()->ShouldUseFieryBrand())\
      \ {\n            DoCastVictim(FIERY_BRAND_SPELL_ID);\n        }\n        //\
      \ Other combat logic...\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Vengeance Demon Hunter's AI decision framework
    and should only be called during active combat. The implementation may vary based
    on the current player's gear, talents, and buff/debuff state. It's recommended
    to cache this value if it's being checked multiple times per update cycle.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat or when the player is not a
    Vengeance Demon Hunter class. Incorrect usage may result in invalid spell casting
    or AI behavior anomalies. The method assumes proper initialization of all internal
    state variables.
