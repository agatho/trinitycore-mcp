  method: IsResetByScheduler
  signature: bool Quest::IsResetByScheduler() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the quest is reset by the scheduler.
  description: This method checks if a quest has been scheduled for reset, typically
    indicating that the quest's completion status has been reset and can be repeated.
    It returns true when the quest's reset state is managed by the scheduler, allowing
    developers to understand if the quest can be reaccepted or if it has been reset
    due to time-based or other scheduling mechanisms. This method is commonly used
    in quest handling logic to determine whether a quest should be considered as available
    for reacceptance or if it has already been reset.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest is reset by the scheduler, false otherwise. This
    indicates that the quest's completion status has been reset and can potentially
    be repeated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (quest->IsResetByScheduler()) {\n    // Quest has been reset by scheduler\n\
      \    // Perform actions to reaccept or reset quest\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest management system and should be
    used in conjunction with other quest-related methods for complete quest handling
    logic. It's typically called during quest completion checks or when determining
    if a quest can be repeated.
  warnings: This method does not directly affect quest completion status but rather
    indicates whether the quest has been reset by scheduler, which may influence quest
    reacceptance logic.
