  signature: Player * FormationManager::GetFormationLeader() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the leader player object of the formation.
  description: The GetFormationLeader method retrieves the Player object that serves
    as the leader of the current formation. This method is typically used in group
    or raid management systems where players are organized into formations with a
    designated leader. The returned pointer may be null if no valid formation leader
    exists or if the formation has not been properly initialized. In World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore implementation, this method supports the dynamic grouping mechanics
    that allow players to form and manage units in structured arrangements such as
    raids, dungeons, or battlefield formations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Player object representing the formation leader, or nullptr
    if no leader is set or the formation is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve formation leader
    code: "Player* leader = formationManager->GetFormationLeader();\nif (leader)\n\
      {\n    std::cout << \"Formation leader: \" << leader->GetName() << std::endl;\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    std::cout << \"No formation leader found.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the FormationManager instance has a valid internal
    state representing an active formation. It is recommended to verify the existence
    of a formation before calling this method to avoid unexpected null returns.
  warnings: The returned Player pointer should not be stored or used beyond the scope
    where the formation remains valid, as the leader may change or become invalid
    during gameplay events such as player logout or group disbanding.
