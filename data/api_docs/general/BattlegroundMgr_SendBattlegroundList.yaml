  signature: void BattlegroundMgr::SendBattlegroundList(Player * player, const int
    & guid, int bgTypeId)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a battleground list to the specified player.
  description: The SendBattlegroundList method is responsible for transmitting available
    battleground information to a connected player. It retrieves and formats a list
    of battlegrounds that the player can join, including relevant details such as
    type, level ranges, and availability. This method is typically invoked when a
    player opens the battleground interface or requests a list of available arenas
    and battlegrounds. The method ensures that only appropriate battlegrounds for
    the player's level and faction are displayed.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the client receiving the
      battleground list.
  - name: guid
    description: Integer identifier representing the unique GUID of the player or
      related entity. Used for tracking and validation purposes.
  - name: bgTypeId
    description: Integer value indicating the type ID of the battleground to filter
      results. A value of -1 typically means all battlegrounds are listed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: BattlegroundMgr::Instance()->SendBattlegroundList(player, player->GetGUID().GetCounter(),
      -1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Filter by Specific Battleground Type
    code: BattlegroundMgr::Instance()->SendBattlegroundList(player, player->GetGUID().GetCounter(),
      BATTLEGROUND_AV);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal battleground data structures and may perform
    database lookups to determine available battlegrounds. It is typically called
    from within the game's UI handling logic when players interact with battleground
    windows.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also, be aware that
    incorrect bgTypeId values may lead to no battlegrounds being displayed or unexpected
    filtering results.
