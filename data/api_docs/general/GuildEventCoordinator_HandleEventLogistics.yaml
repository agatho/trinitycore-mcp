documentation:
  brief: Processes logistics for a specified guild event
  description: The HandleEventLogistics method manages the logistical aspects of a
    guild event identified by its unique event ID. This includes coordinating player
    participation, handling event prerequisites, and ensuring proper resource allocation.
    The method is typically invoked when a guild event needs to be initialized or
    updated within the game world. It operates within the GuildEventCoordinator class
    which oversees all guild-related events and their associated systems.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: Unique identifier for the guild event to process logistics for. Must
      correspond to an existing event in the guild event system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Logistics Processing
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.HandleEventLogistics(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing Multiple Events
    code: "GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;\nfor (uint32 eventId : eventIds)\n{\n\
      \    coordinator.HandleEventLogistics(eventId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild event tracking systems and
    may trigger additional callbacks or notifications to players. It should be called
    from a context where the guild event system is properly initialized and accessible.
  warnings: Ensure that the eventId parameter references an actual existing event,
    as processing a non-existent event could lead to undefined behavior or system
    errors. This method may have performance implications if called frequently with
    many events.
