  class: QuestCompletion
  method: GetCompletableQuests
  signature: int QuestCompletion::GetCompletableQuests(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of quests that can be completed by the specified player
    bot.
  description: The GetCompletableQuests method evaluates the current state of a player
    bot and determines how many quests are currently in a completable state. This
    includes quests that have been accepted, meet all prerequisites, and have their
    objective requirements fulfilled. The method is typically used in automated questing
    systems or AI logic to determine what actions a bot should take next. It does
    not modify the player's quest data but rather provides a read-only count of available
    completable quests. The result can be zero if no quests are currently completable
    or if the player has not accepted any quests that meet the completion criteria.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose completable
      quests are being evaluated. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the count of quests that are currently
    completable for the specified player bot. A return value of zero indicates no
    quests can be completed, while a positive integer indicates the number of quests
    ready for completion.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check quest completion status
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player object\nint completableCount\
      \ = QuestCompletion::GetCompletableQuests(myBot);\nif (completableCount > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Process the completable quests\n    printf(\"%d quests are completable\\\
      n\", completableCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the result to trigger quest completion logic
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nint count = QuestCompletion::GetCompletableQuests(bot);\n\
      if (count > 0)\n{\n    // Iterate through completable quests and complete them\n\
      \    for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i)\n    {\n        // Logic to complete quest\
      \ at index i\n        // ...\n    }\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No quests available,\
      \ perhaps move to next step\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal checks on the player's quest log and
    evaluates each quest's completion status based on game rules. It may involve checking
    quest objectives, item requirements, and NPC interactions. The performance impact
    is minimal as it only counts quests rather than processing them.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. This method should be called in
    contexts where player state is stable and quest data is fully loaded.
