  class: Pet
  method: SavePetToDB
  signature: void Pet::SavePetToDB(PetSaveMode mode)
documentation:
  brief: Saves the pet's data to the database using the specified save mode.
  description: The SavePetToDB method persists the current state of a pet object into
    the database. It takes a PetSaveMode parameter that determines how the pet data
    should be saved, such as whether to update existing records or insert new ones.
    This method is typically invoked when a pet's state changes and needs to be synchronized
    with the persistent storage. The operation ensures that all relevant pet attributes
    like health, experience, level, and ownership details are correctly stored in
    the database for future retrieval.
  parameters:
  - name: mode
    description: Specifies the save mode for the pet data. Valid values include PetSaveMode::SAVE_MODE_NEW,
      PetSaveMode::SAVE_MODE_UPDATE, and others depending on implementation. Controls
      whether to insert a new record or update an existing one in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Save pet with update mode
    code: 'Pet* myPet = ...; // Assume pet is initialized

      myPet->SavePetToDB(PetSaveMode::SAVE_MODE_UPDATE);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Save new pet to database
    code: 'Pet* newPet = new Pet();

      // Set pet properties...

      newPet->SavePetToDB(PetSaveMode::SAVE_MODE_NEW);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct database write operation and should be used
    carefully to avoid unnecessary I/O overhead. It is recommended to batch multiple
    save operations for performance optimization in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the pet object may
    result in incomplete or corrupted data being saved to the database. Ensure that
    all required fields are populated before invoking this method.
