  signature: void BotAI::~BotAI()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BotAI instance and performs necessary cleanup operations.
  description: The ~BotAI destructor is responsible for cleaning up all resources
    associated with a BotAI instance. When a BotAI object is destroyed, this method
    ensures that any allocated memory, active AI behaviors, and references to game
    entities are properly released. This destructor typically handles the deactivation
    of bot AI logic, cleanup of internal data structures, and may notify the system
    that the bot is no longer under AI control. It's automatically invoked when a
    BotAI object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of BotAI instance
    code: 'BotAI* botAI = new BotAI();

      // ... use the bot AI ...

      delte botAI; // Destructor ~BotAI is automatically called here'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing memory.
    It's important to ensure that all references to the BotAI object are cleared before
    deletion to prevent dangling pointers. The destruction process may involve multiple
    internal cleanup steps including stopping AI threads, releasing game object references,
    and updating bot status in the system.
  warnings: Never call ~BotAI directly unless you're implementing custom memory management.
    The destructor assumes that all necessary cleanup has been coordinated by the
    owning system. Calling it manually can lead to resource leaks or undefined behavior
    if not done correctly.
