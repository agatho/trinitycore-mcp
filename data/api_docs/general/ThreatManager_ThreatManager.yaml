  brief: Initializes a new ThreatManager instance by copying an existing one
  description: The ThreatManager constructor creates a new threat management instance
    by copying the state and configuration of an existing ThreatManager object. This
    method is typically used when creating new instances based on existing ones, such
    as during object cloning or when establishing threat relationships between different
    entities in the game world. The copied instance maintains all threat-related properties
    including current threat levels, target tracking, and associated behavior settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic ThreatManager Copy Example
    code: ThreatManager newManager = ThreatManager(oldManager);
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used in scenarios where threat management needs
    to be duplicated or copied between different objects. It's important to note that
    this method does not perform any deep copying of complex data structures, so changes
    to the original object may affect the copied instance.
  warnings: This method should not be used for creating new instances from scratch
    without proper initialization. The copied instance may inherit unintended threat
    states or behaviors if not properly managed.
