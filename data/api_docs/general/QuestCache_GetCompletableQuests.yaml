  class: QuestCache
  method: GetCompletableQuests
  signature: const int & QuestCache::GetCompletableQuests() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the count of quests that can be completed by the player.
  description: The GetCompletableQuests method retrieves the number of quests in the
    player's quest log that are in a state where they can be turned in for completion.
    This value is typically used by the client and server to determine which quests
    should be displayed as available for submission. The returned reference points
    to an internal integer member of the QuestCache class, which is updated when the
    quest cache is refreshed or when quest states change. This method does not perform
    any computation or database queries directly; instead, it provides access to a
    pre-calculated value stored within the QuestCache instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the number of quests that
    are currently completable by the player. The value is updated automatically when
    the quest cache is refreshed and reflects the current state of the player's quest
    log.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int completableQuestCount = player->GetQuestCache()->GetCompletableQuests();\n\
      if (completableQuestCount > 0)\n{\n    // Process or display completable quests\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Quest Completion Eligibility
    code: "QuestCache* cache = player->GetQuestCache();\nconst int& count = cache->GetCompletableQuests();\n\
      if (count > 0)\n{\n    // Notify the player that they have quests ready to turn\
      \ in\n    player->SendNotification(\"You have %d quests ready to complete.\"\
      , count);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a reference to an internal cached value, so modifications
    to this value should not be made directly. The QuestCache instance must be properly
    initialized and updated for accurate results. This method is typically called
    during UI updates or quest status checks.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned reference as it points to an internal member
    variable. Modifying it may lead to inconsistent state in the quest cache. Ensure
    that the QuestCache object is valid before calling this method.
