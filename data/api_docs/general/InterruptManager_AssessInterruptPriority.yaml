  class: InterruptManager
  method: AssessInterruptPriority
  signature: InterruptPriority InterruptManager::AssessInterruptPriority(const SpellInfo
    * spellInfo, Unit * caster)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the interrupt priority level of a spell based on its
    properties and caster.
  description: The AssessInterruptPriority method determines the priority level at
    which a given spell should be interrupted during execution. This is used by the
    game's interrupt system to decide whether an incoming interrupt (such as a silence
    or stun) can successfully break a casting spell. The method analyzes the spell's
    properties, such as its cast time, interrupt flags, and other relevant attributes,
    in conjunction with the caster unit to determine how likely it is that the spell
    will be interrupted. It plays a key role in combat mechanics, particularly in
    scenarios involving spell interruption, such as when a player is silenced or stunned
    while casting a spell.
  parameters:
  - name: spellInfo
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure containing detailed information
      about the spell being evaluated. This includes cast time, interrupt flags, and
      other spell properties that influence interrupt priority.
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the caster of the spell.
      The caster's state, buffs, debuffs, and other attributes may affect how the
      interrupt priority is assessed.
  returns: Returns an InterruptPriority enum value indicating the calculated interrupt
    priority level. Possible values include LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, or VERY_HIGH, depending
    on how likely the spell is to be interrupted.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "InterruptPriority priority = interruptManager->AssessInterruptPriority(spellInfo,\
      \ caster);\nif (priority >= InterruptPriority::HIGH) {\n    // Handle high-priority\
      \ interrupt case\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in interrupt logic
    code: "void HandleSpellInterrupt(Unit* target, const SpellInfo* spellInfo, Unit*\
      \ caster) {\n    InterruptPriority current = interruptManager->AssessInterruptPriority(spellInfo,\
      \ caster);\n    if (current >= InterruptPriority::MEDIUM) {\n        target->InterruptSpell(current);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell casting and interruption logic.
    It may be optimized to cache results or use precomputed values for performance
    in high-frequency scenarios such as combat.
  warnings: Ensure that both spellInfo and caster are valid pointers before calling
    this method, as dereferencing invalid pointers can lead to crashes. The interrupt
    priority levels should not be used directly for gameplay logic without considering
    additional context like spell resistance or immunity effects.
