  signature: void BotNpcLocationService::BuildQuestPOICache()
documentation:
  brief: Populates the internal cache with quest point of interest (POI) data for
    bot NPC locations.
  description: The BuildQuestPOICache method initializes and fills an internal cache
    structure with quest-related point of interest (POI) information specific to bot
    NPCs. This cache is used by the bot AI system to determine optimal navigation
    paths and quest completion strategies. The method iterates through all available
    quests in the game database, extracts relevant POI data such as coordinates, quest
    objectives, and associated NPC locations, and stores this information in a structured
    format for fast lookup during bot behavior execution. This pre-processing step
    significantly improves performance by avoiding repeated database queries or complex
    calculations at runtime.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotNpcLocationService locationService;

      locationService.BuildQuestPOICache();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called once during server initialization
    or when quest data is updated. The cache is not automatically invalidated, so
    calling this method again after quest modifications will refresh the stored POI
    information. Performance is optimized for frequent lookups rather than frequent
    rebuilds.
  warnings: Calling this method repeatedly without proper caching logic may cause
    unnecessary performance overhead. Ensure that quest data changes are properly
    tracked and this method is only invoked when necessary to maintain cache consistency.
