  class: AuctionHouse
  method: LearnMarketPatterns
  signature: void AuctionHouse::LearnMarketPatterns(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Teaches the auction house player the market patterns for a specified item.
  description: The LearnMarketPatterns method is responsible for enabling a player
    to access market pattern data for a specific item within the auction house system.
    This functionality allows players to understand pricing trends and market behavior
    for items they are interested in buying or selling. The method likely updates
    internal data structures or player state to reflect that the player has learned
    the patterns for the given item, potentially unlocking additional features such
    as advanced price analysis or optimized bidding strategies. It is typically invoked
    when a player interacts with an auction house or purchases a specific item that
    grants market knowledge.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item for which market patterns should
      be learned. This value must correspond to a valid item in the game's database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Learn Market Patterns for a Common Item
    code: 'AuctionHouse* ah = player->GetSession()->GetAuctionHouse();

      ah->LearnMarketPatterns(12345); // Learn patterns for item with ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal player state or database entries to
    track learned market patterns. It may also trigger UI updates in the auction house
    interface to reflect new available data.
  warnings: Ensure that the itemId parameter is valid and corresponds to an existing
    item in the game's database, otherwise behavior is undefined. This method should
    only be called on active players with valid auction house sessions.
