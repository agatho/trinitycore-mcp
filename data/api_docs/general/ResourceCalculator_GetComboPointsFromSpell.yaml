  class: ResourceCalculator
  method: GetComboPointsFromSpell
  signature: uint32 ResourceCalculator::GetComboPointsFromSpell(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the number of combo points generated by a specified
    spell.
  description: The GetComboPointsFromSpell method determines how many combo points
    a given spell will generate for the player. This is commonly used in classes like
    Rogues, Assassins, or other combo-point-based specializations where certain abilities
    contribute to combo point accumulation. The method likely queries internal spell
    data or combo point tables to return an accurate count based on the spell's properties
    and the current game state. It does not modify any game state but rather retrieves
    pre-calculated or hardcoded values associated with the spell.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of combo points that would
    be generated by the specified spell. A return value of zero indicates that the
    spell does not generate combo points, or the spell ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Combo Points from a Rogue Ability
    code: "uint32 comboPoints = ResourceCalculator::GetComboPointsFromSpell(1752);\
      \ // Sinister Strike\nif (comboPoints > 0)\n{\n    // Apply combo points logic\n\
      \    printf(\"Sinister Strike generates %u combo points.\\n\", comboPoints);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a resource management system and may be used
    in conjunction with other combo point-related methods such as AddComboPoints or
    GetComboPoints. It assumes that spell data has been properly loaded and indexed
    within the game's internal databases.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided spell ID is valid and corresponds to an actual
    spell in the game database; otherwise, unexpected behavior may occur. This method
    should not be called during critical gameplay events where combo point states
    are being modified.
