  class: IBotSpawner
  method: Update
  signature: void IBotSpawner::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the bot spawner's internal state and manages bot creation or destruction
    based on configured parameters.
  description: The Update method is responsible for driving the core logic of the
    bot spawner system. It processes time-based events, evaluates spawn conditions,
    and manages the lifecycle of bots within the game world. This method is typically
    called from the main game loop at regular intervals, using a delta time value
    to determine how much time has passed since the last update. The implementation
    may handle tasks such as checking if new bots should be spawned, removing expired
    bots, updating bot behavior states, or managing resource allocation for active
    bots. It operates within the context of TrinityCore's AI and bot management systems,
    ensuring that bot spawning aligns with server configuration settings and game
    mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time delta in milliseconds since the last update call. This value
      is used to determine how much time has passed and influences timing-sensitive
      operations like cooldowns, spawn delays, or bot behavior updates.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = GetTickTime();\n    botSpawner->Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Server Update Loop
    code: "class WorldManager\n{\npublic:\n    void Update(uint32 diff)\n    {\n \
      \       botSpawner->Update(diff);\n        // Other update logic...\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called frequently from the main game thread.
    It should not block or perform heavy computations that could affect server performance.
    The diff parameter must be accurately calculated to ensure proper timing of bot
    spawning and behavior updates.
  warnings: Improper handling of the diff parameter can lead to incorrect timing of
    bot spawns or behaviors. Avoid performing blocking operations inside this method
    as it may cause server lag or desynchronization.
