  signature: int Unit::GetTarget() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the target unit currently selected by this
    unit.
  description: The GetTarget method retrieves the GUID of the target unit that is
    currently selected by the Unit. This method is commonly used in game mechanics
    to determine which entity a unit is targeting, such as in combat situations or
    when performing actions. The returned GUID represents the unique identifier of
    the target, which can be a player, creature, or object. This method does not perform
    any validation checks on whether the target actually exists; it simply returns
    the last known target GUID. For units that are not actively targeting anything,
    this method will return an invalid GUID (typically 0). The method is part of the
    Unit class and is used extensively in TrinityCore's core implementation for managing
    target selection and tracking.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the GUID of the currently selected target. If no target is selected,
    it returns 0. This value represents a unique identifier for the target entity
    within the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* unit = ...;\nuint64 targetGUID = unit->GetTarget();\nif (targetGUID\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Target exists\n    // Do something with the target\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // No target selected\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other target-related methods
    such as GetTarget() or SetTarget(). Performance-wise, this method is lightweight
    and does not involve any complex operations. It is thread-safe as long as the
    unit's target state is properly synchronized.
  warnings: This method will return 0 if no target has been selected, which can be
    confused with a valid GUID for a player or creature. Developers should always
    validate whether the returned GUID is valid before using it in actions or logic.
