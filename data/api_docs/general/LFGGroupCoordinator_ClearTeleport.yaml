  class: LFGGroupCoordinator
  method: ClearTeleport
  signature: void LFGGroupCoordinator::ClearTeleport(int playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Clears the teleport state for a specific player in the LFG group coordinator.
  description: The ClearTeleport method removes any pending or active teleportation
    state associated with a given player GUID within the LFG (Looking For Group) system.
    This method is typically invoked when a player's teleport request needs to be
    canceled, either due to a failed teleport attempt, user cancellation, or group
    disbandment. It ensures that the player's teleportation data is reset and that
    they can participate in future LFG activities without interference from stale
    teleport states. The method operates on the internal tracking of player teleport
    status within the LFGGroupCoordinator class.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose teleport state should
      be cleared. This value must correspond to a valid player in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing teleport state for a specific player
    code: 'LFGGroupCoordinator coordinator;

      uint32 playerGuid = 123456;

      coordinator.ClearTeleport(playerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal LFG system and should only be called
    by components that manage group coordination. It does not directly interact with
    the player's client or send messages; it merely resets the internal state.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent player GUID may result
    in undefined behavior or silent failures. Ensure the player GUID is valid before
    invoking this method.
