  method: SyncWithAnalytics
  signature: void BotProfiler::SyncWithAnalytics()
documentation:
  brief: Synchronizes bot profiling data with analytics system to ensure real-time
    performance tracking and reporting.
  description: The SyncWithAnalytics method is responsible for transferring collected
    bot profiling metrics from the local profiler instance to the central analytics
    system. This synchronization ensures that real-time performance data, including
    bot behavior patterns, resource usage, and operational efficiency, are consistently
    updated within the game's analytics infrastructure. The method typically handles
    data serialization, network transmission, and potential conflict resolution between
    local and remote analytics states. It is designed to be called periodically or
    upon significant profiling events to maintain up-to-date performance insights
    for bot management and optimization.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Synchronization Call
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      profiler.SyncWithAnalytics();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Periodic Synchronization in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    static uint32 syncTimer = 0;\n    if (++syncTimer\
      \ >= 300) // Sync every 300 ticks\n    {\n        botProfiler.SyncWithAnalytics();\n\
      \        syncTimer = 0;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve network I/O operations and should be called with
    consideration for performance impact. It's recommended to batch multiple profiling
    updates before synchronization to minimize overhead. The method assumes that the
    analytics system is properly initialized and accessible.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper throttling can cause
    performance degradation due to excessive network traffic or data processing. Ensure
    that the analytics subsystem is ready before invoking this method to avoid potential
    runtime errors.
