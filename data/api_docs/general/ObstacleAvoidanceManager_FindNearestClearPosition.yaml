  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: FindNearestClearPosition
  signature: int ObstacleAvoidanceManager::FindNearestClearPosition(const int & blocked,
    float searchRadius)
documentation:
  brief: Finds the nearest clear position to a blocked location within a specified
    search radius.
  description: The FindNearestClearPosition method is used in obstacle avoidance logic
    to locate the closest navigable point around a given blocked position. It searches
    within the defined search radius for a valid movement coordinate that is not obstructed
    by terrain, objects, or other environmental barriers. This method is typically
    invoked during AI pathfinding to help units avoid collisions and find alternative
    routes when their primary path is blocked. The returned value represents an index
    or identifier indicating the success or failure of the search operation, with
    specific meanings depending on internal implementation details.
  parameters:
  - name: blocked
    description: An integer identifier representing the blocked position or node in
      the navigation system. This could be a waypoint index, grid coordinate, or object
      reference that is currently obstructed.
  - name: searchRadius
    description: A floating-point value defining the maximum distance to search for
      a clear position around the blocked location. Units are typically in game-world
      coordinates (e.g., yards or meters).
  returns: Returns an integer indicating the result of the search operation. A positive
    value usually signifies a valid index or identifier of the found clear position,
    while negative values may indicate failure to find a suitable location within
    the specified radius.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI movement
    code: "int clearPosIndex = obstacleAvoidanceManager.FindNearestClearPosition(currentWaypointIndex,\
      \ 5.0f);\nif (clearPosIndex >= 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with movement to the clear\
      \ position\n    MoveToPosition(clearPosIndex);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No valid\
      \ position found; handle alternative behavior\n    HandleBlockedPath();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal navigation mesh data structures and pathfinding
    algorithms to evaluate positions. Performance can be affected by the size of the
    search radius and complexity of the surrounding environment. The implementation
    may cache previous results or use spatial partitioning for efficiency.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'blocked' parameter refers to a valid position in the
    current navigation context; otherwise, the method may return unexpected results.
    Large search radii can significantly impact performance during high-frequency
    calls.
