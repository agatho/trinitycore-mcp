  class: EvolutionaryOptimizer
  method: Evolve
  signature: void EvolutionaryOptimizer::Evolve()
documentation:
  brief: Performs one iteration of the evolutionary optimization process to improve
    solution quality
  description: The Evolve method executes a single generation of the evolutionary
    algorithm, applying selection, crossover, and mutation operations to advance the
    population toward optimal solutions. This method is typically called iteratively
    to allow the optimizer to converge on better fitness values over time. The implementation
    follows standard genetic algorithm principles where individuals in the population
    are evaluated based on their fitness, selected for reproduction, and combined
    through genetic operators to produce offspring for the next generation.

  - title: Basic Evolutionary Optimization Loop
    code: "EvolutionaryOptimizer optimizer;\n// Initialize population\noptimizer.Initialize(100,\
      \ 10);\n\n// Run multiple generations\nfor (int i = 0; i < 50; ++i)\n{\n   \
      \ optimizer.Evolve();\n    // Optionally log fitness progress\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Generation \" << i << \": Best Fitness = \" << optimizer.GetBestFitness()\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the EvolutionaryOptimizer instance
    and should not be called concurrently from multiple threads without proper synchronization.
    The evolutionary process is stochastic, so results may vary between runs with
    the same initial conditions.
  warnings: Calling Evolve on an uninitialized optimizer may lead to undefined behavior.
    Ensure that Initialize() has been called before invoking this method. The method
    does not guarantee convergence to a global optimum and may get stuck in local
    optima depending on parameter settings.
