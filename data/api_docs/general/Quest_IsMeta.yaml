documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the quest is a meta quest, which provides bonus points
    for completion.
  description: The IsMeta method checks if a quest is classified as a meta quest within
    the TrinityCore framework. Meta quests are special quests that provide additional
    reward points beyond normal quest rewards, typically used for achievements or
    special game mechanics. This method returns true when the quest is categorized
    as a meta quest, indicating it should be treated specially in terms of reward
    calculation and gameplay behavior. The method is commonly used in quest handling
    logic to determine if special bonus points should be awarded upon quest completion.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest is a meta quest, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the quest provides bonus points for completion beyond normal rewards.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (quest->IsMeta()) {\n    // Quest provides bonus points\n    // Handle\
      \ accordingly\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to determine special handling of quests. Implementation relies on internal quest
    data structure and may vary based on how the quest is defined in the database.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it affects reward calculation.
    Incorrect usage could lead to improper bonus point assignment or game balance
    issues.
