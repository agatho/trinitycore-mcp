  class: InterruptRotationManager
  method: CanReachInTime
  signature: bool InterruptRotationManager::CanReachInTime(const InterrupterBot &
    bot, Unit * target, uint32 timeAvailable) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an interrupter bot can reach and interrupt a target within
    a specified time frame.
  description: The CanReachInTime method evaluates if a given InterrupterBot instance
    is capable of reaching and successfully interrupting a specified Unit target within
    the provided time constraint. This method is crucial for AI decision-making in
    combat scenarios where timing and positioning are essential for effective spell
    interruption. It considers factors such as movement speed, distance to target,
    and available time to determine feasibility. The method assumes that the bot has
    already been initialized with appropriate movement and targeting capabilities.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Reference to the InterrupterBot instance that will perform the interrupt
      action. This object contains the bot's current state, movement capabilities,
      and targeting information.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit that is being considered for interruption. This
      represents the target of the interrupt attempt and must be a valid game object.
  - name: timeAvailable
    description: The maximum time (in milliseconds) available for the bot to reach
      and interrupt the target. This value determines the feasibility of the action
      based on movement calculations.
  returns: Returns true if the bot can successfully reach and interrupt the target
    within the specified time frame, false otherwise. The method returns false when
    the calculated travel time exceeds the available time or when the target is unreachable.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "InterrupterBot bot;\nUnit* target = player->GetVictim();\nuint32 timeLimit\
      \ = 1000; // 1 second\nif (interruptManager.CanReachInTime(bot, target, timeLimit))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with interrupt action\n    bot.Interrupt(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with conditional logic
    code: "InterrupterBot bot;\nUnit* target = player->GetVictim();\nuint32 timeAvailable\
      \ = 1500; // 1.5 seconds\nif (interruptManager.CanReachInTime(bot, target, timeAvailable))\
      \ {\n    // Check if interrupt is possible with current mana\n    if (bot.HasSufficientMana())\
      \ {\n        bot.Interrupt(target);\n    }\n} else {\n    // Move closer or\
      \ wait for better opportunity\n    bot.MoveToTarget(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs calculations based on the bot's current movement state
    and target position. It does not account for dynamic changes in target position
    during execution. The timeAvailable parameter should be carefully chosen to reflect
    realistic combat timing constraints.
  warnings: The method assumes that the provided Unit pointer is valid and not null.
    Calling this method with an invalid target may result in undefined behavior. Additionally,
    performance can be impacted by complex movement path calculations, especially
    in crowded environments.
