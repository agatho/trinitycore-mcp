  signature: void BrewmasterStaggerTracker::UpdateStagger(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the stagger state of a player character for Brewmaster monk abilities.
  description: The UpdateStagger method is responsible for recalculating and applying
    the current stagger damage state for a Brewmaster monk player. This method typically
    handles the logic for managing the stagger effect, which represents damage that
    has been absorbed by the monk's defensive abilities such as Zen Meditation or
    Stagger. It processes incoming damage, applies the appropriate stagger mechanics,
    and updates the player's stagger status accordingly. The method is usually invoked
    during combat updates or when damage events occur to ensure the stagger state
    remains accurate.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the Brewmaster monk whose
      stagger state needs to be updated. This parameter must not be null and should
      reference a valid player instance with Brewmaster specialization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void MyBrewmasterAI::OnCombatUpdate(Player* bot)\n{\n    if (bot && bot->IsAlive())\n\
      \    {\n        BrewmasterStaggerTracker tracker;\n        tracker.UpdateStagger(bot);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Stagger After Damage Event
    code: "void MyBrewmasterAI::OnDamageTaken(Player* bot, uint32 damage)\n{\n   \
      \ if (bot && bot->GetClass() == CLASS_MONK && bot->GetSpecializationId() ==\
      \ SPEC_MONK_BREWMASTER)\n    {\n        BrewmasterStaggerTracker tracker;\n\
      \        tracker.UpdateStagger(bot);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's aura system and stagger mechanics.
    It may be called frequently during combat, so performance optimization is important.
    The method assumes that the player object has proper initialization of Brewmaster-specific
    attributes and abilities.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player pointer is valid and represents a Brewmaster
    monk before calling this method. Calling UpdateStagger on non-Brewmaster players
    or null pointers may result in undefined behavior or crashes.
