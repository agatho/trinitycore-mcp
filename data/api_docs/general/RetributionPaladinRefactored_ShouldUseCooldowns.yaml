  signature: bool RetributionPaladinRefactored::ShouldUseCooldowns(int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the retribution paladin should use cooldown abilities
    in the current combat situation
  description: This method evaluates the current state of the Retribution Paladin
    AI to decide if it is appropriate to consume cooldown abilities such as Avenging
    Wrath, Divine Purpose, or other strategic cooldowns. The decision is based on
    factors including target health, available mana, combat duration, and the presence
    of beneficial effects. It serves as a core decision-making function within the
    paladin's combat logic to optimize resource usage during fights.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if cooldown abilities should be used according to the current
    AI state and combat conditions; otherwise returns false
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Logic
    code: "if (paladin->ShouldUseCooldowns()) {\n    // Execute cooldown usage logic\n\
      \    paladin->UseCooldownAbilities();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat State Machine
    code: "void RetributionPaladinRefactored::UpdateCombatState() {\n    if (ShouldUseCooldowns())\
      \ {\n        UseAvengingWrath();\n        UseDivinePurpose();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI's decision-making cycle and
    should not be used to directly trigger cooldown usage, but rather to determine
    whether such actions are appropriate. The implementation likely considers the
    paladin's current mana pool, target threat level, and time since last cooldown
    use.
  warnings: Do not call this method in a loop without proper state checks as it may
    lead to unnecessary performance overhead. The method assumes valid internal AI
    state; calling it when the paladin is not in combat may produce undefined behavior.
