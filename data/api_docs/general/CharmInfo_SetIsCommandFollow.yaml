documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the charm is in command follow mode.
  description: This method configures the charm's command follow behavior, determining
    if the creature should follow its master's commands or act independently. When
    set to true, the charm will obey specific commands from the player and follow
    them in a controlled manner. This is commonly used for summoned creatures or pets
    that are under the player's direct control. The setting affects how the charm
    interacts with the player's movement and command system.

    description: Boolean value indicating whether to enable command follow mode. True
      enables command follow, false disables it.
