  signature: void SmartAIMgr::LoadHelperStores()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads all helper data stores required for SmartAI functionality.
  description: The LoadHelperStores method is responsible for initializing and populating
    various internal data structures and lookup tables that are essential for the
    operation of SmartAI scripts within TrinityCore. This method typically loads predefined
    mappings, cached data, or auxiliary information that SmartAI creatures rely on
    during their execution. It ensures that all necessary resources are available
    before any SmartAI behavior is triggered, thereby preventing runtime errors due
    to missing data. The method is usually invoked during server startup or when loading
    AI scripts for the first time.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: SmartAIMgr::instance()->LoadHelperStores();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the SmartAI system and should
    not be invoked manually unless in specific debugging or initialization scenarios.
    It may perform database queries or file reads to populate helper stores, so it
    could have performance implications during server startup.
