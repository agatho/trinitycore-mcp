documentation:
  brief: Applies buffs to the shaman bot based on current combat state and resource
    management.
  description: The ApplyBuffs method is responsible for determining and applying appropriate
    buffs to a shaman character within the TrinityCore AI framework. This method evaluates
    the current game state, including available mana, combat conditions, and buff
    durations, to decide which buffs should be applied to maximize the shaman's effectiveness
    in both PvE and PvP scenarios. It typically manages key shaman abilities such
    as totems, weapon buffs, and defensive auras. The method ensures that buffs are
    applied optimally based on rotation priorities and resource conservation strategies.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "void ShamanAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n    {\n      \
      \  rotation.ApplyBuffs(&bot);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should only
    be invoked when the bot is in a valid combat or pre-combat state. It assumes that
    the shaman has sufficient mana and resources to apply buffs without causing performance
    issues.
  warnings: Improper use of this method outside of valid combat states may result
    in incorrect buff application or resource waste. Ensure that all prerequisites
    for buff casting are met before calling this function.
