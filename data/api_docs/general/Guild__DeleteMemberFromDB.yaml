  class: Guild
  method: _DeleteMemberFromDB
  signature: void Guild::_DeleteMemberFromDB(int trans, int lowguid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a guild member's data from the database using a transaction and low
    GUID.
  description: The _DeleteMemberFromDB method is an internal utility function within
    the Guild class that removes all stored information about a specific guild member
    from the database. It takes a database transaction handle and the low GUID of
    the player to be removed, ensuring that the deletion occurs within the context
    of an existing transaction for data consistency. This method is typically called
    when a player leaves a guild or is kicked, and it directly interacts with the
    database to purge relevant records such as member-specific guild data, permissions,
    and other associated information. The function does not return any value, as its
    purpose is purely to perform the deletion operation.
  parameters:
  - name: trans
    description: The database transaction handle used for executing the deletion query.
      This ensures that the operation is atomic and consistent with other related
      database changes within the same transaction scope.
  - name: lowguid
    description: The low GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) of the player whose guild
      membership data should be deleted from the database. This value uniquely identifies
      the player within the game world.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Guild Member Removal
    code: "void RemoveGuildMember(Guild* guild, uint32 playerLowGuid) {\n    TransactionHolder\
      \ trans;\n    // Begin transaction\n    trans.Begin();\n    \n    // Delete\
      \ member from database\n    guild->_DeleteMemberFromDB(trans, playerLowGuid);\n\
      \    \n    // Commit transaction\n    trans.Commit();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended for internal use only and should not be called directly
    by external code. It assumes that the provided transaction is already initialized
    and active, and that the lowguid corresponds to a valid player in the guild. The
    method performs no validation on inputs beyond basic type checking.
  warnings: Calling this method without an active database transaction may result
    in inconsistent data or database errors. Ensure that all related operations are
    wrapped within the same transaction context for proper rollback behavior.
