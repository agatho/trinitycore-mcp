  class: BotLevelManager
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool BotLevelManager::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot level management system and prepares it for use.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the internal state and data structures
    required for the BotLevelManager to function properly. It typically performs setup
    operations such as loading configuration data, initializing lookup tables, or
    establishing connections to necessary subsystems. This method should be called
    once during the system initialization phase before any other bot level management
    operations are performed. The method returns true if initialization was successful,
    and false otherwise, indicating that the manager is not ready for use.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initialization process completed successfully and the
    BotLevelManager is ready for use; returns false if initialization failed or encountered
    an error condition.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "BotLevelManager levelManager;\nbool success = levelManager.Initialize();\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Manager is ready to use\n    // Proceed with bot level\
      \ operations\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle initialization failure\n    // Log error\
      \ or abort further setup\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the application lifecycle.
    Repeated calls to Initialize may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks.
    The method is typically invoked during server startup or when a new instance of
    BotLevelManager needs to be configured.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper system setup or after an incomplete
    shutdown can lead to inconsistent state. Ensure all dependencies are available
    before calling Initialize.
