documentation:
  brief: Returns the exit code of the world server process
  description: The GetExitCode method retrieves the exit code that the world server
    process will return upon termination. This value is typically used by system processes
    or scripts to determine the outcome of the server's execution. The exit code can
    indicate successful operation, errors, or other states depending on how the server
    was shut down. In a typical TrinityCore environment, this method may be called
    during shutdown procedures or by external monitoring tools to assess the server's
    status.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the exit code of the world server process. Common
    values include 0 for successful exit, and non-zero values indicating various error
    conditions or abnormal termination states.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Shutdown
    code: "void World::HandleShutdown()\n{\n    uint8 exitCode = GetExitCode();\n\
      \    // Log the exit code for monitoring purposes\n    sLog->outString(\"World\
      \ server shutting down with exit code: %u\", exitCode);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with server shutdown procedures
    and may be called from multiple threads during the termination sequence. It's
    important to note that the actual exit code value might be set by external factors
    such as system signals or administrative commands.
