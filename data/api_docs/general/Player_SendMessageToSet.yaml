  signature: void Player::SendMessageToSet(const WorldPacket * data, const Player
    * skipped_rcvr) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a WorldPacket message to all players in the player's group or raid.
  description: The SendMessageToSet method sends a WorldPacket to all players within
    the player's group or raid, excluding the specified skipped receiver. This method
    is commonly used for sending broadcast messages to group members, such as player
    announcements, loot notifications, or other game events. It ensures that the message
    is properly distributed to all relevant players in the player's party or raid
    instance, making it an essential tool for communication within group contexts.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: The WorldPacket containing the message data to be sent to the set
      of players. This packet typically contains the actual message content and is
      usually constructed using appropriate opcode constants.
  - name: skipped_rcvr
    description: The Player pointer that specifies which player should be skipped
      in the broadcast. This parameter allows for excluding a specific player from
      receiving the message, commonly used when sending messages to group members
      while excluding oneself or another player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'WorldPacket packet(SMSG_MESSAGE_CHAT);

      packet << uint8(0); // channel

      packet << uint32(0); // sender GUID

      packet << uint32(0); // target GUID

      packet << uint64(0); // target GUID

      packet << uint32(0); // message type

      packet << uint32(0); // language

      packet << "Hello world!";

      player->SendMessageToSet(&packet, nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is implemented using the group/raid system in TrinityCore. It
    uses the player's group or raid members to determine which players should receive
    the message. The method ensures proper packet handling and avoids sending messages
    to players who are not part of the same group or raid.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it can potentially cause
    performance issues if used excessively in rapid succession. Also, the skipped_rcvr
    parameter must be valid and should not be nullptr unless explicitly intended to
    skip all players.
