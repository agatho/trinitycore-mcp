  class: InteractionValidator
  method: IsFlightNodeDiscovered
  signature: bool InteractionValidator::IsFlightNodeDiscovered(::Player * bot, uint32
    nodeId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a flight node has been discovered by the specified player.
  description: The IsFlightNodeDiscovered method determines if a given flight path
    node has been discovered for the specified player character. In World of Warcraft,
    flight nodes represent waypoints in the game's flight system that players must
    discover before they can use them to travel between locations. This method typically
    checks the player's known flight paths or discovery flags associated with the
    node ID. The method is commonly used in AI logic to determine valid flight destinations
    for bot characters.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose flight
      discovery status is being checked.
  - name: nodeId
    description: Unique identifier for the flight node to check. This corresponds
      to a specific waypoint in the game's flight path system.
  returns: Returns true if the flight node has been discovered by the player, false
    otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the player can use this flight
    node for travel.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check flight node discovery
    code: "if (validator.IsFlightNodeDiscovered(player, 12345)) {\n    // Node is\
      \ discovered, player can use it\n    player->AddCorpseForm();\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Node not discovered, need to discover first\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      Flight path not discovered yet.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI logic for bot flight path decision making
    code: "uint32 bestNode = 0;\nfor (uint32 nodeId : availableNodes) {\n    if (validator.IsFlightNodeDiscovered(bot,\
      \ nodeId)) {\n        bestNode = nodeId;\n        break; // Found first discovered\
      \ node\n    }\n}\nif (bestNode != 0) {\n    bot->GetMotionMaster()->MoveTaxiPath(bestNode);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's flight path discovery flags
    stored in the database or in memory. The nodeId parameter should correspond to
    a valid flight path node defined in the game's data files. Performance-wise, this
    check is typically fast as it involves bit flag or database lookup operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Passing an invalid nodeId may result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    return values. This method should only be called for players who are actively
    in the game world, not for offline or ghost characters.
