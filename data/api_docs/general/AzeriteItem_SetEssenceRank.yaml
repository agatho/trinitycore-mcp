  class: AzeriteItem
  method: SetEssenceRank
  signature: void AzeriteItem::SetEssenceRank(int azeriteEssenceId, int rank)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the rank of a specified Azerite essence on the item.
  description: The SetEssenceRank method updates the rank of a given Azerite essence
    associated with the item. This method is typically used in the context of Azerite
    gear progression, where players can enhance their Azerite items by increasing
    the rank of their essences. The method modifies internal data structures to reflect
    the new rank value for the specified essence ID. It's important to note that this
    change may trigger UI updates or other game state modifications depending on how
    it's invoked within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: azeriteEssenceId
    description: The unique identifier of the Azerite essence to update. This ID corresponds
      to a specific type of Azerite essence, such as 'Mastery' or 'Haste'. Valid values
      are defined by the game's Azerite essence database.
  - name: rank
    description: The new rank value for the specified Azerite essence. Ranks typically
      range from 1 to the maximum allowed rank for that essence type, which is determined
      by game mechanics and item level constraints. Negative values or values exceeding
      the maximum rank may be clamped or ignored.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Mastery Essence Rank
    code: "AzeriteItem* item = player->GetItemByEntry(12345);\nif (item)\n{\n    item->SetEssenceRank(10,\
      \ 5); // Sets the Mastery essence to rank 5\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Multiple Essences
    code: "AzeriteItem* item = player->GetItemByEntry(67890);\nif (item)\n{\n    item->SetEssenceRank(10,\
      \ 3); // Set Mastery to rank 3\n    item->SetEssenceRank(15, 2); // Set Haste\
      \ to rank 2\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal state updates and may require synchronization
    with the client-side UI. The implementation should ensure that the provided rank
    does not exceed the maximum allowed for the given essence type. It's recommended
    to validate inputs before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the azeriteEssenceId
    or rank parameters might lead to unexpected behavior or invalid game states. Ensure
    that the essence ID corresponds to an actual Azerite essence in the game database,
    and that the rank is within valid bounds.
