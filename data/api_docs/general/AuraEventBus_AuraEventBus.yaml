documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new AuraEventBus instance for handling aura-related events
    in the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The AuraEventBus constructor initializes the event bus system used
    for managing and dispatching aura-related events within the TrinityCore game engine.
    This class serves as a central hub for registering, triggering, and processing
    events that occur during the application of, modification of, or removal of auras
    from units. It is designed to support the dynamic nature of World of Warcraft's
    spell and buff systems, allowing for efficient event-driven programming patterns
    when dealing with aura states such as application, update, or removal. The initialization
    process sets up internal data structures necessary for tracking registered listeners
    and queued events.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'AuraEventBus eventBus;

      // eventBus is now ready to register listeners and dispatch aura events'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any heavy operations or resource allocation;
    it simply initializes internal state. The actual event handling logic is managed
    through separate registration and dispatch methods. Developers should ensure that
    instances are properly managed to avoid memory leaks.
