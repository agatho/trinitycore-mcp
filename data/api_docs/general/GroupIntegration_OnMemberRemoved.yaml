documentation:
  brief: Handles cleanup and notifications when a player is removed from a group
  description: The OnMemberRemoved method is invoked when a player is removed from
    a group, either through explicit removal, disbanding, or leaving. This method
    performs necessary cleanup operations such as updating group member counts, notifying
    other members of the change, and potentially triggering quest or achievement updates
    related to group participation. The method ensures that the group state remains
    consistent after member removal and handles any required internal bookkeeping
    for the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object from which the member was removed. Must
      be a valid group instance, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  - name: member
    description: Pointer to the Player object that was removed from the group. Must
      represent a valid player in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group management
    code: "void MyGroupHandler::HandlePlayerLeave(Group* group, Player* player)\n\
      {\n    // Perform custom logic before removal\n    if (group && player)\n  \
      \  {\n        group->RemoveMember(player->GetGUID());\n        GroupIntegration::OnMemberRemoved(group,\
      \ player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom group systems
    code: "class CustomGroupSystem\n{\npublic:\n    void OnPlayerRemovedFromGroup(Group*\
      \ group, Player* player)\n    {\n        // Update custom tracking systems\n\
      \        UpdatePlayerTracking(player);\n        \n        // Notify external\
      \ services\n        SendGroupUpdateNotification(group, player);\n        \n\
      \        // Call base implementation\n        GroupIntegration::OnMemberRemoved(group,\
      \ player);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    group membership changes occur. Developers should not directly invoke this method
    unless implementing custom group behavior. The method assumes that the group and
    member parameters are valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Calling this method with null pointers for either parameter may lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure proper validation of group and player objects
    before calling. This method modifies internal group state, so calling it outside
    of appropriate framework contexts can cause inconsistencies.
