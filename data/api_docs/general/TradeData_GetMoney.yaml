documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the amount of money involved in a trade transaction
  description: The GetMoney method returns the total amount of gold coins that have
    been placed into the trade window by either player during a trade session. This
    value represents the monetary component of the trade and is typically used to
    validate trade offers, calculate refunds, or update player currency displays.
    The returned value is expressed in copper coins (the base unit of WoW currency),
    where 100 copper equals 1 silver and 100 silver equals 1 gold. This method is
    commonly called when processing trade confirmations or when updating the UI to
    reflect the current money amount in the trade window.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the total amount of money (in copper) currently
    in the trade window. Returns 0 if no money has been added to the trade.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve money from a trade
    code: "TradeData* trade = player1->GetTradeData();\nint moneyAmount = trade->GetMoney();\n\
      if (moneyAmount > 0)\n{\n    // Process the trade with the specified amount\
      \ of money\n    sLog->outString(\"Trade contains %d gold\", moneyAmount / 10000);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only returns the money value and does not account for item values
    or other trade components. The returned value is read-only and should not be modified
    directly. In a typical trade scenario, this value would be updated whenever a
    player adds or removes gold from their trade window.
