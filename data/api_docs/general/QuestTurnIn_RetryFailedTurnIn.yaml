  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: RetryFailedTurnIn
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::RetryFailedTurnIn(Player * bot, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Retries a failed quest turn-in for the specified player and quest ID.
  description: The RetryFailedTurnIn method attempts to reprocess a previously failed
    quest turn-in for a given player and quest ID. This functionality is typically
    used in automated questing systems or bots to handle cases where a quest submission
    failed due to temporary issues such as network latency, server lag, or invalid
    state. The method ensures that the quest is properly validated and submitted again,
    maintaining consistency with the game's quest progression logic. It assumes that
    the player has already completed the necessary quest requirements and that the
    quest is in a retryable state.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot attempting the
      quest turn-in.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest that needs to be retried for turn-in.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Retry Usage
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume initialized player object

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      QuestTurnIn::RetryFailedTurnIn(myBot, questId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a previous turn-in attempt has failed.
    It does not validate whether the quest is actually completable or if the player
    meets all requirements again. The underlying implementation may perform checks
    to avoid duplicate submissions.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the original turn-in failed
    can lead to unintended behavior, such as duplicate quest rewards or invalid state
    transitions. Ensure proper error handling and validation before invoking RetryFailedTurnIn.
