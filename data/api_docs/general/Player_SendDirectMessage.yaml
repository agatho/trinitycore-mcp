  class: Player
  method: SendDirectMessage
  signature: void Player::SendDirectMessage(const WorldPacket * data) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a direct message to the player's client using a WorldPacket.
  description: This method sends a WorldPacket containing raw data directly to the
    player's client, bypassing the normal packet handling mechanisms. It is typically
    used for sending specific game messages or updates that require immediate delivery
    without being processed through the standard packet queue. The method operates
    on the principle that the WorldPacket contains formatted data ready for transmission,
    and it ensures the message reaches the player's client in a timely manner.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: A pointer to a WorldPacket containing the raw data to be sent to
      the player's client. This packet must be properly formatted with valid data
      and header information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'WorldPacket packet(SMSG_UPDATE_OBJECT, 100);

      packet << uint8(1);

      packet << uint64(0);

      player->SendDirectMessage(&packet);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it bypasses normal packet processing
    and can potentially cause issues if the WorldPacket is not properly formatted.
    It's typically reserved for special cases where immediate delivery of data is
    required.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to client-side crashes or malformed
    packet errors. Ensure the WorldPacket is correctly formatted before sending, as
    it bypasses normal packet validation mechanisms.
