    & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one PacketPoolManager object to another
  description: The assignment operator for PacketPoolManager performs a deep copy
    of all internal data members from the source object to the target object. This
    method ensures that both objects maintain independent copies of their packet pool
    resources, preventing shared state issues. In the context of TrinityCore's networking
    system, this operation is crucial when managing packet memory pools used for efficient
    network communication between the server and clients. The assignment maintains
    thread safety by properly handling concurrent access to packet resources during
    the copy process.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source PacketPoolManager object whose contents will be copied
      to this instance
  returns: A reference to the current PacketPoolManager object, allowing for chaining
    of assignment operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Usage
    code: 'PacketPoolManager manager1;

      PacketPoolManager manager2 = manager1; // Uses copy constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      manager2 = manager1; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Operations
    code: 'PacketPoolManager pool1, pool2, pool3;

      // Perform multiple assignments

      pool1 = pool2 = pool3; // All pools will contain identical data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements a copy-and-swap idiom or similar pattern
    to ensure strong exception safety. The implementation should handle potential
    memory allocation failures gracefully and maintain consistency of packet pool
    states across all instances.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning large packet pool managers as this operation
    may involve significant memory copying and could impact performance in high-frequency
    scenarios. Avoid unnecessary assignments in performance-critical code paths.
