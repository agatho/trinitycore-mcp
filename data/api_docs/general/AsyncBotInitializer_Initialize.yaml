  class: AsyncBotInitializer
  method: Initialize
  signature: void AsyncBotInitializer::Initialize(size_t numWorkerThreads)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the asynchronous bot initializer with a specified number of worker
    threads.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the AsyncBotInitializer class to manage
    a pool of worker threads for handling asynchronous bot operations. This method
    must be called before any bot initialization tasks can be executed. It configures
    internal thread management structures and prepares the system for concurrent bot
    processing. The number of worker threads determines how many bots can be initialized
    simultaneously without blocking each other.
  parameters:
  - name: numWorkerThreads
    description: Specifies the number of concurrent worker threads to create for asynchronous
      bot initialization. Must be a positive integer greater than zero.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'AsyncBotInitializer initializer;

      initializer.Initialize(4); // Create 4 worker threads'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization with Dynamic Thread Count
    code: 'AsyncBotInitializer initializer;

      size_t threadCount = std::thread::hardware_concurrency();

      initializer.Initialize(threadCount); // Use system''s hardware concurrency'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called once during application startup or when the
    bot system needs to be reconfigured. The worker threads are created immediately
    upon calling this method and remain active until the object is destroyed. Thread
    safety is ensured internally within the implementation.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times on the same instance may result in undefined
    behavior or resource leaks. Ensure that no initialization tasks are running when
    calling this method. The number of worker threads should be carefully chosen based
    on system resources and expected load to avoid performance degradation.
