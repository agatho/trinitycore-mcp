documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player has a riding skill available.
  description: The HasRidingSkill method determines whether a player character possesses
    the necessary riding skill to mount and control a vehicle or creature in World
    of Warcraft. This method typically evaluates the player's current skill level,
    class restrictions, and any applicable requirements for riding. It is commonly
    used within the MountManager class to validate if a player can engage with riding
    mechanics such as mounting creatures or vehicles. The method returns true if the
    player meets all conditions for riding, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or internal
      data structure. This parameter is expected to be a valid reference to a player
      object within the TrinityCore framework.
  returns: Returns true if the player has the required riding skill and can mount
    creatures or vehicles; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HasRidingSkill
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nif (mountManager.HasRidingSkill(&playerId)) {\n\
      \    // Player can mount\n    std::cout << \"Player has riding skill\" << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    // Player cannot mount\n    std::cout << \"Player lacks riding\
      \ skill\" << std::endl;\n}"

  notes: This method relies on internal player data structures and may involve checks
    against the player's class, level, and learned skills. It is recommended to ensure
    that the player pointer is valid before calling this function to avoid undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the player parameter points to a valid player object; otherwise,
    calling this method could result in memory access violations or incorrect results.
    The method may not account for temporary skill modifiers or buffs applied during
    gameplay.
