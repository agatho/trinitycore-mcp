documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot action queue contains no pending actions
  description: The Empty method determines if the BotActionQueue is currently devoid
    of any queued actions. This is a read-only operation that provides immediate feedback
    on the queue's state without modifying it. In the context of TrinityCore's AI
    system, this method is commonly used to determine whether a bot has completed
    all its assigned tasks or if there are pending actions waiting to be executed.
    The method performs a simple check on an internal counter or flag that tracks
    the number of queued items.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the queue contains no actions, false otherwise. This boolean
    value allows for straightforward conditional logic in AI decision-making processes.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if bot queue is empty before adding new actions
    code: "if (bot->GetActionQueue()->Empty()) {\n    bot->AddAction(new MoveToAction(targetPosition));\n\
      \    bot->AddAction(new AttackAction(targetUnit));\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Empty() in a loop to process all queued actions
    code: "while (!bot->GetActionQueue()->Empty()) {\n    BotAction* action = bot->GetActionQueue()->Front();\n\
      \    action->Execute(bot);\n    bot->GetActionQueue()->Pop();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented as a constant-time operation, making
    it efficient for frequent checks. The implementation likely uses an internal counter
    or boolean flag rather than iterating through all queued items. In multi-threaded
    environments, developers should be aware that the queue state might change between
    the time of the check and subsequent operations.
  warnings: While this method is safe to call frequently, relying on its return value
    for critical game logic may lead to race conditions in concurrent scenarios. The
    method does not provide thread safety guarantees, so callers should ensure proper
    synchronization if needed.
