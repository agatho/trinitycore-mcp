  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: ScanForTrendBreakouts
  signature: int MarketAnalysis::ScanForTrendBreakouts()
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes market data to identify potential trend breakouts and returns the
    count of detected breakouts.
  description: The ScanForTrendBreakouts method performs a comprehensive analysis
    of current market trends within the TrinityCore environment, specifically focusing
    on identifying instances where item prices or demand patterns have broken from
    established trends. This method examines historical pricing data, transaction
    volumes, and seasonal fluctuations to detect significant shifts that may indicate
    new market opportunities or disruptions. The function is designed to be used in
    conjunction with the auction house system and market monitoring tools to provide
    actionable insights for players engaged in economic activities within World of
    Warcraft. It typically runs during periodic market updates or when triggered by
    specific user commands.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the number of trend breakouts detected
    during the scan. A return value of zero indicates no significant breakouts were
    identified, while positive integers indicate the count of detected breakouts.
    Negative values may be used to denote errors or invalid states, though this behavior
    should be confirmed through implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "MarketAnalysis analyzer;\nint breakoutCount = analyzer.ScanForTrendBreakouts();\n\
      if (breakoutCount > 0) {\n    printf(\"Detected %d potential market breakouts\\\
      n\", breakoutCount);\n} else if (breakoutCount == 0) {\n    printf(\"No significant\
      \ breakouts detected.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Auction House
    code: "void ProcessMarketTrends() {\n    MarketAnalysis analyzer;\n    int result\
      \ = analyzer.ScanForTrendBreakouts();\n    if (result > 0) {\n        // Notify\
      \ players of potential opportunities\n        SendSystemMessage(\"Market alert:\
      \ %d trend breakouts detected!\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal market data structures and may require
    sufficient historical data to produce meaningful results. Performance could be
    impacted by the volume of items being analyzed, especially during peak server
    activity times. The method should ideally be called asynchronously or during off-peak
    hours to avoid affecting gameplay performance.
  warnings: Improper handling of the return value may lead to incorrect market analysis
    conclusions. Developers should verify that sufficient data exists before calling
    this method. Additionally, frequent calls without proper throttling may cause
    performance degradation in high-traffic environments.
