  class: Garrison
  method: Enter
  signature: void Garrison::Enter() const
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the player's entry into their garrison, setting up the garrison
    environment and associated systems.
  description: The Enter method is responsible for initializing a player's garrison
    experience upon entering it. This includes setting up the garrison's visual environment,
    loading necessary data structures, and preparing the player's session for garrison-related
    activities such as building management, mission assignments, and resource handling.
    The method typically ensures that all garrison-related systems are properly initialized
    and that the player's client is synchronized with the server-side garrison state.
    It may also handle any prerequisite checks or setup routines required before allowing
    full access to garrison features.

  - title: Basic Usage in Player Login Context
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterGarrison(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->GetGarrison())\n\
      \    {\n        player->GetGarrison()->Enter();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    a player enters their garrison area. Developers should not need to call this directly
    unless implementing custom garrison entry logic or handling special cases where
    automatic entry fails.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of proper game context may result in undefined
    behavior or client-server synchronization issues. Ensure that the player has a
    valid garrison before invoking this method.
