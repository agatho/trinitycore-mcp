documentation:
  brief: Updates the management state of traps for a Beast Mastery hunter, including
    trap placement, activation, and removal logic.
  description: The UpdateTrapManagement method handles the core logic for managing
    traps in the Beast Mastery hunter's gameplay. This includes checking if traps
    are ready to be placed, verifying valid placement conditions, handling trap activation
    triggers, and managing trap removal when they expire or are destroyed. The method
    integrates with the hunter's pet behavior system to ensure traps are properly
    positioned and function according to game mechanics. It also manages cooldowns
    and resource consumption for trap usage, ensuring that the hunter's trap management
    remains synchronized with their overall combat strategy.

  - title: Basic trap management update call
    code: "void UpdateTrapManagement()\n{\n    // Internal logic for updating trap\
      \ state\n    if (m_trapCooldown <= 0)\n    {\n        PlaceTrap();\n    }\n\
      \    else\n    {\n        UpdateTrapCooldown();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the hunter's update cycle and should
    be invoked regularly to maintain trap state consistency. The implementation may
    vary based on specific hunter specialization and gear effects that modify trap
    behavior.
