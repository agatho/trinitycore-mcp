documentation:
  brief: Calculates the healing amount for Emerald Blossom spell based on caster's
    stats
  description: The CalculateEmeraldBlossomHealing method computes the total healing
    value that an Evoker would deal with the Emerald Blossom spell. This calculation
    takes into account the caster's spell power, critical strike chance, and other
    relevant stat modifiers to determine the final healing output. The method is typically
    invoked during spell execution when the Emerald Blossom effect needs to be resolved.
    It returns a signed integer representing the calculated healing amount which can
    be positive or negative depending on whether the spell heals or damages.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the caster's object data structure containing relevant
      stats and properties needed for healing calculation
  returns: Returns an integer representing the calculated healing amount. Positive
    values indicate healing, while negative values may represent damage or special
    effects depending on implementation context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of Emerald Blossom healing calculation
    code: 'EvokerCalculator calculator;

      Unit* evoker = GetPlayer()->GetSelectedUnit();

      int healingAmount = calculator.CalculateEmeraldBlossomHealing(&evoker);

      // healingAmount now contains the calculated healing value for Emerald Blossom'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the caster parameter points to a valid Unit object
    with proper spell power and stat data. The calculation may involve randomization
    for critical strikes or other probabilistic effects. Performance is generally
    fast as it only involves basic arithmetic operations on stored stats.
  warnings: Ensure that the caster pointer is not null before calling this method,
    as dereferencing a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. The method does
    not validate if the caster is actually an Evoker class or has the required spell
    knowledge.
