  class: CreatureAggroGracePeriodExpiredNotifier
  method: Visit
  signature: void CreatureAggroGracePeriodExpiredNotifier::Visit(int & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the expiration of a creature's aggro grace period by processing the
    affected creature.
  description: The Visit method in the CreatureAggroGracePeriodExpiredNotifier class
    is responsible for managing the behavior when a creature's aggro grace period
    has expired. This typically occurs after a creature has been initialized or reset,
    during which it is immune to aggro from players. Once the grace period ends, this
    method ensures that the creature becomes vulnerable to player attacks and can
    begin normal combat behavior. The method operates on an integer parameter representing
    the creature's unique identifier or index within the system, allowing for targeted
    processing of specific creatures.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An integer parameter that represents the unique identifier or index
      of the creature whose aggro grace period has expired. This value is used to
      locate and process the specific creature object within the game world.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Processing a Creature's Grace Period Expiration
    code: 'CreatureAggroGracePeriodExpiredNotifier notifier;

      int creatureId = 12345;

      notifier.Visit(creatureId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore AI system
    when a creature's grace period timer expires. It should not be called directly
    unless implementing custom AI behavior or debugging purposes. The integer parameter
    must correspond to a valid creature instance in the game world.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid creature ID may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the provided identifier refers to an active creature
    before invoking this method.
