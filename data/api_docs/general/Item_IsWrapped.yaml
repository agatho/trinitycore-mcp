documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the item is wrapped, returning true if the item has been
    wrapped by another item.
  description: The IsWrapped method checks if an item has been wrapped by another
    item, typically in the context of a player's inventory or bank. This method is
    used to identify items that have been placed inside other items, such as when
    an item is placed inside a container or when an item is wrapped by another item.
    It returns true if the item is currently wrapped, false otherwise. The method
    is particularly useful for determining item properties in game mechanics related
    to item stacking and container management.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item is wrapped by another item, false otherwise. This
    indicates that the item has been placed inside another item or container.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Item* item = new Item();\nif (item->IsWrapped()) {\n    // Item is wrapped\n\
      }\nelse {\n    // Item is not wrapped\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Inventory Check Example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByGUID(12345);\nif (item && item->IsWrapped())\
      \ {\n    // Item is wrapped by another item\n}\nelse {\n    // Item is not wrapped\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other item-related methods
    to determine item properties. It may be affected by item stacking and container
    mechanics. Performance considerations are minimal as this method simply checks
    internal item flags.
  warnings: This method does not distinguish between different types of wrapping;
    it only indicates whether an item is wrapped or not. Be cautious when using this
    method in conjunction with other item property checks to avoid confusion.
