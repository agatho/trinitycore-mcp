documentation:
  brief: Updates all active buff states and modifiers for the Fury Warrior class.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for refreshing and applying all
    active buffs, debuffs, and aura effects that are currently affecting a Fury Warrior
    character. This method typically runs during each update cycle to ensure that
    the warrior's stats, abilities, and combat performance accurately reflect their
    current buff status. It handles the logic for applying stat modifiers, cooldown
    reductions, damage multipliers, and other gameplay mechanics tied to active buffs.
    The method may also manage the expiration of temporary effects and the reapplication
    of recurring buffs such as those from talents or equipment.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update Loop
    code: "void CombatUpdate()\n{\n    furyWarrior.UpdateBuffs();\n    // Other combat\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Warrior AI
    code: "class MyFuryAI : public FuryWarriorRefactored\n{\npublic:\n    void OnCombatStart()\n\
      \    {\n        UpdateBuffs();\n        // Initialize combat state\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to maintain accurate
    character state. It may internally iterate through all active auras and apply
    their effects, which could have performance implications if many buffs are active
    simultaneously.
  warnings: Modifying buff states directly without calling this method may result
    in inconsistent character stats or abilities. This method should not be called
    during critical sections where aura application might cause race conditions or
    state corruption.
