  method: IsGroupMemberInterrupting
  signature: bool InterruptManager::IsGroupMemberInterrupting(const InterruptTarget
    & target)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if any group member is currently interrupting the specified target.
  description: The IsGroupMemberInterrupting method determines whether any player
    within the current player's group is in the process of interrupting the given
    target. This functionality is typically used in combat scenarios to prevent multiple
    group members from interrupting the same spell or ability simultaneously. The
    method evaluates the interrupt state of all group members and returns true if
    at least one member is actively interrupting the target. It relies on internal
    tracking of interrupting actions within the group context.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The InterruptTarget object representing the entity being interrupted.
      This parameter defines what target is being checked for active interruptions
      by group members.
  returns: Returns true if any group member is currently interrupting the specified
    target; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check group interruption status
    code: "if (interruptManager.IsGroupMemberInterrupting(target)) {\n    // Handle\
      \ case where group is interrupting target\n    sLog->outString(\"Group is interrupting\
      \ the target.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in combat logic to prevent redundant interrupts
    code: "if (!interruptManager.IsGroupMemberInterrupting(target)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with interrupting the target\n    player->InterruptSpellWithSpellType(SPELL_INTERRUPT_TYPE_INTERRUPT);\n\
      } else {\n    // Skip interrupt as group already handling it\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Skipping interrupt - group already interrupting.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the target parameter is valid and properly initialized.
    The internal tracking of group interruptions relies on the current player's group
    context, so it should only be called when the player is in a group. Performance
    impact is minimal as it performs simple state checks.
  warnings: Ensure that the InterruptTarget object passed to this method is valid
    and represents an active combatant. Calling this method outside of combat or with
    invalid targets may lead to unexpected behavior. The method does not validate
    the target's current interruptibility status.
