documentation:
  brief: Retrieves and returns the stored value of a specific type from the Value
    object.
  description: The Get method is used to extract and return the value stored within
    a Value object, which is typically used in AI decision-making systems. It takes
    a BotAI pointer as input and returns a std::any object that can hold any type
    of value. The method allows for type-safe retrieval of data from AI-related structures,
    enabling bots to access contextual information during gameplay. This functionality
    is essential for implementing complex AI behaviors where different types of data
    need to be dynamically accessed based on the current game state or decision context.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that provides context for retrieving
      the value. This parameter is required and must point to a valid BotAI object
      for proper functionality.
  returns: Returns a std::any object containing the stored value of arbitrary type.
    The actual type of the returned value depends on what was previously set in the
    Value object. If no value has been set, the returned std::any may be empty or
    contain a default-constructed value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve an integer value
    code: 'Value* val = new Value();

      val->Set(42);

      std::any result = val->Get(ai);

      int number = std::any_cast<int>(result);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Retrieving a string value in AI decision context
    code: 'Value* targetName = new Value();

      targetName->Set(std::string("Goblin"));

      std::any result = targetName->Get(ai);

      std::string name = std::any_cast<std::string>(result);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on the BotAI context to properly interpret and retrieve
    values. It's important to ensure that the correct type is specified when using
    std::any_cast to avoid runtime exceptions. The Value class likely uses internal
    type tracking or metadata to support this dynamic retrieval mechanism.
  warnings: Using std::any_cast without checking the type can lead to std::bad_any_cast
    exceptions. Always verify the type before casting, especially in AI systems where
    multiple data types might be stored and retrieved dynamically.
