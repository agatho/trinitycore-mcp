documentation:
  brief: Destroys the DPSPositioning object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the DPSPositioning class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the object's
    lifetime. This method ensures proper resource deallocation when an instance of
    DPSPositioning goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's
    AI and combat systems, this class likely manages positioning logic for DPS characters,
    and its destructor handles cleanup of any internal data structures or state tracking
    related to positioning calculations.

  - title: Basic Object Destruction
    code: 'DPSPositioning* dpsPos = new DPSPositioning();

      // ... use the object ...

      delete dpsPos; // Triggers ~DPSPositioning()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless the object was allocated
    on the heap. It is automatically invoked when objects go out of scope or are deleted.
    Developers should ensure that no other pointers reference the object after deletion
    to prevent dangling pointer issues.
