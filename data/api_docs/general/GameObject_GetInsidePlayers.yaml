documentation:
  brief: Returns pointer to array of player GUIDs inside GameObject
  description: This method retrieves the list of player GUIDs that are currently inside
    the GameObject. It is used primarily for managing interactions between players
    and game objects, particularly in scenarios where a GameObject might contain multiple
    players such as in certain quest events or instance encounters. The returned pointer
    points to an array that can be iterated over to access individual player GUIDs,
    with the array size determined by the number of players currently inside the object.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to an array of player GUIDs (int) that are currently
    inside this GameObject. The array is null-terminated and contains the GUIDs of
    all players currently inside the object. If no players are inside, returns nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "GameObject* go = ...;\nconst int* players = go->GetInsidePlayers();\nif(players\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    for(int i = 0; players[i] != 0; ++i)\n    {\n        uint32\
      \ playerGuid = players[i];\n        // Process player GUID\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other GameObject methods
    like GetGOData or GetGODataForPlayer to manage player interactions within the
    game object. The returned array may be modified by external functions, so caution
    should be taken when using this method in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Care must be taken when iterating over the returned array as it can be
    null-terminated and may not always contain valid GUIDs. Also, players might leave
    the GameObject during iteration, which could lead to invalid memory access if
    not handled properly.
