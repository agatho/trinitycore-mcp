documentation:
  brief: Checks if an object entry and private owner exist for the given object pointer
  description: The ObjectEntryAndPrivateOwnerIfExistsCheck::operator() method performs
    a validation check to determine whether a specified object has both a valid entry
    identifier and a private owner assigned. This is commonly used in TrinityCore's
    object management system to ensure data integrity when processing game objects,
    particularly during operations such as object spawning, despawning, or ownership
    transfer. The method takes an integer pointer representing the object and returns
    true if both conditions are met, otherwise false. It serves as a predicate for
    filtering or validating objects within container-based algorithms.
  parameters:
  - name: object
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the object identifier. This parameter
      is expected to point to a valid object entry in the game world's object registry.
  returns: Returns true if the object pointed to by 'object' has both a valid entry
    and a private owner assigned; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Predicate Context
    code: "std::vector<int*> objectList;\n// Assume objectList is populated with valid\
      \ object pointers\nauto it = std::remove_if(objectList.begin(), objectList.end(),\n\
      \    [](int* obj) { return ObjectEntryAndPrivateOwnerIfExistsCheck{}(obj); });\n\
      objectList.erase(it, objectList.end());"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Individual Object Validity
    code: "int testObject = 12345;\nbool isValid = ObjectEntryAndPrivateOwnerIfExistsCheck{}(&testObject);\n\
      if (isValid) {\n    // Proceed with object operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with STL algorithms like std::remove_if
    or as part of conditional logic within game systems that require strict validation
    of object state. It assumes the input pointer points to a valid integer representing
    an object entry and does not perform null checking itself.
  warnings: Ensure that the integer pointed to by 'object' is actually a valid object
    identifier managed by TrinityCore's core systems. Using invalid or uninitialized
    pointers may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
