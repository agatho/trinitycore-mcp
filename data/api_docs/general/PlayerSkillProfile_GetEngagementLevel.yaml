  method: GetEngagementLevel
  signature: float PlayerSkillProfile::GetEngagementLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the player's current engagement level based on skill
    usage and activity.
  description: The GetEngagementLevel method computes a float value representing how
    actively engaged the player is with their skills. This metric typically reflects
    the frequency and intensity of skill usage over a defined time period, which can
    be used for game balance, achievement tracking, or player behavior analysis. The
    engagement level may consider factors such as recent skill casts, cooldowns, and
    overall activity within the game context. The method does not modify any internal
    state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 that represents the player's engagement
    level. A value of 0.0 indicates no engagement, while 1.0 indicates maximum engagement.
    Intermediate values reflect varying degrees of skill usage activity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float engagement = player->GetSkillProfile()->GetEngagementLevel();\nif\
      \ (engagement > 0.7f)\n{\n    // Player is highly engaged\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Engagement Level for UI Display
    code: 'PlayerSkillProfile* profile = player->GetSkillProfile();

      float level = profile->GetEngagementLevel();

      std::string status = (level > 0.8f) ? "Highly Active" : (level > 0.5f) ? "Moderately
      Active" : "Inactive";

      player->SendNotification("Your engagement level: " + status);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal tracking mechanisms to determine skill activity,
    and may reset or decay values over time. It is recommended to cache this value
    if used frequently in performance-sensitive code paths.
  warnings: The engagement level calculation might be influenced by server-side settings
    or game mechanics that could change between patches. Ensure compatibility with
    current TrinityCore versions when relying on specific behavior.
