documentation:
  brief: Manages inventory space for a player during trade operations
  description: The ManageInventorySpace method handles the allocation and deallocation
    of inventory slots when players engage in trading activities. It ensures that
    both parties have sufficient space in their inventories to complete the trade,
    preventing overflow or invalid transactions. This method is typically invoked
    during trade initialization and validation phases to maintain game balance and
    prevent exploits related to inventory manipulation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trade Space Management
    code: "void HandleTradeStart(Player* player1, Player* player2) {\n    // Initialize\
      \ trade\n    TradeSystem::ManageInventorySpace(player1);\n    TradeSystem::ManageInventorySpace(player2);\n\
      \    // Proceed with trade logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any trade operations begin to ensure
    both players have adequate inventory space. It may internally check for item stack
    limits and container capacity constraints.
  warnings: Failure to call this method before trading can result in invalid trades
    or client-side errors. The method assumes valid player pointers and does not perform
    null checks.
