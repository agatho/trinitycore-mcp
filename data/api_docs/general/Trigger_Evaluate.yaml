  class: Trigger
  method: Evaluate
  signature: TriggerResult Trigger::Evaluate(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates the trigger condition and returns whether it is met.
  description: The Evaluate method assesses the current state of a trigger within
    the AI system to determine if its conditions are satisfied. This method is typically
    called by the BotAI framework during decision-making processes to check if specific
    events or states have occurred that would prompt an action. The evaluation considers
    various factors such as player location, health status, combat state, and other
    relevant game mechanics. It serves as a core component in the conditional logic
    system of the AI behavior tree.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a TriggerResult enum value indicating whether the trigger condition
    is met (true) or not (false). The result may also include additional metadata
    about the evaluation outcome, such as timing information or specific conditions
    that were checked.
  examples:
  - title: Basic trigger evaluation
    code: "TriggerResult result = trigger->Evaluate(ai);\nif (result == TRIGGER_TRUE)\
      \ {\n    // Execute action when trigger is met\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently during AI processing cycles to ensure
    timely detection of trigger conditions. The evaluation logic may involve complex
    checks and should not be computationally expensive to maintain good performance
    in real-time gameplay scenarios.
  warnings: Improper implementation of trigger evaluation logic can lead to incorrect
    AI behavior or performance bottlenecks. Ensure that all referenced game state
    information is valid before performing evaluations.
