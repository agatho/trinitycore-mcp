  method: GetChanceMultiplier
  signature: uint32 AuctionBotBuyer::GetChanceMultiplier(uint32 quality)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the chance multiplier for purchasing items based on
    their quality level.
  description: The GetChanceMultiplier method determines a multiplier value that influences
    the probability of an auction bot buyer purchasing an item, depending on the item's
    quality. This multiplier is used internally by the AuctionBot system to adjust
    buying behavior according to item rarity or desirability. The method takes a quality
    parameter which represents the item's quality level (typically ranging from 0
    for poor to 7 for legendary), and returns a corresponding multiplier value that
    scales the chance of purchase. Higher quality items may have different multipliers
    to reflect their increased value or desirability in the auction house system.
  parameters:
  - name: quality
    description: The quality level of the item, typically ranging from 0 (poor) to
      7 (legendary). This parameter determines which multiplier is returned based
      on predefined quality tiers.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the chance multiplier for purchasing
    an item of the specified quality. The exact value depends on internal configuration
    and may be used to scale probabilities in auction bot decision-making logic.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: uint32 chanceMultiplier = buyer.GetChanceMultiplier(4); // Gets multiplier
      for rare quality items
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Multiplier in Decision Logic
    code: "uint32 quality = 6; // Legendary item\nuint32 multiplier = buyer.GetChanceMultiplier(quality);\n\
      if (rand() % 100 < multiplier) {\n    // Proceed with purchase logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal configuration tables or constants to map
    quality levels to chance multipliers. The returned values are typically used in
    probabilistic calculations within the auction bot's purchasing algorithm.
  warnings: Ensure that the quality parameter is within valid bounds (typically 0-7)
    to avoid unexpected behavior or out-of-bounds access in internal lookup tables.
