  brief: Processes and handles crafting materials for auction house transactions
  description: The HandleCraftingMaterials method manages the retrieval and processing
    of crafting materials associated with items listed on the auction house. This
    method is responsible for ensuring that players can properly access and utilize
    crafting materials when buying or selling items through the auction system. It
    likely performs validation checks to confirm material availability and player
    permissions before allowing transactions to proceed. The method may also update
    internal data structures tracking material inventories and player resource allocations.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      or index within the game system
  returns: null

    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      AuctionHouse auctionHouse;

      auctionHouse.HandleCraftingMaterials(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's inventory system and may trigger
    database updates to reflect material changes. Developers should ensure proper
    error handling when processing materials that might not be available or accessible
    to the specified player.
  warnings: Care must be taken when passing player identifiers to avoid invalid memory
    access. The method assumes valid player data exists at the provided pointer location.
