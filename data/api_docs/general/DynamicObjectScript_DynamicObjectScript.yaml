  class: DynamicObjectScript
  method: DynamicObjectScript
  signature: void DynamicObjectScript::DynamicObjectScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a DynamicObjectScript with the specified name for handling dynamic
    object events in TrinityCore.
  description: The DynamicObjectScript constructor initializes a script instance that
    can be used to handle events related to dynamic objects within the TrinityCore
    world. This constructor sets up the script's internal state and registers it with
    the core system so that it can respond to dynamic object creation, update, and
    destruction events. Dynamic objects in World of Warcraft are temporary game entities
    such as area effects from spells, traps, or environmental effects that exist for
    a limited time or under specific conditions. The name parameter serves as an identifier
    for this particular script instance, allowing the core to route relevant events
    to the correct handler. This constructor is typically called during server initialization
    or when loading scripts from configuration files.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated string that uniquely identifies this DynamicObjectScript
      instance. This name is used internally by TrinityCore to register and dispatch
      events to the appropriate script handler. The name should be unique among all
      registered dynamic object scripts to avoid conflicts.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic DynamicObjectScript Initialization
    code: "class MyDynamicObjectScript : public DynamicObjectScript\n{\npublic:\n\
      \    MyDynamicObjectScript() : DynamicObjectScript(\"MyCustomDynamicObjectScript\"\
      ) {}\n\n    void OnAddToWorld(DynamicObject* dynamicObject) override\n    {\n\
      \        // Handle dynamic object addition to world\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering a Custom DynamicObjectScript
    code: "class FireballAOEScript : public DynamicObjectScript\n{\npublic:\n    FireballAOEScript()\
      \ : DynamicObjectScript(\"FireballAOE\") {}\n\n    void OnUpdate(DynamicObject*\
      \ dynamicObject, uint32 diff) override\n    {\n        // Update logic for fireball\
      \ area effect\n        if (dynamicObject->GetDuration() <= 0)\n            dynamicObject->Remove();\n\
      \    }\n};\n\n// In your script loading code:\nvoid AddSC_FireballAOE()\n{\n\
      \    new FireballAOEScript();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically not called directly by user code but rather
    through the scripting system or when deriving from DynamicObjectScript. The name
    parameter must be unique across all registered scripts to prevent event routing
    conflicts. DynamicObjectScript instances are managed by the TrinityCore core and
    should not be manually deleted unless explicitly handled by the script lifecycle
    management.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly with duplicate names as it may cause
    event routing issues. Ensure that any derived classes properly implement virtual
    methods to handle dynamic object events, otherwise unexpected behavior may occur
    when dynamic objects are created or updated in the world.
