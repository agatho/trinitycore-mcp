  class: Battlefield
  method: GetGraveyardVector
  signature: GraveyardVect Battlefield::GetGraveyardVector() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the vector of graveyards associated with the battlefield.
  description: The GetGraveyardVector method retrieves a collection of graveyard structures
    that are linked to the current battlefield instance. This vector contains all
    the graveyards where players can be resurrected during battlefield combat. The
    method is typically used by the battlefield system to manage player respawns and
    to determine valid resurrection points for players who have died in the battlefield
    zone. The returned vector is read-only and should not be modified directly.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a vector of graveyard structures (GraveyardVect)
    that are associated with this battlefield instance. Each element in the vector
    represents a valid graveyard location for resurrection during battlefield events.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Battlefield Graveyards
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(1234);\n\
      if (bf)\n{\n    const Battlefield::GraveyardVect& graveyards = bf->GetGraveyardVector();\n\
      \    for (auto& graveyard : graveyards)\n    {\n        // Process each graveyard\
      \ in the battlefield\n        sLog->outString(\"Graveyard ID: %u, Location:\
      \ (%f, %f)\", \n                       graveyard->GetID(), \n              \
      \         graveyard->GetX(), \n                       graveyard->GetY());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battlefield management system and should only
    be called on active battlefield instances. The returned vector is cached internally
    and may not reflect real-time changes to graveyard assignments during a battlefield
    event.
