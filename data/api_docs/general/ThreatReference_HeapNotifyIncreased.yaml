  class: ThreatReference
  method: HeapNotifyIncreased
  signature: void ThreatReference::HeapNotifyIncreased()
documentation:
  brief: Notifies the threat reference that its heap position has increased, triggering
    necessary updates to maintain heap integrity.
  description: The HeapNotifyIncreased method is used within the ThreatReference class
    to signal that the threat value associated with this reference has increased,
    requiring the underlying heap data structure to be adjusted. This typically occurs
    when a creature or player's threat level rises above other entries in the threat
    list. The method ensures that the heap property is maintained by potentially moving
    the element up the heap structure. This is a core part of the threat management
    system used in World of Warcraft's AI behavior, particularly for mob aggro mechanics
    and NPC targeting logic.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Increase Notification
    code: 'ThreatReference* threatRef = new ThreatReference();

      // ... some code that increases threat ...

      threatRef->HeapNotifyIncreased(); // Notify heap of the increase'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the threat system when threat
    values are modified. It's important to ensure that the threat value has actually
    increased before calling this method, as calling it unnecessarily can cause performance
    overhead due to heap reorganization. The method assumes that the underlying heap
    structure is properly initialized and maintained.
  warnings: Calling HeapNotifyIncreased without first increasing the threat value
    may lead to incorrect heap state. This method should only be invoked when a legitimate
    increase in threat has occurred, otherwise heap integrity may be compromised.
