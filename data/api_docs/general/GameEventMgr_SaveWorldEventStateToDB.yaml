  method: SaveWorldEventStateToDB
  signature: void GameEventMgr::SaveWorldEventStateToDB(uint16 event_id)
documentation:
  brief: Saves the state of a specific world event to the database.
  description: The SaveWorldEventStateToDB method persists the current state of a
    specified game event into the database. This ensures that event data such as start
    times, end times, and active status are maintained across server restarts or reboots.
    The method is typically invoked when an event's state changes, allowing the server
    to accurately restore the event state upon next startup. It operates on a per-event
    basis using the event identifier provided as a parameter.
  parameters:
  - name: event_id
    description: The unique identifier of the world event whose state needs to be
      saved to the database. This ID corresponds to entries in the game_event table.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Save State for a Specific Event
    code: GameEventMgr::instance()->SaveWorldEventStateToDB(1234);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the GameEventMgr when event states
    change. It performs database I/O operations, so frequent calls may impact performance.
    Ensure that the event_id corresponds to an existing event in the database.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent event_id may result
    in undefined behavior or database inconsistencies. Always validate the event exists
    before calling this method.
