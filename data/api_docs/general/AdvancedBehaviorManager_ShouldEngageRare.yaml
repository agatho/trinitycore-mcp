  signature: bool AdvancedBehaviorManager::ShouldEngageRare(Creature * rare) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the AI should engage a rare creature based on configured
    behavior settings.
  description: The ShouldEngageRare method evaluates whether the current AdvancedBehaviorManager
    instance allows engagement with a specified rare creature. This decision is typically
    made based on internal configuration flags, player proximity, or other AI-specific
    conditions that control when rare creatures should be targeted. The method does
    not directly perform any combat actions but rather provides a boolean flag indicating
    if engagement is permitted under current AI rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI should engage the rare creature; otherwise returns
    false. A return value of false typically indicates that the AI has determined
    it is not appropriate to initiate combat with the rare at this time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "if (ai->ShouldEngageRare(rareCreature)) {\n    ai->AttackStart(rareCreature);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AdvancedBehaviorManager's core AI decision-making
    logic and may be overridden or extended by custom behavior implementations. It
    assumes that the rare creature pointer is valid and not null.
  warnings: Ensure that the Creature pointer passed to this method is valid before
    calling, as dereferencing an invalid pointer will cause undefined behavior. This
    method should only be called during active AI update cycles where the creature's
    state is stable.
