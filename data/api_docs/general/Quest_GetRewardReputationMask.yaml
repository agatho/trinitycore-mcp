  class: Quest
  method: GetRewardReputationMask
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetRewardReputationMask() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the reputation mask associated with the quest's reward.
  description: This method retrieves the reputation mask value that determines which
    faction(s) the player will gain reputation with upon completing the quest. The
    reputation mask is used to identify specific factions in the game's reputation
    system, allowing for proper handling of reputation gains and rewards. This method
    is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related functions to determine
    the complete reward structure for a quest.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the reputation mask, which corresponds
    to specific faction(s) that will receive reputation gain upon quest completion.
    The value may be zero if no reputation rewards are associated with the quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 mask = quest->GetRewardReputationMask();\nif (mask != 0)\n{\n  \
      \  // Handle reputation reward\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the Quest class and operates on a const object, meaning
    it does not modify the quest data. It should be used in conjunction with other
    quest methods to fully understand the reward structure.
  warnings: This method may return zero if no reputation rewards are defined for the
    quest, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about reputation gain. Always
    check for zero values before proceeding with reputation handling logic.
