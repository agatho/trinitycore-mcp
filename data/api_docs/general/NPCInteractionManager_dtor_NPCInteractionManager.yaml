documentation:
  brief: Destroys the NPC interaction manager instance and releases all associated
    resources.
  description: The destructor for the NPCInteractionManager class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the lifetime of the manager. This includes releasing references to active interactions,
    clearing internal data structures, and ensuring no dangling pointers remain. The
    destructor is automatically invoked when an NPCInteractionManager object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's World of
    Warcraft emulation, this ensures proper cleanup of NPC interaction state when
    a player ends their session or when the manager itself is no longer needed.

  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of NPCInteractionManager
    code: 'NPCInteractionManager* manager = new NPCInteractionManager();

      // ... perform interactions ...

      delete manager; // Triggers ~NPCInteractionManager()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic destruction via stack allocation
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    NPCInteractionManager manager;\n    // ...\
      \ use manager ...\n    // ~NPCInteractionManager() called automatically when\
      \ function exits\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless the object was dynamically
    allocated. It is important to ensure that all interactions are properly ended
    before destruction to avoid potential memory leaks or undefined behavior. The
    implementation may include cleanup of internal maps, lists, or other containers
    that track active NPC interactions.
  warnings: Calling the destructor manually on stack-allocated objects will result
    in undefined behavior. Ensure that any references to the manager are invalidated
    before it is destroyed. In multi-threaded environments, ensure no concurrent access
    occurs during destruction.
