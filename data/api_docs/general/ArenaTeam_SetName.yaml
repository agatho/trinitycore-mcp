  class: ArenaTeam
  method: SetName
  signature: bool ArenaTeam::SetName(const std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the name of the arena team to the specified value.
  description: The SetName method updates the internal name of an arena team instance.
    This method is typically used when modifying the display name of a team in the
    game world. The operation will only succeed if the provided name meets the game's
    naming requirements, such as length and character restrictions. Changes made through
    this method are usually persisted to the database and reflected in the game client
    immediately. The method returns true upon successful update, or false if the name
    is invalid or the update fails for any reason.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The new name to assign to the arena team. Must be a valid string
      that conforms to the game's naming rules, typically between 1 and 24 characters
      in length and containing only alphanumeric characters and spaces.
  returns: Returns true if the name was successfully updated, false otherwise. Failure
    may occur due to invalid name length, prohibited characters, or database update
    errors.
  examples:
  - title: Setting a valid arena team name
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\nif (team)\n\
      {\n    bool success = team->SetName(\"Thunderbolts\");\n    if (success)\n \
      \       TC_LOG_INFO(\"arena\", \"Arena team name updated successfully.\");\n\
      \    else\n        TC_LOG_ERROR(\"arena\", \"Failed to update arena team name.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal validation of the provided name against
    game rules, and may involve database synchronization. It should be used carefully
    in performance-critical sections due to potential database I/O operations.
  warnings: Do not call this method with empty or excessively long names as it will
    likely fail and return false. Ensure that the arena team object is valid before
    calling to avoid undefined behavior.
