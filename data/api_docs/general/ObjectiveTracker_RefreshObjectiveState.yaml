documentation:
  brief: Updates the state of an objective tracker for a specified player.
  description: The RefreshObjectiveState method updates the internal state of an objective
    tracker associated with a given player. This method is typically invoked when
    changes occur in the player's quest progress or objective completion status, ensuring
    that the tracker reflects the most current information. It may involve recalculating
    objective states, updating UI elements, and synchronizing data between the game
    server and client. The method operates on a provided ObjectiveState object which
    holds the current tracking information for the player.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose objective state needs to be refreshed.
      This parameter must not be null.
  - name: state
    description: Reference to an ObjectiveState object that holds the current tracking
      data for the player's objectives. The method modifies this object to reflect
      updated state information.

  notes: This method should be called whenever there is a change in quest progress
    or objective completion to ensure the UI accurately reflects the current state.
    It's commonly used during quest updates, objective completions, or when loading
