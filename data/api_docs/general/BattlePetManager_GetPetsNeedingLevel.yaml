  class: BattlePetManager
  method: GetPetsNeedingLevel
  signature: int BattlePetManager::GetPetsNeedingLevel(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of battle pets that require leveling up for the player.
  description: The GetPetsNeedingLevel method calculates and returns the number of
    battle pets owned by the player that are not at their maximum level. This method
    is typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's Battle Pet system to determine
    which pets need attention or training. The method does not modify any state and
    is read-only. It may be called during gameplay to provide UI feedback or trigger
    events related to pet management.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier (GUID).
      This parameter is expected to be a valid pointer to a player ID, though its
      exact usage within the method implementation is not specified in the signature.
  returns: An integer value indicating the number of battle pets that require leveling
    up. Returns zero if no pets need leveling or if the provided player ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check pet levels
    code: "int playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nint petsNeedingLevel =\
      \ battlePetManager->GetPetsNeedingLevel(&playerId);\nif (petsNeedingLevel >\
      \ 0) {\n    // Notify user that pets need leveling\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You have %d pets needing level up.\", petsNeedingLevel);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely iterates through the player's battle pet collection to
    check each pet's current level against its maximum possible level. It may involve
    database queries or cached data structures depending on the implementation.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed is valid and not null, as passing
    an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
