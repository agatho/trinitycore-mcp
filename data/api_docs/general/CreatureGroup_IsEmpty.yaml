  signature: bool CreatureGroup::IsEmpty() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the creature group contains any creatures.
  description: The IsEmpty method determines if a CreatureGroup currently has no active
    members. This is useful for managing AI behavior groups where you need to know
    if all creatures in the group have been defeated or removed. The method performs
    a simple check on the internal list of creatures within the group and returns
    true if that list is empty, false otherwise. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    implementation, this typically relates to creature AI grouping mechanics used
    for coordinated attacks, movement patterns, or event triggers.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature group contains no creatures, false if it contains
    one or more creatures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check group status
    code: "if (creatureGroup->IsEmpty())\n{\n    // All creatures in the group have\
      \ been defeated or removed\n    // Trigger event or cleanup logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsEmpty in AI decision making
    code: "void CreatureGroupAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (creatureGroup->IsEmpty())\n\
      \    {\n        // Group is empty, stop following or attacking\n        DoDespawn();\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Continue with group behavior\n        DoGroupBehavior();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a constant-time check on the internal creature list.
    It does not perform any complex calculations or database queries. The implementation
    relies on maintaining an accurate count of active creatures within the group,
    which is typically updated through events like creature death or removal from
    the world.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only checks for active creatures in the group.
    If a creature has been marked for removal but not yet fully removed from memory,
    it may still be counted as part of the group until the cleanup process completes.
