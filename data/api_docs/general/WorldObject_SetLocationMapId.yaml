documentation:
  brief: Sets the map ID for the WorldObject, updating its location within the game
    world.
  description: This method updates the map ID associated with a WorldObject, which
    determines the game world area where the object resides. It is commonly used during
    object creation or movement to ensure proper positioning within the game environment.
    The method directly modifies the internal map ID field of the object, affecting
    how the object interacts with world systems and zone-based mechanics. This operation
    typically occurs when setting up a creature or player's location in a specific
    map.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Map ID for a Creature
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetLocationMapId(1234);

      // creature is now located in map 1234'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly affects the object's
    location within the game world. It may require synchronization with other systems
    to ensure proper positioning and avoid conflicts with zone-based mechanics.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect positioning of objects
    in the game world, potentially causing issues with zone-based interactions or
    movement systems.
