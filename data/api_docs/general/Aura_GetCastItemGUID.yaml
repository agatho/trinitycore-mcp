  class: Aura
  method: GetCastItemGUID
  signature: int Aura::GetCastItemGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the GUID of the item that cast the aura.
  description: The GetCastItemGUID method returns the unique identifier (GUID) of
    the item responsible for applying the aura. This is typically used in cases where
    an aura was applied through an item's enchantment, spell scroll, or other item-based
    effect. The returned value represents the full GUID of the casting item, which
    can be used to identify and reference that specific item within the game world.
    This method does not perform any validation on whether the aura actually originated
    from an item; it simply returns the stored GUID value if one exists.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the item that cast the aura, or 0 if
    no item was involved in casting the aura.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Log Cast Item GUID
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    int castItemGUID\
      \ = aura->GetCastItemGUID();\n    if (castItemGUID != 0)\n    {\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Aura cast by item with GUID: %d\", castItemGUID);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Aura not cast by an item.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for debugging and logging purposes. The
    returned GUID may be used to retrieve the actual item object from the world using
    functions like ObjectAccessor::GetObjectByTypeMask(). Be aware that if the aura
    was not cast by an item (e.g., spell or ability), this method will return 0.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-zero return value guarantees that the item still
    exists in the game world. The item might have been destroyed, sold, or otherwise
    removed from the player's inventory since the aura was applied.
