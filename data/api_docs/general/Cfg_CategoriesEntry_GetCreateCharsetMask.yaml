documentation:
  brief: Returns the character creation charset mask for the configuration category.
  description: The GetCreateCharsetMask method retrieves the bitmask value that defines
    which character sets are allowed for creation within this configuration category.
    This bitmask is used by the TrinityCore server to validate and restrict character
    creation based on predefined charset rules. The returned value typically corresponds
    to a combination of flags that represent different charset options such as Latin,
    Cyrillic, Asian, etc. This method is commonly used during character creation validation
    to ensure that players can only select from allowed character sets according to
    server configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer bitmask representing the allowed character sets for creation
    in this category. Each bit in the mask corresponds to a specific charset type,
    with active bits indicating supported character sets. The exact bit positions
    and meanings are defined by the game's charset configuration system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Cfg_CategoriesEntry* entry = sConfigMgr->GetCategoryEntry(123);\nint charsetMask\
      \ = entry->GetCreateCharsetMask();\nif (charsetMask & 0x01) {\n    // Latin\
      \ charset is allowed\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation Example
    code: "void ValidateCharacterCreation(Cfg_CategoriesEntry* category) {\n    int\
      \ mask = category->GetCreateCharsetMask();\n    if (mask == 0) {\n        //\
      \ No charsets allowed - creation blocked\n        sLog->outError(\"No charsets\
      \ configured for category %d\", category->ID);\n    } else {\n        // Proceed\
      \ with charset validation logic\n        sLog->outString(\"Allowed charsets\
      \ mask: 0x%08X\", mask);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during character creation flow to determine
    valid charset options. The bitmask values are usually defined in the config database
    and may vary between different server configurations or expansions. The implementation
    assumes that the category entry has been properly loaded with valid data.
  warnings: The returned mask value should not be modified directly as it represents
    a configuration setting. Always validate the mask against expected charset values
    before using it in character creation logic to prevent invalid character set selections.
