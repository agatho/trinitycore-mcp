  class: KitingManager
  method: ExecuteMovementToPosition
  signature: bool KitingManager::ExecuteMovementToPosition(const int & target)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates kiting movement to a specified target position.
  description: The ExecuteMovementToPosition method triggers the KitingManager to
    begin moving the associated unit toward a designated target location. This method
    is typically used in AI behavior scripting to control unit movement during kiting
    mechanics, where a unit moves in a circular or zigzag pattern while maintaining
    distance from an enemy. The method handles pathfinding and movement execution
    internally, returning true upon successful initiation of the movement sequence.
    It may be called repeatedly to update the target position during active kiting.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Reference to the target position or identifier that the unit should
      move towards. This parameter typically represents a waypoint, enemy position,
      or destination coordinate used for kiting behavior.
  returns: Returns true if the movement to the specified target was successfully initiated
    and queued for execution. Returns false if the movement could not be started due
    to invalid parameters, unit state, or pathfinding failure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic kiting movement initiation
    code: "if (kitingManager.ExecuteMovementToPosition(targetId)) {\n    // Movement\
      \ successfully initiated\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"AI\", \"Kiting movement started towards\
      \ target {}\", targetId);\n} else {\n    // Failed to initiate movement\n  \
      \  LOG_ERROR(\"AI\", \"Failed to start kiting movement towards target {}\",\
      \ targetId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying AI system's pathfinding capabilities.
    The actual movement execution may be asynchronous and subject to unit speed, terrain,
    and obstacle avoidance. Ensure that the target parameter is valid and accessible
    before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the target parameter
    may result in failed movement initiation or undefined behavior. This method should
    only be called when the unit is in a state suitable for movement (e.g., not stunned,
    rooted, or in combat with certain restrictions).
