  class: PointMovementGenerator
  method: Finalize
  signature: void PointMovementGenerator::Finalize(int * owner, bool active, bool
    movementInform)
documentation:
  brief: Completes the point movement generation process and handles cleanup or finalization
    tasks for the movement.
  description: The Finalize method in PointMovementGenerator is responsible for completing
    the movement generation process. It performs necessary cleanup operations, such
    as clearing movement references, notifying the owner of movement completion, and
    ensuring proper state transitions. This method is typically called when a movement
    has been successfully executed or interrupted, allowing the system to properly
    finalize the movement behavior and release associated resources. The method may
    also handle informing the owning unit about the completion of the movement through
    movement inform callbacks.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the owner of the movement generator,
      typically used to identify or reference the unit performing the movement.
  - name: active
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the movement is currently active.
      If true, the movement is considered ongoing; if false, it's inactive or completed.
  - name: movementInform
    description: Boolean flag that determines whether to send a movement inform message
      to the owner upon completion of the movement process.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Finalize Usage
    code: 'PointMovementGenerator generator;

      int owner = 12345;

      bool isActive = false;

      bool inform = true;

      generator.Finalize(&owner, isActive, inform);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Finalize with Active Movement
    code: 'PointMovementGenerator generator;

      int owner = 67890;

      bool isActive = true;

      bool inform = false;

      generator.Finalize(&owner, isActive, inform);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the movement system in TrinityCore and should be called
    when a point-based movement is completed or canceled. It ensures proper cleanup
    of movement-related data structures and maintains consistency within the AI subsystem.
