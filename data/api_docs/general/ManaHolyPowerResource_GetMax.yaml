  method: GetMax
  signature: uint32 ManaHolyPowerResource::GetMax() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the maximum mana or holy power value for the resource.
  description: The GetMax method returns the upper limit of the mana or holy power
    resource for a given unit. This value typically represents the total capacity
    of the resource and is used in various game mechanics such as resource regeneration,
    spell casting, and UI display. The returned value is usually constant for a given
    unit type but may vary based on player level, class, equipment, or buffs. This
    method does not modify any internal state and is safe to call during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum capacity of the mana or holy power
    resource. This value indicates how much resource can be stored at its peak, typically
    used for calculating percentages or displaying resource bars in the user interface.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Display Resource Capacity
    code: 'uint32 maxMana = player->GetPower(POWER_MANA);

      uint32 currentMana = player->GetMaxPower(POWER_MANA);

      printf("Mana: %u/%u", currentMana, maxMana);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GetMax for Resource Calculation in a Spell Handler
    code: "if (spellInfo->Effects[0].Effect == SPELL_EFFECT_ENERGIZE)\n{\n    uint32\
      \ maxPower = unit->GetMaxPower(POWER_HOLY_POWER);\n    uint32 gain = maxPower\
      \ * 0.1f; // Gain 10% of maximum holy power\n    unit->AddPower(POWER_HOLY_POWER,\
      \ gain);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with GetPower() to determine
    resource percentages for UI elements. The value returned may be affected by temporary
    modifiers such as buffs or debuffs that alter maximum resource capacity. It's
    recommended to cache this value if it's accessed frequently during performance-sensitive
    operations.
  warnings: Do not confuse this method with GetPower(), which returns the current
    amount of resource rather than the maximum. Calling this method on a unit without
    the appropriate power type may return unexpected results or zero values.
