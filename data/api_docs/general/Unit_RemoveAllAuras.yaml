  brief: Removes all active auras from the unit
  description: The RemoveAllAuras method removes all currently active aura effects
    from the target unit. This method is commonly used in game mechanics to clear
    buffs, debuffs, or other magical effects that may be applied to a unit. It ensures
    that no aura effects remain on the unit after execution, which can be crucial
    for certain gameplay scenarios such as resetting a unit's status or preparing
    for specific encounters. The method operates on all aura types and is typically
    used in conjunction with other aura management functions.

  returns: null

    code: "Unit* target = GetPlayer();\n target->RemoveAllAuras();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other methods like RemoveAura
    or RemoveAllAurasByType. It may be called from various contexts including combat,
    non-combat situations, or during specific game events. Performance considerations
    are minimal as the method simply clears all aura effects without complex processing.
  warnings: This method should not be used to remove specific auras unless explicitly
    required. The removal of all auras can affect gameplay mechanics and may interfere
    with certain quest or encounter behaviors that rely on specific aura states.
