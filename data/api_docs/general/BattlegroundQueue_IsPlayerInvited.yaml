    const uint32 removeTime)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has been invited to join a specific battleground queue.
  description: The IsPlayerInvited method determines whether a player identified by
    their GUID has received an invitation to join a particular battleground instance.
    This functionality is used within the battleground queue system to track player
    invitations and manage queue states. The method takes into account both the player's
    unique identifier and the battleground instance GUID to verify if an invitation
    exists. It also considers a removal time parameter that may affect the validity
    of the invitation status.
  parameters:
  - name: pl_guid
    description: The unique global identifier (GUID) of the player being checked for
      invitation status.
  - name: bgInstanceGuid
    description: The instance GUID of the battleground that the player might have
      been invited to join.
  - name: removeTime
    description: A timestamp indicating when the invitation should be considered removed
      or expired.
  returns: Returns true if the player has been invited to the specified battleground
    instance and the invitation is still valid based on the removeTime; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a player is invited to a battleground
    code: "if (BattlegroundQueue::IsPlayerInvited(playerGuid, bgInstanceGuid, currentTime\
      \ + 300)) {\n    // Player has been invited and invitation is still valid\n\
      \    SendBattlegroundInvite(playerGuid);\n} else {\n    // No valid invitation\
      \ found\n    SendBattlegroundQueueUpdate(playerGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in the context of battleground queue management
    to prevent duplicate invitations and ensure proper queue state tracking. The removeTime
    parameter allows for expiration handling of invitations, which helps maintain
    clean queue states.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID and battleground instance GUID are valid before
    calling this method, as invalid identifiers may lead to unexpected behavior or
    incorrect return values. Be aware that the method's logic may depend on internal
    queue data structures that could change during runtime.
