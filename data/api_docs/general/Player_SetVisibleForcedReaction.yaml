  class: Player
  method: SetVisibleForcedReaction
  signature: void Player::SetVisibleForcedReaction(uint32 factionId, int rank)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the visible forced reaction for a specified faction ID.
  description: This method allows a player to set their visible forced reaction for
    a specific faction, which affects how the player's reputation appears to other
    NPCs. The method modifies the player's faction visibility status and can be used
    to make certain factions appear as if they are at a specific reputation level.
    This is particularly useful for controlling how faction relationships are displayed
    in the game interface and can affect NPC interactions based on reputation.
  parameters:
  - name: factionId
    description: The faction ID for which to set the visible forced reaction. This
      typically corresponds to a known faction in the game database.
  - name: rank
    description: The rank level to set for the faction. This determines how the faction
      appears in the player's reputation list, with values ranging from 0 (hated)
      to 8 (exalted).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a visible forced reaction
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetVisibleForcedReaction(1124, 5); // Set faction ID 1124 to friendly
      level

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other reputation-related
    methods to control how factions appear in the player's interface. It does not
    affect actual reputation gain or loss, only visual appearance.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect faction display in the
    game UI, potentially affecting NPC interactions and quest completion.
