  class: LootDistribution
  method: AdjustLootDecisionsForFairness
  signature: void LootDistribution::AdjustLootDecisionsForFairness(Group * group,
    Player * player, LootRollType & decision)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts loot roll decisions to ensure fairness within a group based on player
    participation and loot distribution rules.
  description: The AdjustLootDecisionsForFairness method modifies a player's loot
    roll decision (such as need, greed, or pass) to maintain equitable distribution
    of loot among group members. This function considers factors like the player's
    recent loot history, group composition, and loot rules to prevent certain players
    from consistently receiving high-value items while others are left with poor drops.
    It is typically invoked during the loot rolling process to dynamically adjust
    decisions for fairness. The method operates on a reference to a LootRollType variable,
    which allows it to modify the decision in-place. This ensures that when multiple
    players are involved in a loot roll, each player's decision is adjusted according
    to group fairness mechanisms rather than purely individual preference.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group of players involved
      in the loot distribution. This parameter is required for determining group composition
      and applying group-based fairness rules.
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose loot decision is being adjusted.
      This player's recent loot history and participation are considered when modifying
      their roll decision.
  - name: decision
    description: Reference to a LootRollType variable that holds the current loot
      decision (Need, Greed, Pass). The method modifies this value in-place to reflect
      a fairness-adjusted decision.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Loot Roll Context
    code: "void HandleLootRoll(Group* group, Player* player, LootRollType& decision)\
      \ {\n    LootDistribution::AdjustLootDecisionsForFairness(group, player, decision);\n\
      \    // The 'decision' variable is now modified to reflect fairness adjustments\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Loot Rolling System
    code: "void DistributeLoot(Group* group, Player* player, LootRollType& decision)\
      \ {\n    // Apply fairness adjustments before finalizing the roll\n    LootDistribution::AdjustLootDecisionsForFairness(group,\
      \ player, decision);\n    \n    switch (decision) {\n        case LOOT_ROLL_NEED:\n\
      \            // Process need decision\n            break;\n        case LOOT_ROLL_GREED:\n\
      \            // Process greed decision\n            break;\n        case LOOT_ROLL_PASS:\n\
      \            // Process pass decision\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's loot distribution system and is intended
    to be called during the active loot rolling phase. It modifies the decision parameter
    in-place, so callers should be aware that the original value may be altered. The
    fairness algorithm considers recent loot history and group dynamics but does not
    override explicit player choices unless necessary for maintaining balance.
  warnings: This method modifies the input 'decision' parameter directly. Callers
    must ensure they have a valid Group and Player pointer before invoking this function
    to avoid undefined behavior. Incorrect usage may lead to unexpected loot distribution
    outcomes or crashes.
