  brief: Retrieves the shaman offensive cooldowns for a player in PvP combat.
  description: The GetShamanOffensiveCooldowns method retrieves the current state
    of offensive cooldowns available to a shaman player during PvP combat. This method
    is part of the PvPCombatAI class and is used to determine which shaman abilities
    are currently on cooldown, allowing the AI to make informed decisions about spell
    usage. The returned value typically represents a bitmask or integer flag indicating
    which offensive abilities are not yet ready for use. This functionality is crucial
    for proper AI behavior in PvP scenarios where timing and resource management are
    key factors.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the current state of shaman offensive cooldowns.
    The value typically encodes information about which abilities are on cooldown,
    with specific bits or values indicating different cooldown states. A return value
    of 0 may indicate all abilities are available, while non-zero values suggest various
    cooldown states.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "PvPCombatAI* ai = player->GetPvPCombatAI();\nint cooldowns = ai->GetShamanOffensiveCooldowns(nullptr);\n\
      if (cooldowns == 0) {\n    // All shaman offensive abilities are available\n\
      \    // Cast an offensive spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the AI system to make decisions
    about when to use shaman offensive spells. The exact bit layout or encoding of
    the returned integer should be determined from the internal implementation or
    related constants in the TrinityCore codebase. This method may be called frequently
    during combat, so performance considerations are important.
  warnings: The return value format (bitmask vs. flag values) is not explicitly defined
    and may vary based on implementation details. Using this method without understanding
    the bit layout could lead to incorrect behavior. Ensure proper handling of the
    returned integer value to avoid misinterpreting cooldown states.
