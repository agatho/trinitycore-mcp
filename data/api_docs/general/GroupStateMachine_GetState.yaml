  method: GetState
  signature: GroupState GroupStateMachine::GetState() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current state of the group state machine.
  description: The GetState method returns the current GroupState enum value that
    represents the operational state of the group within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method is typically used to determine whether a group is in a valid, active,
    or inactive state for various game mechanics such as quest progression, instance
    locking, or player synchronization. The returned state can be used by other systems
    to make decisions about group behavior, permissions, and interactions with world
    objects or other players.
  parameters: []
  returns: A GroupState enum value indicating the current operational state of the
    group. Possible values may include GROUP_STATE_NONE, GROUP_STATE_ACTIVE, GROUP_STATE_INACTIVE,
    or other state constants depending on the implementation details of the GroupStateMachine
    class.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Group State Before Quest Acceptance
    code: "void CheckGroupStateBeforeQuest(Player* player)\n{\n    Group* group =\
      \ player->GetGroup();\n    if (group)\n    {\n        GroupStateMachine* stateMachine\
      \ = group->GetGroupStateMachine();\n        GroupState currentState = stateMachine->GetState();\n\
      \        if (currentState == GROUP_STATE_ACTIVE)\n        {\n            //\
      \ Proceed with quest acceptance logic\n            player->PlayerTalkClass->SendQuestGiverQuestList();\n\
      \        }\n        else\n        {\n            // Handle inactive group state\n\
      \            player->SendSystemMessage(\"Your group is not in an active state.\"\
      );\n        }\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method performs a simple read operation and should be thread-safe if
    accessed from multiple threads. The GroupState enum values may vary depending
    on the specific implementation of the TrinityCore version being used, so developers
    should consult their local documentation or source code for exact definitions.
