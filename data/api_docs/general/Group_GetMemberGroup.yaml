  method: GetMemberGroup
  signature: int Group::GetMemberGroup(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the group index of a member given their GUID.
  description: The GetMemberGroup method retrieves the group index (0-4) for a specified
    group member identified by their GUID. This method is used internally by the Group
    class to determine which subgroup a player belongs to within a larger group. The
    returned value represents the member's position in the group's internal structure,
    with 0 indicating the main group and values 1-4 representing subgroups. It is
    commonly used for managing group loot distribution, role assignments, and maintaining
    group organization.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the group index (0-4) of the member if
    found in the group. Returns -1 if the GUID does not correspond to any member in
    the group.
  examples:
  - title: Find a player's group index
    code: "uint32 playerGuid = 12345;\nint groupIndex = group->GetMemberGroup(playerGuid);\n\
      if (groupIndex >= 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Player is in subgroup %d\\n\", groupIndex);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"Player not found in group\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through the group members, so performance
    may degrade with very large groups. The method is const and safe to call from
    multiple threads as long as the group data isn't being modified concurrently.
  warnings: The return value of -1 indicates that the GUID was not found in the group,
    which could happen if the player has left the group or if an invalid GUID was
    passed. Always check for this condition before using the returned index.
