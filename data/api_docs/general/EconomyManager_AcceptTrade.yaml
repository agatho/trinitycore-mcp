documentation:
  brief: Completes a trade transaction between two players in the economy system
  description: The AcceptTrade method finalizes a pending trade agreement between
    two players within the TrinityCore economy manager. This method validates the
    trade state, transfers items and currency between parties, and updates the trade
    session accordingly. It ensures that both players have agreed to the trade terms
    before executing the transaction. The method returns true if the trade is successfully
    completed, or false if validation fails or the trade cannot be processed due to
    game state constraints.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the trade was successfully accepted and completed, false
    if the trade could not be finalized due to validation errors, invalid trade state,
    or other processing failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trade Acceptance
    code: "if (economyManager->AcceptTrade()) {\n    // Trade completed successfully\n\
      \    SendSystemMessage(\"Trade accepted and completed.\");\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Trade failed to complete\n    SendSystemMessage(\"Trade could not be completed.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a trade is in an acceptable state
    for finalization. It's typically invoked after both players have confirmed their
    trade agreements and the trade session is ready to be closed. The method may perform
    internal validation checks including item availability, inventory space, and trade
    agreement consistency.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper preconditions may result in incomplete
    or corrupted trade states. Ensure that all trade terms are valid and both parties
    have agreed before invoking this method. This method does not handle error reporting
    internally; callers should check the return value to determine success or failure.
