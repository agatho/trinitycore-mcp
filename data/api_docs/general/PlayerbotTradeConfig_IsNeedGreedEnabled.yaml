  signature: bool PlayerbotTradeConfig::IsNeedGreedEnabled()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Need-Greed trading system is enabled for player bots.
  description: The IsNeedGreedEnabled method checks if the Need-Greed trade configuration
    is active within the PlayerbotTradeConfig class. This functionality controls how
    player bots handle item distribution when multiple players are interested in the
    same loot, specifically enabling or disabling the Need-Greed system where players
    can declare their interest in an item before it is rolled for. The method returns
    a boolean value indicating the current state of this configuration setting.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Need-Greed trading system is enabled; otherwise, returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Check Need-Greed Status
    code: "PlayerbotTradeConfig tradeConfig;\nbool isNeedGreedEnabled = tradeConfig.IsNeedGreedEnabled();\n\
      if (isNeedGreedEnabled) {\n    // Proceed with Need-Greed logic\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Need-Greed system is enabled\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Fall back\
      \ to alternative trading logic\n    std::cout << \"Need-Greed system is disabled\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely reads from internal configuration flags or settings that
    may be loaded at runtime. It's important for bot behavior logic to determine how
    items are distributed among group members.
