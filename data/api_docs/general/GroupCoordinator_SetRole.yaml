  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: SetRole
  signature: void GroupCoordinator::SetRole(GroupRole role)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the role of the group coordinator within a World of Warcraft group context.
  description: The SetRole method assigns a specific GroupRole to the GroupCoordinator
    instance, which determines the coordinator's functional responsibilities and permissions
    within a group. This method is typically used during group initialization or role
    reassignment scenarios. The assigned role affects how the coordinator interacts
    with group members, handles leadership decisions, and manages group activities
    such as loot distribution or instance locking. The method does not validate the
    role parameter against predefined valid roles, so callers should ensure they pass
    appropriate values. This operation modifies the internal state of the GroupCoordinator
    object and may trigger related updates in the group management system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Assigning a Leader Role
    code: 'GroupCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.SetRole(GROUP_ROLE_LEADER);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting a Main Tank Role
    code: 'GroupCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.SetRole(GROUP_ROLE_MAIN_TANK);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal role state of the GroupCoordinator.
    It is recommended to call this method only when transitioning between valid roles,
    as invalid role values may lead to undefined behavior in group operations. The
    method does not perform any validation or error handling for invalid role inputs.
  warnings: Passing an invalid GroupRole value to this method can result in unexpected
    behavior or crashes within the group management system. Ensure that only predefined
    valid roles are used, as the method does not validate input parameters.
