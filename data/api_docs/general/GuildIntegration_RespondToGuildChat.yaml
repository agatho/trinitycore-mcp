  brief: Processes and responds to incoming guild chat messages by a player.
  description: The RespondToGuildChat method handles incoming guild chat messages
    from players, processing them according to guild permissions and game rules. It
    ensures that only authorized members can send messages and enforces guild-specific
    chat restrictions. This method typically integrates with the core messaging system
    to route and validate guild communications.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object representing the sender of the guild
      chat message. Must be a valid player instance or nullptr.
  - name: message
    description: Reference to a GuildChatMessage object containing the content and
      metadata of the guild chat message being processed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Chat Response
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player instance

      GuildChatMessage msg;

      msg.text = "Hello everyone!";

      msg.channel = GUILD_CHANNEL_GENERAL;

      guildIntegration->RespondToGuildChat(&player, msg);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has proper guild membership and permissions.
    It may internally validate the player's guild rank and channel access rights before
    processing.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as passing an invalid pointer may cause undefined behavior or crashes.
