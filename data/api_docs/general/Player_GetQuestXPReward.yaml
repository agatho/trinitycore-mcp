  description: This method retrieves the amount of experience points that a player
    will receive upon completing the specified quest. The value is calculated based
    on the quest's level, quest giver's level, and other factors such as quest completion
    bonus and player's level difference. This method is used internally by the game
    engine to determine the XP reward for quests, and it can be useful for developers
    who need to understand how quest rewards work in TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the experience points reward value as a uint32. This value represents
    the total XP that will be awarded to the player upon completing the quest.
  examples:

  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related functions
    to determine overall quest reward behavior. It should be noted that the XP reward
    value returned by this function may vary depending on game mechanics and player
    level difference.
