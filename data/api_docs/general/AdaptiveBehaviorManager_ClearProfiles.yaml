documentation:
  brief: Clears all adaptive behavior profiles from the manager.
  description: The ClearProfiles method removes all currently loaded adaptive behavior
    profiles from the AdaptiveBehaviorManager instance. This operation resets the
    manager's internal profile storage, effectively disabling any adaptive behaviors
    that were previously configured. The method is typically used during cleanup,
    reconfiguration, or when transitioning between different game states where old
    behavior data should be discarded. No parameters are required as the method operates
    on the manager's current state.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AdaptiveBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = sObjectAccessor->GetPlayerByGUID(playerGuid)->GetAdaptiveBehaviorManager();

      behaviorManager->ClearProfiles();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it will immediately invalidate
    all existing adaptive behaviors. It is recommended to ensure no active behaviors
    are running before calling this method.
