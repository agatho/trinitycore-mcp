documentation:
  brief: Links two creatures so that one respawns when the other dies
  description: The SetCreatureLinkedRespawn method establishes a respawn linkage between
    two creatures in the World of Warcraft server. When the creature with the specified
    guid dies, the creature with the linkedGuid will respawn at its original location
    after the standard respawn timer expires. This functionality is commonly used
    for creating groups of mobs that respawn together or for implementing specific
    encounter mechanics where one mob's death triggers another's respawn. The method
    operates on the object manager's internal data structures to maintain these linkage
    relationships.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier of the primary creature that will trigger
      the respawn of the linked creature
  - name: linkedGuid
    description: The global unique identifier of the creature that will respawn when
      the primary creature dies
  returns: Returns true if the linkage was successfully set or updated, false if either
    guid is invalid or the operation failed due to internal constraints
  examples:
  - title: Link two creatures for synchronized respawn
    code: "if (sObjectMgr->SetCreatureLinkedRespawn(12345, 12346)) {\n    // Successfully\
      \ linked creature 12345 to respawn when 12346 dies\n    sLog->outString(\"Creature\
      \ 12345 linked to respawn with 12346\");\n} else {\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed\
      \ to link creatures 12345 and 12346\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal respawn linkage data structures within ObjectMgr.
    The linked creatures must exist in the database and have valid GUIDs. Changes
    take effect immediately for future respawns but do not affect already spawned
    creatures. This functionality is typically used during world initialization or
    dynamic creature management.
  warnings: Using invalid GUIDs may cause undefined behavior or database corruption.
    Ensure both creatures exist before calling this method. Multiple links to the
    same creature should be handled carefully to avoid circular dependencies or unexpected
    respawn behavior.
