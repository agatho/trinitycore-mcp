  brief: Casts the Battle Shout spell on the WarriorAI's target or self.
  description: The CastBattleShout method is responsible for executing the Battle
    Shout ability within the Warrior AI framework. This method typically triggers
    the casting of the Battle Shout spell, which provides a buff to the caster and
    nearby allies, increasing their attack power. The implementation may include checks
    for spell availability, line-of-sight, and cooldowns before proceeding with the
    cast. It is commonly used in combat scenarios where the warrior needs to enhance
    the offensive capabilities of itself or its group members.
