api:
  class: BattlePetManager
  method: NeedsHealing
  signature: bool BattlePetManager::NeedsHealing(int * player, uint32 speciesId) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player's battle pet requires healing based on its current
    health status.
  description: The NeedsHealing method evaluates if any of the player's active battle
    pets are below a certain health threshold that indicates they need to be healed.
    This method is typically used in battle pet management systems to identify when
    healing actions should be prioritized. The function takes into account the player's
    current battle pet roster and checks each pet's health against predefined thresholds.
    It returns true if at least one pet needs healing, false otherwise. This functionality
    is crucial for automated pet care systems within the Battle Pet system of World
    of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier. This
      parameter likely refers to the player's GUID or internal ID used to retrieve
      their battle pet data from the game state.
  - name: speciesId
    description: The unique identifier for a specific battle pet species. This allows
      the method to check if a particular pet species requires healing, possibly based
      on species-specific health thresholds or behaviors.
  returns: Returns true if any of the player's battle pets require healing (i.e.,
    their current health is below the defined threshold), false otherwise. The exact
    health threshold and logic for determining 'needs healing' are implementation-specific
    but generally relate to combat readiness.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if any pet needs healing
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nuint32 speciesId = 1234;\nbool needsHealing = battlePetManager.NeedsHealing(&playerId,\
      \ speciesId);\nif (needsHealing) {\n    // Trigger healing logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using NeedsHealing in a loop to check all pets
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nuint32 speciesIds[] = {1234, 5678, 9012};\nfor (auto\
      \ id : speciesIds) {\n    if (battlePetManager.NeedsHealing(&playerId, id))\
      \ {\n        // Perform healing action for this pet\n        std::cout << \"\
      Pet with species ID \" << id << \" needs healing\" << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal battle pet health tracking systems
    and may be called frequently during combat or pet management events. Performance
    considerations should be taken into account when using this in high-frequency
    loops. The exact health thresholds for determining 'needs healing' are not publicly
    documented but are typically based on game balance mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Also, be aware that
    this function may have side effects if it modifies internal pet state during evaluation.
