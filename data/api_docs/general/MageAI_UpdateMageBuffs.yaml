documentation:
  brief: Updates the Mage's buff state based on current spell availability and target
    conditions.
  description: The UpdateMageBuffs method is responsible for managing the application
    and maintenance of beneficial auras and buffs specific to the Mage class. This
    method evaluates the current state of the Mage's spells, target conditions, and
    cooldowns to determine which buffs should be applied or maintained. It typically
    handles core Mage abilities such as Arcane Intellect, Frost Armor, and other defensive
    or offensive enhancements that provide stat boosts or protective effects. The
    method ensures optimal buff management during combat by checking spell availability,
    target status, and ensuring no conflicting buffs are active.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MageAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    UpdateMageBuffs();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Mage AI
    code: "class MyMageAI : public MageAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override\n    {\n        if (Unit* target = GetVictim())\n        {\n    \
      \        UpdateMageBuffs();\n            // Additional custom logic\n      \
      \  }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should be
    invoked regularly to maintain optimal buff states. The implementation may vary
    between different versions of TrinityCore, but generally follows a pattern of
    checking spell availability before applying buffs. It's important to note that
    this method does not directly cast spells, but rather manages the state of buffs
    that may be applied by other methods or systems.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the Mage AI is actively engaged
    in combat or when buff management is required. Calling it outside of appropriate
    contexts may lead to unnecessary processing or incorrect buff states. Additionally,
    ensure proper target validation before calling this method as it relies on valid
    target state for buff decisions.
