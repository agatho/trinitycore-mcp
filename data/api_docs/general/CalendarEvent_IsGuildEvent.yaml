  class: CalendarEvent
  method: IsGuildEvent
  signature: bool CalendarEvent::IsGuildEvent(uint32 flags)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a calendar event is classified as a guild event based
    on its flags.
  description: The IsGuildEvent method evaluates the provided flags of a calendar
    event to determine if it represents a guild-related event. This functionality
    is essential for distinguishing between personal, guild, and raid events within
    the World of Warcraft calendar system. The method checks specific flag bits that
    indicate the event type and returns true if the event is categorized as a guild
    event. This is commonly used in UI rendering and event filtering logic to display
    appropriate event types to players.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: The flags value associated with the calendar event, which contains
      bitfield information about the event type and properties.
  returns: Returns true if the event is classified as a guild event; otherwise returns
    false. The method evaluates the flags to determine if the GUILD_EVENT flag bit
    is set.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an event is a guild event
    code: "uint32 eventFlags = 0x00000004; // Example flags value\nbool isGuild =\
      \ CalendarEvent::IsGuildEvent(eventFlags);\nif (isGuild)\n{\n    // Handle guild\
      \ event logic\n    printf(\"This is a guild event\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with calendar event data
    code: "CalendarEvent* event = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(eventId);\nif (event)\n{\n\
      \    bool isGuild = CalendarEvent::IsGuildEvent(event->GetFlags());\n    if\
      \ (isGuild)\n    {\n        // Display guild-specific UI elements\n        ShowGuildEventUI();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other calendar event flag
    checks to determine the complete nature of an event. The implementation relies
    on predefined flag constants that are consistent with the TrinityCore calendar
    system. Performance is minimal as it's a simple bitwise operation.
  warnings: Ensure that the flags parameter contains valid calendar event flags, as
    invalid or uninitialized values may lead to incorrect results. This method should
    not be used without proper validation of the input flags.
