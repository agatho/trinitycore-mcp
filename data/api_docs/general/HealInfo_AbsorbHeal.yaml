  class: HealInfo
  method: AbsorbHeal
  signature: void HealInfo::AbsorbHeal(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Reduces the heal amount by the specified absorption value, typically used
    to apply damage shielding effects.
  description: The AbsorbHeal method modifies the healing information by reducing
    the total heal amount based on an absorption value. This is commonly used in World
    of Warcraft mechanics where spells or abilities provide damage absorption that
    reduces incoming heals. The method adjusts internal heal values to reflect the
    absorbed portion, ensuring proper accounting for healing mitigation effects such
    as spell shields, damage reduction auras, or other protective mechanisms. It does
    not directly modify the target's health but rather adjusts how much healing will
    be applied after absorption calculations are complete.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of healing to absorb, typically representing the value
      of a damage shield or absorption effect that reduces incoming heals. Must be
      a non-negative integer value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Absorb Usage
    code: 'HealInfo healInfo;

      uint32 absorbAmount = 500;

      healInfo.AbsorbHeal(absorbAmount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying Absorption from a Shield Ability
    code: 'Unit* target = player->GetVictim();

      HealInfo healInfo;

      healInfo.SetHeal(1000);

      // Apply shield that absorbs 300 healing

      healInfo.AbsorbHeal(300);

      // Heal will now be reduced to 700 after absorption'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the healing calculation phase of combat,
    before final heal application. It modifies the internal heal amount stored within
    the HealInfo object and should be used in conjunction with other HealInfo methods
    to properly manage healing effects.
  warnings: Be cautious when calling this method multiple times on the same HealInfo
    object as it may lead to incorrect healing calculations if not handled properly.
    Ensure that absorption values do not exceed the total heal amount, which could
    result in negative healing values.
