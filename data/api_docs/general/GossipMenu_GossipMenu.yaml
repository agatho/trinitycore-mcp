documentation:
  brief: Moves a GossipMenu object to another GossipMenu object using move semantics.
  description: The GossipMenu move constructor initializes a new GossipMenu object
    by transferring ownership of resources from an existing GossipMenu object. This
    operation is typically used in scenarios where temporary or intermediate GossipMenu
    objects need to be efficiently transferred without copying their internal data
    structures. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server implementation,
    this constructor supports efficient management of gossip menu state during quest
    interactions, NPC dialogues, and player interaction flows. The move constructor
    ensures that the source object is left in a valid but unspecified state after
    the transfer.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move GossipMenu to New Instance
    code: 'GossipMenu menu1;

      // ... populate menu1 with gossip options ...

      GossipMenu menu2 = std::move(menu1);

      // menu1 is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // menu2 contains all the data from menu1'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor leverages C++ move semantics to avoid expensive deep copying
    operations. It's particularly useful when working with temporary gossip menu objects
    during quest or dialogue handling. The source GossipMenu object should not be
    used after a move operation, as its state becomes undefined.
  warnings: Using the moved-from GossipMenu object after calling this constructor
    results in undefined behavior. Always ensure that the original object is not accessed
    after being moved.
