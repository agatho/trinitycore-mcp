documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotHealthCheck class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the BotHealthCheck
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the class exists throughout the application's
    lifecycle. This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's AI and bot management
    systems to access global health checking functionality for game bots. The returned
    instance can be used to perform various health checks, status evaluations, and
    monitoring tasks related to bot characters within the game world. This method
    is thread-safe and should be called whenever access to the global BotHealthCheck
    singleton is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single BotHealthCheck instance. The method will always
    return a valid pointer; it does not return nullptr under normal circumstances.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotHealthCheck* healthChecker = BotHealthCheck::instance();

      bool isHealthy = healthChecker->IsBotHealthy(playerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Management
    code: "void CheckAndHandleBotHealth(Player* bot)\n{\n    BotHealthCheck* checker\
      \ = BotHealthCheck::instance();\n    if (!checker->IsBotHealthy(bot->GetGUID()))\n\
      \    {\n        checker->HandleUnhealthyBot(bot);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the classic singleton pattern implementation. The instance
    is typically created lazily on first access, and subsequent calls return the same
    object reference. The BotHealthCheck singleton likely maintains internal state
    about bot health statuses and may cache results for performance optimization.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, be cautious when mocking or testing this method
    in unit tests as it can lead to test isolation issues. Ensure that any modifications
    to the singleton's state are thread-safe if accessed from multiple threads.
