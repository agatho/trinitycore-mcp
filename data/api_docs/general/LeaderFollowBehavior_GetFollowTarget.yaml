  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: GetFollowTarget
  signature: Player * LeaderFollowBehavior::GetFollowTarget() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the player target that this behavior is following.
  description: The GetFollowTarget method returns a pointer to the Player object that
    the LeaderFollowBehavior is currently configured to follow. This method is typically
    used within the context of AI behaviors where a creature or NPC follows a designated
    leader player. The returned pointer may be null if no valid follow target has
    been set or if the target has left the game world. This method does not perform
    any validation on the returned player object beyond ensuring it's a valid pointer
    to a Player instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Player object that is being followed, or nullptr if no
    follow target exists or the target is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override {\n        if (LeaderFollowBehavior* followBehavior = dynamic_cast<LeaderFollowBehavior*>(me->GetAI()))\
      \ {\n            Player* target = followBehavior->GetFollowTarget();\n     \
      \       if (target && target->IsInWorld()) {\n                // Perform actions\
      \ based on the target\n                DoSomethingWithTarget(target);\n    \
      \        }\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's AI system and should only be called
    from within AI contexts. The returned Player pointer is valid only as long as
    the target player remains in the game world and hasn't been deleted.
  warnings: Always check for null return values before using the returned Player pointer
    to avoid segmentation faults. Be aware that the target may become invalid if the
    player leaves the game or is removed from the world.
