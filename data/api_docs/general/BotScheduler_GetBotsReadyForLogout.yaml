documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of bots ready for logout from the scheduler queue
  description: The GetBotsReadyForLogout method retrieves the count of bots that are
    currently marked as ready for logout. This method is typically used in the context
    of TrinityCore's bot management system to determine how many automated player
    characters can be safely logged out without disrupting ongoing operations. The
    method filters bots based on their current state and readiness criteria, ensuring
    only those that are idle or have completed their tasks are considered ready for
    logout. This functionality is essential for efficient resource management in environments
    where multiple bots are running simultaneously.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of bots that are currently ready
    for logout. A return value of zero indicates no bots are ready, while a positive
    integer indicates the count of bots that can be logged out safely.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check bot readiness
    code: "int readyBots = scheduler->GetBotsReadyForLogout();\nif (readyBots > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with logout operations\n    LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"{} bots are\
      \ ready for logout\", readyBots);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal filtering of bot states to determine
    readiness. It may be called periodically as part of a cleanup routine or during
    server shutdown sequences. The implementation might involve thread synchronization
    to ensure accurate state reporting.
