  signature: bool AuraEffect::HasSpellClassMask() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the aura effect has a spell class mask assigned.
  description: The HasSpellClassMask method checks if the AuraEffect object is associated
    with a specific spell class mask. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, spell class
    masks are used to categorize spells and determine which effects apply to certain
    spell types. This method returns true if the aura effect has been configured with
    a spell class mask, indicating that it will only affect spells matching that mask.
    The check is typically performed during spell application or aura handling routines
    to ensure proper targeting and filtering of spell effects based on their classification.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the aura effect has a spell class mask assigned; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (auraEffect->HasSpellClassMask()) {\n    // Process aura effect with\
      \ spell class mask\n    std::cout << \"Aura has spell class mask\" << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle aura without spell class mask\n    std::cout << \"Aura\
      \ does not have spell class mask\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in spell effect handling logic to filter which
    spells should be affected by a particular aura. The spell class mask is typically
    set during aura creation or initialization and determines compatibility with specific
    spell categories.
