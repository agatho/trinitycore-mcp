  method: UseInterruptSpell
  signature: bool DungeonScript::UseInterruptSpell(int * player, int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to interrupt a spell cast by a player or target within a dungeon
    environment.
  description: The UseInterruptSpell method is designed to handle spell interruption
    mechanics within dungeon scenarios. It evaluates whether a spell interruption
    can occur based on the current state of the player and target entities. This method
    typically checks for valid targets, spell casting states, and game rules that
    determine if an interruption is possible. The function returns true if the interruption
    was successfully processed, or false if it failed due to invalid conditions or
    game restrictions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or index
      within the dungeon context.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target entity's identifier
      or index that is currently casting a spell.
  returns: Returns true if the spell interruption was successfully executed, false
    otherwise. A return value of false may indicate invalid parameters, lack of valid
    spell casting state, or other game rule violations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Interruption
    code: "int playerID = 12345;\nint targetID = 67890;\nbool success = dungeonScript->UseInterruptSpell(&playerID,\
      \ &targetID);\nif (success) {\n    // Spell interruption processed successfully\n\
      \    printf(\"Spell interrupted successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Failed\
      \ to interrupt spell\n    printf(\"Failed to interrupt spell\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spell Interruption
    code: "int playerID = 12345;\nint targetID = 67890;\nif (dungeonScript->UseInterruptSpell(&playerID,\
      \ &targetID)) {\n    // Apply interruption effects\n    player->AddAura(12345,\
      \ player); // Example aura application\n    printf(\"Player interrupted target's\
      \ spell\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle failure case\n    printf(\"Interruption\
      \ failed - check conditions\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the dungeon scripting system and should only be called
    within appropriate dungeon contexts. The player and target parameters must point
    to valid entities in the current dungeon instance. Implementation may involve
    checking spell state, cooldowns, and other game-specific conditions.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and target pointers are valid before calling this
    method. Passing null or invalid pointers may lead to undefined behavior. This
    function should not be used outside of proper dungeon script contexts where spell
    interruption mechanics are applicable.
