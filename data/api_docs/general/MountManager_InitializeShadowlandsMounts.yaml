  brief: Initializes Shadowlands mount data for the MountManager
  description: The InitializeShadowlandsMounts method sets up and loads all Shadowlands-specific
    mount information into the MountManager. This includes registering new mounts,
    applying necessary flags and requirements, and ensuring compatibility with the
    Shadowlands expansion content. The method is typically called during server initialization
    or when loading player data to ensure that Shadowlands mounts are properly available
    for use. It handles the integration of new mount types, their associated achievements,
    and any special conditions required to unlock them within the Shadowlands expansion.

  notes: This method should only be called after the Shadowlands expansion data has
    been loaded into the game world. It is typically invoked during server startup
    or when processing player login events to ensure mount availability.
