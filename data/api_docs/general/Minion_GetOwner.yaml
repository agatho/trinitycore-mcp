  method: GetOwner
  signature: int * Minion::GetOwner() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the owner identifier of the minion.
  description: The GetOwner method retrieves a pointer to the unique identifier (GUID)
    of the creature's owner. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, minions
    are typically summoned creatures or pets that have an associated owner. This method
    allows access to the owner's GUID, which is essential for tracking relationships
    between summoned units and their controllers. The returned pointer should be used
    carefully as it points to internal data within the minion object and may become
    invalid if the minion is destroyed or its owner changes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the minion's owner. If
    the minion has no owner (e.g., wild creatures), this may return nullptr or a zero
    value depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if minion has an owner
    code: "Minion* pet = ...; // Assume we have a minion instance\nint* ownerGuid\
      \ = pet->GetOwner();\nif (ownerGuid != nullptr && *ownerGuid != 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ The minion has an owner with the GUID stored in *ownerGuid\n    printf(\"\
      Pet's owner GUID: %d\\n\", *ownerGuid);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No owner or invalid\
      \ owner GUID\n    printf(\"Pet has no owner.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a pointer to the internal GUID storage of the minion,
    so it should not be modified directly. The returned value is typically used for
    comparison or lookup purposes in the game's object management system.
  warnings: Be cautious when dereferencing the returned pointer as it may point to
    invalid memory if the minion has been deleted or its owner changed. Always validate
    that the pointer is not null before dereferencing.
