  class: AuctionManager
  method: RecordAuctionCancelled
  signature: void AuctionManager::RecordAuctionCancelled(int botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Records the cancellation of an auction for a specific bot GUID in the auction
    manager system.
  description: The RecordAuctionCancelled method logs the cancellation event of an
    auction associated with a given bot GUID. This function is typically invoked when
    an auction is removed from the auction house, either by the bot owner canceling
    it or due to external conditions such as item unavailability. It updates internal
    tracking mechanisms within the AuctionManager to maintain accurate records of
    auction activities and potentially triggers related cleanup or notification processes.
    The method does not return any value but modifies internal state for audit and
    statistical purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose auction cancellation
      is being recorded. This value must correspond to a valid bot entry in the system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AuctionManager* auctionMgr = sAuctionMgr;

      auctionMgr->RecordAuctionCancelled(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with bot behavior scripting and
    may be part of a larger system that manages automated auction house operations.
    It should be called whenever an auction is canceled to ensure data consistency.
