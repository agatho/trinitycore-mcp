  method: CheckPetName
  signature: int ObjectMgr::CheckPetName(std::string_view name)
documentation:
  brief: Validates a pet name and returns an error code indicating whether the name
    is acceptable.
  description: The CheckPetName method verifies if a given pet name meets the game's
    naming requirements. It checks for invalid characters, length restrictions, and
    reserved words that are not allowed in pet names. This method is typically used
    during pet creation or renaming to ensure compliance with World of Warcraft's
    naming policies. The validation process includes checking against a list of forbidden
    names and ensuring the name adheres to server-specific rules. The method returns
    different error codes based on the type of validation failure, allowing the calling
    code to provide appropriate feedback to the player.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The pet name to validate as a std::string_view. Must be a valid UTF-8
      string representing the desired pet name.
  returns: Returns an integer error code indicating the validation result. Common
    return values include 0 for success (valid name), and positive integers for specific
    error types such as invalid length, forbidden characters, or reserved name violations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic pet name validation
    code: "int result = sObjectMgr->CheckPetName(\"Fluffy\");\nif (result == 0) {\n\
      \    // Name is valid\n    printf(\"Pet name is acceptable\\n\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle invalid name\n    printf(\"Invalid pet name: %d\\n\", result);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking multiple pet names
    code: "std::vector<std::string> petNames = {\"Buddy\", \"123\", \"\", \"Shadow\"\
      };\nfor (const auto& name : petNames) {\n    int result = sObjectMgr->CheckPetName(name);\n\
      \    if (result == 0) {\n        printf(\"'%s' is a valid pet name\\n\", name.c_str());\n\
      \    } else {\n        printf(\"'%s' failed validation with code %d\\n\", name.c_str(),\
      \ result);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs case-sensitive validation. The implementation may vary
    depending on server configuration and locale settings. It's recommended to use
    this method before allowing pet renaming or creation operations to prevent invalid
    names from being stored in the database.
  warnings: The return codes are not standardized across all TrinityCore versions,
    so developers should verify the exact meaning of each error code by examining
    the source implementation. Additionally, this method does not check for duplicate
    pet names, only syntactic validity.
