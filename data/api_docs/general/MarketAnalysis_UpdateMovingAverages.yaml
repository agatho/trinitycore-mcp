  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: UpdateMovingAverages
  signature: void MarketAnalysis::UpdateMovingAverages(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the moving averages for the specified item in the market analysis
    system.
  description: The UpdateMovingAverages method recalculates and stores updated moving
    average values for a given item ID within the MarketAnalysis class. This method
    is typically invoked when new market data becomes available for an item, ensuring
    that statistical trends and price movements are accurately reflected in the analysis.
    The implementation likely maintains historical price data points and computes
    averages over configurable time windows or transaction counts. It may be called
    automatically by market event handlers or manually during data synchronization
    processes.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item for which moving averages need
      to be updated. This corresponds to the Item ID used in the World of Warcraft
      database and must reference a valid item entry.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update moving averages for a specific item
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analysis;

      uint32 itemId = 18732; // Example: Item ID for a common trade good

      analysis.UpdateMovingAverages(itemId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update moving averages for multiple items in a loop
    code: "MarketAnalysis analysis;\nstd::vector<uint32> itemIds = {18732, 18733,\
      \ 18734};\nfor (uint32 itemId : itemIds)\n{\n    analysis.UpdateMovingAverages(itemId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database operations to retrieve and store updated
    market data. It may be computationally intensive if many items are processed in
    sequence, so consider batching updates or using asynchronous execution for performance-critical
    scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the itemId parameter refers to a valid item in the game database;
    passing an invalid item ID could lead to undefined behavior or database errors.
    The method assumes that market data for the given item is already available and
    properly indexed.
