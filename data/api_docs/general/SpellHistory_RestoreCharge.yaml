documentation:
  brief: Restores a spell charge for the specified charge category.
  description: The RestoreCharge method is used to restore a single charge for a spell
    that belongs to the specified charge category. This functionality is typically
    utilized when a player's ability to use a spell is limited by charges, and certain
    conditions (such as cooldown expiration or specific game events) allow for the
    restoration of one or more charges. The method operates on the internal charge
    tracking system of the SpellHistory class, which manages cooldowns and charge
    states for spells within the context of a player or unit's abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: chargeCategoryId
    description: An integer identifier representing the charge category associated
      with the spell. This ID corresponds to a specific group of spells that share
      the same charge limitations and restoration rules.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Restoring a Charge for a Specific Spell Category
    code: 'SpellHistory* history = player->GetSpellHistory();

      history->RestoreCharge(12345); // Restores one charge for spell category 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core game logic when a
    spell's cooldown ends or when specific events occur that allow for charge restoration.
    It does not directly affect the visual state of charges displayed to players;
    that is handled separately through the client-side UI updates.
