  brief: Moves taxi-related data from another PlayerTaxi object to this instance.
  description: The PlayerTaxi constructor taking an rvalue reference is used to transfer
    ownership of taxi-related data from one PlayerTaxi instance to another. This move
    constructor efficiently transfers internal state such as taxi path information,
    flight progress, and related flags without performing expensive deep copies. It's
    typically invoked during object construction or assignment operations where an
    temporary or unnamed PlayerTaxi object is being moved into a named instance. The
    operation leaves the source object in a valid but unspecified state, suitable
    for immediate destruction or reassignment.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing a PlayerTaxi Object
    code: 'PlayerTaxi taxi1;

      // ... populate taxi1 with data ...

      PlayerTaxi taxi2 = std::move(taxi1); // Move constructor invoked

      // taxi1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a copy constructor. It's designed for efficiency
    when transferring ownership of resources. After the move operation, the source
    object should not be used for operations that require valid taxi data. The implementation
    assumes that the moved-from object will be left in a valid state for destruction.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after a move operation results in undefined
    behavior. Ensure all references to the source object are discarded immediately
    after the move. This constructor is typically not called directly but rather through
    move semantics during assignment or initialization.
