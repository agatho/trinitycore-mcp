  method: GetInterruptSpellId
  signature: uint32 CombatSpecializationBase::GetInterruptSpellId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell ID associated with the combat specialization's interrupt
    ability.
  description: The GetInterruptSpellId method returns the unique identifier of the
    spell that is used to interrupt enemy casters when this combat specialization
    is active. This value typically corresponds to a specific spell entry in the game's
    spell database, such as a silence or spellsteal effect. The returned ID can be
    used to check if an interrupt spell exists for the current specialization, validate
    interrupt mechanics, or perform actions related to spell interruption. This method
    does not require any parameters and is read-only, returning a constant value based
    on the specialization configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 representing the spell ID of the interrupt ability associated
    with this combat specialization. Returns 0 if no interrupt spell is defined for
    the specialization.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a specialization has an interrupt spell
    code: "uint32 interruptSpellId = player->GetCombatSpecialization()->GetInterruptSpellId();\n\
      if (interruptSpellId != 0)\n{\n    // The specialization has an interrupt spell\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Specialization has interrupt spell ID: %u\", interruptSpellId);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // No interrupt spell defined for this specialization\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      No interrupt spell defined for this specialization\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with spell casting and combat
    logic to determine if a player's current specialization allows for spell interruption.
    The returned spell ID should be validated against the game's spell database to
    ensure it corresponds to an actual interrupt spell.
