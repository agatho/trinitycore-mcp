  class: InsanityResource
  method: GenerateInsanity
  signature: void InsanityResource::GenerateInsanity(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates insanity resource for the player based on the specified amount.
  description: The GenerateInsanity method is responsible for adding a specified amount
    of insanity resource to the player's current resource pool. This method is typically
    invoked during gameplay events such as spell casting, ability usage, or other
    game mechanics that generate insanity. The insanity resource is used by certain
    classes and abilities in World of Warcraft, particularly those related to shadow
    magic or specific class mechanics. The method does not return any value but directly
    modifies the internal insanity resource state of the InsanityResource object.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of insanity resource to generate. This value must be a
      non-negative integer representing the quantity of insanity to add to the player's
      resource pool.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Insanity Generation
    code: 'InsanityResource insanityResource;

      insanityResource.GenerateInsanity(50);

      // Adds 50 units of insanity to the player''s resource pool.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Generating Insanity Based on Spell Effect
    code: "void OnSpellCast(SpellInfo* spell)\n{\n    if (spell->Id == 12345)\n  \
      \      player->GetInsanityResource()->GenerateInsanity(25);\n}\n// Generates\
      \ 25 insanity when a specific spell is cast."
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal resource state and should be called
    only when appropriate game logic requires an increase in insanity. It does not
    perform any validation on the input amount, so callers should ensure that the
    value passed is valid for their use case.
  warnings: Calling this method with a negative value may result in undefined behavior
    or resource depletion. Ensure proper bounds checking before invoking this method
    in performance-critical code paths.
