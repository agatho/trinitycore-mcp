documentation:
  brief: Destroys the LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter class is responsible
    for releasing any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the adapter.
    This method ensures proper cleanup when an instance of the LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter
    is no longer needed, preventing memory leaks and maintaining system stability.
    In the context of TrinityCore's bot framework, this destructor likely handles
    cleanup of bot-related data structures, connections, or internal state that may
    have been initialized during the object's lifetime. The method does not accept
    any parameters and performs no return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter instance
    code: 'LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter* adapter = new LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter();

      // ... use the adapter ...

      delete adapter; // Triggers the destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a standard C++ destructor and will be automatically invoked when
    an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. Developers should ensure
    that no other references to this object exist before deletion to avoid dangling
    pointer issues.
