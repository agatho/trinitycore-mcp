  brief: Stacks offensive cooldowns for the player in PvP combat.
  description: The StackOffensiveCooldowns method manages the application and stacking
    of offensive cooldowns for a player within PvP combat scenarios. This function
    is typically used by the PvPCombatAI class to control when and how offensive abilities
    can be used, ensuring proper cooldown management and strategic gameplay balance.
    The method evaluates the current state of the player's offensive abilities and
    applies appropriate cooldown stacking logic based on game mechanics and AI behavior
    patterns.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the offensive cooldowns were successfully stacked or applied;
    returns false if the operation failed or was not applicable due to current conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in PvP Combat
    code: "if (pvpCombatAI->StackOffensiveCooldowns(&playerId)) {\n    // Cooldowns\
      \ successfully stacked\n    // Proceed with next AI action\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PvP combat AI system and should only be called
    during active PvP encounters. The implementation may depend on internal state
    tracking of player abilities and cooldown timers.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a proper PvP combat context may lead to
    undefined behavior or incorrect cooldown application. Ensure that the player is
    in a valid PvP state before invoking this function.
