  signature: void LFGBotManager::UnregisterBotAssignment(int botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a bot assignment from the LFG system by its GUID.
  description: The UnregisterBotAssignment method removes a previously registered
    bot assignment from the Looking for Group (LFG) system within TrinityCore. This
    function is typically used when a bot needs to be removed from an active group
    or when a bot's role in a group has changed and it should no longer be tracked
    by the LFG manager. The method takes a single parameter representing the unique
    identifier (GUID) of the bot to be unregistered. It ensures that the bot is properly
    removed from internal tracking structures without affecting other active assignments.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose assignment needs to
      be unregistered. This value should correspond to a valid bot entry in the LFG
      system's tracking structures.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Unregister a bot with GUID 12345
    code: "LFGBotManager* lfgBotManager = sLFGMgr->GetLFGBotManager();\nif (lfgBotManager)\n\
      {\n    lfgBotManager->UnregisterBotAssignment(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided botGuid is valid and corresponds to
    an existing bot assignment. The implementation likely involves removing the bot
    from internal data structures such as maps or lists used for tracking LFG assignments.
    It may also trigger cleanup of associated resources or notifications to other
    systems.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent botGuid could lead
    to undefined behavior or errors. Ensure that the GUID corresponds to a known and
    active bot assignment before calling this function.
