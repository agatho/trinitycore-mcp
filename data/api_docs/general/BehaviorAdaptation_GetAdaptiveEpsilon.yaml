  method: GetAdaptiveEpsilon
  signature: float BehaviorAdaptation::GetAdaptiveEpsilon(uint32_t botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the adaptive epsilon value for a specified bot GUID used in behavior
    adaptation calculations.
  description: The GetAdaptiveEpsilon method retrieves a floating-point epsilon value
    associated with a specific bot identified by its GUID. This epsilon value is typically
    used in AI behavior adaptation algorithms to determine the threshold for decision-making
    or convergence criteria. The method operates on internal data structures that
    maintain adaptive parameters per bot, allowing for dynamic adjustment of AI behaviors
    based on environmental conditions or previous actions. It is commonly utilized
    in TrinityCore's bot system to fine-tune NPC or player-controlled bot behaviors
    during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the adaptive epsilon parameter for the specified
    bot. This value typically defines a small threshold used in comparisons or convergence
    checks within behavior adaptation logic, with typical ranges between 0.0 and 1.0
    depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve adaptive epsilon for a specific bot
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      float epsilon = behaviorAdaptation->GetAdaptiveEpsilon(botGuid);

      TC_LOG_INFO("bot", "Adaptive epsilon for bot %u is %f", botGuid, epsilon);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal state data structures that may be thread-unsafe
    if not properly synchronized. The returned epsilon value might be dynamically
    updated based on bot performance or environmental factors during runtime.
