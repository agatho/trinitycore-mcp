  class: GameObject
  method: SetSpellId
  signature: void GameObject::SetSpellId(uint32 id)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the spell ID for a game object, allowing it to trigger specific spells
    upon interaction.
  description: The SetSpellId method assigns a spell ID to a GameObject instance,
    which determines the spell that will be triggered when the object is interacted
    with by players. This method is commonly used in conjunction with game object
    templates and can be essential for implementing custom behaviors such as quest
    completion or spell activation. The spell ID set here typically corresponds to
    a specific spell that is defined in the database or script files, and affects
    how the GameObject behaves during interaction.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The spell ID to assign to the game object. This value should correspond
      to a valid spell entry in the database, typically used for triggering specific
      spells upon interaction.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Spell ID for Quest Completion
    code: 'GameObject* go = GameObject::CreateObject(180754);


      // Set spell ID to trigger a specific quest completion spell

      go->SetSpellId(12345);


      // The game object will now trigger the spell when interacted with'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other GameObject methods
    like SetGoState or SetOwner. It's important to note that setting a spell ID does
    not automatically make the GameObject trigger the spell; it must be properly configured
    in the database or script for the spell to activate upon interaction.
  warnings: Be cautious when setting spell IDs, as invalid or incorrect spell IDs
    can lead to unexpected behavior or errors during gameplay. Ensure that the spell
    ID corresponds to a valid spell entry in the database before setting it.
