  method: AddToWorld
  signature: void Pet::AddToWorld()
documentation:
  brief: Adds the pet to the world environment, making it visible and interactive
    to players.
  description: The AddToWorld method integrates a Pet object into the game world's
    active entities. This method ensures that the pet becomes visible to its owner
    and other nearby players, initializes its presence in the server's object manager,
    and prepares it for interaction with game systems such as movement, combat, and
    AI behavior. It is typically called internally by the core engine when a pet is
    summoned or created, and should not be invoked manually unless handling special
    cases or custom pet spawning logic. The method performs necessary setup operations
    including updating the pet's grid position, notifying nearby players of its appearance,
    and registering it with the world object manager.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pet Summoning
    code: 'Pet* myPet = new Pet();

      myPet->SetOwner(player);

      myPet->SetType(PET_TYPE_SUMMON);

      myPet->AddToWorld(); // Makes pet visible in the world'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after all necessary initialization of the
    Pet object is complete, including setting the owner, type, and position. It assumes
    that the pet has already been added to the player's pet list and that the necessary
    data structures are properly initialized.
  warnings: Calling AddToWorld on a pet that is already in the world may cause undefined
    behavior or duplicate entries in the object manager. Always ensure proper lifecycle
    management of pet objects.
