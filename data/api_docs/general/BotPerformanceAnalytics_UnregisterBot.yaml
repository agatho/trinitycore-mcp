  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: UnregisterBot
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::UnregisterBot(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a bot from performance analytics tracking by its unique identifier.
  description: The UnregisterBot method removes a specified bot from the performance
    analytics system, ensuring that subsequent performance data collection for this
    bot is halted. This function is typically invoked when a bot is destroyed, disconnected,
    or manually removed from the game world. The method takes the bot's unique identifier
    (GUID) as input and performs internal cleanup operations to prevent memory leaks
    or invalid references in the analytics subsystem. It is important that this method
    is called consistently with corresponding registration calls to maintain accurate
    performance metrics.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot to be unregistered from performance
      analytics. This value must correspond to a valid bot entity currently registered
      in the system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UnregisterBot Usage
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      botPerformanceAnalytics->UnregisterBot(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Unregistering Bot on Destruction
    code: "void OnBotDestroy(uint32_t botGuid)\n{\n    botPerformanceAnalytics->UnregisterBot(botGuid);\n\
      \    // Additional cleanup logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided GUID corresponds to a registered bot.
    If called with an invalid or unregistered GUID, behavior is undefined and may
    result in internal errors or data corruption. The implementation likely uses hash
    maps or similar data structures for efficient lookup and removal operations.
  warnings: Calling UnregisterBot with an invalid GUID can lead to system instability
    or crashes. Always ensure the bot exists in the analytics registry before calling
    this method. This function should not be called concurrently from multiple threads
    without proper synchronization.
