  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: EscortFlagCarrier
  signature: bool BattlegroundAI::EscortFlagCarrier(int * player, int * fc)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the battleground AI should escort the flag carrier during
    a capture the flag scenario.
  description: The EscortFlagCarrier method is used in battleground AI logic to decide
    whether the AI should actively escort or protect the player who currently carries
    the enemy flag. This method evaluates the current state of the battleground, including
    the flag carrier's position and the AI's assigned role or strategy. It typically
    returns true when the AI should prioritize protecting the flag carrier from enemy
    players, and false otherwise. The method is commonly used in battlegrounds such
    as Warsong Gulch or Arathi Basin where flag capture mechanics are involved.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player ID of the flag carrier.
      This value may be modified by the method to reflect updated information about
      the current flag carrier.
  - name: fc
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the flag carrier's current status
      or role in the battleground. This value is used internally by the AI to determine
      escort behavior.
  returns: Returns true if the AI should escort the flag carrier, otherwise returns
    false. The return value indicates whether the AI's current strategy involves prioritizing
    protection of the flag carrier.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in battleground AI
    code: "bool shouldEscort = bgAI->EscortFlagCarrier(&flagCarrierId, &flagCarrierStatus);\n\
      if (shouldEscort)\n{\n    // Execute escort behavior\n    ai->MoveTo(flagCarrierId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with flag capture logic
    code: "void BattlegroundAI::Update()\n{\n    int player = 0;\n    int fc = 0;\n\
      \    if (EscortFlagCarrier(&player, &fc))\n    {\n        // Escort the flag\
      \ carrier to safety\n        MoveTo(player);\n        SetTarget(player);\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground AI system and is typically called
    during the battleground update loop. The parameters 'player' and 'fc' may be modified
    by the method to reflect updated state information. It's important to note that
    this method only affects AI behavior in specific battleground types where flag
    capture mechanics are active.
  warnings: Incorrect handling of the player or fc parameters can lead to unexpected
    AI behavior, such as failing to escort the flag carrier or incorrectly targeting
    other players. Ensure that the input values are valid and properly initialized
    before calling this method.
