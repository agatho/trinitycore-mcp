  class: BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized
  method: SetMaxSessionsPerUpdate
  signature: void BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::SetMaxSessionsPerUpdate(uint32 max)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum number of bot sessions to process per update cycle in the
    optimized world session manager.
  description: This method configures the upper limit on the number of bot sessions
    that will be processed during each update iteration within the BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized
    class. It controls how many sessions are handled concurrently to balance performance
    and resource usage. The setting affects the frequency and efficiency of bot session
    updates without impacting active gameplay or core server operations. This value
    is typically used in scenarios where the server needs to manage a large number
    of bot sessions efficiently, such as during peak hours or when running extensive
    automated testing.
  parameters:
  - name: max
    description: The maximum number of bot sessions to process per update cycle. Valid
      values are positive integers. Setting this value too high may cause performance
      degradation due to excessive processing overhead, while setting it too low may
      result in delayed session updates.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Sessions Per Update
    code: 'BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized* sessionManager = BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::instance();

      sessionManager->SetMaxSessionsPerUpdate(100);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Session Processing for High Load
    code: "// Example of adjusting based on server load conditions\nif (serverLoad\
      \ > 80)\n{\n    sessionManager->SetMaxSessionsPerUpdate(50);\n}\nelse\n{\n \
      \   sessionManager->SetMaxSessionsPerUpdate(200);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly influences the update frequency of bot sessions. It's
    recommended to monitor system performance after adjusting this value to ensure
    optimal balance between responsiveness and resource consumption. The default value
    may vary depending on server configuration and should be tuned accordingly.
  warnings: Setting this value too high can lead to increased CPU usage and potential
    lag during updates. Conversely, setting it too low might cause bot sessions to
    become outdated or unresponsive if processing is delayed excessively. Avoid frequent
    changes to this parameter unless necessary for performance tuning.
