  method: AcceptDungeonInvite
  signature: bool GroupCoordinator::AcceptDungeonInvite()
documentation:
  brief: Accepts a dungeon invite from another player and attempts to join the corresponding
    dungeon group.
  description: The AcceptDungeonInvite method is used by a player's GroupCoordinator
    to accept an incoming dungeon invitation. This method handles the logic required
    to process the invite, including verifying the invite validity, checking if the
    player meets the necessary requirements (such as level or quest prerequisites),
    and attempting to add the player to the appropriate dungeon group. It ensures
    that the player is properly integrated into the group's dungeon instance, potentially
    handling queue management, loot distribution settings, and other group-related
    configurations. The method may also perform checks for raid restrictions, instance
    locks, or other game mechanics that affect dungeon entry.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the dungeon invite was successfully accepted and the player
    was added to the group; returns false if the operation failed due to invalid state,
    insufficient permissions, or other conditions preventing the acceptance of the
    invite.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (groupCoordinator->AcceptDungeonInvite()) {\n    // Player successfully\
      \ joined the dungeon group\n    sLog->outString(\"Player accepted dungeon invite.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Failed to accept the invite\n    sLog->outString(\"Failed\
      \ to accept dungeon invite.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically when a player receives a dungeon
    invite through the game's interface or chat system. It assumes that the necessary
    preconditions (such as having an active group, being in the correct zone, etc.)
    are already met. The implementation may involve asynchronous operations for handling
    server-side validation and group synchronization.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring proper state (e.g., no pending invite
    or invalid group context) may result in undefined behavior or failed join attempts.
    It should only be called when a valid dungeon invitation is present and ready
    to be accepted.
