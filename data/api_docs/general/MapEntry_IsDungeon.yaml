documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the map entry represents a dungeon type instance.
  description: The IsDungeon method checks if the current MapEntry object corresponds
    to a dungeon-type map. This is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    server implementation to differentiate between various map types such as dungeons,
    raids, battlegrounds, and world maps. The method evaluates internal flags or properties
    associated with the map entry to determine its dungeon classification. It returns
    true if the map is classified as a dungeon, false otherwise. This functionality
    is crucial for game mechanics that require specific handling of dungeon instances,
    such as quest tracking, loot distribution, and player encounter rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map entry represents a dungeon type map; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Dungeon Type
    code: "MapEntry* entry = sMapStore.LookupEntry(1234);\nif (entry && entry->IsDungeon())\
      \ {\n    // Handle dungeon-specific logic\n    printf(\"This map is a dungeon\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsDungeon in Player Instance Logic
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nMapEntry const* mapEntry = sMapStore.LookupEntry(player->GetMapId());\n\
      if (mapEntry && mapEntry->IsDungeon()) {\n    // Apply dungeon-specific rules\n\
      \    player->SetInDungeon(true);\n    // Additional dungeon handling code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal map flags or type definitions stored within
    the MapEntry structure. The implementation likely checks against predefined dungeon
    type constants or bitmasks. It's important to note that this check is performed
    at the map entry level, not the instance level, so it applies to all instances
    of a given map type.
  warnings: Ensure that the MapEntry pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid null pointer dereferences. The method assumes that the map entry has been
    properly initialized with correct type information. In some edge cases, custom
    or modified map entries might not behave as expected if their internal flags are
    not correctly set.
