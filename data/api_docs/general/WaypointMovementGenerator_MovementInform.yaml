  class: WaypointMovementGenerator
  method: MovementInform
  signature: void WaypointMovementGenerator::MovementInform(const Creature * param0)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Notifies the waypoint movement generator that a creature has reached a waypoint.
  description: The MovementInform method is called when a Creature using the WaypointMovementGenerator
    has successfully reached a waypoint in its path. This method serves as a callback
    mechanism to inform the movement generator that the creature has completed movement
    to a specific waypoint, allowing it to trigger subsequent actions such as waiting,
    changing direction, or proceeding to the next waypoint in the sequence. It is
    typically invoked by the AI system or movement manager when the creature's movement
    animation or pathfinding completes at a designated waypoint location.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A pointer to the Creature instance that has reached the waypoint.
      This parameter represents the entity whose movement has been completed and is
      used for context within the movement generator.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Context
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void MovementInform(uint32\
      \ type, uint32 id) override {\n        if (type == WAYPOINT_MOTION_TYPE && id\
      \ == 5) {\n            // Trigger action when waypoint 5 is reached\n      \
      \      DoSomething();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's movement system and is invoked internally
    by the game engine during path execution. Developers should not call this method
    directly unless implementing custom movement logic or extending existing movement
    generators.
  warnings: Incorrect handling of this callback may lead to unexpected behavior in
    creature movement sequences, such as skipping waypoints or failing to execute
    subsequent actions. Ensure that all waypoint-related logic is properly synchronized
    with the movement system.
