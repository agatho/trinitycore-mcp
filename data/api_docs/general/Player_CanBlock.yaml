  signature: bool Player::CanBlock() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player can block an incoming attack.
  description: The CanBlock method checks if the player's current combat stance allows
    for blocking attacks. This method is primarily used in combat scenarios to determine
    if a player has the ability to block incoming melee attacks, typically when using
    a shield or in defensive stances. The method returns true only if the player is
    in a stance that permits blocking, such as defensive stance or stance of the warrior.
    It does not consider weapon type or other factors beyond stance compatibility.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player can block attacks, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the player's current stance allows for blocking melee attacks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->CanBlock()) {\n    // Player can block incoming attacks\n \
      \   // Perform blocking logic here\n}\nelse {\n    // Player cannot block\n\
      \    // Handle accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation relies on the player's current stance and weapon type. This
    method does not consider whether the player has a shield equipped, but rather
    checks if the stance allows for blocking. Performance impact is minimal as it
    simply checks stance state.
  warnings: This method should be used in conjunction with other combat-related methods
    to determine full blocking capability. It does not account for weapon or shield
    availability, which may affect actual blocking ability.
