documentation:
  brief: Updates the buff states and effects for the subtlety rogue class.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing all
    active buffs and debuffs that affect a subtlety rogue character. This includes
    updating aura states, recalculating stat modifiers, and ensuring that the rogue's
    abilities remain properly enhanced or impaired based on their current buff status.
    The method typically runs during each update cycle to maintain accurate gameplay
    state and ensure that all passive and active effects are correctly applied to
    the player's performance.

  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void Update() {\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    _rogue.UpdateBuffs();\n\
      \    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to ensure that
    buff states remain accurate. It may internally iterate through all active auras
    and apply their effects, which could have performance implications if many buffs
    are present.
