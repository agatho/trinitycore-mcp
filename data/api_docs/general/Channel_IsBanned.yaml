  method: IsBanned
  signature: bool Channel::IsBanned(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player with the specified GUID is banned from the channel.
  description: The IsBanned method determines whether a player identified by their
    global unique identifier (GUID) is currently banned from joining or participating
    in the channel. This functionality is typically used to enforce channel restrictions
    and maintain order within in-game communication channels such as guild chat, general
    chat, or custom channels. The method performs a lookup in the channel's internal
    ban list and returns true if the player is found in that list, otherwise false.
    It does not modify any state; it only checks the current ban status of the specified
    player.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player with the given GUID is banned from the channel,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a player is banned from a channel
    code: "Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"GuildChat\", player->GetTeam());\n\
      if (channel && channel->IsBanned(player->GetGUID().GetCounter())) {\n    //\
      \ Player is banned\n    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      You are banned from this channel.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the channel object has already been initialized
    and contains valid ban data. The GUID parameter should be a valid player identifier
    obtained through standard TrinityCore APIs like GetGUID().GetCounter(). Performance
    is generally fast as it relies on internal hash maps or similar structures for
    O(1) lookup time.
  warnings: Ensure that the Channel object is not null before calling this method
    to avoid potential crashes. Also, note that GUIDs in TrinityCore are typically
    represented using the ObjectGuid type which includes both low and high parts;
    make sure you're extracting the correct portion if needed.
