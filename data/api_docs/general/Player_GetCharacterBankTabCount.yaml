api:
  class: Player
  method: GetCharacterBankTabCount
  signature: uint8 Player::GetCharacterBankTabCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of bank tabs available to the player character.
  description: This method retrieves the count of bank tabs that a player character
    has access to, which is determined by their level and class-specific abilities.
    The returned value represents the maximum number of bank tabs that can be unlocked
    for the player's character. This information is crucial for determining how many
    bank tab slots are available for use in the game world, particularly when considering
    the player's level requirements for unlocking additional bank tabs beyond the
    default initial tab. The method does not consider any temporary or permanent modifications
    to the bank tab count, such as those from achievements or items that might increase
    the number of available tabs.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the total number of bank tabs available
    to the player character, which can range from 1 to 9 depending on the player's
    level and class. The value is typically 1 for low-level characters and increases
    up to 9 for high-level characters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint8 bankTabCount = player->GetCharacterBankTabCount();\nif (bankTabCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Use bankTabCount to determine how many tabs are available\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other bank-related methods
    to determine the player's bank tab capacity. It should be noted that the actual
    number of bank tabs available may differ from what this method returns due to
    game mechanics such as level requirements or class-specific abilities.
  warnings: This method does not account for any modifications to bank tab count that
    might occur through achievements, items, or other in-game effects; developers
    should ensure that they consider all relevant factors when determining the actual
    number of bank tabs available.
