  method: EnableAdvancedCoordination
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::EnableAdvancedCoordination(uint32 groupId,
    bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables advanced coordination features for a specified instance
    group.
  description: The EnableAdvancedCoordination method controls whether advanced coordination
    mechanisms are active for a given instance group. This functionality is typically
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to manage complex instance behaviors,
    such as synchronized events, shared cooldowns, or coordinated player interactions
    across multiple players within the same group. The method takes a group identifier
    and a boolean flag to enable or disable the advanced coordination features. When
    enabled, the system may enforce stricter synchronization rules for group activities
    within the instance. This method is part of the InstanceCoordination class which
    handles various instance management tasks in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: The unique identifier of the instance group for which advanced coordination
      should be enabled or disabled. This value typically corresponds to a group ID
      used internally by the TrinityCore instance management system.
  - name: enable
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      advanced coordination features for the specified group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Advanced Coordination for Group
    code: 'InstanceCoordination* coord = sObjectAccessor->GetInstanceCoordination();

      coord->EnableAdvancedCoordination(12345, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Advanced Coordination for Group
    code: 'InstanceCoordination* coord = sObjectAccessor->GetInstanceCoordination();

      coord->EnableAdvancedCoordination(67890, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal state flags within the InstanceCoordination
    class. It may be used in conjunction with other coordination methods to manage
    complex instance behaviors. The groupId parameter should correspond to a valid
    group that has been previously registered with the instance system.
  warnings: Calling this method on an invalid or unregistered group ID may result
    in undefined behavior. Ensure that the groupId corresponds to an active instance
    group before calling this method.
