documentation:
  brief: Clears all recorded health issues for the bot
  description: The ClearAllHealthIssues method resets the internal state of the BotHealthCheck
    class by removing all previously recorded health-related problems or warnings
    for the associated bot. This method is typically used to reset the health monitoring
    system after resolving or ignoring previous issues, allowing the bot to start
    fresh with a clean health status. The operation does not affect the actual in-game
    health of the bot but only clears the tracking records within the health checking
    system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resetting Health Issues for a Bot
    code: 'BotHealthCheck healthCheck;

      // ... some health issues were previously recorded ...

      healthCheck.ClearAllHealthIssues(); // Clears all previous health warnings'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it permanently removes health issue
    tracking data. It is recommended to call this after addressing or dismissing health
    concerns to prevent redundant alerts.
