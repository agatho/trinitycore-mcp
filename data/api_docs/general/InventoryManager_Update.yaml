documentation:
  brief: Updates the inventory manager's internal state based on the elapsed game
    time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and maintaining the
    state of an inventory manager within the TrinityCore framework. It typically handles
    time-based operations such as updating cooldowns, refreshing item statuses, or
    performing periodic checks on player inventory contents. This method is commonly
    called from the main game loop to ensure that all inventory-related systems remain
    synchronized with the passage of time. The implementation may vary depending on
    the specific subclass or specialization of InventoryManager, but generally involves
    iterating through managed items and applying time-dependent logic.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other updates ...\n\
      \    _inventoryManager.Update(diff);\n    // ... other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly, typically every game tick or frame
    update. It is important that the 'diff' parameter accurately reflects the time
    elapsed since the last call to ensure proper cooldown and timing behavior.
