documentation:
  brief: Removes a calendar invite from the system by its unique identifier.
  description: The RemoveInvite method is responsible for removing a specific calendar
    invite from the system. It takes an invite ID, event ID, and a remover ID as parameters
    to identify which invite should be removed. This method is typically used when
    a player cancels their attendance at an event or when an event organizer removes
    a player's invitation. The remover parameter indicates who initiated the removal
    action, which may affect permissions or notifications. The method does not return
    any value but modifies the internal calendar data structures to reflect the removal
    of the invite.
  parameters:
  - name: inviteId
    description: The unique identifier of the calendar invite to be removed. This
      is typically a GUID that uniquely identifies the specific invitation within
      the calendar system.
  - name: eventId
    description: The unique identifier of the calendar event associated with the invite.
      This helps ensure that the correct event's invite is being removed and can be
      used for validation purposes.
  - name: remover
    description: The identifier of the player who is removing the invite. This could
      be the GUID of the player performing the removal action, which may be used to
      determine permissions or send appropriate notifications.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint64 inviteId = 123456789ULL;

      uint64 eventId = 987654321ULL;

      uint64 remover = 111222333ULL;

      CalendarMgr::instance()->RemoveInvite(inviteId, eventId, remover);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Invite with Current Player
    code: "uint64 inviteId = sCalendarMgr->GetInviteIdForPlayer(eventId, playerGuid);\n\
      if (inviteId)\n{\n    sCalendarMgr->RemoveInvite(inviteId, eventId, playerGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates database records and internal data structures
    to remove the invite. It may also send notifications to affected players or event
    organizers. The method should be called only when proper permission checks have
    been performed, as it directly modifies calendar data.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation may result in removing invites
    that shouldn't be removed. Ensure that the remover has appropriate permissions
    before calling this function. Also, make sure that both inviteId and eventId are
    valid identifiers to avoid unexpected behavior.
