documentation:
  brief: Sends group update packets to all members of the group
  description: The SendUpdate method serializes and broadcasts the current state of
    the group to all connected group members. This includes player positions, health,
    mana, and other relevant group member information. The method is typically called
    internally by the group system when changes occur that need to be propagated to
    all group members. It ensures synchronization between the server's internal group
    state and the client-side group UI, maintaining accurate group member data display
    for all players in the group.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->SendUpdate();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically called by the group system when member data
    changes, but can also be invoked manually to force an immediate update. The method
    may trigger network packets that could impact performance if called excessively
    in tight loops.
