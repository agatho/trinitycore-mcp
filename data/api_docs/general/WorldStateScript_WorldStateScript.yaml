  class: WorldStateScript
  method: WorldStateScript
  signature: void WorldStateScript::WorldStateScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a WorldStateScript with the specified name for handling world
    state events.
  description: The WorldStateScript constructor initializes a new instance of the
    WorldStateScript class with a given name. This class is used to manage and respond
    to world state changes in the game environment, such as updating UI elements,
    tracking quest progress, or modifying game variables that affect the overall world
    state. The name parameter uniquely identifies this script instance within the
    system, allowing for proper event routing and management. This constructor typically
    sets up internal data structures and registers the script with the appropriate
    event handlers to begin processing world state events.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated character string that serves as the unique identifier
      for this WorldStateScript instance. The name should be descriptive and unique
      within the context of the game's scripting system to avoid conflicts with other
      scripts.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic WorldStateScript Initialization
    code: WorldStateScript* script = new WorldStateScript("MyCustomWorldState");
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Script for Quest Tracking
    code: "class QuestWorldStateScript : public WorldStateScript\n{\npublic:\n   \
      \ QuestWorldStateScript() : WorldStateScript(\"QuestProgressState\") {}\n  \
      \  // Implementation details here\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The WorldStateScript constructor should be called during the initialization
    phase of a module or addon. The name parameter is critical for identifying and
    managing multiple script instances. Ensure that the name string remains valid
    throughout the lifetime of the script object to prevent memory access violations.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly on already initialized objects as
    it may lead to memory leaks or undefined behavior. The name parameter must be
    a valid, null-terminated C-string; passing invalid pointers can cause crashes.
