  method: UpdateUnholyState
  signature: void UnholyDeathKnightRefactored::UpdateUnholyState(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the unholy death knight's state based on target and current conditions
  description: The UpdateUnholyState method manages the internal state of an Unholy
    Death Knight AI, handling transitions between different combat states such as
    targeting, casting, and movement. This method evaluates the current target, checks
    for valid spell conditions, and updates the AI's behavior accordingly. It is typically
    called during the AI update cycle to ensure the death knight maintains optimal
    gameplay behavior in accordance with unholy specialization mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or index.
      This parameter determines which entity the death knight will focus on for spell
      casting and movement decisions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateUnholyState Usage
    code: "void Update()\n{\n    int targetId = GetTarget()->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n\
      \    UpdateUnholyState(&targetId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI update loop and should be called regularly
    to maintain proper state management. The target parameter must point to a valid
    entity identifier; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur.
  warnings: Do not call this method with a null pointer for target as it will likely
    cause a crash or unexpected behavior in the AI logic.
