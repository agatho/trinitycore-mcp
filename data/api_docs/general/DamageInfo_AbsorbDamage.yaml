  class: DamageInfo
  method: AbsorbDamage
  signature: void DamageInfo::AbsorbDamage(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Reduces the damage amount by the specified absorption value.
  description: The AbsorbDamage method modifies the current damage amount stored within
    the DamageInfo object by reducing it with the provided absorption value. This
    method is typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's combat system to
    simulate damage mitigation from shields, spells, or other defensive mechanisms.
    The method directly alters the internal state of the DamageInfo object, decreasing
    its total damage value. It does not perform any validation on the input amount
    and assumes that the absorption value is non-negative. This method is commonly
    called during the damage calculation phase of combat processing.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of damage to absorb from the current damage total. Must
      be a non-negative integer representing the mitigation value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Damage Absorption
    code: 'DamageInfo damageInfo;

      damageInfo.SetDamage(100); // Initial damage

      uint32 absorbed = 30;

      damageInfo.AbsorbDamage(absorbed); // Reduces damage to 70'
    language: cpp
  - title: Absorbing All Damage
    code: 'DamageInfo damageInfo;

      damageInfo.SetDamage(50);

      damageInfo.AbsorbDamage(50); // Damage reduced to 0

      uint32 remaining = damageInfo.GetDamage(); // Returns 0'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal damage value directly and should be called
    before any final damage application. The method does not check if the absorption
    amount exceeds the current damage; it simply subtracts the value, potentially
    resulting in negative damage values if absorption exceeds damage.
  warnings: Be cautious when using large absorption values that exceed the current
    damage amount, as this can lead to unexpected behavior or negative damage values
    in subsequent calculations. Ensure proper validation of input parameters before
    calling this method.
