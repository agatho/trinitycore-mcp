api:
  class: GameObject
  method: GetGoStateFor
  signature: int GameObject::GetGoStateFor(const int & viewer) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the game object state for a specific viewer.
  description: This method retrieves the current state of a game object as it appears
    to a particular viewer, which is essential for determining visibility and interaction
    status in World of Warcraft. The returned value represents the state of the GameObject
    from the perspective of the specified viewer, including whether it's visible,
    hidden, or in a specific animation state. This functionality is crucial for managing
    dynamic object states during quests, events, or player interactions where objects
    may change their appearance based on player conditions or game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: viewer
    description: The unique identifier of the viewer (player) for which to retrieve
      the game object state. This parameter represents the GUID of the player who
      is observing the GameObject.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the current state of the GameObject for
    the specified viewer. Possible values include 0 (default state), 1 (hidden), 2
    (visible), or other state values depending on the game object's configuration
    and the viewer's conditions. The exact meaning depends on the specific game object
    type and its implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: int state = gameObject->GetGoStateFor(playerGuid);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other GameObject state
    management functions to determine visibility and interaction status. Performance
    considerations include checking for valid viewer GUIDs before calling this method,
    as invalid GUIDs may lead to undefined behavior or errors.
  warnings: The method may return unexpected values if the viewer GUID is not properly
    initialized or if the GameObject state has not been updated according to game
    mechanics. Care should be taken when using this method in event-driven code where
    player states might change frequently.
