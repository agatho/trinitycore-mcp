    int race)
documentation:
  brief: Teaches spells to the player that are rewarded by skill level progress.
  description: The LearnSkillRewardedSpells method is responsible for granting spells
    to a player based on their skill level progression in a specific skill. This method
    typically gets invoked when a player's skill value reaches certain thresholds,
    allowing them to unlock new abilities or spells associated with that skill. It
    handles the logic of determining which spells should be learned at what skill
    levels and ensures these spells are properly added to the player's spell book.
    The method considers the skill ID, current skill value, and optionally the player's
    race to determine appropriate spell rewards.
  parameters:
  - name: skillId
    description: The unique identifier of the skill for which rewarded spells should
      be learned. This corresponds to the skill type in the game database.
  - name: skillValue
    description: The current value or level of the skill. This determines which spell
      rewards are unlocked based on predefined thresholds.
  - name: race
    description: The race of the player (optional parameter). Some spells may be race-specific
      and only granted to players of certain races.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for learning skill rewards
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->LearnSkillRewardedSpells(164, 300, 1);

      // Learns spells rewarded by the Blacksmithing skill at level 300 for Human
      race'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with different skill and race values
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      uint32 skillId = 165; // Leatherworking

      uint32 skillValue = 450; // Advanced level

      int race = 2; // Orc

      player->LearnSkillRewardedSpells(skillId, skillValue, race);

      // Grants orc-specific leatherworking spells at advanced level'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine during skill
    progression events. It may be invoked multiple times for a single skill as the
    player advances through different reward thresholds. The implementation relies
    on internal databases and configuration files that define which spells are rewarded
    at what skill levels.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you understand the underlying
    skill reward system. Improper usage could lead to incorrect spell learning or
    game state inconsistencies. Ensure that skill values and IDs correspond to valid
    entries in the game's database.
