  class: TradeManager
  method: RemoveFromBlacklist
  signature: void TradeManager::RemoveFromBlacklist(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from the trade manager's blacklist by their GUID.
  description: The RemoveFromBlacklist method removes a specified player, identified
    by their global unique identifier (GUID), from the trade manager's blacklist.
    This action allows the previously blacklisted player to once again engage in trading
    activities with the current player. The method operates on the internal blacklist
    data structure maintained by the TradeManager class and does not perform any validation
    on whether the GUID corresponds to an actual online or existing player. It is
    typically used in response to user requests or administrative actions to lift
    trade restrictions.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player to be removed from
      the blacklist. This value should correspond to a valid player GUID within the
      game's database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a Player from Blacklist
    code: 'TradeManager* tradeMgr = player->GetTradeData();

      tradeMgr->RemoveFromBlacklist(123456); // Removes player with GUID 123456 from
      blacklist'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GUID provided is valid and corresponds to an
    existing player in the game world. It does not perform any database lookups or
    checks for player existence. The internal state of the blacklist is modified directly
    without notifying other systems.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may lead to undefined
    behavior if the underlying data structure does not handle such cases gracefully.
    Ensure that the GUID corresponds to a known player before calling this method.
