  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: IsAoEPositionOptimal
  signature: bool LineOfSightManager::IsAoEPositionOptimal(const int & pos, const
    int & targets)
documentation:
  brief: Determines if an Area of Effect (AoE) position is optimal for targeting multiple
    enemies based on line of sight and positioning.
  description: The IsAoEPositionOptimal method evaluates whether a given position
    in the world is suitable for casting an Area of Effect spell or ability. It considers
    factors such as line of sight to targets, optimal positioning for maximum damage
    or effect coverage, and potential obstructions that might prevent effective targeting.
    This method is typically used by AI systems to determine the best location for
    casting AoE spells. The method takes into account the position where the AoE would
    be centered and the number of targets that would be affected. It returns true
    if the position allows for optimal targeting with minimal obstruction, and false
    otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position (likely a coordinate or index) where the Area of Effect
      would be centered. This represents the location in the world space from which
      the AoE spell or ability is cast.
  - name: targets
    description: The number of targets that would be affected by the Area of Effect
      at the specified position. This parameter influences how the method evaluates
      optimal positioning for maximum coverage and effectiveness.
  returns: Returns true if the given AoE position is considered optimal for targeting
    multiple enemies, meaning it provides clear line of sight to most or all targets
    with minimal obstruction. Returns false if the position is suboptimal due to obstacles,
    poor positioning, or insufficient target coverage.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (lineOfSightManager.IsAoEPositionOptimal(playerPosition, numberOfEnemies))\
      \ {\n    // Cast AoE spell at playerPosition\n    caster.CastSpellAtPosition(playerPosition,\
      \ SPELL_AOE_DAMAGE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with multiple potential positions
    code: "std::vector<int> possiblePositions = {100, 200, 300};\nint bestPosition\
      \ = -1;\nfor (int pos : possiblePositions) {\n    if (lineOfSightManager.IsAoEPositionOptimal(pos,\
      \ targetCount)) {\n        bestPosition = pos;\n        break;\n    }\n}\nif\
      \ (bestPosition != -1) {\n    // Execute AoE at bestPosition\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs complex spatial calculations involving collision
    detection, field-of-view checks, and target distribution analysis. It may be computationally
    expensive when used frequently in AI decision loops, so caching or precomputation
    might be beneficial for performance.
  warnings: The parameters 'pos' and 'targets' should represent valid world coordinates
    and integer counts respectively. Invalid or out-of-bounds values could lead to
    undefined behavior or incorrect results. The method assumes that the underlying
    world state is consistent when called.
