  signature: bool WorldSession::isLogingOut() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player session is in the process of logging out.
  description: The isLogingOut method determines whether a WorldSession is currently
    in the process of logging out. This flag is typically set when a player initiates
    the logout sequence, and it remains true until the logout process is fully completed.
    The method is commonly used to prevent certain operations during logout, such
    as sending packets or modifying player state. It's an essential utility for maintaining
    session integrity and preventing race conditions during player disconnection.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the session is in the process of logging out, false otherwise.
    This boolean value indicates the current logout state of the player's session.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to prevent operations during logout
    code: "if (!session->isLogingOut()) {\n    // Safe to send packets or modify player\
      \ state\n    session->SendPacket(packet);\n} else {\n    // Skip sending packets\
      \ during logout\n    sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_NETWORKIO, \"Skipping packet\
      \ send during logout\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a logout guard condition
    code: "void Player::HandleLogout() {\n    if (GetSession() && !GetSession()->isLogingOut())\
      \ {\n        GetSession()->SetLogoutTimer(10000); // 10 seconds\n        //\
      \ Proceed with logout logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    logout flag is managed internally by the session management system, and developers
    should not manually set or clear it. This method provides a reliable way to check
    the session state without needing to access internal session flags directly.
  warnings: Do not use this method as a replacement for proper session lifecycle management.
    While useful for preventing operations during logout, it should not be used to
    determine if a session is valid for other purposes. Also, be aware that the logout
    process may involve multiple steps and the flag may be set before all cleanup
    operations are complete.
