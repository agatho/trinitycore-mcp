  brief: Returns the name of the guild
  description: The GetName method retrieves the human-readable name of the guild as
    stored in the database. This string is used for display purposes in the user interface,
    chat messages, and other game systems that reference guilds by name. The returned
    reference points to an internal string member of the Guild class, ensuring efficient
    access without unnecessary copying. The method does not perform any validation
    or modification of the guild's name; it simply returns the stored value. This
    operation is safe to call from any thread that has access to the Guild object
    instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the guild's name. The
    string is guaranteed to be valid and non-empty for all properly initialized Guild
    objects. No null or error conditions are possible as this is a getter method.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Guild* myGuild = sObjectMgr->GetGuildById(12345);\nif (myGuild)\n{\n  \
      \  const std::string& guildName = myGuild->GetName();\n    printf(\"Guild name:\
      \ %s\\n\", guildName.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Chat Message
    code: "Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345));\n\
      if (player && player->GetGuild())\n{\n    std::string message = \"Welcome to\
      \ the guild: \" + player->GetGuild()->GetName();\n    player->SendNotification(message.c_str());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned string reference is valid only as long as the Guild object remains
    in scope and has not been destroyed. Since this is a const method, it does not
    modify any internal state of the Guild object. The implementation likely uses
    cached data from the database to avoid repeated lookups for performance reasons.
