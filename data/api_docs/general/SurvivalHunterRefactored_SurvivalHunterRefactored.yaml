  brief: Initializes a Survival Hunter bot with default settings and behavior configurations.
  description: The SurvivalHunterRefactored constructor initializes a player bot specifically
    configured for survival hunting gameplay. This method sets up essential attributes,
    abilities, and AI behaviors required for the bot to function as a survival hunter
    within the TrinityCore environment. It configures the bot's class-specific mechanics
    such as pet management, ability usage, and tactical decision-making routines.
    The initialization process ensures that the bot adheres to survival hunter gameplay
    paradigms including proper resource management, optimal shot selection, and environmental
    awareness.

  - title: Basic Survival Hunter Bot Initialization
    code: 'Player* bot = new Player();

      SurvivalHunterRefactored hunterBot(bot);

      // The bot is now initialized with survival hunter behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The method
    assumes that the provided Player object has been properly allocated and configured.
    Implementation details include setting up default talent points, initializing
    pet AI, and configuring combat behavior trees specific to survival hunters.
  warnings: Calling this constructor on an already initialized bot may lead to undefined
    behavior or memory leaks. Ensure that the Player pointer is valid and not null
    before calling this method.
