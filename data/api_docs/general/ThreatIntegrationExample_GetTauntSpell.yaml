  class: ThreatIntegrationExample
  method: GetTauntSpell
  signature: uint32 ThreatIntegrationExample::GetTauntSpell(int playerClass)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the spell ID of the taunt ability associated with a given player
    class.
  description: The GetTauntSpell method retrieves the unique identifier (spell ID)
    for the taunt spell that is appropriate for the specified player class. This functionality
    is commonly used in threat management systems within World of Warcraft's AI and
    combat mechanics to determine which taunt spell should be cast by a mob or NPC
    when targeting a specific player class. The method assumes a predefined mapping
    between player classes and their corresponding taunt spells, typically aligned
    with game mechanics where different classes have different taunt abilities. It
    is important to note that this method does not validate the input parameter; it
    is expected that the provided class ID corresponds to a valid player class within
    the game's framework.
  parameters:
  - name: playerClass
    description: An integer representing the player class identifier. Valid values
      typically correspond to the standard World of Warcraft class IDs (e.g., 1 for
      Warrior, 2 for Paladin, etc.). The method expects a valid class ID that maps
      to an existing taunt spell in the game's database.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the spell ID of the taunt ability associated
    with the given player class. If no mapping exists for the provided class, the
    method may return zero or an invalid spell ID, which should be handled by the
    calling code.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 tauntSpellId = threatExample.GetTauntSpell(1); // Gets taunt spell\
      \ for Warrior class\nif (tauntSpellId != 0)\n{\n    // Use the spell ID to cast\
      \ taunt on target\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Logic
    code: "class ThreatIntegrationExample\n{\npublic:\n    uint32 GetTauntSpell(int\
      \ playerClass);\n    void ApplyTaunt(Unit* target, int playerClass)\n    {\n\
      \        uint32 spellId = GetTauntSpell(playerClass);\n        if (spellId !=\
      \ 0 && target)\n        {\n            DoCast(target, spellId);\n        }\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger threat management system and should be used
    in conjunction with other AI-related methods for proper combat behavior. The implementation
    relies on internal class-to-spell mappings that are typically defined in game
    databases or hardcoded configurations. It is recommended to cache the results
    if this method is called frequently during combat.
  warnings: The method does not perform any validation on the input parameter 'playerClass'.
    Passing an invalid class ID may result in unexpected behavior or return a zero
    spell ID, which could lead to silent failures in AI logic. Ensure that only valid
    player class IDs are passed to this method.
