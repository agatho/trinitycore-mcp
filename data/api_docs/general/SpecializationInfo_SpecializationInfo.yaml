documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the SpecializationInfo class with default values.
  description: The SpecializationInfo constructor initializes a new instance of the
    SpecializationInfo class, setting up internal data structures and default state
    values. This method is typically called when creating a new specialization information
    object for a player character. The constructor ensures that all member variables
    are properly initialized to their default states, which may include resetting
    specialization-related flags, clearing cached data, or preparing internal buffers
    for subsequent operations. In the context of TrinityCore's architecture, this
    constructor is part of the player specialization management system and is invoked
    during character loading or when new specialization data needs to be created.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new SpecializationInfo instance
    code: 'SpecializationInfo specInfo;

      // This creates a new specialization info object with default values

      // ready for use in player specialization management'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically not called directly by developers but rather
    invoked automatically during object creation. The implementation may perform initialization
    of internal data structures that are required for tracking player specializations,
    including but not limited to talent points, spell knowledge, and specialization-specific
    abilities.
