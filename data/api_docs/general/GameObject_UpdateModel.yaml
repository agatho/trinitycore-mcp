documentation:
  brief: Updates the model of the GameObject to reflect its current state
  description: The UpdateModel method is responsible for updating the visual representation
    of a GameObject in the game world. This method ensures that the object's model
    is properly synchronized with its current state, including any changes to its
    appearance, animation, or display properties. It typically involves recalculating
    and applying the necessary transformations to the GameObject's mesh data, which
    may include updating textures, positions, or other visual elements based on the
    object's current state. This method is essential for maintaining accurate visual
    representation of game objects during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->UpdateModel();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called whenever the GameObject's state changes in a
    way that affects its visual representation. The implementation typically involves
    updating the object's mesh data and may include synchronization with client-side
    rendering systems.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can result in visual artifacts or incorrect
    display of game objects, particularly if called without proper synchronization
    with the game world state.
