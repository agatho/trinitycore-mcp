documentation:
  brief: Performs emergency healing on a specified group member using the Druid's
    restoration abilities
  description: The HandleEmergencyHealing method executes a priority healing action
    targeting a specific group member within the Druid's current group. This method
    is designed to provide immediate healing support during high-pressure combat situations,
    typically triggered by in-game events or player commands. It evaluates the target's
    health status and applies the most appropriate healing spell based on available
    mana and spell cooldowns. The method returns true if the healing was successfully
    initiated, or false if no valid target could be found or if healing conditions
    were not met.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier specifying which group member to heal. Valid
      values are typically 0-4 for party members or -1 for self-healing.
  returns: Returns true if emergency healing was successfully initiated on the target,
    false otherwise. The method may return false if no valid target exists, insufficient
    mana, or if the target is already at full health.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Emergency Healing Usage
    code: "if (druid->HandleEmergencyHealing(0)) {\n    // Healing successfully initiated\
      \ on group member 0\n    LOG_INFO(\"player\", \"Emergency healing applied to\
      \ group member 0\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Emergency Healing with Error Handling
    code: "int targetGroup = player->GetGroup() ? player->GetGroup()->GetMemberGroup(player->GetGUID())\
      \ : -1;\nif (targetGroup >= 0) {\n    if (!druid->HandleEmergencyHealing(targetGroup))\
      \ {\n        // Attempt fallback healing\n        druid->HandleBasicHealing();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat situations where immediate
    healing is required. The Druid's mana pool and spell cooldowns are automatically
    checked before execution. The method assumes that the Druid has a valid group
    context and target selection mechanism in place.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper group context or target validation
    may result in undefined behavior. Ensure the Druid is in a valid combat situation
    and has sufficient mana before invoking this method to prevent unnecessary spell
    casting failures.
