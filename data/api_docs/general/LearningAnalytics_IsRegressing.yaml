  signature: bool LearningAnalytics::IsRegressing(uint32_t botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified bot is currently regressing in learning progress
  description: The IsRegressing method checks if a bot identified by its GUID has
    experienced a decline in learning progress. This typically occurs when a bot's
    skill levels or knowledge base decreases, which may happen due to various game
    mechanics such as skill decay, reset conditions, or specific gameplay events.
    The method returns true if the bot is regressing and false otherwise. It is commonly
    used within the LearningAnalytics system to monitor and respond to changes in
    bot learning behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot to check for regression.
      This should be a valid uint32_t value representing a registered bot in the system.
  returns: Returns true if the specified bot is currently regressing in learning progress,
    false otherwise. A regression indicates that the bot's skill or knowledge levels
    have decreased compared to previous measurements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of IsRegressing
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = 12345;\nif (learningAnalytics.IsRegressing(botGuid))\
      \ {\n    // Handle regression case\n    std::cout << \"Bot is regressing\" <<\
      \ std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"Bot is not regressing\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal tracking mechanisms to compare current
    and historical learning data for each bot. It may involve comparing skill levels,
    experience points, or other measurable learning metrics over time.
