documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes a percentage modifier to override spell power based on
    attack power.
  description: This method modifies the player's spell power by a specified percentage
    based on their attack power, allowing for dynamic adjustment of spell damage output.
    The modification is applied or removed depending on the boolean parameter 'apply'.
    This functionality is commonly used in custom scripts or game mechanics that require
    adjustments to spell power calculations based on attack power values. The method
    affects the player's ability to deal spell damage and can be used in conjunction
    with other spell power modifiers for complex gameplay scenarios.
  parameters:

    description: The percentage modifier value to apply or remove from spell power.
      This value is typically positive, representing a percentage increase in spell
      power based on attack power.
  - name: apply
    description: Determines whether to apply (true) or remove (false) the modifier.
      When true, the modifier is applied; when false, it is removed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      float mod = 10.0f;

      player->ApplyModOverrideSpellPowerByAPPercent(mod, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      float mod = 5.5f;

  notes: This method is typically used in custom scripts or game mechanics that require
    dynamic adjustment of spell power based on attack power. It may be used in conjunction
    with other spell power modifiers to achieve desired effects. The modification
    affects the player's overall spell damage output and should be used carefully
    in custom content.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly in standard gameplay without proper
    understanding of its implications. Incorrect usage can lead to unexpected spell
    power calculations and may affect game balance. Also, this method is typically
    used in conjunction with other spell power modifiers, so care must be taken to
    avoid conflicts or double modifications.
