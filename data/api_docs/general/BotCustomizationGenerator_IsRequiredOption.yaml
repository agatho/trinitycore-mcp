  signature: bool BotCustomizationGenerator::IsRequiredOption(uint32 optionId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot customization option is required for character creation.
  description: The IsRequiredOption method checks if a specific bot customization
    option is mandatory for the bot's character creation process. This method evaluates
    the internal configuration and rules set forth by the TrinityCore framework to
    determine if an option must be selected by the user or if it will be automatically
    applied. The method is typically used during bot initialization and character
    generation to ensure that all required customizations are properly handled before
    the bot is fully instantiated in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified customization option is required for bot
    creation, false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the option must
    be selected or applied during character generation, while false means the option
    is optional or not enforced by the system.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a customization option is required
    code: "uint32 optionId = 12345;\nif (botCustomizationGenerator->IsRequiredOption(optionId))\
      \ {\n    // Handle required option logic\n    printf(\"Option %u is required\
      \ for bot creation\\n\", optionId);\n} else {\n    // Handle optional option\
      \ logic\n    printf(\"Option %u is not required\\n\", optionId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal data structures that define which customization
    options are mandatory. The implementation may cache results for performance reasons,
    and the method should be called during appropriate initialization phases to avoid
    inconsistent state checks.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called before the bot customization generator
    has been properly initialized with all necessary configuration data. Calling this
    method in an uninitialized state may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect return
    values.
