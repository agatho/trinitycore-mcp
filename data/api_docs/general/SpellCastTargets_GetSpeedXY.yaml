  class: SpellCastTargets
  method: GetSpeedXY
  signature: float SpellCastTargets::GetSpeedXY() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the horizontal speed of the spell's target movement.
  description: The GetSpeedXY method computes the horizontal (X,Y) speed of a spell's
    target movement, which is used in spell casting mechanics to determine how fast
    a target is moving horizontally during the cast. This value is typically used
    for calculating spell effects that depend on target velocity or for adjusting
    spell trajectory calculations. The method returns a float representing the speed
    in game units per second along the horizontal plane.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the horizontal speed of the spell's target movement
    in game units per second. Returns zero if no valid target exists or if the target
    is stationary.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "SpellCastTargets targets;\nfloat speed = targets.GetSpeedXY();\nif (speed\
      \ > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Apply spell effects based on target movement speed\n  \
      \  // For example, adjust damage or duration\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Spell Effect Calculation
    code: "void CalculateSpellEffect(SpellCastTargets& targets)\n{\n    float speed\
      \ = targets.GetSpeedXY();\n    if (speed > 0.0f)\n    {\n        // Reduce spell\
      \ effectiveness based on movement speed\n        float effectiveness = 1.0f\
      \ / (1.0f + speed * 0.1f);\n        // Apply modified damage or effect\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in spell casting logic where target movement
    affects spell outcomes. The returned value represents the horizontal component
    of velocity only, excluding vertical movement. It's important to note that this
    method should only be called when a valid target exists in the SpellCastTargets
    object.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or invalid SpellCastTargets object
    may return unexpected results. Always verify that a target exists before calling
    GetSpeedXY() to avoid incorrect calculations. The returned value is not thread-safe
    and should not be used in multithreaded contexts without proper synchronization.
