  signature: bool CombatManager::HasPvECombat() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the CombatManager has any active PvE combat state.
  description: The HasPvECombat method determines whether the CombatManager instance
    currently has an active Player versus Environment (PvE) combat state. This typically
    indicates that the player or unit associated with this combat manager is engaged
    in combat against non-player entities such as monsters, NPCs, or creatures. The
    method returns true if there is an ongoing PvE combat session and false otherwise.
    This check is commonly used in game logic to determine when certain actions, abilities,
    or behaviors should be enabled or disabled based on the combat state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if there is an active PvE combat state; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (combatManager.HasPvECombat()) {\n    // Player is in PvE combat, handle\
      \ accordingly\n    HandlePvECombatState();\n} else {\n    // Player is not in\
      \ PvE combat\n    HandlePeacefulState();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Logic
    code: "void Player::UpdateCombatState() {\n    if (combatManager.HasPvECombat())\
      \ {\n        // Apply combat-specific effects\n        ApplyCombatBuff();\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Remove combat effects\n        RemoveCombatBuff();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks internal flags or state variables within the CombatManager
    to determine if PvE combat is active. It may be used in conjunction with other
    combat-related methods like HasPvPCombat() or GetCombatState(). The implementation
    might involve checking for active combat targets, combat timers, or related combat
    session data.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is called at appropriate times during the game
    loop to avoid stale state information. In multi-threaded environments, consider
    synchronization if the combat state can be modified concurrently by other systems.
