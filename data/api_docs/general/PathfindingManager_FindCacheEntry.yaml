  class: PathfindingManager
  method: FindCacheEntry
  signature: PathCacheEntry * PathfindingManager::FindCacheEntry(const int & start,
    const int & goal)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a cached pathfinding entry for the specified start and goal node
    IDs.
  description: The FindCacheEntry method searches the internal pathfinding cache for
    an existing entry that matches the provided start and goal node identifiers. This
    method is used to avoid recomputing paths when the same route between two points
    has already been calculated and stored. The cache improves performance by reusing
    previously computed navigation paths. If no matching entry exists in the cache,
    the method returns a null pointer, indicating that a new path calculation is required.
    This functionality is essential for efficient AI pathfinding in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore environment.
  parameters:
  - name: start
    description: The unique identifier of the starting node in the navigation graph.
      This value typically represents a waypoint or position in the game world that
      the AI agent begins from.
  - name: goal
    description: The unique identifier of the destination node in the navigation graph.
      This value typically represents a waypoint or position in the game world that
      the AI agent is trying to reach.
  returns: A pointer to a PathCacheEntry object if a cached path exists for the given
    start and goal nodes; otherwise, returns nullptr if no matching cache entry is
    found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of FindCacheEntry
    code: "PathCacheEntry* entry = pathfindingManager->FindCacheEntry(1001, 2005);\n\
      if (entry != nullptr) {\n    // Use cached path\n    std::cout << \"Cached path\
      \ found for nodes 1001 to 2005\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Compute new\
      \ path\n    std::cout << \"No cached path, computing new one...\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the pathfinding system's caching mechanism. It assumes
    that node IDs are unique and properly indexed within the navigation mesh. The
    cache entries may have expiration or eviction policies depending on implementation
    details, so it's recommended to check for validity before using returned entries.
