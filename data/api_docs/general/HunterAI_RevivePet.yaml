documentation:
  brief: Revives the hunter's pet if it is dead and has a valid corpse.
  description: The RevivePet method attempts to revive a hunter's pet that has died.
    It checks if the pet is currently dead and has a corpse available for revival.
    If these conditions are met, the method will restore the pet to life with its
    health and mana restored to full. This functionality is typically used in conjunction
    with the hunter's pet management system within the AI framework of TrinityCore.
    The method does not perform any action if the pet is already alive or if no corpse
    exists for revival.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic RevivePet Usage
    code: "void MyHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_owner->GetPet() &&\
      \ m_owner->GetPet()->IsDead())\n    {\n        RevivePet();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system when a hunter's
    pet dies and needs to be revived. It assumes that the hunter has a valid pet and
    that the pet's corpse exists in the world. The actual revival process involves
    restoring the pet's health, mana, and other vital stats to their maximum values.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the pet is confirmed to be dead
    and has a corpse available. Calling it on a living pet or without a valid corpse
    may result in undefined behavior or errors within the AI system.
