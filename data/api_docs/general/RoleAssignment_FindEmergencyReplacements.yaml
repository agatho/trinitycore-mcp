  class: RoleAssignment
  method: FindEmergencyReplacements
  signature: int RoleAssignment::FindEmergencyReplacements(GroupRole role, uint32
    minLevel, uint32 maxLevel)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the count of available emergency replacements for a specified
    group role within the given level range.
  description: The FindEmergencyReplacements method searches through the player base
    to identify eligible candidates who can serve as emergency replacements for a
    specific group role (such as tank, healer, or damage dealer) within the provided
    minimum and maximum level constraints. This method is typically used in dynamic
    group management systems where roles need to be filled quickly during instance
    encounters or raids. It evaluates players based on their current role assignments,
    availability, and level requirements to determine how many suitable replacements
    exist. The method does not modify any existing data but instead provides a count
    that can be used by the calling code to make decisions about group composition
    or role adjustments.
  parameters:
  - name: role
    description: The GroupRole enum value specifying which type of replacement role
      is being queried (e.g., TANK, HEALER, DAMAGE). This determines what roles will
      be considered for replacement.
  - name: minLevel
    description: The minimum character level that a potential replacement must meet
      or exceed to be considered valid. Must be a positive integer.
  - name: maxLevel
    description: The maximum character level that a potential replacement can have.
      Must be greater than or equal to minLevel.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of players who qualify as emergency
    replacements for the specified role within the given level range. A return value
    of zero indicates no suitable candidates were found.
  examples:
  - title: Find Emergency Tank Replacements
    code: "int tankReplacements = roleAssignment->FindEmergencyReplacements(GroupRole::TANK,\
      \ 80, 90);\nif (tankReplacements > 0) {\n    // Proceed with assigning tanks\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check for Emergency Healer Availability
    code: "int healerReplacements = roleAssignment->FindEmergencyReplacements(GroupRole::HEALER,\
      \ 70, 85);\nif (healerReplacements >= 2) {\n    // Assign two healers\n} else\
      \ if (healerReplacements == 1) {\n    // Assign one healer and consider alternative\
      \ strategies\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a lookup in the group management system's internal
    data structures to find players with matching roles and levels. It may involve
    checking player availability flags, group membership status, and role assignment
    states. The implementation might cache results or use optimized search algorithms
    for performance in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that minLevel is not greater than maxLevel; otherwise, the method
    may return unexpected results or throw an exception depending on internal validation.
    Be aware that this method only considers players who are currently available and
    eligible for role assignment, which might exclude those in combat or other restricted
    states.
