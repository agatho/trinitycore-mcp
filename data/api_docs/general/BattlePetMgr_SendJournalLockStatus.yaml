documentation:
  brief: Sends the battle pet journal lock status to the player's client.
  description: The SendJournalLockStatus method is responsible for transmitting the
    current lock status of the player's battle pet journal to their client. This functionality
    is part of the Battle Pet system in World of Warcraft, specifically within the
    TrinityCore framework. The method ensures that the client UI accurately reflects
    whether the battle pet journal is locked or unlocked, which affects the player's
    ability to interact with certain battle pet features such as adding new pets to
    their collection or modifying existing ones. This method typically gets invoked
    when a player logs in, when the journal state changes, or when specific game events
    occur that might alter the lock status.

  - title: Basic Usage in Player Login Context
    code: "void Player::OnLogin()\n{\n    // Other login logic...\n    _battlePetMgr->SendJournalLockStatus();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the client-side packet system to send a
    specific opcode related to battle pet journal states. It is important that this
    method is called at appropriate times during player session initialization and
    state changes to maintain synchronization between server and client.
