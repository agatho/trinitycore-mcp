documentation:
  brief: Generates pain for the Vengeance Demon Hunter, increasing their damage output.
  description: The GeneratePain method is used to increase the pain resource of a
    Vengeance Demon Hunter class. This method typically corresponds to abilities that
    generate pain, such as from damaging attacks or specific spells in the Vengeance
    build. Pain is a core resource for Vengeance Demon Hunters, used to fuel various
    abilities and enhance damage output. The method takes an amount parameter which
    determines how much pain is generated. This action usually occurs during combat
    when the Demon Hunter deals or receives damage, or when using certain abilities
    that generate pain.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of pain to be generated. This value represents the amount
      of pain resource added to the Demon Hunter's current pain pool. Valid values
      are positive integers representing pain generation amounts.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pain Generation
    code: DemonHunter->GeneratePain(100);
    language: cpp
  - title: Generating Pain Based on Damage Dealt
    code: 'uint32 damage = target->GetHealth() / 10;

      player->GeneratePain(damage);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat events, such as when the Demon
    Hunter deals damage or takes damage. The pain resource directly affects the effectiveness
    of various Vengeance abilities and should be managed carefully to maximize damage
    output.
  warnings: Ensure that the amount parameter is a positive integer; negative values
    may cause unexpected behavior in pain calculation systems. This method should
    not be called outside of combat contexts unless specifically required by game
    mechanics.
