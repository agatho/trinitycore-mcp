api:
  class: AuctionHouse
  method: IsPriceBelowMarket
  signature: bool AuctionHouse::IsPriceBelowMarket(uint32 itemId, uint32 price, float
    threshold)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given auction price is below the market value for an
    item.
  description: The IsPriceBelowMarket method evaluates if a specified auction price
    for an item is lower than the current market rate. This function is typically
    used in auction house logic to identify potentially underpriced listings or to
    enforce pricing policies. It compares the provided price against the calculated
    or cached market value of the item, using a configurable threshold to determine
    if the difference is significant enough to be considered below market level.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item being evaluated in the auction
      house. Must correspond to a valid item in the game database.
  - name: price
    description: The price offered for the item in the auction house, represented
      in copper (100 copper = 1 silver, 100 silver = 1 gold).
  - name: threshold
    description: A float value representing the percentage threshold below which a
      price is considered below market. For example, a threshold of 0.8 means the
      price must be less than 80% of the market value to return true.
  returns: Returns true if the provided price is below the calculated market value
    by more than the specified threshold; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an auction price is below market
    code: "if (auctionHouse->IsPriceBelowMarket(12345, 5000, 0.9f)) {\n    // Handle\
      \ case where item is priced below 90% of market value\n    printf(\"Item is\
      \ significantly underpriced\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal caching or database lookups to determine
    current market prices. The threshold parameter allows for flexible definition
    of what constitutes 'below market' and can be adjusted based on game balance requirements.
