  class: AuraApplication
  method: GetRemoveMode
  signature: AuraRemoveMode AuraApplication::GetRemoveMode() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the removal mode of the aura application.
  description: The GetRemoveMode method returns the AuraRemoveMode enum value that
    indicates how the aura is being removed from the target. This information is crucial
    for determining the context and reason behind an aura's removal, such as expiration,
    cancellation, or dispel effects. The returned mode helps in triggering appropriate
    actions or events based on how the aura was removed. This method is typically
    used during aura application lifecycle management within TrinityCore's combat
    and effect systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: The AuraRemoveMode enum value representing the removal context of the aura.
    Possible values include AURA_REMOVE_MODE_NONE, AURA_REMOVE_MODE_EXPIRE, AURA_REMOVE_MODE_CANCEL,
    AURA_REMOVE_MODE_DISPEL, and others depending on the specific removal mechanism.
  examples:
  - title: Check Aura Removal Mode
    code: "AuraRemoveMode mode = auraApp->GetRemoveMode();\nif (mode == AURA_REMOVE_MODE_EXPIRE)\n\
      {\n    // Handle expiration logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Aura expired.\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a constant getter and does not modify the aura application
    state. It should be called during aura removal events to determine the appropriate
    response based on how the aura was removed.
