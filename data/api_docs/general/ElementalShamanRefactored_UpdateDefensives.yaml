documentation:
  brief: Updates the defensive abilities and cooldowns of the elemental shaman.
  description: The UpdateDefensives method manages the state and timing of defensive
    abilities for an elemental shaman character within the TrinityCore framework.
    This includes handling cooldowns, mana costs, and activation states of defensive
    spells such as Earth Shield, Stone Bulwark Totem, and other defensive cooldowns.
    The method is typically called during AI updates or when defensive abilities are
    triggered or refreshed. It ensures that defensive abilities are properly tracked
    and available for use according to game mechanics and cooldown restrictions.

  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void ElementalShamanAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    _shaman->UpdateDefensives();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the elemental shaman's AI behavior and should be called
    regularly during the creature's update cycle. It assumes that the shaman has a
    valid reference to its spell system and cooldown tracking mechanisms. The implementation
    may involve checking for active buffs, mana availability, and cooldown timers.
