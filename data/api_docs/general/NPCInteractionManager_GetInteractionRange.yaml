  signature: float NPCInteractionManager::GetInteractionRange(Creature * npc) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the interaction range of a specified NPC creature.
  description: The GetInteractionRange method returns the float value representing
    the maximum distance at which a player can interact with the given NPC creature.
    This range is typically defined by the NPC's AI configuration and determines how
    close a player must be to initiate dialogue or other interactions. The returned
    value is used internally by the TrinityCore framework to validate interaction
    eligibility and enforce game mechanics related to NPC proximity. This method does
    not perform any validation on the input creature pointer, so it assumes a valid
    Creature object is provided.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the interaction range in yards. This value typically
    corresponds to the NPC's defined interaction distance as configured in the database
    or AI settings.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Creature* npc = ...; // Assume valid NPC pointer

      float range = NPCInteractionManager::GetInteractionRange(npc);

      // Use range for distance calculations or UI display'
    language: cpp
  - title: Interaction Validation
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player pointer\nCreature* npc = ...;\
      \ // Assume valid NPC pointer\nfloat interactionRange = NPCInteractionManager::GetInteractionRange(npc);\n\
      float distance = player->GetDistance(npc);\nif (distance <= interactionRange)\n\
      {\n    // Allow interaction\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Deny interaction or show error\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely cached or computed once per NPC instance and may vary
    based on the creature's template, AI type, or dynamic state. It should be used
    carefully in performance-critical code paths as it might involve database lookups
    or configuration reads depending on implementation details.
  warnings: Ensure that the Creature pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null; otherwise, calling this method may result in undefined behavior or crashes.
    The returned range value should not be modified directly as it represents a static
    configuration parameter.
