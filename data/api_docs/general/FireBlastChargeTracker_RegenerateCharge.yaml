documentation:
  brief: Regenerates a fire blast charge for the player.
  description: The RegenerateCharge method is responsible for restoring a single charge
    to the Fire Blast ability. This method typically gets invoked when a player's
    Fire Blast cooldown expires or when specific game events occur that allow for
    charge regeneration. It updates internal tracking variables to reflect the newly
    available charge, ensuring the player can use the ability again. The method does
    not directly interact with the player's visual state or send packets to clients;
    it only manages the charge count within the game logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Ability Logic
    code: "void FireBlastSpell::HandleCast()\n{\n    if (m_chargeTracker.HasCharges())\n\
      \    {\n        m_chargeTracker.UseCharge();\n        // Cast the spell\n  \
      \  }\n    else\n    {\n        m_chargeTracker.RegenerateCharge(); // Regenerate\
      \ one charge\n        // Retry or notify player\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the game engine when a charge
    becomes available. It's important to note that this method does not trigger any
    visual effects or send updates to the client; it only modifies internal state.
