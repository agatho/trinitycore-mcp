  class: IBotSpawner
  method: SetMaxBots
  signature: void IBotSpawner::SetMaxBots(uint32 maxBots)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum number of bots that can be spawned by this spawner.
  description: The SetMaxBots method configures the upper limit for the number of
    bot characters that this spawner instance is allowed to create. This value acts
    as a cap to prevent unlimited bot generation and helps manage server resources.
    The method typically updates an internal counter or configuration parameter within
    the spawner object. It's commonly used in bot management systems, particularly
    in World of Warcraft TrinityCore environments where automated player characters
    (bots) are utilized for testing, training, or gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: maxBots
    description: The maximum number of bots allowed to be spawned by this spawner.
      Must be a non-negative integer value representing the desired cap on bot count.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Bots to 10
    code: 'IBotSpawner* spawner = GetBotSpawner();

      spawner->SetMaxBots(10);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disabling Bot Spawning
    code: 'IBotSpawner* spawner = GetBotSpawner();

      spawner->SetMaxBots(0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates an internal variable that is checked during bot
    creation attempts. The actual enforcement of this limit may occur in other methods
    like SpawnBot() or during the initialization phase of the spawner.
