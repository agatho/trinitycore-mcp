  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: AdaptCoordinationToGroupSkill
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::AdaptCoordinationToGroupSkill(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts instance coordination settings based on the group's skill level and
    requirements.
  description: The AdaptCoordinationToGroupSkill method modifies instance coordination
    parameters to align with the skill level and capabilities of the provided group.
    This ensures that players are matched appropriately for instance content, taking
    into account their collective skill, experience, and progression. The method likely
    adjusts difficulty settings, loot distribution, or other instance-specific behaviors
    based on group composition. It is typically invoked when a group enters an instance
    or when group composition changes during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose skill level and composition will
      be used to adjust instance coordination settings. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adjusting instance coordination for a group entering a dungeon
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    instanceCoordination->AdaptCoordinationToGroupSkill(myGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal group management systems to determine
    appropriate difficulty scaling and content matching. It may be called automatically
    by the core when a group enters an instance, or manually during dynamic adjustments.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid before calling this method; passing
    a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
