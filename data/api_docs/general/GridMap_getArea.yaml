  class: GridMap
  method: getArea
  signature: uint16 GridMap::getArea(float x, float y) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the area ID at the specified coordinates within the grid map.
  description: The getArea method returns the unique identifier of the area associated
    with the given x and y coordinates on the grid map. This is used in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore to determine which geographical area a specific point belongs to,
    which is essential for various game mechanics such as zone-based events, quest
    triggers, and area-specific effects. The method performs coordinate validation
    internally and returns a default area ID if the coordinates are outside the valid
    map bounds. This functionality is crucial for spatial queries within the game
    world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint16 value representing the area ID at the specified coordinates. Returns
    0 if the coordinates are invalid or outside the map boundaries, indicating a default
    or unknown area.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Get Area ID
    code: "float x = 1234.5f;\nfloat y = 6789.0f;\nuint16 areaId = gridMap.getArea(x,\
      \ y);\nif (areaId != 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Player is in area ID: %u\\n\", areaId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Area ID for Zone-Based Logic
    code: "void HandlePlayerEnterArea(float x, float y)\n{\n    uint16 areaId = gridMap.getArea(x,\
      \ y);\n    switch (areaId)\n    {\n        case 1234: // Example dungeon area\n\
      \            StartDungeonEvent();\n            break;\n        case 5678: //\
      \ Example raid area\n            StartRaidEvent();\n            break;\n   \
      \     default:\n            printf(\"Entered unknown area\\n\");\n         \
      \   break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other grid map functions
    for spatial reasoning. The returned area ID corresponds to the AreaTable.dbc entries
    in the game database. Performance-wise, this operation is relatively fast as it
    uses precomputed grid data structures. The method assumes that x and y coordinates
    are in the same coordinate system as the grid map (typically in map units).
  warnings: Be aware that returning 0 does not always indicate an error - it may simply
    mean the coordinates are outside a defined area or in a default region. Always
    validate the returned area ID against your expected valid range to avoid unexpected
    behavior.
