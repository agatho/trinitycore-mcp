  class: ObjectPosSelector
  method: FirstAngle
  signature: bool ObjectPosSelector::FirstAngle(float & angle)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and returns the first angle for object positioning selection.
  description: The FirstAngle method initializes the angle selection process for positioning
    objects within a specified area. It sets up the initial angle value that can be
    used in subsequent positioning calculations, typically for spawning objects like
    creatures or game objects in circular or angular patterns. This method is commonly
    used in AI behavior and object placement logic where precise angular positioning
    is required. The method returns true if the initialization was successful and
    false otherwise, indicating whether a valid starting angle could be determined.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initial angle was successfully set and the selection
    process can proceed; returns false if no valid angle could be determined or if
    the selector is already in use.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for object positioning
    code: "ObjectPosSelector selector;\nfloat angle;\nif (selector.FirstAngle(angle))\
      \ {\n    // Use the angle for positioning\n    printf(\"First angle: %f\\n\"\
      , angle);\n} else {\n    printf(\"Failed to get first angle\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used as part of a larger object positioning system
    where multiple angles are calculated and selected. It's important to note that
    calling FirstAngle resets the internal state of the selector, so it should be
    called before any other angle-related operations.
  warnings: Calling this method on an already initialized selector may reset its internal
    state, potentially causing unexpected behavior if not handled properly. Ensure
    that all previous positioning calculations are complete before calling this method.
