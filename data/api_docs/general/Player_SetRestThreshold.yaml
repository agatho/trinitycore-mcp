  method: SetRestThreshold
  signature: void Player::SetRestThreshold(RestTypes type, uint32 threshold)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the rest threshold for the player, determining when rested experience
    is awarded.
  description: This method configures the rest threshold for a player character, which
    controls at what point the game awards rested experience. The threshold parameter
    defines the maximum amount of rest that can be accumulated before rested experience
    begins to be awarded. This is typically used in conjunction with the RestTypes
    enum to specify whether the threshold applies to normal resting or extended resting.
    The method affects how much rested experience a player receives when they log
    out and return to the game, particularly in terms of their rested state and experience
    gain.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The rest type (RestTypes enum) that determines whether this threshold
      applies to normal or extended resting. Valid values are RestTypes::REST_TYPE_NORMAL
      or RestTypes::REST_TYPE_EXTENDED.
  - name: threshold
    description: The maximum amount of rest (in milliseconds) that can be accumulated
      before rested experience begins to be awarded. This value represents the threshold
      at which rested experience starts being applied to the player's experience gain.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Rest Threshold for Normal Rest
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetRestThreshold(RestTypes::REST_TYPE_NORMAL, 10000);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Rest Threshold for Extended Rest
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetRestThreshold(RestTypes::REST_TYPE_EXTENDED, 30000);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other rest-related methods
    to control how rested experience is calculated. The threshold value must be set
    before logging out or entering a zone where rested experience applies. It's important
    to note that this method does not directly affect the player's current rested
    state, but rather sets the threshold for future rest calculations.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player is in a state where
    they can properly set their resting threshold. If called incorrectly, it may result
    in incorrect experience calculations or even cause the player to lose experience
    points if the threshold is set too low.
