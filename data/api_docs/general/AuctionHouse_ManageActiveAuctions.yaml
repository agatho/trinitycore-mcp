  class: AuctionHouse

  signature: void AuctionHouse::ManageActiveAuctions(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Manages active auctions in the auction house, processing bids and updating
    auction states.
  description: The ManageActiveAuctions method is responsible for handling the lifecycle
    of active auctions within the auction house system. It processes incoming bids,
    updates auction statuses, and manages the removal of expired or sold auctions
    from the auction list. This method typically runs on a periodic basis to ensure
    that all active auctions are properly maintained and that players receive appropriate
    notifications regarding their bids or auction outcomes. The method operates on
    the auction house's internal data structures and may interact with player sessions
    to deliver relevant updates.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier (GUID) associated
      with the auction management operation. This parameter is used to determine which
      player's auctions should be managed or if specific player-related actions need
      to be performed during the auction processing.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Auction Management
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      AuctionHouse* ah = sAuctionHouseMgr->GetAuctionHouse(0);

      ah->ManageActiveAuctions(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the auction house manager or during periodic
    server updates. It's important to ensure that any player-specific operations are
    properly synchronized to avoid race conditions in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Improper handling of the player parameter may lead to incorrect auction
    processing for specific players. Ensure that the pointer passed is valid and points
    to a legitimate player identifier.
