  class: BotProfiler
  method: SyncWithAIProfiler
  signature: void BotProfiler::SyncWithAIProfiler()
documentation:
  brief: Synchronizes bot profiler data with the AI profiler to ensure consistent
    performance metrics collection.
  description: The SyncWithAIProfiler method aligns internal bot profiling statistics
    with the global AI profiler system. This synchronization ensures that bot-related
    performance data is accurately tracked and reported alongside general AI behavior
    metrics. The method likely updates internal counters, timestamps, or statistical
    aggregates to match the current state of the AI profiler. It may be called periodically
    or upon specific events to maintain data consistency between the bot subsystem
    and the broader AI monitoring infrastructure.

  - title: Basic Synchronization Call
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      profiler.SyncWithAIProfiler();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly to maintain accurate profiling data.
    It may involve locking mechanisms or thread synchronization to ensure data consistency
    when accessed from multiple threads.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper throttling might introduce
    performance overhead. Ensure that the AI profiler is initialized before calling
    this method.
