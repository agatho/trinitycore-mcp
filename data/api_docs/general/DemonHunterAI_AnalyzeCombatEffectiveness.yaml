  class: DemonHunterAI
  method: AnalyzeCombatEffectiveness
  signature: void DemonHunterAI::AnalyzeCombatEffectiveness()
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates the combat effectiveness of the Demon Hunter AI during active encounters.
  description: The AnalyzeCombatEffectiveness method performs a comprehensive assessment
    of the Demon Hunter's performance in combat scenarios. It evaluates various factors
    such as damage output, ability usage efficiency, threat generation, and overall
    tactical decision-making during fights. This method is typically invoked during
    or after combat engagements to gather data that can be used for AI behavior adjustments,
    performance metrics, or strategic analysis. The evaluation considers both immediate
    combat actions and long-term resource management decisions made by the AI.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Analysis
    code: "void MyDemonHunter::OnCombatEnd()\n{\n    AnalyzeCombatEffectiveness();\n\
      \    // Process combat effectiveness data for AI improvement\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Demon Hunter AI subsystem and should only be called
    during active combat or shortly after combat ends. It may perform resource-intensive
    calculations that could impact performance if called too frequently outside of
    combat contexts.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of combat scenarios may produce inaccurate
    results or cause unexpected behavior. The method assumes valid combat state data
    is available, so calling it without an active encounter may lead to undefined
    behavior.
