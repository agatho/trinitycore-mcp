  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: GetTopPerformers
  signature: std::vector<BotPerformanceProfile> BotPerformanceAnalytics::GetTopPerformers(uint32_t
    count) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of top-performing bot profiles based on performance analytics.
  description: The GetTopPerformers method returns a vector containing the highest-ranking
    bot performance profiles according to internal analytics criteria. This method
    is typically used to identify and retrieve bots with the best performance metrics,
    such as efficiency, response time, or task completion rates. The returned profiles
    are sorted in descending order of performance, with the most efficient bots appearing
    first. This functionality is useful for monitoring bot behavior, identifying optimal
    configurations, or performing administrative tasks within a TrinityCore-based
    World of Warcraft server environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector<BotPerformanceProfile> containing the top-performing bot
    profiles sorted by performance metrics in descending order. Each profile includes
    relevant performance data such as execution times, task completion rates, and
    other measurable indicators.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Top 5 Performers
    code: "std::vector<BotPerformanceProfile> topBots = analytics.GetTopPerformers(5);\n\
      for (const auto& profile : topBots) {\n    std::cout << \"Bot ID: \" << profile.botId\
      \ << \", Performance Score: \" << profile.score << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve performance overhead if called frequently due to
    sorting and analytics calculations. The implementation likely caches results internally
    for efficiency, but repeated calls with varying counts might trigger recalculation.
    Ensure that the BotPerformanceAnalytics instance is properly initialized before
    calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or improperly configured BotPerformanceAnalytics
    object may result in undefined behavior or empty return vectors. Avoid using large
    count values that could overwhelm system resources or cause memory issues.
