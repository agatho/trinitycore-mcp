  class: ComplaintTicket
  method: ComplaintTicket
  signature: void ComplaintTicket::ComplaintTicket(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new complaint ticket for the specified player.
  description: The ComplaintTicket constructor initializes a new complaint ticket
    associated with a specific player. This method sets up the internal state of the
    ticket, including linking it to the provided player object and initializing default
    values for ticket properties such as timestamp, status, and priority. The ticket
    is typically created when a player submits a complaint through the in-game interface
    or via the GM ticket system. This constructor ensures that all necessary data
    structures are properly allocated and initialized before the ticket can be processed
    by the complaint handling system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new complaint ticket for a player
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player object is already created

      ComplaintTicket ticket(player);

      // The ticket is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when creating a new complaint ticket
    instance. It does not submit the ticket to the server; that requires calling a
    separate submission method. The player parameter must be a valid, non-null pointer
    to an existing Player object.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer as the player parameter will likely cause undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always ensure the player object is properly initialized before
    passing it to this constructor.
