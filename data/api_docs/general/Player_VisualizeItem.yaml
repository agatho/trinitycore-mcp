documentation:
  brief: Displays an item in a player's inventory slot.
  description: The VisualizeItem method allows a player to display an item in a specific
    inventory slot, typically used for visualizing items during gameplay or for debugging
    purposes. This method is commonly employed when setting up items for display in
    the player's inventory without actually equipping them, which can be useful for
    testing or modifying item appearance. The method operates on the player's inventory
    slot and item parameters to ensure proper visualization of the item.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The inventory slot where the item will be visualized. Valid values
      are 0-18, representing different inventory positions (e.g., bag slots, equipped
      items, etc.).
  - name: pItem
    description: Pointer to the Item object that will be visualized in the specified
      slot. Must be a valid Item object or nullptr.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic item visualization example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      Item* item = Item::CreateItem(12345, player);

      player->VisualizeItem(1, item);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for visualizing items in the player's inventory
    without actually equipping them. It does not modify the item's actual properties
    or stats; it only displays the item visually.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it may cause visual inconsistencies
    if the item is not properly initialized or if the slot is invalid. Also, this
    method does not handle item stacking correctly and may lead to display issues
    if multiple items are visualized in the same slot.
