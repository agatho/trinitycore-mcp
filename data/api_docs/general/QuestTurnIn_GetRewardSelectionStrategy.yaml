documentation:
  brief: Determines the reward selection strategy for a bot's quest turn-in based
    on the bot's GUID
  description: The GetRewardSelectionStrategy method evaluates the appropriate reward
    selection approach for a bot when turning in a quest. This method considers various
    factors such as the bot's level, available rewards, quest requirements, and the
    bot's current inventory state to determine whether to select the first available
    reward, the most valuable reward, or a randomly selected reward. The strategy
    returned can influence how the bot prioritizes quest rewards during automated
    quest completion processes within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot player character for which
      to determine the reward selection strategy
  returns: Returns a RewardSelectionStrategy enum value indicating the appropriate
    reward selection approach for the specified bot. Possible values include SELECT_FIRST,
    SELECT_HIGHEST_VALUE, SELECT_RANDOM, or other strategy types defined in the RewardSelectionStrategy
    enumeration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine reward strategy
    code: "uint32 botGuid = 12345;\nRewardSelectionStrategy strategy = questTurnIn.GetRewardSelectionStrategy(botGuid);\n\
      switch (strategy)\n{\n    case SELECT_FIRST:\n        // Handle first reward\
      \ selection\n        break;\n    case SELECT_HIGHEST_VALUE:\n        // Handle\
      \ highest value reward selection\n        break;\n    default:\n        // Handle\
      \ other strategies\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using strategy to optimize quest completion
    code: "uint32 botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nRewardSelectionStrategy\
      \ strategy = questTurnIn.GetRewardSelectionStrategy(botGuid);\nif (strategy\
      \ == SELECT_HIGHEST_VALUE)\n{\n    // Prioritize valuable rewards for this bot\n\
      \    // Implementation for selecting highest value reward\n}\nelse if (strategy\
      \ == SELECT_FIRST)\n{\n    // Select first available reward\n    // Implementation\
      \ for first reward selection\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in automated quest completion systems where
    bots need to make decisions about which rewards to select. The implementation
    may vary based on bot configuration, quest type, and server settings. The method
    should be called before attempting to process quest rewards to ensure proper reward
    selection behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid parameter is valid and corresponds to an existing
    bot character, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. The returned strategy value
    should always be checked for validity before using it in reward selection logic.
