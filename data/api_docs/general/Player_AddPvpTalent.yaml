documentation:
  brief: Adds a PvP talent to the player's active talent group.
  description: This method allows adding a PvP talent to a player's active talent
    group, enabling them to gain access to specific PvP abilities and bonuses. The
    method requires a valid PvpTalentEntry pointer and specifies which talent group
    and slot to use. It is typically used during character progression or when modifying
    player's PvP talent configuration. The method returns true if successful, false
    otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: talent
    description: Pointer to the PvpTalentEntry structure defining the talent to be
      added. Must be a valid pointer to a valid PvP talent entry.
  - name: activeTalentGroup
    description: The active talent group (0 or 1) to add the talent to. Typically
      corresponds to the primary or secondary talent group.
  - name: slot
    description: The slot position in the talent tree where the talent should be placed.
      Must be within valid range (0-10).
  returns: Returns true if the talent was successfully added to the player's active
    talent group, false otherwise. The method may return false if the parameters are
    invalid or if the talent is already present in the specified slot.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();


      PvpTalentEntry* talent = new PvpTalentEntry;

      talent->Id = 12345;

      talent->Rank = 1;


      bool result = player->AddPvpTalent(talent, 0, 0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include checking for valid talent entry and ensuring
    proper slot positioning. The method may involve updating internal talent data
    structures and potentially triggering UI updates. Performance considerations are
    minimal as this is a simple operation.
  warnings: The method may fail if the provided PvpTalentEntry pointer is invalid
    or if the slot number exceeds the allowed range. Ensure that the talent entry
    has valid values before calling this method.
