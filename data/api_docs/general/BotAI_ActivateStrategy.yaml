  class: BotAI
  method: ActivateStrategy
  signature: void BotAI::ActivateStrategy(const std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Activates a specified AI strategy for the bot.
  description: The ActivateStrategy method enables a predefined AI behavior strategy
    for a bot instance. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore framework
    to dynamically switch or enable different AI logic paths for bot characters. The
    strategy name corresponds to a registered AI strategy that has been previously
    defined in the system. When called, this method updates the bot's active strategy
    state, potentially altering its decision-making process and behavior patterns
    during gameplay. The activation may involve initializing strategy-specific variables,
    setting up internal state machines, or modifying the bot's action priority queues.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The string identifier of the AI strategy to activate. This must correspond
      to a valid, previously registered strategy within the BotAI system. Strategy
      names are typically defined in configuration files or through the AI framework's
      registration mechanism.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Activate a basic combat strategy
    code: 'BotAI* botAI = ...;

      botAI->ActivateStrategy("combat");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Activate a movement-based strategy
    code: 'BotAI* botAI = ...;

      botAI->ActivateStrategy("follow_leader");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the BotAI system's core functionality and should be
    called carefully to avoid conflicts with existing active strategies. The strategy
    activation process may involve internal state transitions that could affect the
    bot's current actions or decisions.
  warnings: Calling ActivateStrategy with an invalid or unregistered strategy name
    may result in undefined behavior or runtime errors. Ensure all strategy names
    are properly registered before attempting activation.
