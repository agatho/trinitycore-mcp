  class: IBotSession
  method: QueuePacket
  signature: void IBotSession::QueuePacket(WorldPacket && packet)
documentation:
  brief: Queues a WorldPacket for transmission to the client.
  description: The QueuePacket method schedules a WorldPacket to be sent to the connected
    client at a later time. This method is typically used by bot implementations to
    defer packet sending until the appropriate moment in the game loop or script execution.
    The packet is added to an internal queue and will be processed according to the
    session's transmission logic. This approach allows for better control over network
    traffic and ensures that packets are sent in a timely manner without blocking
    the main execution thread.
  parameters:
  - name: packet
    description: An rvalue reference to a WorldPacket object containing the data to
      be queued for transmission. The packet should be properly constructed with valid
      opcode and data before being passed to this method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Packet Queueing
    code: 'WorldPacket packet(CMSG_PLAYER_LOGIN);

      packet << uint32(12345);

      botSession->QueuePacket(std::move(packet));'
    language: cpp
  - title: Queuing Multiple Packets
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)\n{\n    WorldPacket packet(SMSG_UPDATE_OBJECT);\n\
      \    packet << uint32(i);\n    botSession->QueuePacket(std::move(packet));\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not immediately send the packet. It only queues it for later
    transmission. The actual sending occurs during the session's update cycle or when
    explicitly flushed. This design helps prevent network congestion and ensures proper
    timing of packet delivery.
  warnings: Ensure that the WorldPacket is properly constructed before queuing, as
    invalid packets may cause client-side errors or disconnections. Avoid queuing
    extremely large packets repeatedly as this can lead to memory issues or performance
    degradation.
