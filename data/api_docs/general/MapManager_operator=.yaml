  brief: Moves a MapManager object by transferring ownership of its resources to another
    MapManager instance.
  description: The move assignment operator for MapManager transfers all resources
    from the source MapManager object to the current object, leaving the source in
    a valid but unspecified state. This operation is typically used to efficiently
    transfer ownership of map data structures and associated resources without performing
    deep copies. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server implementation,
    this method allows efficient management of map instances during object lifecycle
    operations, such as when reassigning map managers or handling temporary map objects.
    The operation is designed to be noexcept and should not throw exceptions under
    normal circumstances.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current MapManager object after the move assignment
    has been completed, allowing for chaining of assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'MapManager manager1;

      MapManager manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Move-assigns manager1 to manager2

      // manager1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Move Assignments
    code: 'MapManager m1, m2, m3;

      // ... initialize maps ...

      m3 = std::move(m2) = std::move(m1); // Chained move assignments

      // m1 and m2 are now in valid but unspecified states'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore engine for efficient
    resource management. It's important to note that after a move operation, the source
    object should not be used in any way that would access its moved resources, as
    they are now owned by the target object. The implementation assumes that the MapManager
    class properly implements move semantics for all contained data members.
  warnings: Using this operator on an already moved-from object can lead to undefined
    behavior. Always ensure that objects are not used after being moved from unless
    explicitly reset or reassigned. This method should only be called when you're
    certain about the ownership transfer and have no further use for the source object.
