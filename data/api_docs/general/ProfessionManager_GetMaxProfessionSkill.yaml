  class: ProfessionManager
  method: GetMaxProfessionSkill
  signature: uint16 ProfessionManager::GetMaxProfessionSkill(int * player, ProfessionType
    profession) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum skill level a player can achieve for a specified profession.
  description: The GetMaxProfessionSkill method retrieves the highest possible skill
    value that a player can attain in a given profession. This value is typically
    determined by game mechanics such as character level caps, profession-specific
    limits, or server configuration settings. The method takes a pointer to a player
    object and a profession type identifier to determine the appropriate maximum skill
    level. It is commonly used in skill progression calculations, UI displays, and
    validation checks for profession-related actions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object for which the maximum profession skill
      is being retrieved. This parameter must not be null.
  - name: profession
    description: Identifier representing the specific profession type (e.g., Blacksmithing,
      Alchemy). The value should correspond to a valid ProfessionType enumeration.
  returns: Returns a uint16 value representing the maximum skill level achievable
    for the specified profession. A return value of 0 typically indicates an invalid
    profession or player state.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Maximum Skill for Blacksmithing
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      ProfessionType profession = PROFESSION_BLACKSMITHING;

      uint16 maxSkill = sProfessionManager->GetMaxProfessionSkill(player, profession);

      // maxSkill now contains the maximum skill level for blacksmithing'
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if Player Can Max Out a Profession
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint16 maxSkill = sProfessionManager->GetMaxProfessionSkill(player,\
      \ PROFESSION_ALCHEMY);\nif (player->GetSkillValue(PROFESSION_ALCHEMY) >= maxSkill)\n\
      {\n    // Player has reached maximum skill for Alchemy\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal validation of the player object and
    profession type to ensure valid data. It may also consider server-specific configuration
    settings that define maximum skill limits. The method is expected to be thread-safe
    as it only reads from existing data structures without modifying them.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. Also,
    verify that the profession type passed is valid; invalid values may return unexpected
    results or zero.
