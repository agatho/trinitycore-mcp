documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the level of the player from the who list information.
  description: The GetLevel method returns the current level of a player as stored
    in the WhoListPlayerInfo structure. This method is typically used when processing
    player data within the 'who' command functionality of TrinityCore. The returned
    value represents the character's level, which is an unsigned 8-bit integer ranging
    from 1 to 255 in most cases, though the actual range may vary based on game expansion
    and server configuration. This method does not perform any validation or modification
    of the internal data; it simply retrieves and returns the stored level value.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the player's current level. Valid values typically
    range from 1 to 255, though specific server configurations may alter this range.
    The method will always return a valid level value that was previously set in the
    WhoListPlayerInfo object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Who Command Handler
    code: 'WhoListPlayerInfo playerInfo;

      // Assume playerInfo is populated with data

      uint8 playerLevel = playerInfo.GetLevel();

      std::cout << "Player level: " << static_cast<int>(playerLevel) << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Filtering Players by Level in Who List
    code: "for (auto& player : whoList)\n{\n    uint8 level = player.GetLevel();\n\
      \    if (level >= 60)\n    {\n        // Process players of level 60 or higher\n\
      \        std::cout << \"High-level player: \" << player.GetName() << \" (Level\
      \ \" << static_cast<int>(level) << \")\" << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter and does not involve any database access or
    computation. It directly returns the level value that was set during object initialization
    or data population. The method is thread-safe as it only reads from immutable
    data fields.
