  signature: uint32 ObjectGridLoaderBase::GetLoadedCreatures() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of creatures loaded in the grid.
  description: The GetLoadedCreatures method retrieves the count of all creature objects
    that have been successfully loaded and are currently active within the grid associated
    with this ObjectGridLoaderBase instance. This method is typically used during
    grid loading/unloading operations to track how many creatures are present in a
    specific grid section. The returned value represents the current state of loaded
    creatures and may change as creatures are added or removed from the grid during
    gameplay. This functionality is essential for maintaining proper memory management
    and ensuring that grid-based systems can accurately determine their creature population.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of creature objects currently
    loaded in the grid. Returns zero if no creatures are loaded or if the grid has
    not been initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Creature Count
    code: "uint32 creatureCount = gridLoader->GetLoadedCreatures();\nif (creatureCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"Grid contains %u creatures.\", creatureCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Grid Load for Performance
    code: "ObjectGridLoaderBase* loader = GetGridLoader();\nuint32 loadedCreatures\
      \ = loader->GetLoadedCreatures();\nif (loadedCreatures > 100)\n{\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      High creature load detected in grid: %u creatures\", loadedCreatures);\n   \
      \ // Implement performance optimizations or warnings\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a snapshot of the current state and does not account
    for asynchronous loading operations. The value returned should be considered volatile
    as creature objects may be added or removed from the grid at any time during gameplay.
    This method is likely used internally by TrinityCore's grid management system
    to determine when grids need to be loaded or unloaded.
  warnings: The return value is only valid for the moment it is called and may become
    outdated immediately after. Do not rely on this value for long-term decisions
    without re-querying. This method should not be called from within critical sections
    where grid state changes are occurring, as it may lead to inconsistent results.
