  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: AdaptToEncounterPhase
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::AdaptToEncounterPhase(Group * group, uint32 encounterId,
    uint32 phase)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts dungeon behavior based on the current encounter phase for a given
    group.
  description: The AdaptToEncounterPhase method modifies the behavior of a dungeon
    instance in response to changes in the encounter phase. This method is typically
    invoked when an encounter transitions between different phases, such as from initial
    engagement to a specific mechanic phase. It ensures that group members are properly
    adjusted in terms of positioning, abilities, or other game state elements relevant
    to the current phase. The method operates on a provided group object and uses
    the encounter ID and phase information to determine appropriate adjustments.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group involved
      in the dungeon encounter.
  - name: encounterId
    description: Unique identifier for the current encounter within the dungeon instance.
  - name: phase
    description: Current phase of the encounter, used to determine how behavior should
      be adapted for the group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Encounter Phase Change
    code: 'DungeonBehavior* dungeonBehavior = ...;

      Group* playerGroup = ...;

      dungeonBehavior->AdaptToEncounterPhase(playerGroup, 12345, 2);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger encounter management system and may
    interact with other systems such as phase tracking, player positioning, or ability
    adjustments. It should be called whenever an encounter phase changes to ensure
    proper behavior adaptation.
