  class: BotWorldPositioner
  method: ValidateZones
  signature: void BotWorldPositioner::ValidateZones()
documentation:
  brief: Validates and ensures zone data consistency for bot world positioning within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The ValidateZones method performs internal checks to ensure that all
    zone-related data used by the BotWorldPositioner class is consistent and up-to-date.
    This method likely verifies that bots are positioned correctly within their respective
    zones, checking for valid zone IDs, proper zone boundaries, and ensuring no positional
    conflicts occur between bots or with static world objects. The validation process
    may involve cross-referencing zone information from the game's database with current
    bot positions to maintain accurate spatial awareness in the virtual world.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotWorldPositioner positioner;

      positioner.ValidateZones();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally during bot initialization or periodic
    updates to maintain spatial integrity. It may perform database queries or cache
    lookups to validate zone data, so frequent calls could impact performance in high-bot-density
    scenarios.
