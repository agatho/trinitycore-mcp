  method: HasDst
  signature: bool SpellCastTargets::HasDst() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell cast targets have a destination target set.
  description: The HasDst method checks if the SpellCastTargets object contains a
    valid destination target. This is typically used to verify that a spell will be
    cast at a specific location rather than just on a unit or self-target. The method
    returns true when there is a valid destination coordinate set, and false otherwise.
    In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, this check is crucial for determining
    how spell effects are applied, particularly for area-of-effect spells, projectile
    spells, or any spell that requires a target location.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the SpellCastTargets object has a destination target set
    (i.e., a valid destination coordinate), and false if no destination is specified.
    This indicates whether the spell will be cast at a specific point in space rather
    than on a unit or self-targeted.
  examples:
  - title: Checking for Destination Target Before Casting
    code: "SpellCastTargets targets;\n// ... set up targets ...\nif (targets.HasDst())\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with spell casting that requires destination\n    // e.g.,\
      \ fireball spell to a specific location\n    // ... casting logic here ...\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle case where no destination is specified\n    // e.g.,\
      \ self-targeted or unit-targeted spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using HasDst in Spell Effect Logic
    code: "void CastSpellAtLocation(Unit* caster, Position const& targetPos) {\n \
      \   SpellCastTargets targets;\n    targets.setDst(targetPos);\n    \n    if\
      \ (targets.HasDst()) {\n        // Spell will be cast at the specified destination\n\
      \        // This is important for spells like Fireball, Blizzard, etc.\n   \
      \     caster->CastSpell(&targets, spellId, true);\n    } else {\n        //\
      \ Handle error or fallback behavior\n        sLog->outError(\"Spell cast without\
      \ valid destination target\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in spell processing logic to determine the appropriate
    spell effect application. The destination target is typically set using methods
    like setDst() or similar coordinate-setting functions. Performance-wise, this
    is a simple boolean check and should not impact performance significantly.
  warnings: Be aware that HasDst returning false does not necessarily mean the spell
    cannot be cast - it simply means there's no explicit destination target. Spells
    may still be cast in other modes such as self-target or unit-targeted. Always
    validate all required targets before attempting to cast a spell.
