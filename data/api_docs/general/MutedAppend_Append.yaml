    const
documentation:
  brief: Appends channel notification data to a muted append structure for processing.
  description: The Append method of the MutedAppend class is responsible for adding
    channel notification data into an internal buffer or collection. This method typically
    handles the insertion of data related to channel events such as join, leave, or
    message notifications. It is commonly used in the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore server implementation where players may be muted from channels and
    this class helps manage those muted states. The method does not return any value
    but modifies internal state for further processing by other components in the
    system.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A reference to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify object containing
      channel-related notification data that will be appended to the muted append
      structure.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of Append method
    code: 'MutedAppend mutedAppend;

      WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      // Populate notifyPacket with relevant data

      mutedAppend.Append(notifyPacket);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger system that manages player mute states in
    channels. It's likely used internally by the server to maintain consistency between
    muted players and their channel interactions.
