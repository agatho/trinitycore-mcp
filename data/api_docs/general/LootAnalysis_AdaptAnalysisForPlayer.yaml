  class: LootAnalysis
  method: AdaptAnalysisForPlayer
  signature: void LootAnalysis::AdaptAnalysisForPlayer(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Adapts loot analysis data for a specific player based on their current loot
    settings and preferences.
  description: The AdaptAnalysisForPlayer method modifies or adjusts the internal
    loot analysis data structure to align with the specified player's individual settings,
    such as loot rules, threshold values, and preferred item types. This ensures that
    subsequent loot evaluations or recommendations are tailored to the player's specific
    configuration within the game environment. The method likely updates cached analysis
    results or recalculates relevant metrics based on player-specific criteria. It
    is typically invoked when a player's loot preferences change or when preparing
    analysis data for display or processing.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which the loot analysis should be
      adapted. Must not be null and must represent an active player in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adapting Loot Analysis for a Player
    code: 'Player* myPlayer = ...; // Assume this points to a valid player

      LootAnalysis analysis;

      analysis.AdaptAnalysisForPlayer(myPlayer);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve performance considerations if called frequently,
    as it could trigger recalculations or updates of internal data structures. It
    should only be called when necessary to maintain accurate player-specific loot
    analysis.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player pointer is valid and represents an active
    player; otherwise, calling this method may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
