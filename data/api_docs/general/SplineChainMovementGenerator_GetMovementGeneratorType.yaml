documentation:
  brief: Returns the movement generator type identifier for spline chain movement.
  description: The GetMovementGeneratorType method retrieves the unique type identifier
    associated with the SplineChainMovementGenerator class. This identifier is used
    internally by the TrinityCore movement system to distinguish different types of
    movement generators and manage their behavior during pathfinding and movement
    execution. The returned value typically corresponds to a predefined enum or constant
    that represents the specific movement type within the game's AI and movement subsystem.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the movement generator type identifier for spline
    chain movement. This value is used by the movement system to categorize and handle
    different movement behaviors appropriately.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SplineChainMovementGenerator* movementGen = new SplineChainMovementGenerator();

      int type = movementGen->GetMovementGeneratorType();

      // type will contain the identifier for spline chain movement

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the movement system or AI subsystem to
    determine how to process a specific movement generator. The return value should
    be consistent across all instances of the same movement generator type and is
    often used in switch statements or type-based dispatching logic.
