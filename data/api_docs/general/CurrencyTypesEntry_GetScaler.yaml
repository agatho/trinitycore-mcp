  class: CurrencyTypesEntry
  method: GetScaler
  signature: int32 CurrencyTypesEntry::GetScaler() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the scaler value associated with the currency type entry, used for
    converting currency amounts to display values.
  description: The GetScaler method retrieves the scaler value from a CurrencyTypesEntry
    object, which is typically used in World of Warcraft's currency system to determine
    how currency values should be scaled for display purposes. This scaler is often
    applied when converting raw currency amounts into user-facing values, such as
    gold pieces or other in-game currencies. The method provides access to a configuration
    value that defines the scaling factor for the specific currency type. It is commonly
    used in UI systems and currency calculations where precise representation of currency
    values is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int32 value representing the scaler factor for this currency
    type. This value is typically used to divide or multiply raw currency amounts
    to achieve proper display formatting, such as converting copper to gold pieces
    (e.g., a scaler of 100 might represent 100 copper = 1 silver).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Currency Display Logic
    code: "CurrencyTypesEntry* entry = sCurrencyTypesStore.LookupEntry(1234);\nif\
      \ (entry)\n{\n    int32 scaler = entry->GetScaler();\n    // Use scaler to format\
      \ currency display\n    uint32 displayValue = rawCurrencyAmount / scaler;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Scaler for Currency Conversion
    code: "void FormatCurrencyDisplay(uint32 rawAmount, uint32 currencyId)\n{\n  \
      \  CurrencyTypesEntry const* entry = sCurrencyTypesStore.LookupEntry(currencyId);\n\
      \    if (!entry) return;\n    \n    int32 scaler = entry->GetScaler();\n   \
      \ float scaledValue = static_cast<float>(rawAmount) / static_cast<float>(scaler);\n\
      \    // Display scaledValue to user\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The scaler value is typically defined in the game's database or configuration
    files for each currency type. It's important to note that this value may be negative,
    zero, or positive, though negative values might indicate special handling requirements.
    The method itself is a simple getter and does not perform any calculations or
    modifications.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the scaler value directly in division operations
    without checking for zero values, as this could lead to division by zero errors.
    Ensure that the currency type entry exists before calling this method to avoid
    undefined behavior.
