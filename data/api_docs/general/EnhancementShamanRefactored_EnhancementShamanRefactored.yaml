  class: EnhancementShamanRefactored
  method: EnhancementShamanRefactored
  signature: void EnhancementShamanRefactored::EnhancementShamanRefactored(Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new EnhancementShamanRefactored instance with the specified
    player bot.
  description: This constructor initializes an EnhancementShamanRefactored AI class
    instance for a given player bot. It sets up the internal state and configuration
    required for the enhancement shaman AI behavior, including initializing spell
    caches, setting up combat routines, and preparing the bot for gameplay. The method
    ensures that all necessary data structures are properly allocated and configured
    before the AI can be used in combat or other game scenarios. This constructor
    is typically called when creating a new AI instance for a player character that
    will act as an enhancement shaman in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that this EnhancementShamanRefactored
      AI will control. Must be a valid non-null pointer to a Player instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get or create player bot

      EnhancementShamanRefactored shamanAI(myBot);

      // shamanAI is now ready to be used for enhancement shaman AI behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization logic. It primarily
    sets up the basic AI framework and prepares internal data structures. The actual
    AI behavior configuration may occur later during runtime when the bot enters combat
    or other game states.
