  brief: Sends loot to the player for processing and display.
  description: This method handles the transmission of loot data to a player, allowing
    them to view and interact with the loot items. It is typically used during loot
    generation or when a player opens a loot container. The method ensures that the
    loot is properly formatted and sent to the client for display, enabling the player
    to either take or pass the loot items. This method is part of the core gameplay
    mechanics related to loot distribution and handling in World of Warcraft.

      displayed.

      (true) or just viewing the loot (false). This affects how the loot is processed
      and displayed.

  notes: This method is typically called during the loot distribution process when
    a player opens a loot container or when loot is generated for a player. It ensures
    that the client receives proper formatting of the loot data, including item display
    and monetary information. The method should be used in conjunction with other
    loot-related methods to ensure full functionality.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without proper context; it's
    usually invoked during loot generation or when a player opens a loot container.
    Incorrect usage may result in improper loot display or missing loot items.
