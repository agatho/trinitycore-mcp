  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: DefendOrbCarrier
  signature: bool BattlegroundAI::DefendOrbCarrier(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the battleground AI should defend the orb carrier during
    capture point gameplay.
  description: The DefendOrbCarrier method evaluates the current state of the battleground
    to decide if the AI-controlled team should prioritize protecting the player carrying
    an orb in a capture point scenario. This method is typically used in battlegrounds
    like Eye of the Storm or Strand of the Ancients where players carry orbs to score
    points. The method checks various conditions such as the carrier's health, proximity
    to objectives, and threat levels from enemy players. It returns true if the AI
    should actively defend the orb carrier, otherwise false. This functionality is
    crucial for maintaining balanced gameplay and ensuring that capture point mechanics
    function correctly.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI should defend the orb carrier, false otherwise.
    The method typically returns false when the carrier is not in immediate danger
    or when defensive actions would be counterproductive to the overall battleground
    strategy.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in battleground AI logic
    code: "if (bgAI->DefendOrbCarrier(nullptr)) {\n    // Execute defensive behavior\
      \ for orb carrier\n    bgAI->DefendPlayer(carrierGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground AI subsystem and should only be called
    during active battleground gameplay. The implementation likely involves checking
    the current state of the carrier player, nearby enemy threats, and the overall
    battleground objective status. It's designed to integrate with the broader AI
    decision-making framework used by TrinityCore.
  warnings: This method may not be directly callable in all battleground types. Ensure
    that the battleground context supports orb carrying mechanics before invoking
    this method. Improper usage could lead to unexpected AI behavior or gameplay imbalance.
