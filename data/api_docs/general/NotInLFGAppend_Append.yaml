  description: The Append method populates a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet with data indicating that a player is not currently in a Looking For Group
    (LFG) activity. This method is typically used by the TrinityCore server to send
    appropriate channel notifications to players who are not participating in group
    activities, ensuring proper communication within the game's chat and channel systems.
    The method modifies the provided packet in-place without returning any value.

  notes: This method is part of the internal channel notification system and should
    only be called when managing player presence in LFG-related channels. It directly
    modifies the packet object passed to it, so ensure that the packet is properly
    initialized before calling this method.
