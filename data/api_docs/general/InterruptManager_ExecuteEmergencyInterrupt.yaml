  class: InterruptManager
  method: ExecuteEmergencyInterrupt
  signature: InterruptResult InterruptManager::ExecuteEmergencyInterrupt(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes an emergency interrupt on the specified target unit, attempting
    to halt ongoing spell casting.
  description: The ExecuteEmergencyInterrupt method is designed to forcibly interrupt
    any ongoing spell casting by the specified target unit. This method typically
    represents a high-priority interrupt that can override normal interrupt mechanics,
    such as those caused by damage or movement. It is commonly used in combat scenarios
    where immediate interruption of enemy spells is required for tactical advantage.
    The method evaluates whether the target is currently casting a spell and attempts
    to cancel it immediately, potentially bypassing standard interrupt conditions
    like damage-based interrupts. This function may be invoked during critical moments
    such as when a player is about to cast a dangerous spell or when a mob's spell
    needs to be stopped urgently.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an InterruptResult enum value indicating the outcome of the interrupt
    attempt. Possible values include SUCCESS if the spell was successfully interrupted,
    FAILED if the interrupt could not be performed (e.g., target not casting), or
    INVALID_TARGET if the provided unit is null or otherwise invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Emergency Interrupt Usage
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetVictim();\nif (target)\n{\n    InterruptResult\
      \ result = interruptManager->ExecuteEmergencyInterrupt(target);\n    if (result\
      \ == INTERRUPT_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        // Spell was successfully interrupted\n\
      \        target->InterruptSpell(CURRENT_GENERIC_SPELL);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in combat AI logic or player interrupt handling
    systems. It should be called with caution as it bypasses normal spell interruption
    rules, potentially causing unexpected behavior if misused. The method assumes
    that the target unit is valid and currently casting a spell. Performance-wise,
    this operation is relatively lightweight but may involve locking mechanisms depending
    on how the InterruptManager is implemented internally.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to game state inconsistencies or
    unexpected spell behavior. Ensure that the target unit is valid before calling
    this function to avoid crashes. This interrupt mechanism should not be used in
    situations where normal spell interruption rules should apply, as it may break
    expected gameplay mechanics.
