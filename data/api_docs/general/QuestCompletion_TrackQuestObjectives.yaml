  class: QuestCompletion
  method: TrackQuestObjectives
  signature: void QuestCompletion::TrackQuestObjectives(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates and tracks quest objectives for a specified player character.
  description: The TrackQuestObjectives method is responsible for monitoring and updating
    the progress of quest objectives assigned to a player. This method typically gets
    invoked when a player interacts with quest-related game elements such as killing
    mobs, collecting items, or visiting locations. It ensures that the player's quest
    log accurately reflects their current progress towards completing the objectives.
    The method operates within the context of TrinityCore's quest system and is often
    called during player interaction events to maintain synchronization between the
    player's state and the quest requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which quest objectives should be
      tracked. This parameter must not be null and should reference a valid player
      instance in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      QuestCompletion questTracker;

      questTracker.TrackQuestObjectives(player);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Quest Completion Event
    code: "void OnQuestComplete(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    QuestCompletion\
      \ tracker;\n    tracker.TrackQuestObjectives(player);\n    // Additional logic\
      \ for quest completion handling\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core game loop or during
    specific player interaction events. It may trigger updates to the player's quest
    log and UI elements, so performance considerations should be taken into account
    when calling it frequently. The method assumes that the player object passed in
    has valid quest data associated with it.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid null pointer dereferences. This method modifies internal quest tracking
    state, so calling it at inappropriate times might lead to inconsistent quest progress
    states.
