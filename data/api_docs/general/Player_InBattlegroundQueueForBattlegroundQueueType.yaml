documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player is queued for a specific battleground queue type.
  description: This method determines whether the player is currently queued for a
    particular battleground queue type. It returns true if the player is in the queue
    for the specified battleground queue type, and false otherwise. The method is
    commonly used to check the player's queue status before attempting to join or
    leave a battleground, ensuring proper game mechanics handling during battleground
    matchmaking. This functionality is essential for maintaining correct queue states
    and preventing invalid queue operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is queued for the specified battleground queue
    type, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check Queue Status
    code: "if (player->InBattlegroundQueueForBattlegroundQueueType(BG_QUEUE_2v2))\n\
      {\n    // Player is queued for 2v2 battleground\n    // Proceed with appropriate\
      \ actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other queue-related methods
    to manage player queue states. It's important to note that this method only checks
    the current queue state, not the actual battleground instance or match status.
  warnings: Be aware that this method does not check if the player is actually participating
    in a battleground; it only checks if they are queued for a specific queue type.
    This distinction is important for proper game logic implementation.
