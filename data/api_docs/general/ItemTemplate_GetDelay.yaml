  class: ItemTemplate
  method: GetDelay
  signature: uint32 ItemTemplate::GetDelay() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the attack delay time of the item in milliseconds.
  description: The GetDelay method retrieves the attack delay value associated with
    an ItemTemplate, which represents the time interval (in milliseconds) between
    attacks for weapons or ranged items. This value is crucial for determining the
    weapon's speed and affects the player's attack rate. The delay typically corresponds
    to the item's weapon speed property and influences combat mechanics such as auto-attacks
    and spell casting delays. For non-weapon items, this method may return zero or
    a default value depending on implementation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the attack delay in milliseconds. This indicates
    how long an item's attack must wait before it can be used again after an attack
    action.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and display weapon delay
    code: 'ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);

      uint32 delay = itemTemplate->GetDelay();

      TC_LOG_INFO("custom", "Weapon delay: %u ms", delay);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly accesses the internal delay field of the ItemTemplate
    structure. It should be used carefully in performance-critical sections as repeated
    calls may impact efficiency if not cached.
