  class: MarksmanshipHunterRefactored
  method: ShouldUseTrueshot
  signature: bool MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::ShouldUseTrueshot(int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the marksmanship hunter should activate Trueshot aura
    based on current combat state and target conditions.
  description: This method evaluates the optimal timing for using the Trueshot aura
    ability in a marksmanship hunter's rotation. It considers factors such as target
    threat level, available mana, and combat duration to decide if activating Trueshot
    would maximize damage output or provide beneficial effects. The method does not
    directly cast the spell but returns a boolean indicating whether it should be
    used at the current moment. This decision-making process is crucial for maintaining
    optimal performance during high-damage encounters where proper aura usage can
    significantly impact overall damage dealt.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if Trueshot aura should be activated based on current conditions,
    false otherwise. The decision considers target threat, mana availability, and
    combat timing to optimize damage output.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (hunter->ShouldUseTrueshot()) {\n    // Execute Trueshot aura\n    hunter->CastSpell(TRUESHOT_AURA);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat state evaluation
    code: "bool useTrueshot = hunter->ShouldUseTrueshot();\nif (useTrueshot && hunter->GetManaPct()\
      \ > 30) {\n    // Only use Trueshot when mana is sufficient\n    hunter->CastSpell(TRUESHOT_AURA);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely integrates with the hunter's overall combat state machine
    and rotation logic. It may consider target proximity, duration of current fight,
    and other active buffs or debuffs when making its decision. The implementation
    probably includes checks for whether Trueshot is already active to prevent redundant
    usage.
  warnings: Do not call this method in isolation without considering the broader context
    of the hunter's rotation. Using Trueshot at inappropriate times can waste cooldowns
    or mana, reducing overall effectiveness. Ensure that target conditions are properly
    evaluated before activation.
