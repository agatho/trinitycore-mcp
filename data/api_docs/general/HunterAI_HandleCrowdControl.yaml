  class: HunterAI

  signature: bool HunterAI::HandleCrowdControl(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to apply a crowd control effect to the target unit if conditions
    are met
  description: The HandleCrowdControl method in HunterAI is responsible for managing
    the application of crowd control abilities specific to hunter pets or the hunter
    themselves. This method evaluates whether a suitable crowd control ability can
    be applied to the current target, considering factors such as cooldowns, mana
    costs, and target status. It typically checks if the hunter has a valid target
    that is not immune to crowd control effects and ensures that the appropriate ability
    (such as Freezing Trap or Scatter Shot) is available for use. The method returns
    true if a successful crowd control application occurred, or false if no suitable
    conditions were met or if the ability failed to apply.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit's identifier.
      This parameter is used to determine which unit should receive the crowd control
      effect.
  returns: Returns true if a crowd control ability was successfully applied to the
    target; otherwise returns false if no valid conditions were met or if the application
    failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleCrowdControl
    code: "if (hunterAI->HandleCrowdControl(&targetId)) {\n    // Crowd control successfully\
      \ applied\n    printf(\"Crowd control applied to target %d\\n\", targetId);\n\
      } else {\n    // Failed to apply crowd control\n    printf(\"Failed to apply\
      \ crowd control to target %d\\n\", targetId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI decision-making processes when
    the hunter needs to manage threat or control the battlefield. The implementation
    may vary based on the specific hunter pet type and available abilities.
  warnings: Ensure that targetId points to a valid unit before calling this method,
    as invalid targets can lead to undefined behavior. Also, be aware that some crowd
    control effects might have restrictions such as immunity checks or range limitations.
