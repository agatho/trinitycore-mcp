documentation:
  brief: Returns the portrait ID associated with the quest giver for this quest
  description: This method retrieves the unique portrait identifier that corresponds
    to the quest giver's NPC or object in the game world. The returned value represents
    the visual representation used for displaying the quest giver's portrait in the
    quest log and dialog interface. This is typically used for determining which portrait
    should be displayed when a player interacts with a quest giver, such as an NPC
    or object that provides quests. The method is commonly used in conjunction with
    other quest-related functions to properly display quest giver information in game
    UI elements.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the portrait ID of the quest giver. This
    ID typically corresponds to the creature's or object's model ID that serves as
    the quest giver, and is used for displaying appropriate visual representations
    in quest UI elements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 portraitID = quest->GetQuestGiverPortrait();

      // Use portraitID to display the quest giver''s portrait in UI'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during quest processing and UI display logic.
    The returned value may vary depending on whether the quest giver is an NPC, object,
    or other type of entity. Implementation details may depend on how the quest giver's
    portrait is defined in the database or script files.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it may return different
    values based on the quest giver's type and configuration. Ensure proper handling
    of the returned value to avoid UI display issues.
