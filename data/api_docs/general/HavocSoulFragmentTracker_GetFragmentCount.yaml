  class: HavocSoulFragmentTracker
  method: GetFragmentCount
  signature: uint32 HavocSoulFragmentTracker::GetFragmentCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current count of soul fragments possessed by a Havoc demon
    hunter.
  description: The GetFragmentCount method returns the number of soul fragments currently
    available to a Havoc demon hunter. This value is typically used in conjunction
    with the HavocSoulFragmentTracker class to manage the player's fragment accumulation
    and consumption during combat. The count reflects the total number of fragments
    that can be spent on abilities such as Soul Cleave or other Havoc-specific powers.
    This method does not modify any internal state and is purely informational, making
    it safe to call at any time during gameplay. It is commonly used in ability cooldown
    calculations, resource management systems, and UI updates for fragment tracking.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of soul fragments currently available
    to the Havoc demon hunter. Returns zero if no fragments are available or if the
    tracker has not been initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Ability Check
    code: "if (player->GetHavocSoulFragmentTracker()->GetFragmentCount() >= 3)\n{\n\
      \    // Player can use an ability that costs 3 fragments\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_SOUL_CLEAVE, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: UI Update for Fragment Counter
    code: 'uint32 fragmentCount = player->GetHavocSoulFragmentTracker()->GetFragmentCount();

      player->SendUpdateWorldState(WORLD_STATE_HAVOC_FRAGMENTS, fragmentCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    returned value may change between calls if the player gains or spends fragments
    through combat actions. The HavocSoulFragmentTracker must be properly initialized
    for this method to return meaningful values.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-zero return value guarantees that all abilities
    requiring fragments can be cast, as some abilities may have additional requirements
    beyond fragment count. Always validate ability conditions before attempting to
    cast spells.
