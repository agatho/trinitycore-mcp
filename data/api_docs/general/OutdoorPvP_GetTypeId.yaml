documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique type identifier for the OutdoorPvP instance
  description: The GetTypeId method retrieves the type identifier associated with
    a specific OutdoorPvP object. This identifier is used internally by the TrinityCore
    framework to distinguish between different types of outdoor player versus player
    areas, such as those controlling territories like Wintergrasp or Silithus. The
    returned value corresponds to predefined constants within the OutdoorPvP system
    and is essential for proper handling and dispatching of events related to specific
    PvP zones. This method is typically called during initialization, event processing,
    or when determining which PvP handler should manage a particular area.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique type identifier of the OutdoorPvP instance.
    This value matches predefined constants such as OUTDOOR_PVP_ID_WINTERGRASP, OUTDOOR_PVP_ID_SILITHUS,
    etc., which are defined in the OutdoorPvP system.
  examples:
  - title: Checking OutdoorPvP Type
    code: "OutdoorPvP* pvp = sOutdoorPvPMgr->GetOutdoorPvPByZoneId(4197);\nif (pvp)\n\
      {\n    int typeId = pvp->GetTypeId();\n    if (typeId == OUTDOOR_PVP_ID_WINTERGRASP)\n\
      \    {\n        // Handle Wintergrasp-specific logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a pure virtual function in the base OutdoorPvP class, meaning
    each derived class must implement it to return its specific type ID. The type
    IDs are assigned at compile time and should not change during runtime. It's commonly
    used in conjunction with sOutdoorPvPMgr to identify and manage different PvP zones.
