  class: BehaviorAdaptation
  method: Shutdown
  signature: void BehaviorAdaptation::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the behavior adaptation system, cleaning up resources and stopping
    all active behaviors.
  description: The Shutdown method terminates the BehaviorAdaptation system by releasing
    all allocated resources, stopping ongoing behavior processes, and ensuring a clean
    shutdown of the AI adaptation subsystem. This method is typically invoked during
    server shutdown or when the behavior system needs to be temporarily disabled.
    It ensures that no dangling pointers or active threads remain after execution,
    preventing memory leaks and undefined behavior. The method does not accept any
    parameters and performs no return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: "BehaviorAdaptation* behaviorSystem = sObjectMgr->GetBehaviorAdaptation();\n\
      if (behaviorSystem)\n{\n    behaviorSystem->Shutdown();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the behavior adaptation system is
    no longer needed. Calling Shutdown multiple times may lead to undefined behavior
    if not properly guarded against. The shutdown process is synchronous and will
    block until all cleanup operations are complete.
  warnings: Do not call this method while behaviors are actively executing unless
    you're certain that no active references to the system exist. Improper use can
    result in crashes or memory corruption.
