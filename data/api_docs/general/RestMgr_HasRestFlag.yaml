  class: RestMgr
  method: HasRestFlag
  signature: bool RestMgr::HasRestFlag(RestFlag restFlag) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specific rest flag is set within the RestMgr instance.
  description: The HasRestFlag method determines if a particular RestFlag enumeration
    value is currently active or set within the RestMgr object. This functionality
    is typically used in the context of player rest states, such as determining if
    a player is resting, has rested recently, or is in a state that allows certain
    actions. The method performs a simple lookup or bit-check operation against internal
    flag storage and returns true if the specified flag is present, false otherwise.
    It does not modify any state and is purely a query operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified RestFlag is currently set in the RestMgr
    instance; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (restMgr.HasRestFlag(REST_FLAG_IN_REST)) {\n    // Player is currently\
      \ resting\n    printf(\"Player is resting\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Flags
    code: "bool isResting = restMgr.HasRestFlag(REST_FLAG_IN_REST);\nbool hasRested\
      \ = restMgr.HasRestFlag(REST_FLAG_HAS_RESTED);\nif (isResting && hasRested)\
      \ {\n    // Player is resting and has rested recently\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that RestFlag values are stored as bits or flags within
    the RestMgr class. It's likely implemented using a bitmask or similar mechanism
    for efficient lookup. The method should be thread-safe if used in a multi-threaded
    environment, but this depends on how the internal flag storage is managed.
  warnings: Ensure that the RestFlag enum values passed to this method are valid and
    defined within the context of the current implementation. Passing an invalid or
    undefined RestFlag value may lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect results.
