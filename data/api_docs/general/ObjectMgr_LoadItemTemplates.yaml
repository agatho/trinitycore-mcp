  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadItemTemplates()
documentation:
  brief: Loads all item templates from the database into memory for use in the game
    world.
  description: The LoadItemTemplates method initializes and populates the internal
    item template storage within the ObjectMgr class by reading data from the database
    tables that contain item definitions. This method is typically called during server
    startup or when reloading item data dynamically. It processes all entries in the
    item_template table and creates in-memory representations of each item, including
    their stats, properties, and behavior settings. The loaded templates are then
    used throughout the game to create item instances, validate item usage, and manage
    item-related interactions such as loot drops, vendor sales, and player inventory
    operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadItemTemplates()\n{\n    sObjectMgr->LoadItemTemplates();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked only once during server startup, though it
    can be called again to refresh item data without restarting the server. It's important
    to note that this operation may take significant time depending on the number
    of items in the database, as each item template must be parsed and validated.
    The method assumes that the database connection is already established and functional.
  warnings: Calling this method while players are online can cause unexpected behavior
    or crashes if item instances are being actively used. It should only be called
    during safe periods such as server maintenance windows or when the server is in
    a state where no active gameplay is occurring.
