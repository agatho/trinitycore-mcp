api:
  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateAdvancedRequirements
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateAdvancedRequirements(const Quest * quest,
    Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates advanced quest requirements for a player, ensuring all conditional
    criteria are met before quest progression.
  description: The ValidateAdvancedRequirements method evaluates complex and conditional
    quest prerequisites that go beyond basic level and item requirements. It checks
    for advanced conditions such as faction standing, completed prerequisite quests,
    specific player achievements, and other game state dependencies. This method is
    typically invoked during quest acceptance or update validation to ensure players
    meet all necessary criteria before advancing in a quest chain. The validation
    process may involve checking multiple subsystems within TrinityCore's quest management
    system, including reputation tracking, achievement databases, and quest completion
    logs.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object being validated. Must not be null and
      should represent a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose requirements are being checked.
      Must not be null and represents the player attempting to progress with the quest.
  returns: Returns true if all advanced requirements for the quest are satisfied by
    the player, false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that
    one or more conditional prerequisites have not been met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Validation Usage
    code: "if (QuestValidation::ValidateAdvancedRequirements(quest, player)) {\n \
      \   // Proceed with quest acceptance or progression\n    player->AddQuest(quest);\n\
      } else {\n    // Inform player that requirements are not met\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You do not meet the advanced requirements for this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform database queries to check achievement status and
    reputation levels, so it should not be called excessively in performance-critical
    code paths. The validation logic is typically part of TrinityCore's internal quest
    system and may be extended with custom conditions through scripting or module
    systems.
  warnings: Ensure that both the quest and player parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method to avoid undefined behavior. This method does not modify the
    player's state directly but relies on external systems for validation, so it should
    be used in conjunction with appropriate quest state management.
