    phaseUseFlags, uint16 phaseId, uint32 phaseGroupId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a PhaseShift structure with database-provided phase data.
  description: The InitDbPhaseShift method is responsible for initializing a PhaseShift
    object using phase data retrieved from the database. This method sets up the internal
    state of a phase shift based on provided flags, phase ID, and phase group ID.
    It is typically invoked during player login or zone changes to ensure proper phasing
    behavior. The method does not perform any database queries itself but rather consumes
    pre-fetched phase data to configure the PhaseShift structure for use in gameplay
    mechanics such as visibility, event triggering, and world object rendering.
  parameters:
  - name: phaseShift
    description: Reference to a PhaseShift object that will be initialized with database-provided
      phase information.
  - name: phaseUseFlags
    description: Flags indicating how the phase should be used (e.g., whether it's
      active, persistent, or temporary). Valid values are typically defined in phase-related
      constants.
  - name: phaseId
    description: Unique identifier for a specific phase. This ID maps to phase definitions
      in the database and determines which objects are visible or active during that
      phase.
  - name: phaseGroupId
    description: Identifier of the phase group this phase belongs to. Phase groups
      allow multiple phases to be managed together, often used for complex phased
      events or instance scenarios.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initializing a PhaseShift from Database Data
    code: 'PhaseShift myPhaseShift;

      uint8 useFlags = PHASE_USE_FLAG_NORMAL;

      uint16 phaseId = 1234;

      uint32 groupId = 5678;

      PhasingHandler::InitDbPhaseShift(myPhaseShift, useFlags, phaseId, groupId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided parameters are valid and have been
    correctly fetched from the database. It does not perform validation on inputs,
    so callers must ensure correctness before invoking this method.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting phase IDs or flags can lead to visibility issues or
    missing events in phased content. Ensure that all phase data is consistent with
    the database schema and game logic.
