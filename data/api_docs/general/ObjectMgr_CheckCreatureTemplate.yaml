  class: ObjectMgr
  method: CheckCreatureTemplate
  signature: void ObjectMgr::CheckCreatureTemplate(const int * cInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Validates and processes creature template data for integrity and consistency
    within the game world.
  description: The CheckCreatureTemplate method performs validation checks on creature
    template data to ensure that all creature entries conform to expected formats
    and constraints. This method is typically invoked during server startup or when
    loading creature templates from database files to identify potential issues such
    as invalid IDs, missing required fields, or inconsistent stat values. It helps
    maintain game balance and prevents runtime errors caused by malformed creature
    definitions. The method operates on the provided creature template information
    and may modify or log warnings about problematic entries.
  parameters:
  - name: cInfo
    description: Pointer to an integer array containing creature template data. This
      parameter is expected to point to a structured set of values representing various
      creature attributes such as entry ID, health, damage, etc., though exact layout
      depends on internal data structures.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int creatureData[] = {12345, 1000, 50, 200};

      ObjectMgr::CheckCreatureTemplate(creatureData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger validation system and may be called
    internally by the ObjectMgr during world initialization. It's important to note
    that the exact structure of cInfo is not specified in the signature, so callers
    must ensure compatibility with internal expectations.
  warnings: Improperly formatted or corrupted creature data passed to this method
    could lead to undefined behavior or server crashes. Always validate input before
    calling this method if possible.
