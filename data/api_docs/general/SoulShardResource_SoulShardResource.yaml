  brief: Initializes a new SoulShardResource object with default values
  description: The SoulShardResource constructor initializes a new instance of the
    SoulShardResource class. This class represents the soul shard resource system
    in World of Warcraft, which is used by warlocks to cast spells that consume soul
    shards. The constructor sets up the internal state of the resource, including
    initializing counters and default values for soul shard tracking. It ensures that
    the resource starts in a valid, usable state when created.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new SoulShardResource instance
    code: 'SoulShardResource shardResource;

      // Creates a new soul shard resource with default values

      // The resource is now ready to track soul shards for a warlock'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when creating player resources or when managing warlock-specific abilities. Developers
    should not directly instantiate this class unless implementing custom resource
    management systems.
