  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: ResolveObjectiveConflicts
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::ResolveObjectiveConflicts(Group * group, uint32
    questId, uint32 objectiveIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Resolves conflicts between quest objectives within a group context.
  description: The ResolveObjectiveConflicts method handles the resolution of conflicting
    quest objectives for a specified quest and objective index within a given group.
    This method ensures that only one objective is considered active when multiple
    objectives might otherwise conflict, such as when a player has multiple possible
    ways to complete the same quest objective. It typically manages the state of objectives
    in the context of group quests where individual player progress may affect overall
    group completion status.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group whose quest objectives
      are being resolved. Must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest for which objective conflicts
      are being resolved. Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: The index of the specific objective within the quest that may have
      conflicts. Must be a valid index for the given quest's objectives.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group quest resolution
    code: 'Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      uint32 objectiveIndex = 0;

      objectiveTracker->ResolveObjectiveConflicts(group, questId, objectiveIndex);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during quest update or progression events
    to ensure that conflicting objectives do not cause unexpected behavior in group
    quests. It may modify internal objective states and should be called after any
    changes to player progress that could affect objective validity.
  warnings: Ensure the provided group pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as passing an invalid pointer can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    Also, verify that questId and objectiveIndex are valid indices to prevent out-of-bounds
    access.
