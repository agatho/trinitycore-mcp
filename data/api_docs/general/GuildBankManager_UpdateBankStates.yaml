documentation:
  brief: Updates the state of all guild bank tabs and items in the database.
  description: The UpdateBankStates method synchronizes the current state of the guild
    bank with the database, ensuring that any changes to bank tab permissions, item
    placements, or withdrawal limits are persisted. This method is typically invoked
    when modifications occur to the guild bank structure or contents, such as when
    a guild member deposits or withdraws items, or when tab permissions are updated.
    It ensures data consistency between the in-memory representation and the persistent
    storage.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after any modification to the guild bank state
    to ensure database consistency. It may trigger database I/O operations and should
    not be called excessively in performance-critical sections.
