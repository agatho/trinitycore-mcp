  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: BalanceObjectiveLoad
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::BalanceObjectiveLoad(Group * group, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Loads and processes quest objectives for a group in the objective tracker
    system.
  description: The BalanceObjectiveLoad method initializes and configures quest objectives
    within the ObjectiveTracker for a specified group. This method is typically invoked
    when a player joins or creates a group, ensuring that all relevant quest progress
    and objective data are synchronized across group members. It handles the distribution
    of quest-related information to maintain consistency in group-based quest completion
    tracking. The method operates within the context of TrinityCore's group management
    and quest system, integrating with the broader objective tracking framework to
    provide real-time updates on quest status for all group participants.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object for which quest objectives are being
      loaded. Must be a valid group instance with at least one member.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest whose objectives need to be processed
      and loaded. Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Quest Objective Loading
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (playerGroup)\n{\n    uint32\
      \ questId = 12345;\n    objectiveTracker->BalanceObjectiveLoad(playerGroup,\
      \ questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Loading Multiple Quest Objectives for Group
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    std::vector<uint32>\
      \ questIds = {12345, 12346, 12347};\n    for (uint32 questId : questIds)\n \
      \   {\n        objectiveTracker->BalanceObjectiveLoad(group, questId);\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group has already been properly initialized
    and contains valid members. The method does not validate whether the quest actually
    exists or is available to the group members. It's designed to work in conjunction
    with other objective tracking methods and should be called after the group state
    is fully established.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the questId corresponds to an actual quest in
    the database, otherwise the method may fail silently or cause inconsistencies
    in objective tracking.
