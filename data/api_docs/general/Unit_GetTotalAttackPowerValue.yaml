  class: Unit
  method: GetTotalAttackPowerValue
  signature: float Unit::GetTotalAttackPowerValue(int attType, bool includeWeapon)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total attack power value for a unit, including
    weapon and non-weapon components.
  description: The GetTotalAttackPowerValue method computes the total attack power
    for a Unit object, considering both weapon-based and non-weapon-based attack power
    contributions. It takes into account the type of attack (melee, ranged, or spell)
    and whether to include weapon attack power in the calculation. This method is
    essential for determining damage output in combat scenarios and is commonly used
    in various game mechanics such as critical strike calculations, damage bonuses,
    and attack power-based effects. The method returns a float value representing
    the total attack power, which can be used for further calculations or display
    purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: attType
    description: Specifies the type of attack power to calculate. Valid values include
      melee, ranged, and spell attack types. This parameter determines which attack
      power components are included in the calculation.
  - name: includeWeapon
    description: Determines whether weapon attack power should be included in the
      total calculation. If true, weapon-based attack power is included; if false,
      only non-weapon attack power components are considered.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the total attack power for the specified
    attack type. The value may vary depending on the unit's attributes and equipped
    items, and can be used for damage calculations or other combat-related effects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player;

      float attackPower = unit->GetTotalAttackPowerValue(ATT_TYPE_MELEE, true);

      // Returns total melee attack power including weapon

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player;

      float attackPower = unit->GetTotalAttackPowerValue(ATT_TYPE_SPELL, false);

      // Returns total spell attack power without weapon

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in combat calculations and requires accurate
    unit state information. Performance considerations include potential for multiple
    calls during combat scenarios. Thread safety depends on the implementation of
    the Unit class, which may vary depending on whether it's a player or NPC.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in combat situations as incorrect
    usage can lead to inaccurate damage calculations. The method may not account for
    all possible attack power modifiers, such as temporary buffs or debuffs.
