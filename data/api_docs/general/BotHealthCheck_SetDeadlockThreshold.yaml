  signature: void BotHealthCheck::SetDeadlockThreshold(uint32 milliseconds)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the deadlock threshold in milliseconds for the bot health check system
  description: Configures the maximum allowed time interval between bot health checks
    before a potential deadlock is detected. This threshold determines how long the
    system will wait for a response from a bot's health monitoring thread before flagging
    it as unresponsive. The value should be set based on expected bot processing times
    and system latency to avoid false positives while maintaining responsiveness to
    actual deadlocks.
  parameters:
  - name: milliseconds
    description: The timeout duration in milliseconds that defines when a bot health
      check is considered deadlocked. Valid range is typically 100-30000 milliseconds
      (100ms to 30 seconds). Values outside this range may cause performance issues
      or incorrect deadlock detection.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotHealthCheck healthCheck;

      healthCheck.SetDeadlockThreshold(5000); // Set 5 second timeout'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Tuning Example
    code: "BotHealthCheck* check = sBotAI->GetHealthCheck();\nif (check)\n{\n    check->SetDeadlockThreshold(10000);\
      \ // 10 second threshold for high-latency systems\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the bot monitoring system's ability to detect
    and handle unresponsive bots. Lower values may cause false positives in high-load
    scenarios, while higher values may delay detection of actual deadlocks. The threshold
    should be tuned based on server load and bot complexity.
  warnings: Setting this value too low may result in frequent false deadlock detections
    causing unnecessary bot restarts. Setting it too high may delay detection of real
    deadlocks, potentially leading to resource exhaustion or game state inconsistencies.
