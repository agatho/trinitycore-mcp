  signature: void Player::LoadCorpse(int result)
documentation:
  brief: Loads and processes a player's corpse data based on the provided result code.
  description: The LoadCorpse method is responsible for handling the loading of a
    player's corpse information within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically
    gets invoked when a player dies and their corpse needs to be processed or loaded
    from the database. It takes an integer result parameter that likely indicates
    the success or failure of a previous operation related to corpse retrieval or
    processing. The method may handle cleanup, data validation, and preparation of
    corpse-related information for further game mechanics such as corpse decay timers
    or resurrection handling. This method is part of the core player management system
    and integrates with the broader corpse and death mechanics of World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: result
    description: An integer result code indicating the status of a previous operation
      related to corpse handling. Values typically represent success (0), database
      errors, or other operational outcomes that affect how the corpse data should
      be processed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic corpse loading with result code
    code: "void SomeDeathHandler(Player* player) {\n    int dbResult = sObjectMgr->GetCorpseData(player->GetGUID());\n\
      \    player->LoadCorpse(dbResult);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the core game loop or death handling
    system. Developers should ensure proper synchronization when calling this method
    from different threads, as corpse data manipulation may involve database operations
    and state changes that require thread safety.
  warnings: Calling LoadCorpse without proper validation of the result parameter may
    lead to inconsistent player state or undefined behavior. The method assumes valid
    input and should not be called with invalid or uninitialized result codes.
