  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: AnalyzeBotPerformance
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::AnalyzeBotPerformance(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and records performance metrics for a specified bot character within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The AnalyzeBotPerformance method is designed to evaluate and log detailed
    performance data for a specific bot identified by its unique Game Object Identifier
    (GUID). This function likely collects information such as response times, action
    execution efficiency, resource utilization, and other relevant metrics that help
    in assessing how well the bot performs within the game environment. It may be
    used for debugging, optimization, or monitoring purposes in automated gameplay
    scenarios. The method operates on a per-bot basis and does not return any value
    directly; instead, it updates internal analytics structures or logs for later
    retrieval.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character to be analyzed.
      This value must correspond to an existing bot entity in the game world and is
      typically obtained through bot creation or management systems.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      analytics.AnalyzeBotPerformance(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Manager
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = sBotManager->GetRandomBotGuid();\nif (botGuid != 0)\n\
      {\n    BotPerformanceAnalytics::AnalyzeBotPerformance(botGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the specified bot GUID corresponds to a valid and
    active bot instance. If called with an invalid or non-existent GUID, behavior
    is undefined and may result in errors or silent failures. The analysis process
    might involve accessing internal game state data which could introduce performance
    overhead depending on the complexity of metrics being collected.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid is valid before calling this method to
    avoid potential crashes or incorrect logging. Avoid frequent calls to this function
    during high-frequency gameplay events as it may impact performance.
