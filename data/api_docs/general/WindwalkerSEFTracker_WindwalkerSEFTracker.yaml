documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the WindwalkerSEFTracker class for tracking
    Windwalker Spirit Essence Form effects.
  description: The WindwalkerSEFTracker constructor initializes a new instance of
    the WindwalkerSEFTracker class. This class is designed to track and manage the
    state of the Windwalker Spirit Essence Form (SEF) effect in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore environment. The tracker maintains internal data structures to monitor
    the duration, application, and removal of the SEF buff, which is a key mechanic
    for Windwalker monks. It handles the lifecycle of the effect including initialization,
    updates, and cleanup when the effect expires or is removed from the target. This
    constructor ensures all necessary tracking variables are properly set up before
    the tracker begins monitoring the SEF state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a WindwalkerSEFTracker instance
    code: 'WindwalkerSEFTracker* tracker = new WindwalkerSEFTracker();

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track SEF effects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when initializing a new tracker instance.
    The class likely requires additional setup methods to bind it to specific targets
    or effects. The implementation may involve internal state management for tracking
    effect duration and application times.
