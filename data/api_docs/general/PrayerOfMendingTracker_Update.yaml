  class: PrayerOfMendingTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void PrayerOfMendingTracker::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the Prayer of Mending tracker for the specified player, managing
    heal application and cooldown tracking.
  description: The Update method in the PrayerOfMendingTracker class is responsible
    for processing the state of Prayer of Mending effects on a given player. It handles
    the application of healing ticks, manages the cooldown period between uses, and
    ensures proper tracking of active mending effects. This method is typically called
    during AI update cycles or when player actions affect the spell's behavior. The
    implementation considers the player's current health status, available mana, and
    existing mending effects to determine appropriate healing application.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which the Prayer of Mending tracker
      should be updated. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\n    if\
      \ (m_prayerOfMendingTracker)\n        m_prayerOfMendingTracker->Update(m_bot);\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Tracker Update for Specific Player
    code: "Player* targetPlayer = ObjectAccessor::FindConnectedPlayer(\"TargetPlayer\"\
      );\nif (targetPlayer && m_prayerOfMendingTracker)\n{\n    m_prayerOfMendingTracker->Update(targetPlayer);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on players who have the Prayer of Mending
    spell active. The tracker maintains internal state about healing ticks and cooldowns,
    so calling this method multiple times per update cycle may cause unexpected behavior.
    It is recommended to call this method only when necessary based on game logic
    or AI decision making.
  warnings: Never pass a null pointer to the bot parameter; doing so will result in
    undefined behavior. The method assumes that the player object remains valid throughout
    its execution. Avoid calling this method from multiple threads simultaneously
    without proper synchronization.
