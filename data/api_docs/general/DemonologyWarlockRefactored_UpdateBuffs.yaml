documentation:
  brief: Updates all active buffs and debuffs for the Demonology Warlock
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing all
    active buff and debuff effects on a Demonology Warlock character. This includes
    handling aura applications, duration updates, and ensuring that the warlock's
    special abilities such as Demonic Empowerment, Shadowflame, and other talent-based
    enhancements are properly maintained throughout combat. The method typically runs
    during each update cycle to ensure that all buffs are correctly applied and removed
    based on their duration, triggers, or external conditions. This method is crucial
    for maintaining proper gameplay balance and ensuring that the warlock's abilities
    function as intended within the TrinityCore framework.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void DemonologyWarlockAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI\
      \ logic ...\n    UpdateBuffs();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Buff Management
    code: "void DemonologyWarlockRefactored::UpdateBuffs()\n{\n    // Update all active\
      \ auras\n    if (Unit* owner = GetOwner())\n    {\n        // Apply or refresh\
      \ demonic empowerment buffs\n        if (Aura* aura = owner->GetAura(DemonicEmpowermentSpellId))\n\
      \        {\n            aura->RefreshDuration();\n        }\n        // Handle\
      \ other warlock-specific buffs\n        UpdateShadowflameBuffs();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the AI update cycle to maintain
    proper buff state. The implementation may involve checking for aura expiration,
    applying new auras based on talent trees, and managing cooldowns for buff-triggering
    abilities. Performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary aura checks
    when no buffs are active.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to incorrect buff states, which
    may cause gameplay inconsistencies or bugs in warlock abilities. Ensure all aura
    applications are properly tracked and cleaned up to prevent memory leaks or incorrect
    stacking behavior.
