  class: Creature
  method: CanAlwaysSee
  signature: bool Creature::CanAlwaysSee(const int * obj) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a creature can always see a given object regardless of
    distance or visibility constraints.
  description: The CanAlwaysSee method checks if a creature is capable of seeing a
    specific object, such as a player or another creature, even when normal visibility
    rules would prevent it from doing so. This method is typically used in scenarios
    where the creature's vision needs to be overridden for gameplay purposes, such
    as in certain quest triggers or NPC interactions. The method returns true if the
    creature can see the object under all circumstances, and false otherwise. It may
    be used in conjunction with other visibility-related methods to control how objects
    are perceived by creatures.
  parameters:
  - name: obj
    description: A pointer to an integer representing the object ID or identifier
      that the creature is trying to see. This could be a player GUID, creature GUID,
      or other object identifier.
  returns: Returns true if the creature can always see the specified object regardless
    of distance or visibility constraints, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->CanAlwaysSee(&playerGuid)) {\n    // Do something\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves checking against visibility flags or distance
    constraints that would normally prevent a creature from seeing an object. Implementation
    details may involve internal visibility calculations or special handling of certain
    game objects.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method, as it may bypass normal game mechanics
    and could lead to unexpected behavior if used incorrectly. The method might not
    be available in all contexts and should be used carefully in conjunction with
    other visibility methods.
