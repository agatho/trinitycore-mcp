  class: TradeSystem

  signature: void TradeSystem::SetTradeGold(uint32 sessionId, uint32 playerGuid, uint32
    goldAmount)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the gold amount for a trade session between two players.
  description: The SetTradeGold method updates the gold amount that a player has offered
    or accepted in a trade session. This method is typically used during the trading
    process to synchronize the gold values between the trading parties. The method
    requires a valid session ID and player GUID to ensure proper tracking of the trade
    state. It modifies the internal trade data structure associated with the specified
    session, updating the gold amount for the given player. This functionality is
    essential for maintaining accurate trade states in World of Warcraft's trading
    system.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionId
    description: Unique identifier for the trade session. Must be a valid session
      ID that corresponds to an active trade between two players.
  - name: playerGuid
    description: Global Unique Identifier of the player whose gold amount is being
      set. This must correspond to one of the players involved in the trade session.
  - name: goldAmount
    description: The amount of gold to set for the specified player in the trade.
      Must be a non-negative integer representing copper coins (1 gold = 100 silver
      = 10000 copper).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Gold Amount in Trade
    code: TradeSystem::SetTradeGold(12345, 67890, 5000); // Sets 50 gold (5000 copper)
      for player with GUID 67890 in session 12345
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Trade Gold During Negotiation
    code: "uint32 sessionId = sTradeMgr->GetActiveTradeSession(player1Guid, player2Guid);\n\
      if (sessionId != 0)\n{\n    TradeSystem::SetTradeGold(sessionId, player1Guid,\
      \ 15000); // Player 1 offers 15 gold\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active trade sessions. The method
    does not validate whether the gold amount exceeds the player's available balance;
    this validation must be handled by calling code. The session ID and player GUID
    parameters are assumed to be validated before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid session ID or player GUID can result
    in undefined behavior or corruption of trade data. Always verify that the session
    exists and the player is part of the trade before calling this method. This method
    does not perform any network synchronization; it only updates local state.
