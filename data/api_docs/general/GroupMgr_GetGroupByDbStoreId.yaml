documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a group object from the database storage ID.
  description: The GetGroupByDbStoreId method retrieves a Group object using its unique
    database storage identifier. This method is typically used to fetch a specific
    group that has been previously stored in the database, allowing access to group
    data such as members, leader, and group settings. The method performs a lookup
    in an internal map or container that associates database IDs with Group objects.
    It's commonly used during server startup, player login, or when restoring group
    state from persistent storage.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Group object if found, or nullptr if no group exists with
    the specified database storage ID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve a group by its database ID
    code: "Group* group = sGroupMgr->GetGroupByDbStoreId(12345);\nif (group)\n{\n\
      \    // Group found, perform operations\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_GROUP_FOUND,\
      \ group->GetId());\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No group with this ID exists\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_GROUP_NOT_FOUND);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GroupManager has already loaded groups from
    the database into memory. The storageId parameter corresponds to the unique identifier
    used in the group's database record, typically stored in the 'id' column of the
    'group_member' or similar tables.
