  method: Initialize
  signature: void GameEventMgr::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the game event manager system, loading and preparing all active
    game events for execution.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the GameEventMgr subsystem by loading
    all registered game events from the database and preparing their internal data
    structures for event handling. This method is typically called during server startup
    or when the game event system needs to be reset. It ensures that all event schedules,
    conditions, and associated triggers are properly configured before any events
    can be activated. The initialization process includes validating event data, setting
    up time-based triggers, and preparing the event state management system. This
    method must be called before any other game event operations can take effect.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: GameEventMgr::instance()->Initialize();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization. Repeated
    calls may cause duplicate event registrations or memory leaks. The method performs
    database queries to load event information, so it may have performance implications
    during server startup.
  warnings: Do not call this method from within event handlers or time-critical code
    paths as it may block execution. Avoid calling Initialize multiple times in succession
    without proper cleanup between calls.
