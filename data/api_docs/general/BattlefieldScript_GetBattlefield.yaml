  class: BattlefieldScript
  method: GetBattlefield
  signature: Battlefield * BattlefieldScript::GetBattlefield(Map * map) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the Battlefield object associated with the specified map.
  description: The GetBattlefield method is used to obtain a pointer to the Battlefield
    instance that manages the given Map. This method is typically invoked within the
    context of battlefield scripts to access battlefield-specific data and functionality.
    The returned pointer can be null if no battlefield is currently active on the
    specified map. It's important to note that this method assumes the provided map
    is indeed a battlefield map, otherwise the result may not be meaningful or could
    lead to undefined behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Battlefield object associated with the given map. Returns
    nullptr if no battlefield is active on the specified map or if the map is not
    a valid battlefield map.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Battlefield Script
    code: "class MyBattlefieldScript : public BattlefieldScript\n{\npublic:\n    void\
      \ OnBattlefieldUpdate(Battlefield* bf, uint32 diff) override\n    {\n      \
      \  // Get the battlefield from a specific map\n        Battlefield* battlefield\
      \ = GetBattlefield(sMapMgr->FindMap(1234, 0));\n        if (battlefield)\n \
      \       {\n            // Use the battlefield object\n            battlefield->Update(diff);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in the context of battlefield scripts to access
    battlefield-specific data. The returned Battlefield pointer should be checked
    for null before use, as it may not always point to a valid object. This function
    does not perform any validation on the input map parameter beyond checking if
    it's a valid map instance.
  warnings: Using this method with a non-battlefield map may return an invalid or
    null pointer. Always validate the returned pointer before dereferencing it to
    avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior.
