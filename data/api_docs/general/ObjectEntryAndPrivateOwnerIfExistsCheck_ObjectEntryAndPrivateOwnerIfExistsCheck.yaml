  class: ObjectEntryAndPrivateOwnerIfExistsCheck
  method: ObjectEntryAndPrivateOwnerIfExistsCheck
  signature: void ObjectEntryAndPrivateOwnerIfExistsCheck::ObjectEntryAndPrivateOwnerIfExistsCheck(int
    ownerGUID, int entry)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if an object entry exists and verifies the private owner for the given
    GUID.
  description: The ObjectEntryAndPrivateOwnerIfExistsCheck method performs a validation
    check to determine whether a specified object entry exists within the game world
    and ensures that the provided owner GUID correctly corresponds to the object's
    private ownership. This method is typically used in TrinityCore's core systems
    to enforce data integrity when accessing or modifying game objects, particularly
    those with restricted access or ownership rules. It may be invoked during object
    creation, modification, or access attempts to prevent unauthorized operations
    on private entities.
  parameters:
  - name: ownerGUID
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player or entity that owns the
      object. Must be a valid GUID within the game's database.
  - name: entry
    description: The entry ID of the object being validated. This corresponds to an
      entry in the game's object template database.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ObjectEntryAndPrivateOwnerIfExistsCheck checker;

      checker.ObjectEntryAndPrivateOwnerIfExistsCheck(12345, 67890);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger validation framework and may be used
    internally by TrinityCore's object management system. It assumes that the GUID
    and entry values are already validated before being passed to this function.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method can lead to invalid object access or data
    corruption. Ensure that both parameters are valid before calling to avoid unexpected
    behavior.
