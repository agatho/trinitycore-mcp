  method: GetNodeCount
  signature: size_t MovementPath::GetNodeCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of nodes in the movement path.
  description: The GetNodeCount method retrieves the count of all nodes that define
    the movement path. This is useful for iterating through the path or determining
    the length of the path for navigation purposes. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    movement paths are often used for creature AI, object movement, and scripted events.
    The returned value represents the number of waypoints or positions that make up
    the path, which can be zero if the path is empty or uninitialized.
  parameters: []
  returns: A size_t value representing the total number of nodes in the movement path.
    Returns 0 if the path contains no nodes or has not been initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check path length
    code: "MovementPath* path = player->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentPath();\nsize_t\
      \ nodeCount = path->GetNodeCount();\nif (nodeCount > 0)\n{\n    // Process the\
      \ movement path\n    printf(\"Path has %zu nodes\\n\", nodeCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterating through all nodes in a path
    code: "MovementPath* path = creature->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentPath();\nsize_t\
      \ count = path->GetNodeCount();\nfor (size_t i = 0; i < count; ++i)\n{\n   \
      \ G3D::Vector3 node = path->GetNode(i);\n    // Process each node\n    printf(\"\
      Node %zu: (%.2f, %.2f, %.2f)\\n\", i, node.x, node.y, node.z);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other path-related methods
    like GetNode() to access individual waypoints. The implementation is expected
    to be efficient as it's commonly called during movement updates and AI processing
    loops.
