  signature: std::string CreatureTextMgr::GetLocalizedChatString(uint32 entry, uint8
    gender, uint8 textGroup, uint32 id, LocaleConstant locale) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a localized chat string for a creature based on entry, gender,
    text group, and ID.
  description: The GetLocalizedChatString method retrieves a localized chat message
    for a creature in the TrinityCore database. It uses the provided parameters to
    look up the appropriate text entry in the creature_text table, applying localization
    rules based on the specified locale. The method considers the creature's entry
    ID, gender (used for pronoun substitution), text group number, and specific text
    ID within that group. This allows NPCs to deliver contextually appropriate dialogue
    in different languages depending on the player's locale setting.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The creature entry ID from the creature_template table that identifies
      which NPC the text belongs to.
  - name: gender
    description: The gender of the creature (0 = male, 1 = female, 2 = neutral) used
      for pronoun substitution in localized strings.
  - name: textGroup
    description: The text group number within the creature's text entries, allowing
      multiple distinct dialogues or responses to be organized.
  - name: id
    description: The specific text ID within the given text group, identifying which
      exact line of dialogue to retrieve.
  - name: locale
    description: The LocaleConstant value specifying the desired language for localization
      (e.g., LOCALE_en, LOCALE_fr, etc.).
  returns: Returns a std::string containing the localized chat message. If no matching
    text is found for the given parameters, an empty string may be returned.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve localized NPC dialogue
    code: std::string text = sCreatureTextMgr->GetLocalizedChatString(12345, GENDER_MALE,
      0, 1, LOCALE_en);
    language: cpp
  - title: Get gender-specific localized text for female NPC
    code: std::string greeting = sCreatureTextMgr->GetLocalizedChatString(67890, GENDER_FEMALE,
      1, 2, LOCALE_de);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used by the AI system to provide localized dialogue
    for creatures. The localization process checks for specific locale entries in
    the creature_text table and falls back to default language if no match is found.
    Performance-wise, this method involves database lookups and should be used judiciously
    during high-frequency events like combat or quest interactions.
  warnings: Ensure that all parameters are valid before calling this method; invalid
    entry IDs or locale constants may result in unexpected behavior or empty strings.
    Be aware that the gender parameter affects pronoun substitution, so incorrect
    gender values will lead to grammatically incorrect localized text.
