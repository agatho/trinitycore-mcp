documentation:
  brief: Sets the execution priority of the action to determine its order in the AI
    decision queue.
  description: The SetPriority method assigns a numerical priority value to an Action
    object, which influences when and how often the action is considered for execution
    within the AI system. Higher priority actions are typically evaluated before lower
    priority ones during the AI's decision-making process. This method allows developers
    to fine-tune AI behavior by controlling the relative importance of different actions.
    The priority value is usually a uint32 integer where larger values indicate higher
    priority, though the exact interpretation may depend on the specific implementation
    within TrinityCore's AI framework.
  parameters:
  - name: priority
    description: The priority level to assign to this action. Higher values indicate
      higher priority in the AI decision queue. Valid range is typically 0 to UINT32_MAX,
      though practical limits may apply based on system requirements and AI logic
      implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Action Priority
    code: 'Action* attackAction = new Action();

      attackAction->SetPriority(100);

      // The action will now have high priority in AI decision making'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Priority for Different AI Behaviors
    code: "class EnemyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void InitializeActions()\
      \ {\n        attackAction->SetPriority(200);     // High priority\n        fleeAction->SetPriority(50);\
      \        // Low priority\n        idleAction->SetPriority(10);        // Lowest\
      \ priority\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal priority state of the Action object.
    It should be called before the action is added to any AI decision queue or when
    reconfiguring existing actions. The actual behavior of how priorities affect execution
    order depends on the specific AI implementation and may involve additional factors
    such as cooldowns, conditions, and context.
  warnings: Setting extremely high priority values (close to UINT32_MAX) might cause
    unexpected behavior in certain AI systems that perform arithmetic operations on
    priority values. Ensure that priority values are within reasonable bounds for
    your specific use case. Modifying action priorities at runtime while the AI is
    actively processing may lead to inconsistent behavior if not handled carefully.
