  class: AuctionBotConfig
  method: SetAHBotIncludes
  signature: void AuctionBotConfig::SetAHBotIncludes(const std::string & AHBotIncludes)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the AHBot includes configuration string for the auction house bot.
  description: This method configures the Auction House Bot (AHBot) by setting the
    includes parameter, which determines which item types or categories are included
    in the bot's auction behavior. The AHBot uses this configuration to decide what
    items to list on the auction house based on predefined filters. This setting is
    typically used during server initialization or configuration updates to control
    the bot's inventory management and auction posting behavior. The method does not
    validate the input string format, so incorrect values may lead to unexpected bot
    behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: AHBotIncludes
    description: A string containing the configuration for which item types or categories
      should be included in AHBot's auction listings. This typically consists of a
      comma-separated list of item class and subclass identifiers or category names
      that define what items the bot will consider when creating auctions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting AHBot includes to common weapon types
    code: 'AuctionBotConfig config;

      config.SetAHBotIncludes("0,1,2,3"); // Includes weapons, armor, containers,
      and trade goods'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting AHBot includes with specific item categories
    code: 'AuctionBotConfig config;

      config.SetAHBotIncludes("0,6,7,8"); // Includes weapons, gems, enchantments,
      and recipes'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or configuration reloads.
    The input string format should match the expected AHBot configuration schema;
    otherwise, the bot may not behave as intended. This method directly modifies internal
    configuration state and does not perform any validation of the provided string.
  warnings: Incorrectly formatted includes strings can cause the AHBot to either ignore
    all items or attempt to list invalid items on the auction house. Ensure that the
    input string follows the expected format for item class/subclass identifiers used
    by the AHBot system.
