documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot session is currently active and connected to the game
    server.
  description: The IsOnline method determines if a bot session is currently online
    and connected to the World of Warcraft server. This method typically checks the
    internal state of the session to verify that the bot has successfully logged in,
    is not in a disconnected or idle state, and can communicate with the game server.
    It's commonly used by bot managers or AI systems to ensure that commands are only
    sent to active sessions. The method does not perform any network operations itself
    but relies on cached or tracked session state information.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot session is online and connected to the server;
    otherwise, returns false if the session is offline, disconnected, or in an invalid
    state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check bot status
    code: "if (botSession->IsOnline()) {\n    // Bot is active, proceed with commands\n\
      \    botSession->MoveToTarget(target);\n} else {\n    // Bot is offline, handle\
      \ accordingly\n    LogMessage(\"Bot is not online.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsOnline in a loop to monitor bot status
    code: "while (true) {\n    if (botSession->IsOnline()) {\n        // Perform actions\
      \ only when online\n        botSession->PerformCombatRoutine();\n    } else\
      \ {\n        // Attempt to reconnect or notify user\n        botSession->Reconnect();\n\
      \    }\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(5));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal session tracking and may not reflect real-time
    network status. It's recommended to combine this check with additional health
    checks or error handling for robust bot management systems.
  warnings: Do not assume that a true return value guarantees the bot will respond
    immediately to commands; there may be latency or processing delays in the game
    server communication.
