  signature: uint32 GameObjectTemplate::GetTrivialSkillHigh() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the high trivial skill value associated with the game object template.
  description: The GetTrivialSkillHigh method retrieves the upper bound of the trivial
    skill range for a game object template. In World of Warcraft context, trivial
    skills are used to determine the minimum skill level required to perform certain
    actions on objects, such as mining or herbalism. This value is typically used
    in conjunction with GetTrivialSkillLow() to define a skill range that determines
    whether a player can interact with the object. The returned value represents the
    maximum skill level that qualifies an action as trivial for this game object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the high end of the trivial skill range. This
    value indicates the maximum skill level at which an action involving this game
    object is considered trivial, or easily performed by the player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(12345);

      uint32 highSkill = goTemplate->GetTrivialSkillHigh();

      TC_LOG_INFO("server.loading", "Trivial skill high for GameObject %u is %u",
      12345, highSkill);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Skill Range Check
    code: "GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(67890);\n\
      uint32 lowSkill = goTemplate->GetTrivialSkillLow();\nuint32 highSkill = goTemplate->GetTrivialSkillHigh();\n\
      Player* player = ...; // assumed to be defined\nuint32 playerSkill = player->GetSkillValue(SKILL_MINING);\
      \ // example skill\nif (playerSkill >= lowSkill && playerSkill <= highSkill)\n\
      {\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"entities.player\", \"Player can perform trivial action\
      \ on GameObject %u with skill %u\", 67890, playerSkill);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the GameObjectTemplate class which stores static data
    about game objects. The trivial skill values are usually defined in the game object's
    database entries and affect gameplay mechanics such as resource gathering. This
    method does not perform any runtime calculations but returns pre-defined static
    values from the template.
