documentation:
  brief: Moves a GarrisonMgr object by transferring ownership of its resources to
    another GarrisonMgr instance.
  description: The move assignment operator for the GarrisonMgr class transfers all
    resources from the source GarrisonMgr object (passed as an rvalue reference) to
    the current object. This operation is typically used to efficiently transfer ownership
    of garrison data, including buildings, followers, and other garrison-related state
    information without performing deep copies. The source object is left in a valid
    but unspecified state after the move operation. This method is essential for efficient
    memory management when working with garrison data structures in TrinityCore's
    game logic.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to another GarrisonMgr instance whose resources
      will be moved to this object. After the move, param0 will be left in a valid
      but unspecified state.
  returns: A reference to the current GarrisonMgr object (this) after the move assignment
    has been completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'GarrisonMgr garrison1;

      // ... initialize garrison1 with data ...

      GarrisonMgr garrison2 = std::move(garrison1); // Move garrison1''s resources
      to garrison2

      // garrison1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Function Context
    code: "GarrisonMgr createGarrison() {\n    GarrisonMgr garrison;\n    // ... populate\
      \ garrison with data ...\n    return garrison; // Move semantics allow efficient\
      \ return\n}\n\nGarrisonMgr mainGarrison = createGarrison(); // Uses move assignment"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is part of the standard C++ move semantics and should be used
    when transferring ownership of a GarrisonMgr object. The move operation typically
    involves swapping internal pointers or handles rather than copying large data
    structures, making it much more efficient than copy operations for garrison data
    which can contain numerous buildings and followers.
  warnings: After calling this move assignment operator, the source object (param0)
    should not be used in any way that assumes its previous state is valid. The object
    may still be in a valid state but its contents are unspecified and could lead
    to undefined behavior if accessed.
