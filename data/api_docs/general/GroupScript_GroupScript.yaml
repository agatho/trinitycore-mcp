  class: GroupScript
  method: GroupScript
  signature: void GroupScript::GroupScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a GroupScript instance with the specified name for group-related
    script handling in TrinityCore.
  description: The GroupScript constructor initializes a new group script instance
    with the provided name. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore framework
    to register and manage group-based scripts, such as those that handle group events,
    loot distribution, or quest progression. The name parameter serves as an identifier
    for the script, allowing the game server to distinguish between different group
    script behaviors. This constructor is part of the scripting system that enables
    custom group logic without modifying core server code. It prepares internal data
    structures necessary for tracking and executing group-related scripted events.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated string that uniquely identifies this GroupScript
      instance. The name is used internally by TrinityCore to register and retrieve
      the script during group operations. Must be a valid, non-null C-string.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic GroupScript Initialization
    code: "class MyGroupScript : public GroupScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyGroupScript()\
      \ : GroupScript(\"MyCustomGroupScript\") {}\n};\n\n// Usage in a custom module\n\
      void InitializeCustomScripts()\n{\n    new MyGroupScript();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during server initialization or module
    loading. The name parameter should be unique to avoid conflicts with other registered
    scripts. GroupScript instances are usually created as global singletons or managed
    by the script manager.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly unless you're implementing a custom
    GroupScript subclass. Improper use of the name parameter may lead to script registration
    conflicts or unexpected behavior in group operations.
