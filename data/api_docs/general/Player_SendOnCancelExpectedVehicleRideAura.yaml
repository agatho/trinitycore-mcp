  brief: Sends a cancelation message for expected vehicle ride aura to the player's
    client
  description: This method sends a specific packet to the player's client that cancels
    an expected vehicle ride aura, typically used when a player is no longer able
    to mount or ride a vehicle. It is part of the game mechanics related to vehicle
    handling and ensures proper synchronization between server and client for vehicle-related
    actions. The method is called internally when certain conditions are met, such
    as when a player's vehicle state changes or when a vehicle becomes unavailable.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SendOnCancelExpectedVehicleRideAura();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked when a vehicle ride is interrupted or canceled,
    and it ensures that the client properly removes any pending vehicle mount animations
    or effects. The implementation relies on internal packet handling mechanisms within
    TrinityCore.
