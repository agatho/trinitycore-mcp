documentation:
  brief: Displays faction-specific vendor options to the player based on their reputation
    with the faction.
  description: The HandleFactionVendors method is responsible for managing and presenting
    vendor interactions specific to a player's faction standing. It evaluates the
    player's current reputation level with various factions and determines which faction-specific
    vendors should be available for interaction. This method typically triggers when
    a player interacts with a faction vendor or when their faction reputation changes,
    ensuring that only appropriate vendor options are shown based on their standing.
    The implementation likely involves checking faction reputation thresholds and
    filtering vendor entries accordingly to provide an immersive and balanced gameplay
    experience.

  notes: This method may be invoked during player login, faction reputation changes,

    actual vendor items displayed depend on the faction's reputation level and the
    configured vendor data in the database.
  warnings: Ensure that the player object passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as it could lead to undefined behavior if improperly handled. Also,
    be aware that this method may trigger database queries to retrieve faction-specific
    vendor data.
