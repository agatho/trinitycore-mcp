  class: BattlegroundScript
  method: GetPrematureWinner
  signature: int BattlegroundScript::GetPrematureWinner()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the team ID of the premature winner in a battleground.
  description: The GetPrematureWinner method retrieves the team identifier of the
    player or team that has prematurely won the battleground. This typically occurs
    when one team's players leave the battleground before the match concludes, resulting
    in an automatic victory for the remaining team. The method is used primarily within
    battleground scripts to determine and handle premature victories.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the team ID of the premature winner. A value of
    0 typically indicates no premature winner, while values of 1 or 2 usually correspond
    to the Alliance or Horde teams respectively.
  examples:
  - title: Check for Premature Winner
    code: "if (bg->GetPrematureWinner() == 1)\n{\n    // Handle Alliance victory\n\
      \    sWorld->SendWorldText(L\"Alliance has won the battleground prematurely!\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active battleground events when
    premature win conditions may have occurred. It is not intended for use outside
    of battleground script contexts.
  warnings: Do not assume a non-zero return value indicates a valid premature winner;
    always verify the battleground state before acting on this result.
