  class: ClassAI
  method: HasEnoughResource
  signature: bool ClassAI::HasEnoughResource(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the AI-controlled unit has sufficient resources to cast
    a specified spell.
  description: The HasEnoughResource method evaluates if the ClassAI instance's associated
    unit possesses adequate resource requirements (such as mana, rage, energy, or
    other spell-specific costs) to successfully cast the given spell. This method
    is typically invoked before attempting to cast a spell to prevent invalid actions
    and ensure game logic integrity. It checks against the current state of the unit's
    resource pool and compares it with the resource cost defined for the specified
    spell ID. The method does not modify any internal state but returns a boolean
    value indicating availability of resources.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to check resource requirements
      for. This ID must correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's database.
  returns: Returns true if the unit has enough resources to cast the specified spell,
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Check
    code: "if (ai->HasEnoughResource(12345)) {\n    // Proceed with casting the spell\n\
      \    ai->CastSpell(12345);\n} else {\n    // Handle insufficient resources\n\
      \    ai->DoFlee();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Check in Combat Logic
    code: "if (ai->HasEnoughResource(98765) && ai->GetTarget() != nullptr) {\n   \
      \ // Cast powerful spell if resources allow and target exists\n    ai->CastSpell(98765);\n\
      } else if (!ai->HasEnoughResource(98765)) {\n    // Switch to a lower-cost ability\
      \ or retreat\n    ai->CastSpell(11223);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the spell's resource cost being properly defined in
    the game database. It does not account for temporary buffs or debuffs that might
    affect resource generation or consumption during spell casting. The AI implementation
    may also consider cooldowns and other conditions beyond just resource availability.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId passed to this method corresponds to an actual
    spell entry; invalid IDs could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect return
    values. This method should not be used as a sole determinant for spell selection
    without considering other factors like target validity, line of sight, and AI
    decision-making logic.
