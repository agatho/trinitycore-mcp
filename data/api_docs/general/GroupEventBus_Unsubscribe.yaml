  method: Unsubscribe
  signature: void GroupEventBus::Unsubscribe(BotAI * subscriber)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a BotAI subscriber from the GroupEventBus event system
  description: The Unsubscribe method removes a specified BotAI subscriber from the
    GroupEventBus, effectively disconnecting it from the event notification system.
    This allows the AI to stop receiving group-related events and notifications that
    would normally be dispatched through the bus. The method ensures proper cleanup
    of internal tracking structures for the subscriber, preventing memory leaks or
    dangling references. When a BotAI is unsubscribed, it will no longer receive updates
    about group changes, member status updates, or other group-specific events that
    are broadcast through this event bus.
  parameters:
  - name: subscriber
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that should be removed from the event
      subscription system. Must not be null, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: None. This method returns void and performs no value return.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Unsubscribe Usage
    code: 'BotAI* myBot = new BotAI();

      // ... subscribe bot to events ...

      GroupEventBus::Instance()->Unsubscribe(myBot);

      // myBot will no longer receive group events'
    language: cpp
  - title: Unsubscribe Before Deletion
    code: "BotAI* bot = GetBotFromGroup();\nif (bot)\n{\n    GroupEventBus::Instance()->Unsubscribe(bot);\n\
      \    delete bot;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GroupEventBus instance has already been initialized
    and is accessible via Instance(). The internal implementation likely maintains
    a collection of active subscribers and performs O(n) lookup to remove the specified
    subscriber. It's recommended to call this before deleting BotAI instances to prevent
    potential dangling pointer issues.
  warnings: Calling Unsubscribe with a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the BotAI instance being unsubscribed was previously subscribed to
    avoid attempting to unsubscribe an already-unsubscribed entity, which may cause
    internal consistency errors or crashes.
