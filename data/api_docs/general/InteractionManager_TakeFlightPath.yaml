  class: InteractionManager
  method: TakeFlightPath
  signature: bool InteractionManager::TakeFlightPath(Player * bot, Creature * flightMaster,
    uint32 nodeId)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a flight path for a player using a specified flight master and
    node ID.
  description: The TakeFlightPath method is responsible for starting a flight path
    journey for a given player character. It requires a valid player instance, a flight
    master creature, and a node identifier that specifies which destination to fly
    to. The method handles the necessary checks and state changes required to begin
    the flight path traversal. This function is typically used in AI scripts or quest
    handling where automated travel between locations is needed. The method returns
    true if the flight path initiation was successful, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object that will begin the flight path journey.
      Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: flightMaster
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the flight master who
      can provide the flight path. This must be a valid flight master NPC.
  - name: nodeId
    description: Unique identifier for the flight path node that specifies the destination.
      Must correspond to a valid node in the flight path database.
  returns: Returns true if the flight path was successfully initiated for the player,
    false if the operation failed due to invalid parameters or other conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Flight Path Initiation
    code: "if (interactionManager.TakeFlightPath(player, flightMaster, 12345)) {\n\
      \    // Flight path started successfully\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"player.log\", \"\
      Player %s has begun flight path to node 12345\", player->GetName().c_str());\n\
      } else {\n    // Failed to start flight path\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"player.log\"\
      , \"Failed to initiate flight path for player %s\", player->GetName().c_str());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has already been validated and is in
    a state where they can begin flight path travel. It does not handle the actual
    movement or animation of the flight itself, but rather initiates the process.
    The method may perform internal checks for valid player states, flight master
    availability, and node existence before proceeding.
  warnings: Ensure that all parameters are properly validated before calling this
    method to avoid unexpected behavior. Passing null pointers or invalid node IDs
    may result in undefined behavior or failed flight path initiation. This method
    should not be called during critical game events where flight paths might be restricted.
