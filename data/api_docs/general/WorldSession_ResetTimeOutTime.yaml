  class: WorldSession
  method: ResetTimeOutTime
  signature: void WorldSession::ResetTimeOutTime(bool onlyActive)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the session's timeout timer, extending the time before the client
    is disconnected due to inactivity.
  description: The ResetTimeOutTime method resets the internal timeout counter for
    a WorldSession, effectively prolonging the period of time that the session will
    remain active before being disconnected due to inactivity. This is typically called
    when the session receives valid activity from the client, such as movement commands
    or chat messages. The optional 'onlyActive' parameter determines whether the reset
    should only occur if the session is currently considered active. This mechanism
    helps maintain stable connections for players who are actively playing while preventing
    resource waste on idle sessions.
  parameters:
  - name: onlyActive
    description: If true, the timeout timer is only reset when the session is marked
      as active. If false, the timer is reset regardless of the session's activity
      status.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset timeout for an active session
    code: "WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();\nif (session)\n{\n    session->ResetTimeOutTime(true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Force reset timeout regardless of session state
    code: "WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();\nif (session)\n{\n    session->ResetTimeOutTime(false);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly invoked in response to client input events to prevent
    automatic disconnection. The timeout mechanism is crucial for server resource
    management and helps maintain a balance between connection stability and efficient
    resource usage.
