  class: ProtectionWarriorRefactored
  method: OnCombatStartSpecific
  signature: void ProtectionWarriorRefactored::OnCombatStartSpecific(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes combat-specific behavior for a protection warrior when entering
    combat.
  description: The OnCombatStartSpecific method is invoked when a ProtectionWarriorRefactored
    AI unit enters combat mode. This method sets up initial combat state, applies
    necessary buffs or auras, and prepares the warrior for engaging enemies. It typically
    handles logic such as positioning, threat generation, and activation of defensive
    abilities that are specific to the protection warrior's role in combat. The method
    is part of the AI framework and is automatically called by the TrinityCore engine
    when combat begins for this unit type.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that initiated combat. This represents
      the enemy unit the warrior will engage with.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI context
    code: "void ProtectionWarriorRefactored::OnCombatStartSpecific(Unit* target)\n\
      {\n    // Set initial stance\n    me->SetStandState(UNIT_STAND_STATE_STAND);\n\
      \    \n    // Apply defensive auras\n    me->CastSpell(me, SPELL_SHIELD_BLOCK,\
      \ true);\n    \n    // Initialize threat handling\n    me->AddThreat(target,\
      \ 100.0f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be overridden in derived classes to implement
    custom combat behavior specific to protection warriors. It should not be called
    directly by external code unless implementing a custom AI system.
  warnings: Ensure that all spell casts within this method are checked for validity
    and cooldowns to prevent client-side errors or unexpected behavior during combat
    transitions.
