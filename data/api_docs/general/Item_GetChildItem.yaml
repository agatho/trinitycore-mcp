documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier of a child item.
  description: This method returns the GUID (unique identifier) of the child item
    associated with the current item. It is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework to access item data for various game mechanics, including item management,
    loot systems, and player inventory operations. The method typically returns a
    value representing the item's unique ID within the database or game context.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the GUID of the child item. This value
    corresponds to the unique identifier used by TrinityCore for tracking item instances
    in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      int guid = item->GetChildItem();

      // guid now contains the child item''s GUID'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Item class in TrinityCore and operates on a const
    object, meaning it does not modify the item state. It should be used carefully
    when dealing with item references to avoid potential issues with item GUIDs.
  warnings: The method may return zero or negative values if no child item exists,
    which could indicate an invalid item reference or missing data in the database.
