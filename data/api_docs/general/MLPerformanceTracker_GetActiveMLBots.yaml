  signature: uint32_t MLPerformanceTracker::GetActiveMLBots() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of active machine learning bots currently tracked by
    the performance tracker.
  description: The GetActiveMLBots method returns the number of machine learning bots
    that are currently marked as active within the MLPerformanceTracker. This value
    represents the total count of bots participating in performance monitoring or
    training activities. The method is typically used to gauge system load, monitor
    bot activity levels, or determine how many bots are currently engaged in AI-related
    tasks. It provides a snapshot of active bot utilization at the time of the call
    and does not account for any asynchronous changes that may occur immediately after
    the method returns.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32_t value representing the number of active machine learning bots
    tracked by this performance tracker instance. Returns zero if no bots are currently
    active or if the tracker contains no bot data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Active Bot Count
    code: "MLPerformanceTracker tracker;\nuint32_t activeBots = tracker.GetActiveMLBots();\n\
      if (activeBots > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Currently tracking %u active ML bots\\\
      n\", activeBots);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Active Bot Count for Performance Monitoring
    code: "void MonitorSystemLoad()\n{\n    static MLPerformanceTracker performanceTracker;\n\
      \    uint32_t activeCount = performanceTracker.GetActiveMLBots();\n    \n  \
      \  if (activeCount > 100)\n    {\n        // Log warning about high bot activity\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Warning: High ML bot activity detected (%u bots active)\"\
      , activeCount);\n    }\n    else if (activeCount == 0)\n    {\n        // Log\
      \ idle state\n        sLog->outString(\"No active ML bots currently tracked\"\
      );\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method performs a simple read operation on an internal counter or data
    structure. It's designed to be lightweight and should not cause performance bottlenecks
    in typical usage scenarios. The returned value reflects the state at the moment
    of invocation, so concurrent modifications by other threads may affect subsequent
    calls.
  warnings: Ensure that the MLPerformanceTracker instance is properly initialized
    before calling this method, as accessing an uninitialized tracker could lead to
    undefined behavior. Additionally, since this returns a count, it's not thread-safe
    against concurrent modifications; if bot states are updated concurrently, the
    value returned might be stale by the time it's used.
