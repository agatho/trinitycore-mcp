  class: CreatureAI
  method: GetDialogStatus
  signature: int CreatureAI::GetDialogStatus(const int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the dialog status for a player interacting with the creature.
  description: The GetDialogStatus method is used in TrinityCore's CreatureAI system
    to determine what type of dialog or interaction should be presented to a player
    when they approach the creature. This method is typically called during player-creature
    interaction events, such as when a player right-clicks on a quest-giving NPC or
    interacts with a vendor. The return value indicates the appropriate dialog state,
    which can control whether a quest log entry is shown, if a vendor window opens,
    or if a simple greeting is displayed. This method allows for dynamic dialog behavior
    based on player state, quest progress, faction standing, and other conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the interacting player.
      This parameter is used to access player-specific data such as quest status,
      faction, and inventory for determining appropriate dialog options.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the dialog status type. Common return
    values include DIALOG_STATUS_NONE (0) for no interaction, DIALOG_STATUS_CHAT (1)
    for standard greeting, DIALOG_STATUS_REWARD (2) for quest reward options, and
    DIALOG_STATUS_TRADE (3) for vendor interactions. The specific numeric values may
    vary based on the game's internal dialog system implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Dialog Status Check
    code: "int CreatureAI::GetDialogStatus(const Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->GetQuestStatus(12345)\
      \ == QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE)\n        return DIALOG_STATUS_REWARD;\n    else\
      \ if (player->GetQuestStatus(12345) == QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE)\n        return\
      \ DIALOG_STATUS_CHAT;\n    else\n        return DIALOG_STATUS_NONE;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called frequently during player interaction events, so performance
    should be considered. The method should not perform heavy operations or database
    queries that could block the game loop. It's typically overridden in custom AI
    implementations to provide specific dialog behavior for different creature types.
  warnings: Incorrect return values can cause unexpected UI behavior for players,
    such as showing no dialog when one is expected or displaying incorrect quest options.
    Ensure proper player state checking before returning dialog status codes.
