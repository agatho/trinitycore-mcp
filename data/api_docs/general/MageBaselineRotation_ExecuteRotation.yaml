  class: MageBaselineRotation
  method: ExecuteRotation
  signature: bool MageBaselineRotation::ExecuteRotation(int * bot, int * target, BaselineRotationManager
    & manager)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the baseline Mage rotation logic for a bot, returning true if the
    rotation was successfully completed.
  description: The ExecuteRotation method implements the core logic for a Mage's baseline
    combat rotation. It evaluates the current state of the bot and target, selects
    appropriate spells based on mana availability, cooldowns, and combat conditions,
    and executes the rotation sequence. The method interacts with the BaselineRotationManager
    to manage spell selection and timing. This function is typically called during
    combat situations where the Mage needs to perform automated spell casting according
    to predefined rules. The method returns true if the rotation was successfully
    executed, or false if it could not proceed due to invalid conditions or resource
    constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot's player data structure containing current state,
      stats, and spell information
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target's player data structure containing target state
      and health information
  - name: manager
    description: Reference to the BaselineRotationManager that handles rotation logic,
      spell priorities, and cooldown tracking
  returns: Returns true if the rotation was successfully executed with valid targets
    and resources; returns false if the rotation could not be performed due to invalid
    parameters, insufficient mana, or other execution constraints
  examples:
  - title: Basic Mage Rotation Execution
    code: "int botData[100];\nint targetData[100];\nBaselineRotationManager manager;\n\
      MageBaselineRotation rotation;\n\nbool result = rotation.ExecuteRotation(botData,\
      \ targetData, manager);\nif (result) {\n    // Rotation completed successfully\n\
      \    printf(\"Mage rotation executed\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Rotation failed\
      \ or could not be performed\n    printf(\"Mage rotation failed\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat State Management
    code: "void HandleCombatState(int* bot, int* target) {\n    BaselineRotationManager\
      \ manager;\n    MageBaselineRotation rotation;\n    \n    // Check if bot is\
      \ in combat\n    if (IsInCombat(bot)) {\n        bool success = rotation.ExecuteRotation(bot,\
      \ target, manager);\n        if (!success) {\n            // Handle rotation\
      \ failure\n            AttemptToMoveToTarget(bot, target);\n        }\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot and target data structures are properly
    initialized with valid information. The BaselineRotationManager should be pre-configured
    with appropriate spell priorities and cooldown settings. The method performs no
    direct network communication or external API calls, making it suitable for local
    AI processing within the TrinityCore framework.
  warnings: The method may fail silently if parameters are invalid or if the bot lacks
    sufficient resources (mana, target, etc.). Ensure that the bot data structures
    are properly synchronized before calling this function. The rotation sequence
    might not be optimal for all combat scenarios and should be used in conjunction
    with additional AI decision-making logic.
