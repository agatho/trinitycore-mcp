  brief: Updates the buff states and effects for the Marksmanship Hunter class.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and applying all
    active buffs specific to the Marksmanship Hunter specialization. This includes
    updating the state of combat abilities, passive enhancements, and temporary stat
    boosts that affect the hunter's performance in combat. The method ensures that
    all relevant buff effects are properly maintained and applied based on the current
    game state, including any changes due to spell casts, item usage, or environmental
    factors. It typically runs during the update cycle of the hunter's AI behavior.

  notes: This method is typically called as part of the regular update cycle in the
    hunter's AI implementation. It may internally iterate through active buffs, check
    their durations, and apply or remove effects accordingly. Developers should be
    aware that this method might trigger additional callbacks or events related to
    buff changes.
