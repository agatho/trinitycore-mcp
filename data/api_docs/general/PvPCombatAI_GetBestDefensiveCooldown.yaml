  method: GetBestDefensiveCooldown
  signature: uint32 PvPCombatAI::GetBestDefensiveCooldown(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the most effective defensive cooldown available for
    the player in PvP combat.
  description: The GetBestDefensiveCooldown method evaluates the current state of
    the player's defensive abilities and returns the cooldown time (in milliseconds)
    of the most beneficial defensive ability that is currently available. This method
    is typically used by PvP AI logic to make strategic decisions about when to use
    defensive spells or abilities during combat. The method considers various defensive
    cooldowns such as defensive stance, healing potions, or other protective measures,
    and selects the one with the lowest remaining cooldown time that is currently
    usable. It does not account for global cooldowns or resource requirements, but
    rather focuses purely on timing and availability of defensive options.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the cooldown time in milliseconds of
    the best available defensive ability. If no defensive cooldown is available or
    applicable, it returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in PvP AI Logic
    code: "uint32 cooldown = ai->GetBestDefensiveCooldown();\nif (cooldown > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Use the defensive ability with the shortest remaining cooldown\n \
      \   // Implementation logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Strategic Decision Making Based on Defensive Cooldown
    code: "uint32 bestCooldown = ai->GetBestDefensiveCooldown();\nif (bestCooldown\
      \ < 5000) // Less than 5 seconds remaining\n{\n    // Prioritize defensive actions\
      \ over offensive ones\n    // Execute defensive ability immediately\n}\nelse\
      \ if (bestCooldown > 10000) // More than 10 seconds remaining\n{\n    // Continue\
      \ with normal combat strategy\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PvPCombatAI class and assumes that the AI has
    access to a player object with valid defensive cooldown information. The returned
    value represents absolute time in milliseconds, not relative time. This method
    should be called frequently during combat to ensure optimal timing decisions are
    made.
  warnings: The method may return 0 if no defensive abilities are available or if
    they're all on cooldown. This could lead to incorrect strategic decisions if not
    properly handled. Ensure that the AI has proper access to player state information
    before calling this method.
