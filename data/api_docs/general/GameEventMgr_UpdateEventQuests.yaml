  class: GameEventMgr
  method: UpdateEventQuests
  signature: void GameEventMgr::UpdateEventQuests(uint16 event_id, bool activate)
documentation:
  brief: Updates quest states for a specific game event based on activation status.
  description: The UpdateEventQuests method manages the state of quests associated
    with a particular game event. When activated, it enables or disables quest tracking
    and completion conditions for all quests linked to that event. This ensures that
    during seasonal events, holiday celebrations, or special in-game occasions, relevant
    quests are properly handled according to their event timing. The method typically
    gets invoked when an event starts or ends to synchronize quest data with the current
    event state.
  parameters:
  - name: event_id
    description: The unique identifier of the game event whose quests should be updated.
      Must correspond to a valid registered event in the GameEventMgr.
  - name: activate
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to activate (true) or deactivate
      (false) the event's associated quests. When true, quests become available; when
      false, they are removed from active tracking.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Activate a seasonal event quest
    code: GameEventMgr::instance()->UpdateEventQuests(42, true); // Activate the "Festival
      of Fire" event quests
    language: cpp
  - title: Deactivate holiday event quests
    code: GameEventMgr::instance()->UpdateEventQuests(101, false); // Disable all
      "Winter Veil" related quest tracking
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the GameEventMgr when events
    start or stop. It modifies internal quest state flags and may trigger updates
    to player quest log entries. Ensure that event_id corresponds to an existing registered
    event to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid event_id can lead to assertion failures
    or corrupted quest data. Always verify the event exists before invoking this function.
    Avoid calling it from within quest update handlers to prevent potential recursion
    issues.
