  signature: void PlayerbotGroupManager::UpdateGroupFormation(uint32 groupId, const
    GroupFormationData & formation)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the formation data for a specified player group in the bot manager.
  description: The UpdateGroupFormation method is responsible for updating the formation
    configuration of a specific player group managed by the PlayerbotGroupManager.
    This method allows dynamic modification of how bots within a group should position
    themselves relative to each other, which is crucial for tactical gameplay scenarios
    such as combat positioning, movement coordination, or quest-based group formations.
    The method accepts a group identifier and a complete formation data structure
    that defines the desired layout. It ensures that all bots in the specified group
    adjust their behavior according to the new formation settings.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: The unique identifier of the player group whose formation is to be
      updated. This ID must correspond to an existing group managed by the PlayerbotGroupManager.
  - name: formation
    description: A constant reference to a GroupFormationData structure containing
      the new formation configuration. This includes details such as positioning rules,
      spacing, and tactical layout preferences for the group members.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update Formation for a Specific Group
    code: 'GroupFormationData newFormation;

      newFormation.type = GROUP_FORMATION_CIRCLE;

      newFormation.radius = 10.0f;

      playerbotGroupManager->UpdateGroupFormation(12345, newFormation);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when group tactical settings need to be changed
    during gameplay, such as switching from a defensive circle formation to an offensive
    line formation. The implementation may trigger internal updates to bot AI behaviors
    and movement patterns.
