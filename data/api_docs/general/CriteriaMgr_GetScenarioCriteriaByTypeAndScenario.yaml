  class: CriteriaMgr
  method: GetScenarioCriteriaByTypeAndScenario
  signature: const CriteriaList & CriteriaMgr::GetScenarioCriteriaByTypeAndScenario(int
    type, uint32 scenarioId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves all scenario criteria of a specified type for a given scenario
    ID.
  description: The GetScenarioCriteriaByTypeAndScenario method fetches a list of criteria
    entries that match both the provided scenario type and scenario ID. This is used
    internally by the TrinityCore framework to manage and evaluate scenario-based
    achievements and objectives. The returned CriteriaList is a constant reference,
    ensuring data integrity and preventing modification of the internal criteria collection.
    This method is typically invoked during scenario progression or achievement evaluation
    logic within the game's core systems.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type identifier of the criteria to retrieve. This corresponds
      to predefined criterion types used in scenario tracking and achievement systems.
  - name: scenarioId
    description: The unique identifier of the scenario for which to fetch criteria.
      This ID maps to a specific scenario definition within the game's database.
  returns: A constant reference to a CriteriaList containing all matching criteria
    entries. If no criteria are found for the given type and scenario ID, an empty
    list is returned.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve scenario criteria for a specific scenario type
    code: "const CriteriaList& criteria = sCriteriaMgr->GetScenarioCriteriaByTypeAndScenario(CRITERIA_TYPE_COMPLETE_SCENARIO,\
      \ 1234);\nfor (const auto& criterion : criteria)\n{\n    // Process each criterion\n\
      \    printf(\"Criterion ID: %u\\n\", criterion->ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation using internal data structures. It
    is optimized for frequent access during scenario progression events but should
    not be called excessively in performance-critical code paths. The returned reference
    remains valid only as long as the CriteriaMgr instance exists and its internal
    data has not been modified.
  warnings: Do not modify the contents of the returned CriteriaList, as it's a const
    reference. Modifying it may lead to undefined behavior or corrupted data structures
    within the framework.
