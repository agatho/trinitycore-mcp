  method: FindElevatedPosition
  signature: int LineOfSightManager::FindElevatedPosition(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the elevated position of a target unit for line-of-sight
    evaluation.
  description: The FindElevatedPosition method determines the adjusted vertical position
    of a target unit to account for elevation changes in terrain or object height,
    which is essential for accurate line-of-sight calculations. This method is typically
    used by AI systems and spell casters to ensure that their targeting and pathfinding
    logic correctly considers the three-dimensional space when determining whether
    an object or unit is obstructed. It modifies the target's position based on its
    bounding box and environmental factors to provide a more precise elevation point
    for line-of-sight checks. The method assumes that the target unit is valid and
    accessible within the current game world context.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated elevated position
    of the target unit. A positive value indicates the unit's elevation has been adjusted
    upward, while a negative value may indicate a downward adjustment or error condition.
    The return value is typically used as input for subsequent line-of-sight calculations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "Unit* target = ...;\nint elevatedPos = lineOfSightManager->FindElevatedPosition(target);\n\
      if (elevatedPos > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with line-of-sight check using the elevated\
      \ position\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal unit bounding box data and terrain height
    calculations. It should only be called when the target unit is in a valid world
    state and accessible to the calling context. Performance may be impacted by frequent
    calls during AI decision-making loops.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null or invalid Unit pointer will likely result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the target unit is properly initialized
    and within the game world before invoking this method.
