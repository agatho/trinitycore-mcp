  method: GetAuraEffectMask
  signature: uint32 AuraCreateInfo::GetAuraEffectMask() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the aura effect mask from the AuraCreateInfo object.
  description: The GetAuraEffectMask method returns a 32-bit unsigned integer representing
    the bitmask of aura effects associated with the AuraCreateInfo instance. This
    mask is used internally by the TrinityCore framework to determine which specific
    effects are applied when an aura is created. The returned value typically corresponds
    to a combination of effect types defined in the game's aura system, allowing for
    efficient filtering and processing of aura effects during spell application and
    management.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the bitmask of aura effects. Each bit in the
    mask corresponds to a specific aura effect type, enabling bitwise operations to
    check or combine multiple effects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "AuraCreateInfo createInfo;\n// Assume createInfo has been properly initialized\
      \ with aura effects\nuint32 effectMask = createInfo.GetAuraEffectMask();\nif\
      \ (effectMask & AURA_EFFECT_TYPE_DAMAGE_OVER_TIME)\n{\n    // Handle damage\
      \ over time effect\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Effects
    code: "AuraCreateInfo createInfo;\nuint32 mask = createInfo.GetAuraEffectMask();\n\
      if ((mask & AURA_EFFECT_TYPE_STUN) && (mask & AURA_EFFECT_TYPE_SILENCE))\n{\n\
      \    // Apply both stun and silence effects\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned mask value should not be modified directly. It represents a
    read-only view of the aura effect configuration stored within the AuraCreateInfo
    object. This method is commonly used in spell processing and aura application
    logic where multiple effects need to be evaluated simultaneously.
