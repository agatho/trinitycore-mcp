  method: DetermineRole
  signature: ThreatRole RoleBasedCombatPositioning::DetermineRole(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the threat role of a player bot based on their current combat
    state and positioning.
  description: The DetermineRole method evaluates a player bot's current combat situation
    to assign it a specific threat role within the RoleBasedCombatPositioning system.
    This role typically defines whether the bot should act as a tank, healer, or damage
    dealer in group encounters. The method analyzes various factors such as the bot's
    health status, target threat level, class abilities, and positioning relative
    to other group members. It returns an enum value representing one of the predefined
    threat roles that guide the bot's behavior during combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a ThreatRole enum value indicating the determined role for the
    player bot. Possible values may include TANK, HEALER, DAMAGE_DEALER, or UNKNOWN
    depending on the internal logic and current combat state of the bot.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine bot's threat role
    code: "ThreatRole role = positioning.DetermineRole(bot);\nswitch (role)\n{\n \
      \   case TANK:\n        // Handle tank-specific behavior\n        break;\n \
      \   case HEALER:\n        // Handle healing behavior\n        break;\n    case\
      \ DAMAGE_DEALER:\n        // Handle DPS behavior\n        break;\n    default:\n\
      \        // Handle unknown or invalid role\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's AI framework and relies on accurate
    combat state tracking. The implementation likely uses internal bot state variables
    and combat metrics to make decisions. It should only be called when the bot is
    in a valid combat context to ensure meaningful results.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player* parameter is not null before calling this method,
    as it may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The method assumes the bot is
    actively engaged in combat and may return unexpected values if called during non-combat
    situations.
