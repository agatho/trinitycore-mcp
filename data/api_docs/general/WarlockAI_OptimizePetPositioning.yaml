  signature: void WarlockAI::OptimizePetPositioning()
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the positioning of the warlock's pet for maximum combat effectiveness.
  description: The OptimizePetPositioning method adjusts the pet's position relative
    to the warlock and target enemies to enhance damage output and survivability.
    This method evaluates the current battlefield conditions, including threat levels,
    enemy positions, and available space, to determine the most advantageous placement
    for the pet. It ensures that the pet maintains optimal distance from the warlock
    while staying within effective attack range of targets. The method is typically
    called during combat updates and may be influenced by the warlock's current spell
    selection and pet abilities.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat loop
    code: "void WarlockAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (UpdateVictim())\n   \
      \ {\n        OptimizePetPositioning();\n        // ... rest of AI logic\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active combat situations where pet
    positioning is relevant. It may have performance implications if invoked too frequently
    without proper cooldowns. The method assumes that the warlock and pet are in the
    same combat zone and that valid targets exist.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of combat or when no valid targets are present
    may result in unnecessary calculations or unexpected behavior. Ensure that the
    pet is properly summoned before invoking this method to avoid potential null reference
    issues.
