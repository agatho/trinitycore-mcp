  class: AuraEffect
  method: HandleAuraIncreaseBaseHealthPercent
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleAuraIncreaseBaseHealthPercent(const AuraApplication
    * aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes a percentage-based increase to the target's base health.
  description: The HandleAuraIncreaseBaseHealthPercent method is responsible for modifying
    a unit's base health value by a specified percentage when an aura is applied or
    removed. This method is typically invoked during aura application or removal events,
    adjusting the target's maximum health in accordance with the aura's effect. The
    change affects only the base health value and does not influence current health
    or any other health-related modifiers. It ensures that the unit's health is recalculated
    to reflect the new percentage-based increase or decrease upon applying or removing
    the aura.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. This parameter provides context about which aura and target
      are involved in the operation.
  - name: mode
    description: An unsigned 8-bit integer indicating the mode of operation, typically
      used to determine how the effect should be processed (e.g., application vs.
      removal).
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the aura is being applied (true)
      or removed (false). This determines if the health percentage increase should
      be added or subtracted.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying a Health Increase Aura
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = aura->GetEffect(0);

      effect->HandleAuraIncreaseBaseHealthPercent(auraApp, 1, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing a Health Increase Aura
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = aura->GetEffect(0);

      effect->HandleAuraIncreaseBaseHealthPercent(auraApp, 1, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the base health value directly and does not affect current
    health. It is part of the aura system's internal handling logic and should only
    be called from within the aura application process.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of the 'apply' parameter can lead to unintended health
    modifications. Ensure that the mode and apply flags are correctly set according
    to the aura's intended behavior.
