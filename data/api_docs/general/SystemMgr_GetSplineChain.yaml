  class: SystemMgr
  method: GetSplineChain
  signature: const int * SystemMgr::GetSplineChain(const Creature * who, uint16 id)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spline chain data for a specified creature and ID.
  description: The GetSplineChain method retrieves a const integer array representing
    the spline chain associated with a given creature and identifier. This functionality
    is typically used in pathfinding or movement-related systems within the TrinityCore
    framework, where creatures follow predefined paths defined by spline chains. The
    returned pointer points to an internal data structure that should not be modified
    directly. The method assumes valid inputs and may return nullptr if no matching
    spline chain is found for the specified creature and ID.
  parameters:
  - name: who
    description: Pointer to the Creature object for which the spline chain is being
      retrieved.
  - name: id
    description: A 16-bit unsigned integer identifier used to select a specific spline
      chain from the creature's data.
  returns: A const pointer to an array of integers representing the spline chain data.
    Returns nullptr if no matching spline chain is found for the given creature and
    ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const int* chain = sSystemMgr->GetSplineChain(creature, 1234);\nif (chain\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process spline chain data\n    for (int i = 0; i <\
      \ 10; ++i)\n    {\n        printf(\"Point %d: %d\\n\", i, chain[i]);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal spline chain data structures. It is intended
    for use in movement logic and pathfinding systems. The returned array should not
    be modified directly as it's managed internally by the system.
  warnings: Ensure that the Creature pointer is valid before calling this method,
    otherwise undefined behavior may occur. Also, do not modify the contents of the
    returned array as it is part of an internal data structure.
