documentation:
  brief: Moves a ConditionMgr object, transferring ownership of its resources to the
    new instance.
  description: The ConditionMgr move constructor transfers all managed resources from
    the source ConditionMgr object to the newly created object. This operation is
    typically used when passing ConditionMgr objects by value in scenarios where the
    original object should no longer be used. The move constructor ensures efficient
    resource management by avoiding expensive deep copies and instead transferring
    pointers or handles to the underlying data structures. In the context of TrinityCore's
    condition system, this allows for efficient handling of condition evaluation logic
    without unnecessary memory duplication.

  examples:
  - title: Moving a ConditionMgr object
    code: 'ConditionMgr sourceMgr;

      // ... populate sourceMgr with conditions ...

      ConditionMgr movedMgr = std::move(sourceMgr); // Move constructor called

      // sourceMgr is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a standard C++ move constructor implementation. After the move, the
    original ConditionMgr object should not be used for any operations that require
    its data to remain valid. The moved-from object will typically be left in a valid
    but unspecified state.
  warnings: Using the moved-from ConditionMgr object after a move operation results
    in undefined behavior. Always ensure no further operations are performed on the
    source object after moving it.
