  class: Player
  method: GetDungeonDifficultyID
  signature: int Player::GetDungeonDifficultyID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current dungeon difficulty identifier for the player.
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier that represents the current
    dungeon difficulty level selected by the player. The returned value corresponds
    to the difficulty ID used in game mechanics and is essential for determining which
    content the player should be able to access. This identifier is typically associated
    with the player's current instance difficulty settings, such as normal, heroic,
    or mythic modes, and affects the player's ability to enter dungeons and access
    rewards.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the dungeon difficulty ID. Possible values
    include 1 (normal), 2 (heroic), 3 (mythic), and 4 (mythic+). The value may vary
    based on the player's current difficulty selection and game context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int difficulty = player->GetDungeonDifficultyID();\nif (difficulty == 1)\n\
      {\n    // Player is in normal mode\n}\nelse if (difficulty == 2)\n{\n    //\
      \ Player is in heroic mode\n}\nelse if (difficulty == 3)\n{\n    // Player is\
      \ in mythic mode\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other dungeon-related APIs
    to determine player access to content. The value returned may be influenced by
    the player's current difficulty selection and can change based on game updates
    or player settings.
  warnings: The method returns a value that reflects the player's current difficulty
    setting, which can affect gameplay mechanics such as loot distribution and encounter
    difficulty. Be cautious when using this method in conditional logic to ensure
    proper handling of all possible difficulty values.
