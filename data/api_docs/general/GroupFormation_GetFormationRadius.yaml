  signature: float GroupFormation::GetFormationRadius() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the formation radius of the group formation.
  description: The GetFormationRadius method retrieves the radius value used for maintaining
    group formation in World of Warcraft. This radius defines how close members of
    a group should stay to each other when following a leader or moving together as
    a unit. The returned float value represents the distance in yards. This method
    is typically used by the TrinityCore server's group management system to enforce
    proper positioning and spacing between group members during movement operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the formation radius in yards. This value indicates
    the maximum distance that group members should maintain from each other while
    in formation.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve formation radius for a group
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();

      float radius = formation->GetFormationRadius();

      TC_LOG_INFO("group", "Current formation radius: %.2f yards", radius);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the group formation system that controls how players
    maintain their positions relative to each other. The formation radius may be modified
    by various game mechanics such as player abilities, environmental factors, or
    group leader settings.
