documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a corpse has expired based on the provided time threshold.
  description: The IsExpired method checks if a corpse object has exceeded its allowed
    lifetime in the game world. This is typically used to determine when a player's
    corpse should be removed from the game world to prevent infinite accumulation
    of corpses. The method compares the current time against the corpse's creation
    time and the provided threshold value to make this determination. Corpses in World
    of Warcraft have a limited lifespan before they disappear, and this method helps
    manage that behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: t
    description: The time threshold in seconds after which a corpse is considered
      expired. This represents the maximum lifetime of a corpse before it should be
      removed from the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the corpse has exceeded its expiration time (t seconds
    since creation), false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the corpse
    should be cleaned up by the game system.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a corpse has expired
    code: "if (corpse->IsExpired(300)) // 5 minute expiration\n{\n    // Handle corpse\
      \ cleanup\n    corpse->RemoveFromWorld();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in a game loop to manage corpses
    code: "for (auto& corpse : corpseList)\n{\n    if (corpse->IsExpired(1800)) //\
      \ 30 minute expiration\n    {\n        corpse->RemoveFromWorld();\n        corpse.reset();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during game tick processing or cleanup routines.
    The time threshold 't' usually corresponds to the server's configured corpse decay
    time, which can vary based on game rules and player level. The method does not
    modify the corpse state directly but only evaluates its expiration status.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in performance-critical code paths
    as it may involve time comparisons that could impact frame rate if called excessively.
    Also ensure that the time threshold parameter is appropriate for your game's intended
    gameplay mechanics.
