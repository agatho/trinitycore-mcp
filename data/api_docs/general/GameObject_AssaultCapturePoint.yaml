api:
  class: GameObject
  method: AssaultCapturePoint
  signature: void GameObject::AssaultCapturePoint(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Assaults a capture point by a player, triggering the capture process for
    GameObjects.
  description: This method represents the core functionality for handling capture
    point assaults in World of Warcraft's objective-based gameplay. It allows GameObjects
    to initiate capture point operations by a player, enabling the game mechanics
    that govern how players interact with objectives such as flags, bases, or control
    points. The method typically involves checking player eligibility and initiating
    the capture process, which may involve updating the GameObject's state or triggering
    related events. This function is essential for implementing capture point mechanics
    in battlegrounds and zones where players can control objectives.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object that is assaulting the capture point.
      This parameter must be valid and represent a player who is capable of initiating
      the capture process.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Capture Point Assault Example
    code: "void GameObject::AssaultCapturePoint(int* player)\n{\n    if (!player ||\
      \ !player->IsInWorld())\n        return;\n    \n    // Perform capture point\
      \ assault logic\n    // This may involve updating the GameObject's state\n \
      \   // and triggering related events\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely requires the GameObject to be in a valid state for capture
    point operations. Implementation details include checking player's presence and
    ensuring proper game state updates during the assault process.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the GameObject is in a valid state
    for capture point operations. Improper usage may lead to undefined behavior or
    game mechanics errors.
