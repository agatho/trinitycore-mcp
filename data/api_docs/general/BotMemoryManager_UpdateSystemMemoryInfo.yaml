  signature: void BotMemoryManager::UpdateSystemMemoryInfo()
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal system memory usage statistics for bot management.
  description: The UpdateSystemMemoryInfo method collects and updates current system
    memory consumption data used by the BotMemoryManager class. This information is
    crucial for determining optimal bot behavior, resource allocation, and preventing
    system overload in World of Warcraft environments. The method typically gathers
    memory metrics such as total available memory, used memory, and memory pressure
    indicators to inform bot decision-making processes. It should be called periodically
    to maintain accurate memory state tracking for efficient bot operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotMemoryManager memoryManager;

      memoryManager.UpdateSystemMemoryInfo();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform system calls to retrieve memory information, which
    could introduce minor performance overhead. It's recommended to call this method
    at intervals rather than on every bot update cycle to balance accuracy with performance.
