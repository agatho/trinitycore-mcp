  method: CheckForWipe
  signature: bool CombatStateAnalyzer::CheckForWipe() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current combat state constitutes a wipe for the group
    or raid.
  description: The CheckForWipe method evaluates the current combat state to determine
    if all group members have been defeated, indicating a wipe condition. This is
    typically used in dungeon and raid encounters where the failure of the entire
    group triggers specific game mechanics such as respawn timers, loot resets, or
    quest status changes. The method checks the health status of all players in the
    combat context and returns true if no players remain alive, otherwise false. It's
    commonly invoked during encounter cleanup or post-combat evaluation phases.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all group members are defeated and the combat state is
    considered a wipe; returns false if at least one player remains alive or if the
    combat state doesn't meet wipe criteria.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Wipe Check Usage
    code: "if (combatAnalyzer.CheckForWipe()) {\n    // Handle wipe logic\n    instance->HandleWipe();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Wipe Check with Logging
    code: "bool isWipe = combatAnalyzer.CheckForWipe();\nif (isWipe) {\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL,\
      \ \"Combat wipe detected in instance %u\", instanceId);\n    // Trigger wipe-specific\
      \ actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the combat state has been properly initialized and
    that all relevant players are accounted for in the current combat context. It
    may not function correctly if called outside of an active combat scenario or if
    player tracking is not properly maintained.
  warnings: Do not call this method during combat initialization phases when player
    states might be inconsistent. The method relies on accurate health tracking, so
    calling it before all players have been processed could lead to incorrect results.
