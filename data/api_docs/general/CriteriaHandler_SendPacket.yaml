  class: CriteriaHandler
  method: SendPacket
  signature: void CriteriaHandler::SendPacket(const WorldPacket * data) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a WorldPacket to the client associated with this criteria handler.
  description: The SendPacket method is responsible for transmitting a WorldPacket
    object to the connected client. This method is typically used within the context
    of criteria handling, where specific in-game events or conditions need to be communicated
    back to the player's client. The packet data is sent asynchronously and does not
    block execution. It is important that the packet be properly constructed before
    calling this method, as invalid packets may cause client-side issues or disconnections.
    This method operates on the assumption that the handler has an active connection
    to a client.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: A pointer to the WorldPacket object containing the data to be sent
      to the client. The packet must be properly initialized and contain valid opcode
      and payload data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending a basic criteria update packet
    code: 'WorldPacket packet(SMSG_CRITERIA_UPDATE, 8);

      packet << uint32(12345); // Criteria ID

      packet << uint32(1);   // Progress

      handler->SendPacket(&packet);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the handler has an active client connection.
    Calling it without a valid connection may result in undefined behavior or crashes.
    The packet is sent immediately without buffering, so ensure that the data remains
    valid until transmission is complete.
  warnings: Do not send packets with invalid opcodes or malformed data as this can
    cause the client to disconnect or crash. Always validate packet contents before
    calling SendPacket.
