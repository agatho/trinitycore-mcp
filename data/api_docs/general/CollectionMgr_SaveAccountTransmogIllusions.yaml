  brief: Saves account transmog illusions for the current player's account
  description: The SaveAccountTransmogIllusions method persists the transmogrification
    illusions associated with the current player's account to the database. This method
    is typically invoked when a player applies or removes transmog illusions, ensuring
    that their custom appearance settings are retained across sessions. The method
    operates on the account-level transmog data rather than character-specific data,
    meaning all characters on the same account will share the same illusion settings.
    It performs database write operations to store the current state of transmog illusions
    for the account.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CollectionMgr* collectionMgr = sCollectionMgr;

      collectionMgr->SaveAccountTransmogIllusions(0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers a database transaction to update the account's
    transmog illusion data. It should be called after any modification to account
    transmog illusions to ensure persistence. The parameter 'trans' may represent
    a transmog type or index, though its exact meaning is not clear without source
    code access.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently may impact performance due to database
    I/O operations. Ensure that it's only called when necessary to avoid unnecessary
    database writes. This method should not be called from within database transaction
    contexts to prevent deadlocks.
