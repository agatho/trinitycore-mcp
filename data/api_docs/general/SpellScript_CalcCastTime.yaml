  class: SpellScript
  method: CalcCastTime
  signature: int SpellScript::CalcCastTime(int castTime)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the cast time of a spell based on the provided base
    cast time value.
  description: The CalcCastTime method in the SpellScript class is responsible for
    computing the actual cast time of a spell, taking into account various modifiers
    and conditions that may affect how long a spell takes to complete its casting
    phase. This method typically adjusts the base cast time according to factors such
    as caster's speed, spell-specific modifications, buffs, debuffs, or other game
    mechanics. It is commonly used within spell script implementations to dynamically
    determine how long a spell should take to cast. The method accepts an integer
    representing the base cast time and returns the adjusted value after applying
    all relevant calculations.
  parameters:
  - name: castTime
    description: The base cast time value in milliseconds that serves as input for
      calculation. This represents the initial duration before any modifiers are applied.
  returns: An integer representing the final calculated cast time in milliseconds
    after applying all relevant modifiers and adjustments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Script
    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleCastTime()\
      \ override\n    {\n        int baseCastTime = 1500; // 1.5 seconds\n       \
      \ int finalCastTime = CalcCastTime(baseCastTime);\n        // Use finalCastTime\
      \ to set the actual cast time for the spell\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Modifying Cast Time Based on Caster Stats
    code: "class SpeedSpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleCastTime()\
      \ override\n    {\n        int baseCastTime = 2000; // 2 seconds\n        int\
      \ casterSpeedModifier = 100; // 100% speed modifier\n        int modifiedCastTime\
      \ = CalcCastTime(baseCastTime);\n        // Apply additional logic based on\
      \ the calculated time\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SpellScript framework and is intended to be overridden
    or called during spell execution. Developers should ensure that any modifications
    made to cast time are consistent with game balance and do not introduce unintended
    behavior. The method may interact with other systems like haste, slow effects,
    or spell-specific modifiers.
  warnings: Incorrectly modifying the cast time can lead to gameplay imbalance or
    unexpected behavior. Always validate input parameters and consider how changes
    might affect player experience or server performance. Be cautious when using this
    method in high-frequency spell processing scenarios.
