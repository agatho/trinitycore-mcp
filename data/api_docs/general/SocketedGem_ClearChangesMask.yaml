api:
  class: SocketedGem
  method: ClearChangesMask
  signature: void SocketedGem::ClearChangesMask()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the socketed gem, resetting its modified state
    flags.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask of a SocketedGem
    object, effectively marking the gem as no longer having any pending modifications.
    This is typically used in the context of item update systems where changes to
    socketed gems need to be tracked and communicated to clients. The method ensures
    that subsequent calls to change tracking functions will not report previously
    modified state unless new changes occur. This operation is essential for maintaining
    synchronization between server-side gem data and client-side representations.

  examples:
  - title: Clearing Changes Mask After Item Update
    code: 'SocketedGem* gem = player->GetItemByGuid(itemGuid)->GetSocketedGem(socketIndex);

      gem->ClearChangesMask();

      // Gem is now marked as clean and will not trigger update notifications'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after applying changes to a socketed gem to
    prevent unnecessary network updates. It's commonly used in conjunction with methods
    that check the changes mask to determine if an item needs to be refreshed for
    the player.
