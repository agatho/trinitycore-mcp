  brief: Returns the quantity of a specific currency tracked by the player.
  description: This method retrieves the current amount of a particular currency that
    the player is tracking. It is commonly used in conjunction with the GetCurrencyTrackedQuantity()
    method to determine how much of a specific currency the player has accumulated.
    The method returns the quantity of the specified currency, which can be useful
    for various game mechanics including quest progression, achievement tracking,
    and currency management. This method is typically used when working with currencies
    that are tracked in the player's inventory or through specific tracking mechanisms.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the quantity of the currency tracked by the player. The value represents
    the amount of the specified currency that has been accumulated by the player,
    and can be zero if no currency is being tracked.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: uint32 currencyQuantity = player->GetCurrencyTrackedQuantity(1234); // Returns
      quantity of currency ID 1234
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Player class and should be used in conjunction
    with other currency-related methods. It is typically used for tracking currencies
    that are not necessarily tied to a specific item or quest, but rather to a general
    currency type.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may return zero if no currency
    is being tracked, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about the player's
    currency status.
