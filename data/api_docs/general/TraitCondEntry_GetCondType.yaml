  signature: TraitConditionType TraitCondEntry::GetCondType() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the condition type associated with the trait condition entry.
  description: The GetCondType method returns the TraitConditionType enumeration value
    that defines the type of condition this TraitCondEntry represents. This is used
    within the World of Warcraft TrinityCore framework to determine how a specific
    trait condition should be evaluated during gameplay mechanics such as trait unlocking
    or requirement checking. The returned value indicates whether the condition is
    based on player level, reputation, achievement completion, or other game-specific
    criteria. This method does not modify any internal state and is purely a getter
    function.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A TraitConditionType enumeration value indicating the type of condition
    this entry represents. Possible values include but are not limited to: TRAIT_CONDITION_TYPE_NONE,
    TRAIT_CONDITION_TYPE_LEVEL, TRAIT_CONDITION_TYPE_REPUTATION, TRAIT_CONDITION_TYPE_ACHIEVEMENT,
    etc.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "TraitCondEntry* entry = sTraitMgr->GetTraitCondEntry(12345);\nif (entry)\n\
      {\n    TraitConditionType condType = entry->GetCondType();\n    // Use condType\
      \ to determine how to process the condition\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is const and thread-safe as it only reads from internal member
    variables. It should be called frequently during trait evaluation logic, so performance
    is not a concern for typical usage patterns.
