documentation:
  brief: Credits a monster kill to the player's quest log
  description: This method is used to register a monster kill for the player's quest
    log, typically when a player kills a specific creature that is required for a
    quest. The method updates the player's quest log with the necessary information
    to progress the quest towards completion. It is commonly used in quest scripts
    and event handling code where players need to be credited with killing specific
    monsters.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The creature entry ID of the monster that was killed, which corresponds
      to the creature template ID in the database
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the specific creature that was killed,
      used to track which instance of the creature was killed
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->KilledMonsterCredit(12345, 67890);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with quest scripts and event
    handling code. The method does not directly update the player's quest log, but
    rather marks the necessary information for the quest system to recognize that
    a monster has been killed.
  warnings: The method should only be called when the player actually kills the specified
    creature; calling it without actually killing the creature will result in incorrect
    quest progression.
