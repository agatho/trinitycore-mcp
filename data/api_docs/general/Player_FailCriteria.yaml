  brief: FailCriteria method triggers a criteria fail event for the player
  description: 'The FailCriteria method in TrinityCore''s Player class is used to
    trigger a specific criteria failure event within the game system. This method
    allows developers to simulate or force a player''s criteria progression to fail,
    which can be useful for testing or implementing game mechanics where certain conditions
    need to be met or failed. The method takes two parameters: condition and failAsset,
    which together determine the nature of the failure event.'
  parameters:
  - name: condition
    description: An integer value representing the specific criteria condition that
      is being failed. This parameter defines which criteria should fail, typically
      corresponding to a specific achievement or quest criteria.
  - name: failAsset
    description: An integer value representing the asset associated with the failure
      event. This parameter usually corresponds to a specific item, quest, or achievement
      that triggers the failure condition.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->FailCriteria(12345, 67890);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other player-related methods
    to manage criteria progression and achievement systems. It should be used carefully
    as it can affect game balance and player progression.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may cause unexpected behavior in player progression
    or achievement systems, potentially leading to game imbalance or player frustration.
