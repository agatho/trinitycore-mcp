documentation:
  brief: Handles the casting and management of the Healing Stream Totem spell for
    a shaman AI.
  description: The HandleHealingStreamTotem method is responsible for managing the
    behavior of the Healing Stream Totem ability within the ShamanAI class. This method
    determines whether the totem should be cast, updated, or removed based on various
    conditions such as target health, mana availability, and totem placement rules.
    It integrates with the shaman's AI decision-making process to ensure optimal use
    of the totem for healing purposes. The method returns true if the totem was successfully
    handled (cast or updated), and false otherwise, indicating that no action was
    taken or an error occurred during execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Healing Stream Totem was successfully cast or updated;
    returns false if no action was taken or if an error occurred during processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "if (shamanAI->HandleHealingStreamTotem()) {\n    // Totem is active or\
      \ has been cast\n    // Perform additional actions as needed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the shaman's target selection logic and
    mana management system to determine when and where to place the Healing Stream
    Totem. It may also consider the presence of other totems or environmental factors
    affecting totem placement.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called repeatedly in tight loops without
    proper cooldown checks, as it could lead to performance issues or unintended behavior
    due to excessive totem casting.
