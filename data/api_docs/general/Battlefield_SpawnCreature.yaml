  class: Battlefield
  method: SpawnCreature
  signature: Creature * Battlefield::SpawnCreature(int entry, const Position & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Spawns a creature with the specified entry ID at the given position within
    the battlefield.
  description: The SpawnCreature method creates and spawns a new Creature object within
    the Battlefield environment at the specified location. This method is typically
    used during battlefield initialization or dynamic event handling to add NPCs or
    game entities to the battlefield. The creature will be associated with the battlefield's
    instance and will follow standard creature behavior patterns including AI, respawning,
    and interaction with players. The method returns a pointer to the newly created
    Creature object which can be used for further manipulation or reference.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The creature entry ID that defines what type of creature to spawn.
      This corresponds to the creature_template.entry field in the database.
  - name: pos
    description: The Position structure specifying the x, y, z coordinates and orientation
      where the creature should be spawned.
  returns: A pointer to the newly created Creature object if successful, or nullptr
    if the spawn operation failed due to invalid parameters or resource constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Creature Spawn
    code: "Creature* npc = battlefield->SpawnCreature(12345, Position(100.0f, 200.0f,\
      \ 30.0f, 0.0f));\nif (npc)\n{\n    // Successfully spawned creature\n    npc->SetFaction(14);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Spawn Multiple Creatures in Loop
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)\n{\n    Position spawnPos;\n    spawnPos.Relocate(100.0f\
      \ + i * 10.0f, 200.0f, 30.0f, 0.0f);\n    Creature* mob = battlefield->SpawnCreature(12346,\
      \ spawnPos);\n    if (mob)\n        mob->SetUInt32Value(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS, UNIT_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method creates a creature that is bound to the battlefield's instance.
    The creature will automatically be removed when the battlefield ends or is destroyed.
    Ensure that the entry ID corresponds to a valid creature template in the database,
    otherwise the spawn may fail silently. The Position object should contain valid
    coordinates within the battlefield boundaries.
  warnings: Do not call this method from within a creature's AI update loop as it
    might cause stack overflow or undefined behavior. Avoid spawning too many creatures
    simultaneously which could lead to performance degradation or memory issues. Always
    check for null return values before using the returned Creature pointer.
