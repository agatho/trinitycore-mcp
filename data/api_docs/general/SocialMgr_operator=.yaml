documentation:
  brief: Moves ownership of a SocialMgr object to another SocialMgr instance.
  description: The move assignment operator transfers all resources and state from
    the source SocialMgr object to the target SocialMgr object. This operation is
    typically used when reassigning a SocialMgr instance to another, allowing for
    efficient resource management without copying data. The source object is left
    in a valid but unspecified state after the move operation. In the context of TrinityCore's
    social system, this method would be used to transfer social list data, friend
    lists, ignore lists, and other related social information between SocialMgr instances.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the target SocialMgr object, allowing for chaining of assignment
    operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'SocialMgr manager1;

      SocialMgr manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Move manager1''s resources to manager2

      // manager1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Move Assignment
    code: 'SocialMgr mgrA, mgrB, mgrC;

      mgrA = std::move(mgrB); // Move mgrB to mgrA

      mgrA = std::move(mgrC); // Move mgrC to mgrA (previous contents of mgrA are
      discarded)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically used in scenarios where a SocialMgr object needs
    to be reassigned or replaced with another instance's data. The move operation
    is more efficient than copy operations as it transfers ownership rather than duplicating
    data. After the move, the source object should not be used unless reinitialized.
  warnings: After a move assignment, the source object is left in a valid but unspecified
    state. Using the source object afterward may lead to undefined behavior or unexpected
    results. Ensure that no further operations are performed on the moved-from object
    unless it's explicitly reassigned.
