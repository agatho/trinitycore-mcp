  class: FormationUtils
  method: IsTerrainSuitableForFormation
  signature: bool FormationUtils::IsTerrainSuitableForFormation(FormationType formation,
    const int & location, float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the specified terrain location is suitable for placing a formation
    of the given type within the provided radius.
  description: The IsTerrainSuitableForFormation method evaluates whether a particular
    location in the game world is appropriate for deploying a specific formation type,
    such as a group of NPCs or players. It considers factors like terrain type, obstacles,
    and spatial constraints within the specified radius. This method is typically
    used during AI decision-making processes to ensure that formations are placed
    in valid and effective locations. The method performs checks on the navigability
    and suitability of the area around the given location, ensuring that it can accommodate
    the formation without conflicts or invalid placements.
  parameters:
  - name: formation
    description: The type of formation to evaluate for placement. This parameter specifies
      the formation configuration (e.g., line, circle, wedge) that will be checked
      for suitability at the given location.
  - name: location
    description: The identifier or reference point for the terrain location being
      evaluated. This could represent a specific zone, grid cell, or coordinate-based
      reference used to determine if it's suitable for the formation.
  - name: radius
    description: The radius in which the suitability of terrain is checked around
      the specified location. This defines the area of influence for the evaluation,
      ensuring that the entire space within this radius is considered for placement.
  returns: Returns true if the terrain at the given location is suitable for placing
    the specified formation type within the provided radius; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (FormationUtils::IsTerrainSuitableForFormation(FormationType::LINE,\
      \ 12345, 10.0f)) {\n    // Proceed with formation placement\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple Checks
    code: "bool isSuitable = FormationUtils::IsTerrainSuitableForFormation(FormationType::CIRCLE,\
      \ player->GetMapId(), 25.0f);\nif (isSuitable) {\n    // Attempt to form a circle\
      \ around the player\n    // Additional logic for formation setup\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform expensive terrain checks and should not be called
    frequently in performance-critical sections. It is recommended to cache results
    when possible, especially for static formations or locations that do not change
    often.
  warnings: Ensure that the location parameter refers to a valid and accessible area
    in the game world; invalid or out-of-bounds locations may lead to unexpected behavior
    or errors during evaluation.
