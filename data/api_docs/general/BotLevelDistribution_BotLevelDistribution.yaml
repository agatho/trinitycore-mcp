documentation:
  brief: Initializes a BotLevelDistribution object by copying data from another BotLevelDistribution
    instance.
  description: The BotLevelDistribution constructor initializes a new instance of
    the BotLevelDistribution class by performing a deep copy of all member variables
    from the provided source object. This method ensures that the newly created object
    has identical state and configuration as the original, which is essential for
    maintaining consistency in bot behavior distribution across different game scenarios.
    The constructor likely handles memory management for dynamic data structures and
    ensures proper initialization of internal collections or mappings used to determine
    how bots are distributed across various levels within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotLevelDistribution object from which to copy all member
      data and configuration settings.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Constructor Usage
    code: 'BotLevelDistribution originalDistribution;

      // ... initialize originalDistribution ...

      BotLevelDistribution newDistribution(originalDistribution); // Copy constructor
      usage'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a copy constructor, so it performs a deep copy of all internal data
    structures. Developers should be aware that any dynamic memory allocations within
    the source object will be duplicated in the new instance, which may have performance
    implications for large datasets.
