  class: ResourceMonitor
  method: CalculateAverage
  signature: float ResourceMonitor::CalculateAverage(const int & window) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the average resource usage over a specified time window.
  description: The CalculateAverage method computes the average resource consumption
    (such as CPU or memory) over a defined time period. This method is typically used
    by the ResourceMonitor class to track system performance and detect potential
    bottlenecks in the TrinityCore server. The window parameter determines how many
    samples are considered in the average calculation, allowing for flexible monitoring
    of resource trends. The method may be called periodically to gather performance
    metrics or during diagnostic operations.
  parameters:
  - name: window
    description: The number of time intervals or samples to include in the average
      calculation. This value defines the historical range over which the average
      is computed, with larger values providing smoother but less responsive averages.
  returns: A float representing the calculated average resource usage over the specified
    window. The exact unit depends on the monitored resource type (e.g., percentage
    for CPU usage or bytes for memory). Returns zero if no data is available or if
    the window size is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float avgCpu = resourceMonitor.CalculateAverage(10);

      // Calculates average CPU usage over the last 10 time intervals'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring
    code: "ResourceMonitor monitor;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i)\n{\n    float avg\
      \ = monitor.CalculateAverage(50);\n    // Log or display the average resource\
      \ usage\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely maintains internal buffers or counters to track resource
    samples. It's designed for periodic calls rather than real-time measurements,
    and performance may degrade with very large window sizes due to increased memory
    usage and computation time.
  warnings: Calling this method with a window size of zero or negative values may
    result in undefined behavior or division by zero errors. Ensure that the ResourceMonitor
    instance is properly initialized before calling this method.
