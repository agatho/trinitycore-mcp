  class: PathfindingManager
  method: GetTerrainSlope
  signature: float PathfindingManager::GetTerrainSlope(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the terrain slope at the specified position.
  description: The GetTerrainSlope method computes the slope of the terrain at a given
    position in the game world. This is typically used for pathfinding algorithms
    to determine how steep a surface is, which affects movement behavior and AI decision-making.
    The method likely uses heightmap data or collision detection to calculate the
    angle of inclination at the specified point. It's an essential utility for ensuring
    that NPCs and players navigate terrain realistically, avoiding impossible slopes
    or calculating movement costs based on elevation changes.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position identifier or index used to query terrain slope data.
      This parameter likely represents a specific location in the game world's coordinate
      system, possibly encoded as an integer index or a unique identifier for a terrain
      tile or point.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the terrain slope at the specified position.
    The value typically indicates the angle of inclination in degrees or radians,
    where 0.0 represents flat ground and higher values indicate steeper inclines.
    Negative values may represent declines or slopes in the opposite direction depending
    on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Pathfinding
    code: "float slope = pathfindingManager->GetTerrainSlope(12345);\nif (slope >\
      \ 45.0f) {\n    // Avoid steep terrain for this NPC\n    // Implement alternative\
      \ pathing logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Slope Data in Movement Logic
    code: "float currentSlope = pathfindingManager->GetTerrainSlope(playerPosition);\n\
      if (currentSlope > 30.0f) {\n    // Reduce movement speed or prevent climbing\n\
      \    player->SetSpeed(MOVE_RUN, 0.5f);\n} else if (currentSlope < -10.0f) {\n\
      \    // Allow faster descent\n    player->SetSpeed(MOVE_RUN, 1.5f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely optimized for frequent calls during pathfinding calculations
    and may cache results to improve performance. The exact implementation details
    depend on how positions are mapped to terrain data in the TrinityCore engine.
    Developers should be aware that terrain slope values can vary significantly based
    on the resolution of heightmaps used by the game world.
  warnings: Ensure that the position parameter is valid and within the bounds of loaded
    terrain data, as invalid positions may result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    slope calculations. This method might not be thread-safe if multiple threads access
    shared terrain data simultaneously.
