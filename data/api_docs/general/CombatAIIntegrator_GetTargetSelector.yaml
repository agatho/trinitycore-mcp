  method: GetTargetSelector
  signature: TargetSelector * CombatAIIntegrator::GetTargetSelector() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the target selector object used by the CombatAIIntegrator for choosing
    combat targets.
  description: The GetTargetSelector method returns a pointer to the TargetSelector
    instance that is currently associated with the CombatAIIntegrator. This target
    selector is responsible for determining which unit should be targeted during combat
    situations. The returned pointer is typically used internally by the AI system
    to make decisions about enemy targeting, but may also be accessed by external
    systems for debugging or custom AI logic. The method does not create or manage
    the lifetime of the TargetSelector object; it simply provides access to an existing
    instance that was likely initialized during the CombatAIIntegrator's construction
    or setup phase.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the TargetSelector object used by this CombatAIIntegrator
    instance. Returns nullptr if no target selector has been assigned or if the integrator
    is in an invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "TargetSelector* selector = combatAIIntegrator->GetTargetSelector();\nif\
      \ (selector != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the target selector for custom targeting\
      \ logic\n    Unit* target = selector->SelectTarget();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Debugging Target Selection
    code: "CombatAIIntegrator* ai = creature->GetAI()->ToCombatAIIntegrator();\nif\
      \ (ai)\n{\n    TargetSelector* ts = ai->GetTargetSelector();\n    if (ts)\n\
      \    {\n        // Log current target selection logic\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Using target selector: %p\", ts);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides read-only access to the internal target selector. The
    returned pointer should not be deleted or modified directly as it is managed by
    the CombatAIIntegrator instance. The target selector may be null if the AI has
    not been properly initialized or configured.
  warnings: Calling this method on a CombatAIIntegrator that has not been fully constructed
    or initialized may return a null pointer. Always check for null before using the
    returned pointer to avoid segmentation faults.
