documentation:
  brief: Initializes the centroids used in behavior clustering for AI decision making.
  description: The InitializeCentroids method sets up the initial centroid positions
    for a behavior clustering algorithm, typically used in NPC AI to group similar
    behaviors or actions. This method prepares the data structures needed for clustering
    operations by assigning initial values to the centroid coordinates based on predefined
    criteria or random selection. It is usually called during the initialization phase
    of an AI behavior system before any clustering iterations begin. The centroids
    represent prototype behaviors that the system will use to classify and assign
    similar actions to groups.

  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'BehaviorCluster cluster;

      class InitializeCentroids();

      // Initializes centroids for behavior clustering

      cluster.InitializeCentroids();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization of a BehaviorCluster
    instance. Reinitializing centroids after they have been used in clustering operations
    may lead to inconsistent results. The implementation likely involves setting up
    internal data structures such as arrays or vectors to store centroid coordinates.
