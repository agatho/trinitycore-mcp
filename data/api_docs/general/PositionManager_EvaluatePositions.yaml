  class: PositionManager
  method: EvaluatePositions
  signature: int PositionManager::EvaluatePositions(const int & positions, const MovementContext
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and processes a set of positions based on movement context for
    pathfinding or positioning logic.
  description: The EvaluatePositions method is responsible for analyzing a collection
    of positional data within the context of a movement scenario. It typically handles
    validation, transformation, or decision-making related to position data used in
    AI behavior, pathfinding, or object placement. This method may be invoked during
    NPC movement calculations, player positioning checks, or other game mechanics
    requiring spatial awareness. The method operates on input positions and applies
    logic based on the provided MovementContext, which contains relevant environmental
    or situational data. It returns an integer status code indicating success, failure,
    or specific evaluation outcomes.
  parameters:
  - name: positions
    description: A reference to an integer representing a collection or identifier
      of positions to be evaluated. This could represent a bitmask, index, or handle
      to a set of positional data within the system.
  - name: context
    description: A constant reference to a MovementContext object that provides contextual
      information such as movement type, environment constraints, or target locations
      relevant to how positions should be interpreted or processed.
  returns: 'Returns an integer value indicating the result of the evaluation process.
    Possible values may include: 0 for success, negative values for errors (e.g.,
    invalid input), and positive values for specific outcomes such as number of valid
    positions found or status flags.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int result = positionManager.EvaluatePositions(positions, movementContext);\n\
      if (result >= 0) {\n    // Process successful evaluation\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ error case\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Context
    code: 'MovementContext context;

      context.movementType = MovementType::RUNNING;

      context.targetPosition = {100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f};

      int result = positionManager.EvaluatePositions(42, context);

      // Use result to determine next action in AI logic'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger positioning or navigation system and
    may interact with internal data structures like path grids or spatial partitioning
    systems. It's recommended to ensure that the input positions are valid before
    calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Improper handling of the positions parameter (e.g., passing invalid indices
    or corrupted data) can lead to incorrect evaluations or crashes. Always validate
    inputs and check return codes for error conditions.
