  class: SpellScriptBase
  method: _Validate
  signature: bool SpellScriptBase::_Validate(const SpellInfo * entry)
documentation:
  brief: Validates a spell entry against the SpellScriptBase requirements
  description: The _Validate method checks whether a given SpellInfo entry is compatible
    with the SpellScriptBase implementation. It ensures that the spell meets all necessary
    criteria for the script to be properly executed, such as verifying that the spell
    has valid effects, required flags, or other conditions needed by the specific
    spell script. This validation typically occurs during spell loading or initialization
    phases to prevent invalid spell scripts from being registered or executed in the
    game world.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure representing the spell to be validated.
      Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the spell entry passes all validation checks, false otherwise.
    A return value of false indicates that the spell is incompatible with this spell
    script implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "bool isValid = spellScript->_Validate(spellInfo);\nif (!isValid)\n{\n \
      \   // Handle invalid spell entry\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid spell for script:\
      \ %u\", spellInfo->Id);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Loading
    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScriptBase\n{\npublic:\n    bool _Validate(const\
      \ SpellInfo* entry) override\n    {\n        // Only allow spells with a specific\
      \ spell effect\n        if (entry->Effects[0].Effect != SPELL_EFFECT_SCHOOL_DAMAGE)\n\
      \            return false;\n        \n        // Ensure the spell has a valid\
      \ target\n        if (entry->Targets & TARGET_FLAG_UNIT_ENEMY)\n           \
      \ return true;\n        \n        return false;\n    }\n};"

  notes: This method is typically called during spell script registration or initialization.
    It's important to note that the validation logic should be lightweight and not
    perform heavy computations, as it may be called frequently during server startup
    or spell loading.
  warnings: Do not assume that a valid SpellInfo entry will always pass validation.
    The implementation of this method must account for all possible spell configurations
    that could be loaded from database files or scripted spells.
