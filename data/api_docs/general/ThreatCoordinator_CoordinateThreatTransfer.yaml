  method: CoordinateThreatTransfer
  signature: bool ThreatCoordinator::CoordinateThreatTransfer(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates threat transfer between units in the threat coordinator system.
  description: The CoordinateThreatTransfer method manages the redistribution of threat
    from one unit to another within the ThreatCoordinator framework. This method is
    typically invoked when a unit's threat level needs to be transferred or adjusted,
    such as during mob targeting changes, spell effects, or combat mechanics that
    alter aggro distribution. It ensures proper synchronization of threat data across
    related units and maintains the integrity of the threat management system. The
    method performs internal checks to validate the threat transfer operation and
    returns a boolean indicating success or failure of the coordination process.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the threat transfer coordination was successfully processed
    and applied, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate invalid input
    parameters, failed internal validation, or inability to perform the requested
    threat redistribution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Transfer Coordination
    code: "if (threatCoordinator->CoordinateThreatTransfer(targetUnit)) {\n    //\
      \ Threat transfer was coordinated successfully\n    targetUnit->AddThreat(sourceUnit,\
      \ 100.0f);\n} else {\n    // Handle failed threat coordination\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to coordinate threat transfer for unit %u\", targetUnit->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal threat management system and should typically
    be called automatically by the core combat mechanics rather than directly by external
    code. The method may perform locking operations internally to ensure thread safety
    during concurrent threat updates.
  warnings: Calling this method directly without proper context may lead to inconsistent
    threat states or unexpected behavior in combat systems. Ensure that all involved
    units are valid and in combat before invoking this method.
