  class: TradeStatistics
  method: GetSuccessRate
  signature: float TradeStatistics::GetSuccessRate() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the success rate percentage of trade transactions
    within the TradeStatistics class.
  description: The GetSuccessRate method computes the overall success rate of trade
    operations tracked by the TradeStatistics instance. It typically calculates this
    rate as a ratio of successful trades to total attempted trades, expressed as a
    floating-point value between 0 and 100. This metric is useful for monitoring trading
    performance, identifying trends in player commerce, or evaluating the effectiveness
    of trade-related systems within the game. The method does not modify any internal
    state and is read-only. It assumes that the TradeStatistics object has been properly
    initialized with valid trade data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the success rate percentage of trades. A return
    value of 0.0 indicates no successful trades, while a value of 100.0 indicates
    all trades were successful. Values between 0 and 100 represent the proportion
    of successful trades out of total attempts.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Display Trade Success Rate
    code: 'TradeStatistics stats;

      // ... populate stats with trade data ...

      float successRate = stats.GetSuccessRate();

      printf("Trade Success Rate: %.2f%%\n", successRate);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Success Rate in Performance Monitoring
    code: "void MonitorTradePerformance(TradeStatistics& stats) {\n    float rate\
      \ = stats.GetSuccessRate();\n    if (rate < 75.0f) {\n        // Log warning\
      \ for low trade success rate\n        sLog->outString(\"Warning: Low trade success\
      \ rate detected (%.2f%%)\", rate);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be efficient and should not cause performance
    bottlenecks during regular gameplay or logging operations. It is thread-safe as
    long as the underlying trade data remains consistent during execution.
  warnings: Ensure that the TradeStatistics object contains valid trade data before
    calling this method, otherwise the result may be misleading or incorrect. The
    method assumes all internal counters are properly maintained and updated.
