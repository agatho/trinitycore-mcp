  signature: float Unit::GetHealthPct() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the health percentage of the unit relative to its maximum health.
  description: The GetHealthPct method calculates and returns the current health of
    a Unit as a percentage of its maximum health. This value is commonly used in game
    mechanics for determining unit status, such as whether a creature or player is
    at full health, half health, or critically low health. The method provides a normalized
    representation that simplifies comparisons and calculations in various gameplay
    scenarios. It is particularly useful for determining health-based behavior in
    AI scripts, combat systems, and health bar displays.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the current health percentage of the
    unit. This value ranges from 0.0f to 100.0f, where 0.0f indicates the unit is
    at 0% health (dead) and 100.0f indicates the unit is at full health.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "float healthPct = unit->GetHealthPct();\nif (healthPct < 50.0f)\n{\n  \
      \  // Unit is below half health\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Health-based AI decision making
    code: "Unit* target = unit->GetVictim();\nfloat healthPct = target->GetHealthPct();\n\
      if (healthPct <= 25.0f)\n{\n    // Trigger special abilities when target is\
      \ critically low\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and does not require any synchronization. It directly
    accesses the unit's current health value without performing any calculations or
    conversions, making it efficient for frequent use in game logic. The returned
    value is calculated using a simple division of current health by maximum health,
    which means it will always be a floating-point number between 0.0f and 100.0f.
  warnings: This method returns 0.0f when the unit's current health is zero, indicating
    the unit is dead or has no health points remaining. Be cautious when using this
    value in conditional logic as it may lead to unexpected behavior if not properly
    handled. Also, be aware that for units with different health types (e.g., mana,
    power), this method only returns health percentage and not other resource percentages.
