  method: ~BotCharacterDistribution
  signature: void BotCharacterDistribution::~BotCharacterDistribution()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BotCharacterDistribution instance and releases all associated
    resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotCharacterDistribution class is responsible
    for cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the object's lifetime. This method ensures proper resource deallocation when an
    instance of BotCharacterDistribution goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    In the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this class likely manages character
    distribution logic for AI-controlled players, and its destructor handles cleanup
    of internal data structures related to bot character assignment and management.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of BotCharacterDistribution instance
    code: 'BotCharacterDistribution* distribution = new BotCharacterDistribution();

      // ... use the distribution object ...

      delete distribution; // Triggers ~BotCharacterDistribution()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope
    or is deleted. Developers should not manually call this method unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. The class likely contains internal containers
    or pointers that need proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks.
