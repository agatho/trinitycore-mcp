  signature: void PlayerbotGroupScript::OnInviteMember(Group * group, int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a player is invited to join a group
  description: The OnInviteMember method is invoked when a player is invited to join
    a group within the TrinityCore framework. This method serves as a hook for custom
    bot logic or modifications to group invitation behavior. It allows developers
    to intercept and modify how invitations are processed, potentially altering the
    group composition or triggering additional actions upon invitation. The method
    is typically used in playerbot scripts to customize bot behavior when joining
    groups.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group the player is
      being invited to join. This parameter provides access to group members, leader
      information, and other group-related data.
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player being invited to
      the group. This value uniquely identifies the player within the game world and
      can be used to retrieve player-specific data or perform operations on the invited
      player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic implementation example
    code: "void MyPlayerbotScript::OnInviteMember(Group* group, int guid)\n{\n   \
      \ // Log that a player was invited to a group\n    sLog->outString(\"Player\
      \ with GUID %u was invited to group.\", guid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced example with group data access
    code: "void MyPlayerbotScript::OnInviteMember(Group* group, int guid)\n{\n   \
      \ // Check if the group is full\n    if (group->GetMembersCount() >= MAX_GROUP_SIZE)\n\
      \    {\n        // Reject invitation if group is full\n        return;\n   \
      \ }\n    \n    // Get player name from GUID\n    Player* invitedPlayer = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player,\
      \ guid));\n    if (invitedPlayer)\n    {\n        // Send a custom message to\
      \ the invited player\n        invitedPlayer->GetSession()->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      You have been invited to join a group!\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PlayerbotGroupScript class and is intended for
    use in custom playerbot AI implementations. The group parameter may be null if
    the invitation fails or the group has not yet been properly initialized. Developers
    should ensure that any modifications to group state are thread-safe, as this method
    may be called from different threads depending on the game context.
  warnings: Be cautious when modifying group state within this callback, as it may
    lead to inconsistent group behavior or crashes if not handled properly. Avoid
    performing long-running operations in this method as it can block group invitation
    processing. Also, ensure that the GUID parameter is valid before attempting to
    access player data using it.
