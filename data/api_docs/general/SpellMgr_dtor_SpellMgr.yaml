documentation:
  brief: Destroys the SpellMgr instance and cleans up all associated spell data and
    resources.
  description: The SpellMgr destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up all
    memory and resources allocated during the lifetime of the SpellMgr singleton.
    This includes releasing references to spell templates, spell definitions, and
    any cached spell data that may have been loaded from database or configuration
    files. The destructor ensures that no memory leaks occur when the game shuts down
    or when the spell manager is explicitly destroyed. This method is automatically
    called by the C++ runtime when the SpellMgr singleton instance goes out of scope
    or is deleted.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of SpellMgr
    code: '// The destructor is automatically called when the SpellMgr singleton is
      destroyed

      // This typically happens during server shutdown

      SpellMgr* spellMgr = SpellMgr::Instance();

      // ... use spellMgr ...

      // When spellMgr goes out of scope or is deleted, ~SpellMgr() is called automatically'
    language: cpp
  notes: The SpellMgr destructor should not be called manually as it's a singleton
    instance. The destruction happens automatically when the application shuts down
    or when the singleton is explicitly destroyed by the TrinityCore framework. This
    method ensures proper cleanup of all spell-related resources and prevents memory
    leaks.
