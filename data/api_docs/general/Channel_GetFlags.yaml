  method: GetFlags
  signature: uint8 Channel::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the flags associated with the channel.
  description: The GetFlags method retrieves the current flag state of a channel,
    which determines various channel behaviors and permissions. These flags control
    aspects such as whether the channel is moderated, invite-only, or persistent.
    The returned value is a bitmask representing all active flags for the channel.
    This method is commonly used to check channel settings before performing operations
    that depend on specific channel states.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the bitmask of active channel flags. Each bit
    in the returned value corresponds to a specific channel property or permission
    setting, such as moderation status, invite-only status, or persistent channel
    state.
  examples:
  - title: Check if channel is moderated
    code: "Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"General\", player);\nif (channel\
      \ && (channel->GetFlags() & CHANNEL_FLAG_MODERATED))\n{\n    // Channel is currently\
      \ moderated\n    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"This channel\
      \ is moderated.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine channel permissions
    code: "Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"Trade\", player);\nuint8 flags\
      \ = channel->GetFlags();\nif (flags & CHANNEL_FLAG_INVITE_ONLY)\n{\n    // Channel\
      \ is invite-only\n}\nelse if (flags & CHANNEL_FLAG_MODERATED)\n{\n    // Channel\
      \ is moderated\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Channel has default permissions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flag values are defined by the CHANNEL_FLAG_* constants in TrinityCore's
    source code. The method performs no locking operations, so it should be used carefully
    in multi-threaded contexts where channel flags might change during execution.
    The returned value is a snapshot of the flags at the time of the call.
  warnings: The returned flag value is a bitmask that may contain multiple active
    bits. Always use bitwise operations (e.g., & operator) to check for specific flag
    states rather than direct equality comparisons. Be aware that channel flags can
    change dynamically, so the return value might be stale if used outside of immediate
    context.
