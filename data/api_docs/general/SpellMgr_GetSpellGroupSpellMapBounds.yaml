documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the range of spell entries associated with a specified spell group.
  description: The GetSpellGroupSpellMapBounds method returns a bounds object that
    defines the start and end iterators for all spells belonging to a given spell
    group. This allows iteration over all spells within a specific group, which is
    commonly used for spell linking, group-based spell effects, or managing interdependent
    spells. The returned SpellGroupSpellMapBounds object can be used directly with
    STL-style range-based loops or iterator operations to access the underlying spell
    data. This method does not modify any internal state and is safe for concurrent
    read access.
  parameters: []
  returns: A SpellGroupSpellMapBounds object containing the lower and upper bounds
    of spell entries in the specified spell group. This structure typically holds
    two iterators that define a range, allowing efficient traversal of all spells
    associated with the given SpellGroup identifier.
  examples:
  - title: Iterating Through Spells in a Group
    code: "SpellGroupSpellMapBounds bounds = sSpellMgr->GetSpellGroupSpellMapBounds(SPELL_GROUP_FIREBALL);\n\
      for (auto itr = bounds.first; itr != bounds.second; ++itr)\n{\n    uint32 spellId\
      \ = itr->first;\n    // Process each spell in the group\n    printf(\"Found\
      \ spell ID: %u\\n\", spellId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal data structures that map spell groups to individual
    spells. The underlying map is typically populated during server startup from SQL
    database entries in the spell_group table. Performance is generally good as it's
    a simple lookup operation, but repeated calls within tight loops should be avoided
    if possible.
