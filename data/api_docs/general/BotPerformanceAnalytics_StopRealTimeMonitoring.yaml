documentation:
  brief: Stops real-time performance monitoring for bot analytics.
  description: The StopRealTimeMonitoring method halts the ongoing collection and
    processing of real-time performance data for bot analytics within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method is typically invoked when a bot's performance tracking
    needs to be paused or terminated, allowing for clean resource management and preventing
    unnecessary CPU overhead during inactive periods. It ensures that monitoring systems
    are properly shut down without leaving dangling references or active threads running
    in the background.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      analytics.StopRealTimeMonitoring();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after a corresponding StartRealTimeMonitoring()
    call to ensure proper state management. It is recommended to check if monitoring
    is currently active before invoking this function to avoid potential errors or
    undefined behavior.
