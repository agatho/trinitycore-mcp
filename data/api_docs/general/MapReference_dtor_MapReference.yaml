documentation:
  brief: Destroys a MapReference object and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ~MapReference destructor is responsible for cleaning up the memory
    and resources associated with a MapReference instance. In the context of TrinityCore's
    map management system, this destructor ensures that references to maps are properly
    removed from internal tracking structures, preventing memory leaks and maintaining
    data integrity. It typically handles cleanup tasks such as removing the reference
    from linked lists or other container structures that manage active map references.
    The destructor is automatically invoked when a MapReference object goes out of
    scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of MapReference
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    MapReference ref;\n    // ... use ref ...\n\
      \    // ref is automatically destroyed here when going out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of MapReference
    code: 'MapReference* ref = new MapReference();

      // ... use ref ...

      delete ref; // Triggers the destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is part of the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
    pattern, ensuring automatic cleanup. It's important to note that MapReference
    objects should not be manually deleted if they are managed by containers or other
    reference-counting systems, as this could lead to double-free errors.
  warnings: Never manually delete a MapReference object if it's managed by another
    system (like a container). Doing so may cause undefined behavior or crashes. The
    destructor assumes the reference is valid and properly initialized before destruction.
