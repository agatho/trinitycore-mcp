  brief: Initializes a new RecipeInfo object with default values
  description: The RecipeInfo constructor initializes a new instance of the RecipeInfo
    class, setting up internal data structures and member variables to their default
    states. This method is typically called when creating a new recipe information
    object, either for storing recipe details or as part of a larger system that manages
    crafting recipes within the TrinityCore framework. The initialization ensures
    that all fields are properly configured before any recipe data is populated or
    accessed.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new RecipeInfo instance
    code: 'RecipeInfo recipe;

      // The recipe object is now initialized with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically not called directly by developers, as RecipeInfo
    objects are usually created through factory methods or when loading recipe data
    from the database. The initialization process may involve setting up internal
    containers for storing recipe components, required skills, and other crafting
    parameters.
