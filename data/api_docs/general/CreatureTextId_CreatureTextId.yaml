  class: CreatureTextId
  method: CreatureTextId
  signature: void CreatureTextId::CreatureTextId(uint32 e, uint32 g, uint32 i)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a CreatureTextId object with entity, group, and id values.
  description: The CreatureTextId constructor initializes a creature text identifier
    with three integer parameters representing the entity ID, group ID, and text ID.
    This class is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to manage and
    reference specific creature text lines within the game's dialogue system. The
    initialization sets up internal state that allows for proper identification and
    retrieval of creature-specific text entries during NPC interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: e
    description: Entity ID representing the creature or game object that owns the
      text. This is typically a unique identifier from the creature_template table.
  - name: g
    description: Group ID defining a group of related text lines. Used to organize
      multiple text entries for the same creature or NPC.
  - name: i
    description: Text ID specifying the individual text line within a group. Each
      unique combination of (e, g, i) represents a distinct creature text entry.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic CreatureTextId Initialization
    code: 'CreatureTextId textId(12345, 0, 1);

      // Creates a text identifier for entity 12345, group 0, text line 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using CreatureTextId in NPC Dialogue System
    code: "void HandleCreatureText(uint32 creatureEntry, uint32 groupId, uint32 textId)\n\
      {\n    CreatureTextId textKey(creatureEntry, groupId, textId);\n    // Use textKey\
      \ to retrieve or manage creature text entries\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by TrinityCore's creature text
    management system. The parameter values should correspond to valid entries in
    the creature_text table of the database. The class likely implements comparison
    operators for use in containers like std::map or std::set.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values may lead to invalid text lookups during NPC
    interactions. Ensure that entity, group, and text IDs match existing database
    entries to avoid runtime errors.
