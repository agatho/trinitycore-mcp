documentation:
  brief: Updates the map iterator to the back of the player list.
  description: This method updates the map's iterator to point to the last player
    in the map's player list. It is used to ensure that the iterator reflects the
    current state of players within the map, particularly when dealing with dynamic
    player lists or when iterating through players in reverse order. The method typically
    involves updating internal iterator pointers to maintain consistency with the
    actual player list structure.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Map map;

      Player* player = new Player();

      map.UpdateIteratorBack(player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other iterator management
    methods to maintain proper synchronization between the iterator and actual player
    list. It may be called during map updates or when players are added/removed from
    the map.
