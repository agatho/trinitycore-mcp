documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a summoned creature dies within the AI system
  description: The SummonedCreatureDies method is invoked by the CreatureAI system
    when a creature that was summoned by the current AI-controlled creature has died.
    This method allows custom AI implementations to react to the death of summoned
    units, such as triggering specific behaviors, resetting summon timers, or adjusting
    combat strategies. The method provides access to both the dead summoned creature
    and potentially associated data through its parameters. It is part of the standard
    CreatureAI event handling mechanism for managing summoned minions in World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore emulation.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that has died. This represents the
      summoned creature whose death triggered this callback.
  - name: param1
    description: Pointer to an integer value that may represent summoning data or
      state information associated with the summoned creature. The exact meaning depends
      on implementation context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "void BossAI::SummonedCreatureDies(Creature* summon, int* data)\n{\n   \
      \ // Reset summon timer when a summoned minion dies\n    if (summon->GetEntry()\
      \ == NPC_SUMMONED_MINION)\n    {\n        _summonTimer = 10000; // Reset to\
      \ 10 seconds\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Behavior with Data Handling
    code: "void ShadowLordAI::SummonedCreatureDies(Creature* summon, int* data)\n\
      {\n    if (data && *data == SUMMON_TYPE_BLOOD_ELVES)\n    {\n        // Special\
      \ behavior for blood elf summons\n        DoCast(SPELL_ENRAGE);\n    }\n   \
      \ else\n    {\n        // Default behavior\n        Talk(SAY_SUMMON_DIES);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the core AI system when a summoned
    creature's death event is processed. Developers should be aware that the 'data'
    parameter may contain implementation-specific information and should validate
    its contents before use. The method does not handle the actual destruction of
    the creature object; it only provides notification.
  warnings: Ensure that any pointers passed to this method are valid and not null,
    as dereferencing invalid pointers will cause crashes. Be cautious when modifying
    AI state or summoning new creatures within this callback to avoid recursion or
    infinite loops.
