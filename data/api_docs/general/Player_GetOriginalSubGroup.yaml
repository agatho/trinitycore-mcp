  class: Player
  method: GetOriginalSubGroup
  signature: uint8 Player::GetOriginalSubGroup() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the original subgroup index that the player was assigned to before
    any group modifications.
  description: This method retrieves the original subgroup assignment of a player
    within a group, which is typically used to track the player's initial position
    in the raid or party structure. The returned value represents the subgroup number
    (0-8) that the player originally belonged to before any changes were made to their
    group assignment. This is particularly useful for tracking player roles and positions
    during raids, especially when players are moved between subgroups during encounters.
    The method is commonly used in conjunction with other group management functions
    to maintain proper group structure and ensure correct positioning during raid
    encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the original subgroup index (0-8) that the player was assigned
    to originally, or 0 if the player is not in a group. The value represents the
    subgroup number where 0 indicates no subgroup assignment, while values 1-8 represent
    different subgroups within a raid or party.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint8 originalSubGroup = player->GetOriginalSubGroup();\nif (originalSubGroup\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Player was originally in subgroup 1-8\n    // This can be\
      \ used to determine player's role or position\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Raid Position Tracking Example
    code: "uint8 originalSubGroup = player->GetOriginalSubGroup();\nuint8 currentSubGroup\
      \ = player->GetSubGroup();\nif (originalSubGroup != currentSubGroup)\n{\n  \
      \  // Player has been moved from original subgroup\n    // This helps track\
      \ player movement during raid encounters\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with group management functions
    to maintain proper raid structure. It's important to note that this value only
    reflects the original assignment and may not be updated if the player's subgroup
    changes during a raid encounter. The method is thread-safe and does not require
    any special considerations for usage.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine current group assignments,
    as it returns the original subgroup assignment. Player movement between subgroups
    during encounters will not affect this value, which could lead to incorrect assumptions
    about player positioning.
