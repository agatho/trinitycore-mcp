documentation:
  brief: Computes and returns the hash value of an ObjectGuid for use in hash-based
    containers.
  description: The operator() method is a hash function implementation for the ObjectGuid
    type, used primarily within hash tables and unordered containers to compute a
    unique hash code for each GUID. This allows ObjectGuid instances to be efficiently
    stored and retrieved in containers such as std::unordered_map or std::unordered_set.
    The method takes a const reference to an ObjectGuid and returns a size_t hash
    value that represents the internal identifier of the object. In the context of
    TrinityCore, ObjectGuids are used extensively to uniquely identify game entities
    like players, creatures, items, and game objects. This hash function ensures fast
    lookup times for these identifiers in performance-critical systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A size_t value representing the computed hash of the provided ObjectGuid.
    This value is used internally by hash-based containers to determine where to store
    or retrieve the GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Using ObjectGuid hash in unordered_set
    code: '#include <unordered_set>


      std::unordered_set<ObjectGuid> guidSet;

      ObjectGuid playerGuid(12345);

      guidSet.insert(playerGuid);


      // The hash function is automatically called when inserting into the set

      size_t hashValue = guidSet.hash_function()(playerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by standard library containers and
    should not be called directly in most cases. The implementation likely uses a
    combination of the GUID's low and high bits to produce a well-distributed hash
    value suitable for hash tables. Performance is critical as this function may be
    called frequently during container operations.
