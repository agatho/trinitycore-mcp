documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of fields in a DB2 storage entry
  description: The GetFieldCount method retrieves the total number of fields present
    in each record of a DB2 storage container. This is essential for iterating through
    data records and understanding the structure of loaded database table definitions.
    The method provides metadata about the layout of entries within the storage, which
    is crucial for proper data access and manipulation in TrinityCore's database system.
    It does not perform any data loading or modification operations; it simply returns
    a cached field count value that was determined during the initialization of the
    DB2 storage.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of fields defined for each
    record in this DB2 storage container. This count includes all fields present in
    the database table structure, including those that may be unused or reserved for
    future expansion.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Determine Record Structure
    code: 'DB2StorageBase* storage = sDB2Manager->GetStorage("Creature");

      uint32 fieldCount = storage->GetFieldCount();

      printf("Creature DB2 has %u fields per record\n", fieldCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Field Count for Dynamic Data Access
    code: "DB2StorageBase* storage = sDB2Manager->GetStorage(\"Spell\");\nuint32 fieldCount\
      \ = storage->GetFieldCount();\nfor (uint32 i = 0; i < fieldCount; ++i)\n{\n\
      \    // Access field information dynamically\n    printf(\"Field %u: %s\\n\"\
      , i, storage->GetFieldName(i));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore's DB2 loading system
    and should not be called frequently in performance-critical code paths. The returned
    field count value is determined at initialization time when the storage metadata
    is loaded from the DB2 file format, making this a constant-time operation with
    no computational overhead during runtime access.
