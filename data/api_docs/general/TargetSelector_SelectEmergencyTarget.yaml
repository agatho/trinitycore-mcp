  signature: Unit * TargetSelector::SelectEmergencyTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns the most threatening target for emergency combat situations.
  description: The SelectEmergencyTarget method is used by AI-controlled units to
    identify and return the highest-priority target during urgent combat scenarios.
    This method typically evaluates all available targets within the unit's aggro
    range, considering factors such as threat level, distance, and target priority.
    It is commonly invoked when a unit needs to quickly respond to an immediate danger
    or when the current target becomes invalid. The selected target is usually the
    one that poses the greatest threat to the AI-controlled unit or its allies.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Unit object representing the emergency target,
    or nullptr if no valid target is found within the specified criteria.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Behavior
    code: "Unit* emergencyTarget = selector->SelectEmergencyTarget();\nif (emergencyTarget)\n\
      {\n    // Engage the emergency target immediately\n    me->Attack(emergencyTarget,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Null Return Value
    code: "Unit* target = selector->SelectEmergencyTarget();\nif (!target)\n{\n  \
      \  // No emergency target found, fallback to normal targeting\n    target =\
      \ selector->SelectNextTarget();\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Proceed with emergency engagement\n\
      \    DoCombatAction(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically part of an AI decision-making system and may be
    called frequently during combat. It's important to note that the selection criteria
    for emergency targets are usually more aggressive than normal targeting, prioritizing
    immediate threats over long-term strategic considerations.
  warnings: Ensure proper null checking when using the returned Unit pointer, as it
    can return nullptr if no valid emergency target exists. Improper handling of this
    method's result may lead to crashes or unexpected behavior in AI-controlled units.
