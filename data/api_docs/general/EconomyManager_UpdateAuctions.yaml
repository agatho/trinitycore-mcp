  brief: Updates auction states and processes auction timeouts in the economy system.
  description: The UpdateAuctions method is responsible for managing the lifecycle
    of auctions within the TrinityCore economy system. It processes timed-out auctions,
    updates auction statuses, and handles the transfer of items and gold between bidders
    and sellers. This method is typically called from the main game loop at regular
    intervals to ensure that auction data remains consistent with real-time gameplay
    mechanics.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly, typically every game tick or at fixed
    intervals, to maintain auction integrity. It internally manages auction timeouts
    and may trigger database operations for updating auction records.
