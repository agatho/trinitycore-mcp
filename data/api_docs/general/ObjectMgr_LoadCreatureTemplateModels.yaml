  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadCreatureTemplateModels()
documentation:
  brief: Loads creature template models from the database into memory for use in the
    game world.
  description: The LoadCreatureTemplateModels method initializes and populates internal
    data structures with creature model information retrieved from the database. This
    method is typically called during server startup or reload operations to ensure
    that all creature templates have their associated model data available for spawning
    NPCs and creatures in the game world. It processes entries from the creature_template_model
    table, which maps creature entries to their respective models, sizes, and other
    visual properties. The loaded data is used by the core engine when creating creature
    instances to determine how they should appear visually.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n\
      \    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadCreatureTemplateModels();\n    // Continue with\
      \ other loading processes...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    reloading creature data. It modifies internal caches and should not be invoked
    concurrently with other database operations. The method assumes that the database
    connection is already established and valid.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate entries in internal caches. Avoid calling this during
    active gameplay sessions as it could cause performance issues.
