  method: GetNextPauseWaypointTimestamp
  signature: int TransportTemplate::GetNextPauseWaypointTimestamp(int time) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the timestamp of the next pause waypoint for a transport
    based on the provided time value.
  description: The GetNextPauseWaypointTimestamp method determines the next scheduled
    pause waypoint timestamp for a transport object. This method is typically used
    in the context of transport systems within World of Warcraft, such as boats or
    zeppelins, to manage movement and timing between waypoints. It takes an input
    time value and returns the next pause timestamp that should occur during the transport's
    journey. The method likely iterates through the transport's defined waypoints
    and identifies the next one where a pause is scheduled, using the provided time
    as a reference point for determining the next relevant waypoint.
  parameters:
  - name: time
    description: The current time value in milliseconds used as a reference to determine
      the next pause waypoint. This value represents the elapsed time since the transport
      started its journey or the last pause event.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the timestamp (in milliseconds) of the
    next pause waypoint that will occur after the provided time value. If no further
    pause waypoints exist, it may return a special value indicating end of journey
    or an error condition.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int currentTime = GetTickCount();\nint nextPauseTime = transportTemplate->GetNextPauseWaypointTimestamp(currentTime);\n\
      if (nextPauseTime > 0)\n{\n    // Schedule a pause event at nextPauseTime\n\
      \    // ... pause logic here ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Transport Movement Timing
    code: "class TransportManager\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateTransport(TransportTemplate*\
      \ transport, uint32 diff)\n    {\n        static uint32 lastUpdate = 0;\n  \
      \      uint32 currentTime = GetTickCount();\n        \n        if (currentTime\
      \ >= transport->GetNextPauseWaypointTimestamp(lastUpdate))\n        {\n    \
      \        // Handle pause waypoint event\n            transport->HandlePauseWaypoint();\n\
      \            lastUpdate = currentTime;\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the transport system's internal waypoint management
    logic. It may be used in conjunction with other transport-related methods to control
    movement timing and ensure proper synchronization with game events. The returned
    timestamp should be compared against current time values to determine when to
    trigger pause events during transport movement.
  warnings: The method assumes that the TransportTemplate has valid waypoint data
    and pause information configured. If no waypoints or pause data exists, the behavior
    is undefined and may return unexpected values. Ensure proper initialization of
    transport templates before calling this method.
