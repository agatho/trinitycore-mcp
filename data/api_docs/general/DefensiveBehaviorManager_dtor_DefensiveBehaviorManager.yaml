  method: ~DefensiveBehaviorManager
  signature: void DefensiveBehaviorManager::~DefensiveBehaviorManager()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the DefensiveBehaviorManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the DefensiveBehaviorManager class is responsible
    for releasing all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime.
    This includes cleaning up any internal data structures, releasing references to
    AI behaviors, and ensuring proper cleanup of the defensive behavior system. The
    destructor is automatically invoked when a DefensiveBehaviorManager instance goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures that no memory leaks occur and
    that the AI subsystem remains stable during shutdown or removal of the behavior
    manager.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of DefensiveBehaviorManager
    code: 'DefensiveBehaviorManager* manager = new DefensiveBehaviorManager();

      // ... use the manager ...

      delete manager; // Triggers ~DefensiveBehaviorManager()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless managing memory manually.
    It's typically invoked automatically by the C++ runtime when objects go out of
    scope or are deleted. Ensure that all references to this manager are cleared before
    deletion to prevent dangling pointers.
