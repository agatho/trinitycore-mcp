  class: AreaTrigger
  method: UpdateSplinePosition
  signature: void AreaTrigger::UpdateSplinePosition(Movement::Spline<float> & spline)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the area trigger's position based on the provided spline path.
  description: The UpdateSplinePosition method is responsible for updating the current
    position of an AreaTrigger object by calculating its location along a given Movement::Spline<float>.
    This method is typically invoked during movement updates to ensure that the area
    trigger accurately reflects its position as it follows a defined spline path.
    It plays a crucial role in maintaining synchronization between the visual representation
    and the logical positioning of area triggers, such as those used for spell effects
    or environmental interactions. The method does not return any value but modifies
    the internal state of the AreaTrigger object to match the current point along
    the spline.
  parameters:
  - name: spline
    description: A reference to a Movement::Spline<float> object that defines the
      path along which the area trigger should move. This spline contains all necessary
      data points and timing information for calculating the current position.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating AreaTrigger Position with Spline
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...; // Assume this is a valid area trigger

      Movement::Spline<float> spline;

      // Initialize spline with path data

      trigger->UpdateSplinePosition(spline);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the spline has been properly initialized and contains
    valid movement data. It is typically called from within the game's update loop
    or movement handling system. The internal state of the area trigger may be modified
    directly by this function, so it should only be invoked when appropriate for the
    current context.
