  class: TargetScanner
  method: FindAllHostiles
  signature: int TargetScanner::FindAllHostiles(float range)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the number of hostile units within the specified range.
  description: The FindAllHostiles method scans the area around the target scanner's
    position to identify all hostile units (such as enemies or aggressive NPCs) that
    are within the given range. It performs a radius-based search and counts how many
    such units are detected. This method is commonly used in AI behavior scripts to
    determine nearby threats or targets for combat actions. The method does not modify
    the state of the scanner or the found units, but rather provides a count of qualifying
    entities. The range parameter defines the maximum distance (in yards) from the
    scanner's position to consider for hostile detection.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of hostile units found within
    the specified range. A return value of zero indicates no hostile units were detected
    in the area.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int hostileCount = scanner.FindAllHostiles(20.0f); // Find all hostiles\
      \ within 20 yards\nif (hostileCount > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with combat logic\n\
      \    printf(\"Detected %d hostile units\\n\", hostileCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Decision Making
    code: "float scanRange = 30.0f;\nint hostiles = scanner.FindAllHostiles(scanRange);\n\
      if (hostiles >= 3)\n{\n    // Initiate group combat strategy\n    ai->SetCombatStrategy(\"\
      group_attack\");\n}\nelse if (hostiles == 1)\n{\n    // Use single-target tactics\n\
      \    ai->SetCombatStrategy(\"single_target\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a synchronous search operation and may have performance
    implications when used in high-frequency AI loops. It relies on the underlying
    game's unit detection system, which considers line-of-sight and faction relationships
    to determine hostility. The scanner must be properly initialized with a valid
    position for accurate results.
  warnings: Using very large range values can cause performance degradation due to
    increased computational overhead. The method does not account for terrain or obstacles
    that might block line of sight in real-world scenarios, only the straight-line
    distance.
