  method: SetTankConfig
  signature: void RoleBasedCombatPositioning::SetTankConfig(const TankPositionConfig
    & config)
documentation:
  brief: Configures the tank positioning settings for role-based combat mechanics.
  description: The SetTankConfig method initializes or updates the tank-specific positioning
    configuration used in role-based combat scenarios. This method allows developers
    to define how tanks should position themselves during encounters, including preferred
    distances, angles, and positioning strategies relative to targets. The configuration
    typically includes parameters such as optimal distance from the target, flanking
    angles, and positioning priorities that are critical for maintaining effective
    threat generation and preventing aggro loss. This method is commonly used in custom
    AI scripts or encounter mechanics where precise control over tank positioning
    is required for proper gameplay balance.
  parameters:
  - name: config
    description: A constant reference to a TankPositionConfig object containing the
      desired positioning parameters for tank roles. This includes settings such as
      preferred distance from target, flanking angles, and positioning priority values.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Tank Configuration Setup
    code: 'TankPositionConfig config;

      config.preferredDistance = 5.0f;

      config.flankAngle = 45.0f;

      config.priority = 1;

      roleBasedCombat->SetTankConfig(config);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Tank Configuration with Multiple Parameters
    code: 'TankPositionConfig config;

      config.preferredDistance = 8.0f;

      config.minDistance = 3.0f;

      config.maxDistance = 12.0f;

      config.flankAngle = 60.0f;

      config.positioningPriority = 2;

      config.useFlanking = true;

      roleBasedCombat->SetTankConfig(config);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects combat positioning behavior and should be called
    during encounter initialization or when role configurations need to be updated
    dynamically. The configuration values are typically validated internally, but
    developers should ensure that distance parameters are within reasonable bounds
    for the specific encounter design.
  warnings: Setting inappropriate distance or angle values may cause tanks to position
    incorrectly during combat, potentially leading to aggro issues or gameplay imbalance.
    Avoid calling this method repeatedly in tight loops as it may impact performance
    if internal state updates are expensive.
