  signature: ScenarioStepState Scenario::GetStepState(const ScenarioStepEntry * step)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current state of a specified scenario step within the scenario.
  description: The GetStepState method retrieves the current state of a given scenario
    step, which is represented by a ScenarioStepEntry object. This method allows developers
    to query the progress or completion status of individual steps within a scenario.
    The returned ScenarioStepState indicates whether the step has been completed,
    is in progress, or has not yet started. This functionality is essential for managing
    scenario progression and determining what actions players can take based on their
    current scenario state.
  parameters:
  - name: step
    description: Pointer to a ScenarioStepEntry object that defines the specific step
      whose state should be retrieved. Must not be null.
  returns: 'Returns a ScenarioStepState enum value indicating the current state of
    the specified scenario step. Possible values may include: STEP_STATE_INCOMPLETE,
    STEP_STATE_COMPLETE, or STEP_STATE_FAILED, depending on the implementation and
    game context.'
  examples:
  - title: Check if a scenario step is complete
    code: "ScenarioStepState state = scenario->GetStepState(stepEntry);\nif (state\
      \ == STEP_STATE_COMPLETE)\n{\n    // Handle completion logic\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Scenario step completed!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Query multiple scenario steps for progress tracking
    code: "for (auto& step : scenarioSteps)\n{\n    ScenarioStepState state = scenario->GetStepState(step);\n\
      \    switch (state)\n    {\n        case STEP_STATE_COMPLETE:\n            //\
      \ Update UI to show completed step\n            break;\n        case STEP_STATE_INCOMPLETE:\n\
      \            // Enable step for player interaction\n            break;\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with scenario progression logic
    and UI updates. The returned state may be cached or updated based on game events,
    so calling this method multiple times during a single game tick might return different
    values if the scenario state has changed.
  warnings: Ensure that the ScenarioStepEntry pointer passed to this method is valid
    and not null, as passing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior.
    Also, be aware that scenario step states may change frequently during gameplay,
    so caching results should be done carefully.
