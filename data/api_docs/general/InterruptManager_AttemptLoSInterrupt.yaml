  class: InterruptManager
  method: AttemptLoSInterrupt
  signature: bool InterruptManager::AttemptLoSInterrupt(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to interrupt spell casting of a target unit if line-of-sight is
    available.
  description: The AttemptLoSInterrupt method checks whether the current unit can
    interrupt another unit's spell casting by verifying line-of-sight conditions.
    It evaluates if the target is currently casting a spell and if there is an unobstructed
    path between the caster and the target. If both conditions are met, the interruption
    is attempted and the method returns true; otherwise, it returns false. This functionality
    is commonly used in combat scenarios where players or NPCs attempt to interrupt
    enemy spell casts to prevent damage or debuffs.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell casting of the target unit was successfully interrupted
    due to line-of-sight conditions being met, otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat AI
    code: "if (unit->GetInterruptManager()->AttemptLoSInterrupt(targetUnit)) {\n \
      \   // Spell was interrupted\n    targetUnit->InterruptSpell(CURRENT_GENERIC_SPELL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying line-of-sight checking system which
    may be affected by terrain, objects, or other environmental factors. It is typically
    used in AI logic for interrupting spells during combat encounters.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit is actually casting a spell before calling
    this method to avoid unnecessary processing. This method does not validate if
    the target is hostile or friendly; it only checks line-of-sight and casting state.
