  class: InventoryManager
  method: DestroyItemsForSpace
  signature: uint32 InventoryManager::DestroyItemsForSpace(uint32 slots)
documentation:
  brief: Destroys items in specified inventory slots and returns the count of destroyed
    items.
  description: The DestroyItemsForSpace method removes all items from the specified
    inventory slots, effectively clearing them. This method is typically used when
    managing player inventory, such as during item destruction, equipment changes,
    or when preparing for certain game events. It processes the provided slot identifiers
    and removes any items found in those positions, returning a count of how many
    items were successfully destroyed. The method operates on the player's main inventory
    and may affect various container types depending on the slot values passed. It
    is commonly used in conjunction with other inventory management functions to maintain
    consistent state during gameplay operations.
  parameters:
  - name: slots
    description: A bitmask or identifier representing the inventory slots to clear.
      This value typically corresponds to specific slot positions within the player's
      inventory, such as backpack slots, bag slots, or equipment slots. The exact
      bit layout depends on the internal inventory system implementation.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value indicating the number of items successfully destroyed
    from the specified slots. A return value of zero indicates no items were found
    in the provided slots, while a positive value represents the count of items removed.
  examples:
  - title: Clearing specific inventory slots
    code: uint32 destroyedCount = player->GetInventory()->DestroyItemsForSpace(INV_SLOT_BAG_0
      | INV_SLOT_BAG_1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Destroying all items in a container
    code: uint32 totalDestroyed = player->GetInventory()->DestroyItemsForSpace(PLAYER_SLOT_START
      | PLAYER_SLOT_END);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the inventory state and should be used carefully
    to avoid unintended item loss. It may trigger inventory update events that propagate
    to the client, so performance considerations should be taken into account when
    clearing large numbers of slots. The method assumes valid slot identifiers are
    passed and does not perform bounds checking on the input.
  warnings: Using this method with incorrect or invalid slot identifiers can result
    in undefined behavior or data corruption. Always ensure that slot values correspond
    to actual inventory positions before calling this function. Avoid calling this
    method during critical gameplay operations where item consistency is paramount
    without proper synchronization.
