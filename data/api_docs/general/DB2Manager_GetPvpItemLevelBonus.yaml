  signature: uint8 DB2Manager::GetPvpItemLevelBonus(uint32 itemId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the PvP item level bonus associated with a specified item ID.
  description: The GetPvpItemLevelBonus method fetches the PvP item level bonus value
    for a given item ID from the DB2 database. This value is used in World of Warcraft's
    PvP system to adjust item levels for players participating in battlegrounds and
    arenas. The method performs a lookup in the internal DB2 cache and returns a uint8
    value representing the bonus. If the item ID does not exist in the PvP item level
    bonus table, the method will return 0 as a default value. This function is typically
    used during item evaluation and player stats calculation within PvP scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the PvP item level bonus for the specified
    item ID. A value of 0 indicates that no PvP bonus is associated with the item,
    or the item ID was not found in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 itemId = 12345;\nuint8 bonus = sDB2Manager->GetPvpItemLevelBonus(itemId);\n\
      if (bonus > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Item %u has PvP bonus: %u\\n\", itemId, bonus);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Stats
    code: "void ApplyPvpBonus(Player* player, uint32 itemId)\n{\n    uint8 bonus =\
      \ sDB2Manager->GetPvpItemLevelBonus(itemId);\n    if (bonus > 0)\n    {\n  \
      \      // Apply bonus to player's item level for PvP\n        player->SetPvpItemLevelBonus(bonus);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the DB2Manager's internal caching mechanism. The data
    is loaded during server startup from the DB2 files, and subsequent lookups are
    fast. The method is thread-safe as it only performs read operations on cached
    data.
  warnings: The method returns 0 for missing items, which might be confused with a
    valid bonus of 0. Developers should verify if an item exists in the PvP bonus
    table before relying on this value for critical gameplay logic.
