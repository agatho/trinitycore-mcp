documentation:
  brief: Initiates the Rescue spell cast for the Evoker AI.
  description: The CastRescue method is responsible for executing the Rescue spell
    ability within the Evoker AI framework. This method typically handles the logic
    required to select a target and cast the Rescue spell, which is a key ability
    for Evokers in World of Warcraft. The method operates on a provided target reference,
    allowing it to perform the necessary checks and actions to execute the spell successfully.
    It integrates with the broader AI system to ensure proper targeting and spell
    execution based on current game state and conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit for the Rescue
      spell. This parameter is used to identify which unit will be rescued by the
      Evoker AI.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CastRescue
    code: 'int targetId = 12345;

      EvokerAI* evoker = new EvokerAI();

      evoker->CastRescue(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the target unit is valid and accessible within the
    current game context. It's important to ensure that the target pointer points
    to a valid unit before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target parameter may lead to invalid spell casting
    or crashes. Always validate that the target exists and is eligible for the Rescue
    spell before invoking this method.
