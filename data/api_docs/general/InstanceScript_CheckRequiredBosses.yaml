  signature: bool InstanceScript::CheckRequiredBosses(uint32 param0, const Player
    * param1) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if all required bosses have been defeated in the instance
  description: The CheckRequiredBosses method verifies whether all mandatory boss
    encounters have been successfully completed within the current instance. This
    method is typically used during instance entry or when determining if a player
    can access certain areas or rewards. It evaluates the instance's boss kill status
    against predefined requirements and returns true if all conditions are met, otherwise
    false. The method is commonly called during player login, zone entry, or when
    checking access permissions to instance content.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Unknown parameter - likely a bitmask or identifier for specific boss
      requirements
  - name: param1
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose access is being checked, may be
      null in some contexts
  returns: Returns true if all required bosses have been defeated and instance conditions
    are satisfied, false otherwise. A return value of false typically prevents player
    access to restricted areas or content.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in instance entry check
    code: "if (instanceScript->CheckRequiredBosses(0, player))\n{\n    // Allow player\
      \ to proceed\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"All bosses defeated!\");\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Prevent access\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Not\
      \ all bosses defeated yet.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using CheckRequiredBosses for quest progression
    code: "class MyInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    bool CheckRequiredBosses(uint32\
      \ param0, const Player* player) const override\n    {\n        // Custom logic\
      \ to check boss requirements\n        if (GetBossState(BOSS_MALFURION) == DONE\
      \ && GetBossState(BOSS_ILLIDAN) == DONE)\n            return true;\n       \
      \ \n        return false;\n    }\n};"

  notes: This method is typically called during instance initialization and player
    access checks. The exact implementation details may vary between different instance
    types. Developers should be aware that this method might be invoked from multiple
    threads, though TrinityCore generally handles thread safety for instance data
    access.
  warnings: Ensure that boss state tracking is properly maintained throughout the
    instance lifecycle. Improper implementation can lead to players being unable to
    progress or access content they should be able to reach. The method may not behave
    as expected if boss states are not correctly updated when encounters are completed.
