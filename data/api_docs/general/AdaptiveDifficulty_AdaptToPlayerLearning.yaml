  class: AdaptiveDifficulty
  method: AdaptToPlayerLearning
  signature: void AdaptiveDifficulty::AdaptToPlayerLearning(PlayerSkillProfile * profile,
    DifficultySettings & settings)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts difficulty settings based on player skill profile data.
  description: The AdaptToPlayerLearning method modifies difficulty parameters according
    to a provided player's skill profile. This function is typically used in adaptive
    difficulty systems where game challenges are dynamically adjusted to match the
    player's performance and progression. It takes into account various metrics from
    the player skill profile such as completion rates, time spent on tasks, and success/failure
    patterns to recalibrate the difficulty settings accordingly. The method ensures
    that gameplay remains engaging by preventing too easy or too hard experiences
    for individual players.
  parameters:
  - name: profile
    description: Pointer to a PlayerSkillProfile object containing player's performance
      data and skill metrics used for difficulty adaptation.
  - name: settings
    description: Reference to a DifficultySettings object that will be modified with
      adjusted difficulty parameters based on the player profile.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PlayerSkillProfile* myProfile = new PlayerSkillProfile();

      DifficultySettings currentSettings;

      // Populate profile with player data

      adaptiveDiff.AdaptToPlayerLearning(myProfile, currentSettings);

      // currentSettings now contains adapted difficulty values'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in Game Loop
    code: "void UpdateDifficultyForPlayer(Player* player)\n{\n    PlayerSkillProfile*\
      \ profile = player->GetSkillProfile();\n    DifficultySettings& settings = sWorld->getDifficultySettings();\n\
      \    adaptiveDiff.AdaptToPlayerLearning(profile, settings);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of an adaptive difficulty system and should be called
    periodically during gameplay to maintain dynamic challenge levels. It assumes
    that the PlayerSkillProfile has been properly populated with relevant player data
    before being passed in.
  warnings: Ensure that the profile pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, otherwise it may cause undefined behavior or crashes. The settings object
    will be modified in-place, so keep a backup if needed.
