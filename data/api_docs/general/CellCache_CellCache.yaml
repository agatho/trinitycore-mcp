documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the CellCache class for managing in-memory
    cell data caching.
  description: The CellCache constructor initializes a new instance of the CellCache
    class, setting up internal data structures used to cache cell-related information
    within the TrinityCore server. This class is typically used to optimize performance
    by reducing redundant database queries when processing game world cells. The constructor
    prepares the cache with appropriate memory allocation and default configurations
    needed for efficient cell data management. It does not require any parameters
    and performs no explicit operations beyond initialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic instantiation of CellCache
    code: 'CellCache cache;

      // Initializes a new CellCache instance ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the server framework when
    initializing world processing components. Developers should not need to explicitly
    instantiate CellCache objects unless working directly with low-level cell management
    systems.
