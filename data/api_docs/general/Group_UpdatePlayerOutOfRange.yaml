documentation:
  brief: Updates the group's out-of-range status for a specified player.
  description: The UpdatePlayerOutOfRange method is responsible for managing the visibility
    and synchronization state of a player within a group when that player moves out
    of the group's effective range. This method ensures that group members are properly
    notified of players who have gone out of range, and it handles the necessary updates
    to maintain accurate group data structures. The method typically gets called internally
    by the game engine when a player's position changes significantly relative to
    other group members. It may update internal tracking flags, send relevant packets
    to clients, or adjust the group's internal state to reflect the new range conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group management
    code: "void HandlePlayerMovement(Group* group, Player* player) {\n    // When\
      \ a player moves out of range\n    group->UpdatePlayerOutOfRange(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the TrinityCore framework
    when player movement events occur. Developers should not generally need to call
    this directly unless implementing custom group range logic or debugging range-related
    issues. The method may trigger internal synchronization operations that affect
    performance if called frequently.
  warnings: Calling this method manually can cause unexpected behavior in group synchronization
    and may lead to inconsistent state between the server and client. It should only
    be invoked when absolutely necessary and with a clear understanding of its side
    effects.
