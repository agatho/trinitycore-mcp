  class: UnitAI
  method: DoAction
  signature: void UnitAI::DoAction(int32 param)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a specific AI action based on the provided parameter value.
  description: The DoAction method is a core component of the UnitAI system in TrinityCore,
    used to trigger predefined AI behaviors or actions within a unit's AI state machine.
    This method accepts an integer parameter that typically corresponds to a defined
    action ID, allowing for dynamic control over NPC or creature behavior during combat,
    movement, or other AI-driven events. The implementation likely dispatches the
    action to the appropriate handler within the AI context, enabling modular and
    extensible AI logic. This method is commonly used in custom AI scripts or event-driven
    behaviors where specific actions need to be triggered programmatically.
  parameters:
  - name: param
    description: An integer parameter that identifies the specific AI action to execute.
      The value typically maps to predefined action IDs within the AI system, which
      may correspond to different behaviors such as attack patterns, movement commands,
      or state transitions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Triggering a Custom AI Action
    code: "class MyAI : public UnitAI {\npublic:\n    void DoAction(int32 param) override\
      \ {\n        switch (param) {\n            case 1:\n                // Execute\
      \ special attack\n                me->CastSpell(me, SPELL_SPECIAL_ATTACK, true);\n\
      \                break;\n            case 2:\n                // Initiate retreat\n\
      \                me->GetMotionMaster()->MoveFleeing(me, 5000);\n           \
      \     break;\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Calling DoAction from an Event Handler
    code: "void OnCombatBegin(Unit* me) {\n    // Trigger AI action to start combat\
      \ behavior\n    me->GetAI()->DoAction(10);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically overridden in custom AI implementations. The parameter
    value should be carefully chosen to match predefined action IDs within the AI
    framework, or else the action may not be recognized. It's recommended to define
    action IDs as constants for better code readability and maintainability.
  warnings: Calling DoAction with an invalid or unhandled parameter ID may result
    in undefined behavior or no action being executed. Ensure that all possible parameter
    values are properly handled within the overridden method implementation.
