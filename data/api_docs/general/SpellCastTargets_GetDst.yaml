documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the destination spell target for the current spell cast.
  description: The GetDst method retrieves the SpellDestination object that represents
    the target location or entity for a spell being cast. This destination is typically
    set during spell initialization and contains information about where the spell
    will be cast, including coordinates, map ID, and optionally a target GUID. The
    returned pointer is const, meaning it should not be modified directly. This method
    is commonly used in spell handling logic to determine the target of a spell before
    execution or to validate targeting mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to a SpellDestination object representing the spell's
    destination. Returns nullptr if no destination has been set for the spell cast
    targets.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Logic
    code: "void MySpellHandler(Spell* spell)\n{\n    SpellCastTargets const& targets\
      \ = spell->GetSpellCastTargets();\n    const SpellDestination* dest = targets.GetDst();\n\
      \    if (dest)\n    {\n        // Process the destination coordinates or target\n\
      \        WorldLocation const& pos = dest->GetPosition();\n        // Use pos\
      \ for spell effects\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Target Validity Before Casting
    code: "bool IsValidSpellTarget(Spell* spell)\n{\n    SpellCastTargets const& targets\
      \ = spell->GetSpellCastTargets();\n    const SpellDestination* dest = targets.GetDst();\n\
      \    return dest != nullptr && dest->GetPosition().IsInMap();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned SpellDestination pointer is only valid for the lifetime of the
    SpellCastTargets object. Do not store this pointer beyond the scope of the current
    spell handling context. This method does not perform any validation on whether
    the destination is actually reachable or valid for casting.
  warnings: Accessing the returned pointer without checking for null can lead to crashes.
    Always verify that GetDst() does not return nullptr before dereferencing it. The
    SpellDestination object should not be modified directly through this pointer as
    it's const.
