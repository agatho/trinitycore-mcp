documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a player is in the friend list of the current player
  description: The IsFriend method determines if a specified player is present in
    the social list of the current player as a friend. This method is typically used
    within the context of World of Warcraft's social system to verify friendship relationships
    between players. The method performs a lookup in the player's social database
    entry and returns true if the target player GUID exists in the friend list, false
    otherwise. It does not validate if the player is online or offline, only that
    they are registered as a friend.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified player GUID is found in the current player's
    friend list, false if the player is not a friend or if the GUID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Friend Check
    code: "if (socialManager.IsFriend(12345)) {\n    // Player with GUID 12345 is\
      \ in friends list\n    std::cout << \"Player is a friend\" << std::endl;\n}\
      \ else {\n    // Player with GUID 12345 is not in friends list\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Player is not a friend\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the SocialManager instance is properly initialized
    and associated with a valid player context. The GUID parameter should represent
    a valid player in the game database. Performance is generally fast as it relies
    on indexed lookups in the social list.
