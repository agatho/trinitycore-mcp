  method: SetBankPolicy
  signature: void GuildBankManager::SetBankPolicy(uint32 guildId, GuildBankItemType
    itemType, const std::string & policy)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the bank policy for a specific item type within a guild's bank.
  description: The SetBankPolicy method configures access permissions for a specified
    item type in the guild bank. This method allows administrators to define who can
    deposit, withdraw, or view specific items within the guild's bank system. The
    policy string typically contains permission flags or roles that determine access
    rights. This functionality is integral to managing guild resources and ensuring
    proper item distribution among members based on their roles or ranks.
  parameters:
  - name: guildId
    description: Unique identifier of the guild whose bank policy is being modified.
      Must correspond to an existing guild in the database.
  - name: itemType
    description: Type of item for which the policy is being set. Represents a specific
      category or classification of items within the guild bank system.
  - name: policy
    description: String representation of the access policy to be applied. Format
      and content depend on the internal implementation but typically includes role-based
      permissions or access flags.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Deposit Policy for Consumables
    code: GuildBankManager::SetBankPolicy(12345, GUILD_BANK_ITEM_TYPE_CONSUMABLE,
      "rank_1,rank_2,rank_3");
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Withdraw Policy for Equipment
    code: GuildBankManager::SetBankPolicy(67890, GUILD_BANK_ITEM_TYPE_EQUIPMENT, "officer_only");
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the database to persist policy changes.
    It may trigger internal updates to guild bank access caches or notify connected
    clients of policy modifications. The exact format and interpretation of the policy
    string should be verified against the TrinityCore source code for full compatibility.
  warnings: Incorrect guildId values will result in undefined behavior or failed operations.
    Policy strings must follow expected formats otherwise access control may not function
    as intended. This method should only be called by trusted administrative functions
    to prevent unauthorized access changes.
