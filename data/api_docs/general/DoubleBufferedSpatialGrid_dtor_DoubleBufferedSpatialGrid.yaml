documentation:
  brief: Destroys a DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid instance and releases all associated
    memory resources.
  description: The destructor for the DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid class is responsible
    for cleaning up all dynamically allocated memory and resources used by the grid
    structure. This includes releasing memory for both the current and pending buffers,
    as well as any internal data structures that manage spatial partitioning. The
    destructor ensures proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks in the TrinityCore server
    environment. It is automatically invoked when an instance of DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid
    code: 'DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid* grid = new DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid();

      // ... use the grid ...

      delete grid; // Destructor is called automatically here'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor performs cleanup operations that are essential for maintaining
    memory safety in TrinityCore's spatial partitioning system. It is important to
    note that this destructor should only be called on objects that were allocated
    on the heap, as automatic stack allocation will invoke the destructor automatically
    when the object goes out of scope.
