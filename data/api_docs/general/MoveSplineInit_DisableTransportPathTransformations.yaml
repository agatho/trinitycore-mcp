  signature: void MoveSplineInit::DisableTransportPathTransformations()
documentation:
  brief: Disables transport path transformations for the movement spline initialization.
  description: The DisableTransportPathTransformations method prevents the movement
    spline from applying any transformations related to transport vehicles. This is
    typically used when a unit is moving on a transport such as a boat or elevator,
    and the movement should not be adjusted for the transport's motion. The method
    modifies internal flags within the MoveSplineInit class to ensure that subsequent
    path calculations do not incorporate transport-related offsets or rotations. This
    can be important for precise positioning during scripted events or when handling
    specific movement behaviors where transport influence needs to be suppressed.

  - title: Disabling Transport Transformations Before Movement
    code: 'MoveSplineInit init(movementInfo);

      init.DisableTransportPathTransformations();

      init.MoveTo(destination);

      init.Launch();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initiating any movement with transport
    transformations disabled. It affects only the current spline initialization and
    does not persist across multiple movements. The internal state change is typically
    used in conjunction with other movement setup methods like MoveTo() or MoveBy()
    to ensure accurate path generation.
  warnings: Calling this method after movement has already been initialized may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect path calculations. It should be used carefully
    in scenarios involving complex transport interactions where precise control over
    movement is required.
