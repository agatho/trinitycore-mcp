  class: AdaptiveDifficulty
  method: IsEnabled
  signature: bool AdaptiveDifficulty::IsEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether adaptive difficulty is enabled for the current game context.
  description: The IsEnabled method checks if the adaptive difficulty system is currently
    active within the TrinityCore instance. This system dynamically adjusts the difficulty
    of encounters based on the player group's performance and other factors. The method
    returns a boolean value indicating the operational state of this feature. Adaptive
    difficulty can be toggled via configuration settings or game master commands,
    and this method provides a way for other systems to query its current status without
    directly accessing internal configuration variables.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if adaptive difficulty is enabled, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the system will actively modify encounter difficulties based on player
    performance metrics.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Adaptive Difficulty is Enabled
    code: "if (AdaptiveDifficulty::IsEnabled()) {\n    // Perform actions specific\
      \ to adaptive difficulty being active\n    sLog->outString(\"Adaptive difficulty\
      \ is currently enabled.\");\n} else {\n    // Handle case where adaptive difficulty\
      \ is disabled\n    sLog->outString(\"Adaptive difficulty is currently disabled.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple boolean check and has no performance implications.
    It should be safe to call from any thread context as it's likely reading a cached
    or atomic configuration value.
