  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: BroadcastCoordinationMessage
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::BroadcastCoordinationMessage(Group * group,
    const std::string & message)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a coordination message to all members of a specified group.
  description: The BroadcastCoordinationMessage method is used to transmit a message
    to all players within a given group, typically for instance coordination purposes
    in World of Warcraft. This method is essential for synchronizing group activities
    such as instance entrances, event triggers, or shared objectives. The message
    is sent directly to each group member's client, ensuring that all players receive
    the same information simultaneously. It is commonly used during dungeon, raid,
    or scenario instances where coordinated actions are required among group members.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the members who will receive
      the message. Must be a valid group instance; null pointer will result in undefined
      behavior.
  - name: message
    description: String containing the coordination message to broadcast. Should be
      properly formatted and localized for the target audience. Empty strings are
      allowed but may not convey meaningful information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Broadcast instance start message
    code: "Group* dungeonGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (dungeonGroup)\n{\n    InstanceCoordination::BroadcastCoordinationMessage(dungeonGroup,\
      \ \"Instance starting in 30 seconds!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Send objective update to group
    code: "Group* raidGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (raidGroup && raidGroup->isRaidGroup())\n\
      {\n    InstanceCoordination::BroadcastCoordinationMessage(raidGroup, \"Boss\
      \ phase 2 engaged. Prepare for mechanics!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates synchronously and sends messages directly to each group
    member's client without any delay. It is designed specifically for instance coordination
    scenarios and should not be used for general chat communication. The method does
    not validate whether the group members are in the same instance or zone, so it's
    up to the calling code to ensure appropriate context.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the group is valid and contains at least one
    member before invoking this function. Also, be cautious about sending too many
    messages in rapid succession as it may overwhelm client-side message buffers.
