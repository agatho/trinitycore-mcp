  class: InteractionValidator
  method: ValidateRequirements
  signature: bool InteractionValidator::ValidateRequirements(::Player * bot, const
    InteractionRequirement & requirements) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player meets the specified interaction requirements.
  description: The ValidateRequirements method checks if a given Player object satisfies
    all conditions defined in an InteractionRequirement structure. This method is
    typically used within the TrinityCore framework to determine if a player can interact
    with certain game objects, NPCs, or quest elements based on their current state,
    level, quest progress, and other criteria. It evaluates various flags and conditions
    such as required items, quest completion status, player level thresholds, and
    faction requirements. The method returns true if all requirements are met, false
    otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose interaction requirements are being
      validated. Must not be null.
  - name: requirements
    description: Reference to an InteractionRequirement structure containing the conditions
      that must be satisfied for interaction to be allowed.
  returns: Returns true if the player meets all specified interaction requirements;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nInteractionRequirement req;\n// Set up requirements\n\
      req.requiredLevel = 10;\nreq.hasQuest = true;\nreq.questId = 12345;\nbool canInteract\
      \ = validator.ValidateRequirements(player, req);\nif (canInteract) {\n    //\
      \ Allow interaction\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple Conditions
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nInteractionRequirement req;\nreq.requiredLevel =\
      \ 20;\nreq.hasItem = true;\nreq.itemId = 45678;\nreq.requiredFaction = FACTION_ALLIANCE;\n\
      req.completedQuests.push_back(9876);\nbool canInteract = validator.ValidateRequirements(player,\
      \ req);\nif (canInteract) {\n    // Proceed with interaction logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be used in conjunction with the TrinityCore AI
    and quest systems. It's commonly called before allowing player interactions with
    game objects or NPCs to ensure proper game state validation. The implementation
    may involve database lookups for quest status and item possession checks.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is valid and not null, as passing
    a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. Also note
    that this method does not modify the player's state; it only evaluates whether
    they meet requirements.
