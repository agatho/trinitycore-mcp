  class: SocialEventBus
  method: GetSubscriberCount
  signature: uint32 SocialEventBus::GetSubscriberCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of subscribers currently registered with the social
    event bus.
  description: The GetSubscriberCount method retrieves the current count of all active
    subscribers registered within the SocialEventBus instance. This count represents
    how many entities (such as players, NPCs, or systems) are currently listening
    for social events broadcast through this event bus. The method is typically used
    for monitoring, debugging, or performance-related checks to understand the load
    or activity level of the social event system. It does not modify any internal
    state and is safe to call from any thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of subscribers currently registered
    with the social event bus. Returns zero if no subscribers are present.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 subscriberCount = sSocialEventBus->GetSubscriberCount();

      TC_LOG_INFO("social", "Current subscriber count: {}", subscriberCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Event Bus Activity
    code: "void CheckSocialEventBusLoad()\n{\n    uint32 count = sSocialEventBus->GetSubscriberCount();\n\
      \    if (count > 1000)\n    {\n        TC_LOG_WARN(\"social\", \"High subscriber\
      \ count detected: {}\", count);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a thread-safe read operation on an internal counter.
    The subscriber count may change between the time when this method is called and
    when the result is used, especially in high-concurrency scenarios. For performance-critical
    applications, consider caching the value if frequent access is required.
  warnings: While the method itself is safe to call, relying on subscriber counts
    for critical game logic decisions might introduce race conditions or lead to inconsistent
    behavior if subscribers are added or removed during the same operation. Always
    ensure proper synchronization when using this count in conditional logic.
