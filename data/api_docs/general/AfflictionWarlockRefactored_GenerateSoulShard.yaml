  signature: void AfflictionWarlockRefactored::GenerateSoulShard(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates soul shards for the affliction warlock based on specified amount.
  description: The GenerateSoulShard method is responsible for creating or adding
    soul shards to an affliction warlock's resource pool. This method typically corresponds
    to abilities like Soul Fire, Shadow Bolt, or other damage spells that generate
    soul shards as a resource. The amount parameter determines how many soul shards
    are generated and added to the warlock's current shard count. This functionality
    is integral to the warlock's gameplay loop, particularly for managing the Soul
    Shard resource which powers various abilities such as Healthstone, Soulstone,
    and other summoning spells.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: warlock->GenerateSoulShard(1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Generating Multiple Soul Shards
    code: 'warlock->GenerateSoulShard(3);

      // This would add 3 soul shards to the warlock''s current resource pool'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal resource tracking systems within
    the TrinityCore framework. It may trigger visual effects or update UI elements
    showing the increased soul shard count. The implementation should ensure thread
    safety when modifying shared resource pools in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called when appropriate for game mechanics
    (e.g., after casting certain spells). Calling it excessively without proper game
    state checks may lead to unbalanced gameplay or unexpected behavior.
