  class: VendorInteraction
  method: ShouldSellItem
  signature: bool VendorInteraction::ShouldSellItem(Player * player, uint32 itemGuid,
    const SellingStrategy & strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a vendor should sell a specific item based on the provided
    selling strategy and player context.
  description: The ShouldSellItem method evaluates if a given item, identified by
    its GUID, should be offered for sale by a vendor to a specific player. It uses
    a SellingStrategy object to define the conditions under which an item is considered
    suitable for sale. This method is typically used during vendor inventory management
    to dynamically determine what items are appropriate for a particular player or
    faction. The evaluation considers factors such as item quality, player level,
    faction reputation, and other game-specific constraints defined in the strategy.
    It returns true if the item meets all criteria for sale, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the buyer who will purchase
      the item. Must not be null.
  - name: itemGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the item being evaluated for sale. Must
      correspond to a valid item in the game world.
  - name: strategy
    description: Reference to a SellingStrategy object that defines the rules and
      conditions for determining if an item should be sold. Contains logic for item
      filtering based on various criteria.
  returns: Returns true if the vendor should sell the specified item to the player
    according to the given strategy; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ShouldSellItem
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 itemGuid = 12345;\nSellingStrategy strategy\
      \ = ...;\nbool shouldSell = VendorInteraction::ShouldSellItem(player, itemGuid,\
      \ strategy);\nif (shouldSell)\n{\n    // Proceed with adding item to vendor's\
      \ inventory\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using ShouldSellItem in vendor logic
    code: "void VendorInteraction::UpdateVendorInventory(Player* player)\n{\n    for\
      \ (auto& item : GetAllAvailableItems())\n    {\n        if (ShouldSellItem(player,\
      \ item.GetGUID(), GetDefaultSellingStrategy()))\n        {\n            AddItemToVendorInventory(item);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the vendor interaction system and may be called frequently
    during vendor updates or player interactions. It's recommended to cache results
    where possible for performance optimization. The SellingStrategy object should
    be properly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also ensure
    itemGuid corresponds to an actual existing item in the game world.
