  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: InitializeTriggers
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::InitializeTriggers()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the triggers for the leader follow behavior AI.
  description: The InitializeTriggers method sets up and configures all necessary
    event triggers that govern how a creature behaves when following a leader in the
    World of Warcraft environment. This method is typically called during the initialization
    phase of an AI behavior system to register callbacks for events such as the leader's
    movement, combat state changes, or health status updates. It ensures that the
    follower creature responds appropriately to changes in its leader's actions and
    maintains proper positioning and engagement within the group.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'LeaderFollowBehavior behavior;

      behavior.InitializeTriggers();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the AI behavior setup phase.
    It is expected to register all necessary event handlers with the core game engine,
    which will then invoke appropriate callbacks when events occur. The triggers initialized
    here are crucial for maintaining proper group dynamics in instances or raids.
  warnings: Do not call this method multiple times on the same instance as it may
    result in duplicate trigger registrations and unexpected behavior. Ensure that
    all required dependencies for the leader follow AI are properly initialized before
    calling this method.
