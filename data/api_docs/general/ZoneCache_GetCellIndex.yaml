  class: ZoneCache
  method: GetCellIndex
  signature: uint32 ZoneCache::GetCellIndex(float x, float y) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the cell index for a given world coordinate within
    the zone cache.
  description: The GetCellIndex method computes a unique cell identifier based on
    the provided world coordinates (x, y) within the ZoneCache's grid system. This
    index is used internally by TrinityCore to efficiently manage and query game objects,
    players, and other entities within specific spatial regions. The method performs
    coordinate normalization and grid indexing to determine which cell a given position
    belongs to, enabling optimized spatial queries and object management. The returned
    index corresponds to a specific cell in the zone's grid structure, where each
    cell represents a defined area of the world map.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the unique cell index within the ZoneCache
    grid system. This index can be used to access or manipulate objects within that
    specific spatial region.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float x = 100.5f;

      float y = 200.3f;

      uint32 cellIndex = zoneCache.GetCellIndex(x, y);

      // cellIndex now contains the grid cell identifier for position (100.5, 200.3)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ZoneCache has been properly initialized with
    valid grid dimensions and that the input coordinates are within the valid world
    bounds. The implementation likely uses integer division and coordinate normalization
    to map floating-point positions to discrete grid cells.
