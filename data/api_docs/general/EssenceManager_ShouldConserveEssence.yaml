documentation:
  brief: Determines whether essence conservation mechanics should be applied to the
    player
  description: The ShouldConserveEssence method evaluates the current state of the
    player's essence management system to determine if essence conservation rules
    should be enforced. This typically involves checking if the player has reached
    a threshold where essence conservation becomes active, such as when their essence
    reserves are low or when specific gameplay conditions are met. The method is used
    by the game engine to control how essence is consumed and managed during various
    activities like spell casting, ability usage, or resource generation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if essence conservation mechanics should be applied, false
    otherwise. When true, the system will enforce reduced essence consumption rates
    or alternative behavior for essence-based abilities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (player->GetEssenceManager()->ShouldConserveEssence()) {\n    // Apply\
      \ conservation mechanics\n    player->ApplyEssenceConservation();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during gameplay state updates and ability
    execution to dynamically adjust essence consumption behavior. The implementation
    may consider factors such as player level, class specialization, active buffs/debuffs,
    and current essence reserves.
