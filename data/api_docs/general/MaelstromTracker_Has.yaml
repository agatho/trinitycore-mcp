  class: MaelstromTracker
  method: Has
  signature: bool MaelstromTracker::Has(uint32 amount) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the MaelstromTracker has a specific amount of maelstrom resource
    available.
  description: The Has method determines whether the MaelstromTracker contains a specified
    amount of maelstrom resource. This is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework to verify if a player or unit possesses enough maelstrom for certain
    abilities or effects. The method performs a simple comparison against the internal
    stored amount and returns true if the tracker holds at least the requested amount,
    false otherwise. This functionality is integral to handling maelstrom-based mechanics
    such as Storm, Earth, and Fire abilities in the game.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the MaelstromTracker contains at least the specified amount
    of maelstrom resource; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (maelstromTracker.Has(50)) {\n    // Player has at least 50 maelstrom\n\
      \    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_STORM_ELEMENTAL, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ability Activation
    code: "if (maelstromTracker.Has(100) && player->HasAura(SPELL_MASTERY_AURA)) {\n\
      \    // Player has sufficient maelstrom and mastery aura\n    player->CastSpell(nullptr,\
      \ SPELL_EARTH_ELEMENTAL, true);\n} else if (maelstromTracker.Has(75)) {\n  \
      \  // Player has at least 75 maelstrom for basic ability\n    player->CastSpell(nullptr,\
      \ SPELL_FIRE_ELEMENTAL, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not modify the internal state of the MaelstromTracker. It
    is a read-only check that compares against the current stored amount. The implementation
    likely uses a simple comparison operation and should be efficient for frequent
    checks during gameplay.
