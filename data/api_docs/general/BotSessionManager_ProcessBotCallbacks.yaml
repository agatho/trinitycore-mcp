  class: BotSessionManager
  method: ProcessBotCallbacks
  signature: void BotSessionManager::ProcessBotCallbacks(WorldSession * session)
documentation:
  brief: Processes pending bot callbacks for the specified WorldSession.
  description: The ProcessBotCallbacks method handles execution of queued bot-related
    actions and events associated with a specific WorldSession. This method is typically
    invoked during the session's update cycle to ensure that all bot commands, AI
    decisions, and state changes are properly processed in a timely manner. It manages
    the flow of asynchronous operations such as movement commands, spell casts, and
    interaction events from bots controlled by the session. The method ensures that
    bot behavior remains synchronized with the game world state and player actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Session Update Loop
    code: "void WorldSession::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other session updates\
      \ ...\n    if (GetBotSessionManager())\n        GetBotSessionManager()->ProcessBotCallbacks(this);\n\
      \    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the session's update cycle
    to maintain proper bot responsiveness. It is designed to be non-blocking and typically
    processes callbacks in a batch manner to avoid performance degradation. The implementation
    assumes that all relevant bot data structures are properly initialized before
    invocation.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring proper session initialization may
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the BotSessionManager instance
    exists and is valid before invoking this method.
