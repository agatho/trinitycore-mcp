  signature: void RestorationSwiftmendTracker::UseSwiftmend()
documentation:
  brief: Executes the Swiftmend spell usage logic for restoration shamans.
  description: The UseSwiftmend method triggers the application of the Swiftmend spell
    effect, which is a healing ability used by restoration shamans in World of Warcraft.
    This method typically handles the internal logic for applying the heal, managing
    cooldowns, and updating the player's spell state. It may also interact with the
    target's health system to apply the healing effect and potentially trigger additional
    effects such as mana regeneration or aura updates. The method is designed to be
    called when a restoration shaman intends to use Swiftmend on a target.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'RestorationSwiftmendTracker tracker;

      tracker.UseSwiftmend();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger spell handling system and may depend
    on proper initialization of the shaman's spell state. It should only be called
    when the player has the necessary resources (mana, target, etc.) to cast Swiftmend.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying preconditions such as available
    mana or valid target may lead to undefined behavior or client/server synchronization
    issues in TrinityCore.
