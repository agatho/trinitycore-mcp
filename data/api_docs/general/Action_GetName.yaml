documentation:
  brief: Returns the name of the action
  description: The GetName method retrieves the human-readable name associated with
    an Action object. This name typically represents the action's purpose or function
    within the game's AI system. The returned string is immutable and should not be
    modified directly. This method is commonly used for debugging, logging, or displaying
    action information to players or developers. The implementation ensures thread-safe
    access to the internal name storage, making it safe to call from multiple threads
    simultaneously.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the name of the action.
    The string is guaranteed to be valid and non-empty for properly initialized Action
    objects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Action* action = new Action();

      std::cout << "Action name: " << action->GetName() << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Debug Logging
    code: "void LogCurrentAction(Action* current_action) {\n    if (current_action)\
      \ {\n        TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"ai\", \"Executing action: %s\", current_action->GetName().c_str());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned std::string reference is valid only as long as the Action object
    exists. The method performs no dynamic allocation and returns a cached internal
    string, making it efficient for frequent calls.
