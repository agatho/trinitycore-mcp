  brief: Initiates the lunar eclipse state for a balance druid character.
  description: The EnterLunarEclipse method transitions a balance druid into the lunar
    eclipse state, which modifies their spell casting behavior and effects. This method
    is typically invoked when a druid's Eclipse state changes from solar to lunar,
    affecting abilities like Starfire and Moonfire. The method updates internal tracking
    variables and applies necessary aura effects or modifiers to reflect the lunar
    eclipse condition in the game world.

    code: "BalanceEclipseTracker* tracker = player->GetSpellModOwner();\nif (tracker)\n\
      {\n    tracker->EnterLunarEclipse();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the druid is eligible to enter lunar
    eclipse, typically based on their current Eclipse state and spell casting conditions.
    It modifies internal state variables and may trigger additional game events or
    visual effects.
