  class: MovementRequest
  method: GetFollowParams
  signature: const FollowMovementParams & MovementRequest::GetFollowParams() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the follow movement parameters associated with this movement request.
  description: The GetFollowParams method provides access to the structured data defining
    how a unit should follow another unit or object. This includes parameters such
    as distance, angle, and behavior flags that control the follower's movement pattern.
    The returned reference is const, ensuring that the internal state of the movement
    request cannot be modified through this accessor. This method is typically used
    in AI logic and movement handling systems to determine how a creature or player
    should position itself relative to a target during a follow action.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a FollowMovementParams structure containing all
    relevant parameters for the follow movement behavior, including distance, angle,
    and movement flags.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Follow Parameters in AI
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override {\n        if (m_movementRequest)\n        {\n            const FollowMovementParams&\
      \ params = m_movementRequest->GetFollowParams();\n            // Use params.distance,\
      \ params.angle, etc.\n            if (params.distance > 10.0f)\n           \
      \     DoMoveToTarget();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to internal data within the MovementRequest
    object and should not be stored or used beyond the scope of the current function
    call. The FollowMovementParams structure contains default values for all fields,
    so accessing any field is safe even if specific values were not explicitly set.
