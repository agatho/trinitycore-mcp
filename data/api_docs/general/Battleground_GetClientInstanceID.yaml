  class: Battleground
  method: GetClientInstanceID
  signature: int Battleground::GetClientInstanceID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the client instance ID associated with the battleground.
  description: The GetClientInstanceID method retrieves the unique identifier used
    by the client to distinguish different instances of a battleground. This ID is
    essential for proper client-server synchronization and ensures that players are
    matched into the correct battleground instance. The returned value typically corresponds
    to the instance ID of the map where the battleground is taking place, allowing
    the game engine to manage multiple simultaneous battlegrounds correctly.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the client instance ID for this battleground. This
    value usually matches the instance ID of the underlying map or zone where the
    battleground is active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);

      int instanceId = bg->GetClientInstanceID();

      printf("Battleground client instance ID: %d\n", instanceId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework to
    handle battleground instance management. The returned value should not be modified
    directly as it's managed by the battleground system.
