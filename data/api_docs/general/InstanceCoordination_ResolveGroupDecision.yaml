  method: ResolveGroupDecision
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::ResolveGroupDecision(Group * group, const
    std::string & decision)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and applies a group decision for instance coordination.
  description: The ResolveGroupDecision method handles the resolution of decisions
    made by a group within the context of instance coordination. This typically occurs
    during group-based instance encounters where multiple players must make collective
    decisions, such as choosing a path, selecting a strategy, or agreeing on an action.
    The method processes the provided decision string and applies appropriate logic
    to synchronize the group's state or modify instance behavior accordingly. It is
    designed to work with TrinityCore's group management and instance handling systems.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object for which the decision is being resolved.
      Must be a valid group pointer, typically representing a player group participating
      in an instance encounter.
  - name: decision
    description: String containing the decision made by the group. This string typically
      represents a choice or action that affects the instance coordination logic,
      such as 'accept', 'decline', 'proceed', or custom decision identifiers.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Decision Resolution
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    instanceCoordination->ResolveGroupDecision(group,\
      \ \"accept\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Decision Handling
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && group->IsLeader(player))\n\
      {\n    std::string decision = \"proceed\";\n    instanceCoordination->ResolveGroupDecision(group,\
      \ decision);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal instance coordination state machines
    and may trigger further actions such as updating group member states, modifying
    instance timers, or sending synchronization packets to clients. The implementation
    details are not visible in the source code provided.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer is valid before calling this method to prevent
    null pointer dereferences. The decision string should be validated against expected
    values to avoid unexpected behavior in instance coordination logic.
