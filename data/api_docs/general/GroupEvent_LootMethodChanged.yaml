  class: GroupEvent
  method: LootMethodChanged
  signature: GroupEvent GroupEvent::LootMethodChanged(int groupGuid, uint8 lootMethod)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a GroupEvent object indicating that the loot method for a group has
    changed.
  description: The LootMethodChanged method is a static factory function within the
    GroupEvent class that constructs and returns a new GroupEvent instance to represent
    a change in the loot method for a specific group. This event is typically triggered
    when a group's loot settings are modified, such as switching from free-for-all
    looting to round-robin or master loot. The returned event encapsulates the group
    identifier and the new loot method, allowing subsystems to react to this change
    appropriately. This method serves as part of TrinityCore's group management system
    and is used internally to propagate group state changes throughout the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: groupGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group whose loot method has changed.
      This value identifies the specific group in the game world.
  - name: lootMethod
    description: The new loot method being applied to the group. Valid values are
      typically defined by the game's loot system, such as 0 for free-for-all, 1 for
      round-robin, and 2 for master loot.
  returns: A new GroupEvent object representing the loot method change for the specified
    group. The event contains the group GUID and the updated loot method information.
  examples:
  - title: Creating a Loot Method Changed Event
    code: GroupEvent event = GroupEvent::LootMethodChanged(12345, 2); // Group 12345
      switches to master loot
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the Event in a Group Management Context
    code: "void HandleGroupLootChange(uint32 groupId, uint8 newMethod) {\n    GroupEvent\
      \ event = GroupEvent::LootMethodChanged(groupId, newMethod);\n    // Broadcast\
      \ the event to all group members\n    sWorld->SendGlobalMessage(event);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a static factory function and does not modify any existing
    state directly. It simply creates an event object that can be used for further
    processing or broadcasting. The group GUID should be validated before calling
    this method to ensure it refers to an active group in the game world.
  warnings: Ensure that the groupGuid parameter corresponds to a valid, existing group
    in the current game world context. Passing an invalid or non-existent group GUID
    may lead to undefined behavior or errors in downstream systems that process the
    event.
