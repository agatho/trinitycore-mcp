  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleAuraModIncreaseFlightSpeed(const AuraApplication
    * aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the flight speed of an aura application when applied or removed.
  description: The HandleAuraModIncreaseFlightSpeed method is responsible for adjusting
    the flight speed of a player or creature when an aura that modifies flight speed
    is applied or removed. This method is typically invoked during the application
    or removal of auras such as those providing increased flight speed through buffs,
    debuffs, or environmental effects. It directly manipulates the movement speed
    attributes of the affected unit based on the aura's properties and the specified
    mode (application or removal). The method ensures that flight speed changes are
    properly synchronized with the game state and applied to the correct unit.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. This parameter contains information about the aura's target,
      duration, and other properties that influence how flight speed is modified.
  - name: mode
    description: An unsigned 8-bit integer indicating the mode of operation. Typically
      represents whether the aura is being applied (1) or removed (0). This value
      determines how the flight speed modification should be processed.
  - name: apply
    description: A boolean flag that indicates whether the aura is being applied (true)
      or removed (false). When true, the method increases flight speed; when false,
      it restores normal flight speed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying a Flight Speed Aura
    code: 'AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication();

      HandleAuraModIncreaseFlightSpeed(app, 1, true);

      // Increases flight speed of the target unit'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing a Flight Speed Aura
    code: 'AuraApplication* app = GetAuraApplication();

      HandleAuraModIncreaseFlightSpeed(app, 0, false);

      // Restores normal flight speed of the target unit'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the aura handling system in TrinityCore and interacts
    with the movement speed subsystem. It should be called only when the aura's state
    changes to ensure proper synchronization with the game world. The method assumes
    that the target unit supports flight mechanics.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of the mode or apply parameters can lead to unexpected
    flight speed behavior. Ensure that this method is not called outside of the proper
    aura application lifecycle to prevent inconsistencies in movement attributes.
