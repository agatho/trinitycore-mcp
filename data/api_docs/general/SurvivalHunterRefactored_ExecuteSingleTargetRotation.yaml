  signature: void SurvivalHunterRefactored::ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the survival hunter's single-target combat rotation logic.
  description: The ExecuteSingleTargetRotation method implements the core decision-making
    logic for a survival hunter's single-target combat rotation. This method evaluates
    the current combat state, available abilities, and target conditions to determine
    the optimal sequence of actions. It typically involves checking for cooldowns,
    managing resource usage (such as focus or energy), assessing threat levels, and
    selecting appropriate spells or abilities based on the hunter's current situation.
    The method is designed to be called during the AI update cycle when the hunter
    is engaged in single-target combat.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target object that the hunter will perform the rotation
      against. This parameter represents the current enemy unit being targeted by
      the hunter.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "void MyHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        Unit* target = me->GetVictim();\n        if (target && !target->IsDead())\n\
      \        {\n            m_hunter->ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(&target);\n  \
      \      }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the AI update loop of a survival hunter.
    It assumes that the hunter has an active target and is in combat. The implementation
    may involve complex state management for tracking cooldowns, resource levels,
    and tactical positioning.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid Unit object before
    calling this method, as dereferencing a null pointer will cause undefined behavior.
    This method should only be called when the hunter is actually in combat with a
    valid target.
