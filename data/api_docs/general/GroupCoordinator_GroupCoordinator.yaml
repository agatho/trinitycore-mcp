  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: GroupCoordinator
  signature: void GroupCoordinator::GroupCoordinator(Player * bot, BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new GroupCoordinator instance with the specified bot player
    and AI controller.
  description: The GroupCoordinator constructor initializes a new group coordination
    object for managing bot behavior within a player group. This method sets up internal
    references to both the bot player entity and its associated AI controller, enabling
    coordinated group actions such as positioning, targeting, and tactical decision-making.
    The initialization process ensures that the coordinator can properly communicate
    with the bot's AI system and maintain synchronization with group activities. This
    constructor is typically called during bot creation or when establishing group
    coordination for a specific player-controlled bot.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that this coordinator
      will manage. Must not be null and should represent a valid bot character in
      the game world.
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI object that controls the behavior of the specified
      bot. Must not be null and should correspond to the AI system managing the bot's
      actions and decisions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic GroupCoordinator Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get reference to bot player

      BotAI* myAI = ...;     // Get reference to bot AI

      GroupCoordinator coordinator(myBot, myAI); // Initialize coordinator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing GroupCoordinator in Bot Creation Context
    code: "void CreateBot(Player* player)\n{\n    Player* bot = ...; // Create or\
      \ retrieve bot player\n    BotAI* ai = new BotAI(bot);\n    GroupCoordinator*\
      \ coordinator = new GroupCoordinator(bot, ai);\n    // Further setup and group\
      \ assignment\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any network synchronization or world state
    updates. It simply establishes internal references. The actual group coordination
    behavior is managed through other methods in the GroupCoordinator class that are
    called during gameplay operations.
  warnings: Ensure that both the bot and ai parameters are valid, non-null pointers
    before calling this constructor. Passing null pointers will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. The bot must already be initialized in the game world for
    proper coordination to function.
