documentation:
  brief: Checks if the Arms Warrior has the Tactical Mastery talent active.
  description: This method determines whether the Arms Warrior class currently possesses
    the Tactical Mastery talent, which provides a damage bonus when using certain
    abilities. The check typically involves verifying the presence of the talent in
    the player's talent tree and ensuring that any relevant buff or state is active.
    This method is commonly used in combat logic to adjust damage calculations or
    ability usage based on the warrior's current talent configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Tactical Mastery talent is active and applicable; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Logic
    code: "if (warrior->HasTacticalMastery()) {\n    // Apply additional damage multiplier\
      \ or effect\n    damage *= 1.15f;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ability Activation
    code: "if (warrior->HasTacticalMastery() && target->GetHealthPct() < 30.0f) {\n\
      \    // Use an ability that benefits from Tactical Mastery\n    warrior->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_BLOODTHIRST_TACTICAL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks both the talent's presence in the player's spec
    and any active buffs or effects associated with it. It may be called frequently
    during combat, so performance should be considered in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the warrior instance is valid before calling this method to
    avoid accessing invalid memory. The method assumes the player has a valid talent
    tree state, which might not always be true in all game states or during loading
    sequences.
