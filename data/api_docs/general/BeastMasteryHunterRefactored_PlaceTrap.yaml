  class: BeastMasteryHunterRefactored
  method: PlaceTrap
  signature: void BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::PlaceTrap(uint32 param0, int param1)
documentation:
  brief: Places a trap using the specified parameters for Beast Mastery hunter class.
  description: The PlaceTrap method is used by the Beast Mastery Hunter specialization
    to deploy a trap at the target location. This method typically handles the logic
    for trap placement, including validation of the trap type, positioning, and activation.
    It integrates with the hunter's pet management system to ensure that traps are
    placed effectively in conjunction with the hunter's beast companion. The method
    may also handle cooldowns, resource consumption, and visual effects associated
    with trap deployment.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The trap type or ID to be placed. This parameter determines which
      specific trap ability is deployed, such as a snare trap, explosive trap, or
      freezing trap.
  - name: param1
    description: The target position or index for trap placement. This may represent
      the x/y coordinates of the location where the trap should be placed, or an index
      value used to select a specific trap slot.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trap Placement
    code: 'BeastMasteryHunterRefactored hunter;

      hunter.PlaceTrap(12345, 100); // Places a trap of type 12345 at position 100'
    language: cpp
  - title: Trap Placement with Dynamic Coordinates
    code: 'BeastMasteryHunterRefactored hunter;

      Position targetPos = player->GetPosition();

      hunter.PlaceTrap(67890, static_cast<int>(targetPos.GetX())); // Places a trap
      at the player''s X coordinate'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Beast Mastery hunter's core gameplay mechanics
    and should only be called when the hunter has sufficient resources and is in a
    valid state to place traps. The implementation may include checks for pet presence,
    trap cooldowns, and environmental restrictions.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without validating parameters can lead to
    invalid trap placement or game state corruption. Ensure that param0 corresponds
    to a valid trap type and param1 represents a valid position or index within the
    expected range.
