  signature: void WorldSession::HandleSetAdvancedCombatLogging(WorldPackets::ClientConfig::SetAdvancedCombatLogging
    & setAdvancedCombatLogging)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the advanced combat logging state for the player's session.
  description: This method handles the client's request to enable or disable advanced
    combat logging. Advanced combat logging provides detailed combat information including
    damage numbers, spell effects, and other combat-related events that are typically
    not displayed in standard combat log. The method processes the incoming packet
    from the client and updates the session's combat logging settings accordingly.
    This functionality is primarily used for debugging, development, or specialized
    gameplay analysis.
  parameters:
  - name: setAdvancedCombatLogging
    description: A packet containing the advanced combat logging state flag sent by
      the client. The packet includes a boolean value indicating whether advanced
      combat logging should be enabled (true) or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in session handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSetAdvancedCombatLogging(WorldPackets::ClientConfig::SetAdvancedCombatLogging&\
      \ setAdvancedCombatLogging)\n{\n    // Process the advanced combat logging setting\n\
      \    SetAdvancedCombatLog(setAdvancedCombatLogging.Enabled);\n    // Log the\
      \ change for debugging purposes\n    if (setAdvancedCombatLogging.Enabled)\n\
      \        sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_NETWORKIO, \"Player %s enabled advanced combat\
      \ logging.\", GetPlayer()->GetName().c_str());\n    else\n        sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_NETWORKIO,\
      \ \"Player %s disabled advanced combat logging.\", GetPlayer()->GetName().c_str());\n\
      }"

  notes: This method is typically called when a player changes their combat logging
    preferences through the game interface. The session maintains the state of this
    setting, which may affect how combat events are processed and displayed to the
    player. Implementation should consider performance implications when processing
    large amounts of combat data.
