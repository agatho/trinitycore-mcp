  class: CooldownStackingOptimizer
  method: RegisterCooldown
  signature: void CooldownStackingOptimizer::RegisterCooldown(const CooldownData &
    data)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a cooldown data entry for tracking and optimization within the
    cooldown stacking system.
  description: The RegisterCooldown method is used to add a new cooldown entry to
    the CooldownStackingOptimizer's internal tracking system. This method allows the
    system to monitor and manage multiple cooldowns, ensuring proper stacking behavior
    and optimization based on game mechanics such as spell interactions, talent effects,
    or item bonuses. It typically expects a CooldownData structure containing relevant
    information about the cooldown, including its duration, category, and any associated
    identifiers. The registration process is essential for maintaining accurate cooldown
    state tracking across different game events and player actions.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: A constant reference to a CooldownData structure containing all necessary
      information about the cooldown to be registered, including duration, category,
      spell ID, and other relevant metadata for tracking and optimization purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cooldown Registration
    code: 'CooldownData data;

      data.spellId = 12345;

      data.duration = 30000; // 30 seconds in milliseconds

      data.category = COOLDOWN_CATEGORY_SPELL;

      cooldownOptimizer.RegisterCooldown(data);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering a Cooldown with Custom Metadata
    code: 'CooldownData data;

      data.spellId = 67890;

      data.duration = 15000; // 15 seconds

      data.category = COOLDOWN_CATEGORY_ITEM;

      data.sourceGuid = player->GetGUID();

      cooldownOptimizer.RegisterCooldown(data);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called whenever a new cooldown is initiated or modified
    in the game world. The internal tracking system relies on accurate registration
    to prevent incorrect stacking behavior and ensure proper cooldown resolution.
    It's recommended to register cooldowns immediately upon activation, especially
    for abilities that may interact with other cooldowns.
  warnings: Failure to properly register cooldowns can lead to incorrect stacking
    behavior or missed cooldown optimizations. Avoid calling this method with invalid
    or uninitialized CooldownData structures, as it could cause undefined behavior
    in the optimization system.
