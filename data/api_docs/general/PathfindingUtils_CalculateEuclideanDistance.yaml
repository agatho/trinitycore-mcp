  class: PathfindingUtils
  method: CalculateEuclideanDistance
  signature: float PathfindingUtils::CalculateEuclideanDistance(const int & a, const
    int & b)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in a 2D coordinate system.
  description: The CalculateEuclideanDistance method computes the straight-line distance
    between two points represented as integers, typically used for pathfinding and
    spatial calculations within the TrinityCore framework. This utility function is
    commonly employed to determine movement costs or proximity checks between game
    entities such as NPCs, players, or waypoints. The method takes two integer parameters
    that represent coordinates (likely X and Y values) and returns a floating-point
    value representing the calculated distance using the standard Euclidean formula.
    It's an essential component for navigation systems and AI behavior in World of
    Warcraft-style environments.
  parameters:
  - name: a
    description: The first coordinate value (typically X or Y position) used in distance
      calculation
  - name: b
    description: The second coordinate value (typically X or Y position) used in distance
      calculation
  returns: A float value representing the Euclidean distance between the two provided
    coordinates. Returns zero if both coordinates are identical, and positive values
    for all other cases.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: float distance = PathfindingUtils::CalculateEuclideanDistance(10, 20);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Coordinate Pairs
    code: 'int x1 = 5, y1 = 10;

      int x2 = 15, y2 = 20;

      float distance = PathfindingUtils::CalculateEuclideanDistance(x1, x2) + PathfindingUtils::CalculateEuclideanDistance(y1,
      y2);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the parameters represent coordinates in a 2D plane.
    The implementation likely uses the formula sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2) where x1
    and y1 are derived from parameter 'a' and x2 and y2 are derived from parameter
    'b'. For performance-critical applications, consider using squared distances to
    avoid expensive square root calculations.
  warnings: Be cautious when passing very large integer values as coordinates, which
    may lead to overflow issues in intermediate calculations. Also note that this
    method only calculates distance between two scalar values, not full 3D positions.
