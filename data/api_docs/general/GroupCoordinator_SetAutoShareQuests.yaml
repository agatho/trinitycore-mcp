documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables automatic quest sharing for the group coordinator.
  description: The SetAutoShareQuests method configures whether quests discovered
    by group members are automatically shared with other group members. When enabled,
    newly acquired quests will be automatically offered to all eligible group members.
    This functionality is typically used in group coordination scenarios where seamless
    quest progression is desired. The setting affects the behavior of the group coordinator's
    quest sharing logic and may influence how quest data is propagated within the
    group context.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      automatic quest sharing for the group coordinator.
  returns: null

  - title: Disable Auto Share Quests
    code: 'GroupCoordinator* coordinator = ...;

      coordinator->SetAutoShareQuests(false);'

  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the GroupCoordinator and affects
    subsequent quest sharing behavior. It does not retroactively share previously
    discovered quests with group members.
