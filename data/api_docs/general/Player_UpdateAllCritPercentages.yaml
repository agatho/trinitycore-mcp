documentation:
  brief: Updates all critical strike percentages for the player based on current stats
    and modifiers
  description: The UpdateAllCritPercentages method recalculates and applies all critical
    strike chance modifiers for a player character. This includes updating crit chances
    for melee attacks, ranged attacks, and spell casting based on the player's current
    attributes, equipment, buffs, debuffs, and any active aura effects. The method
    ensures that the player's critical strike percentages are accurately reflected
    in combat calculations. This function is typically invoked when stat changes occur
    that could affect critical strike chances, such as equipment swaps, level-ups,
    or buff/debuff updates.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateAllCritPercentages();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage After Equipment Change
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      // After equipping new gear

      player->UpdateAllCritPercentages();

      // Critical strike chances are now updated to reflect new equipment'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally calls various stat calculation functions and updates
    the player's crit chance values stored in their combat statistics. It should be
    called whenever there's a potential change to critical strike modifiers, but excessive
    calls may impact performance during rapid stat changes.
