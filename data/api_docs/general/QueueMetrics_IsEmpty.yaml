documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the queue metrics container is empty
  description: The IsEmpty method determines if the QueueMetrics object contains no
    queued items or data. This method is typically used to verify the state of a queue
    before attempting operations that require non-empty queues. In the context of
    TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server implementation, this could be relevant
    for managing player queues, such as those for battlegrounds, arenas, or other
    queued activities. The method performs a simple check on internal data structures
    and returns immediately without side effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the queue metrics container contains no items, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the queue is in an empty state suitable for certain operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check queue state
    code: "QueueMetrics metrics;\nif (metrics.IsEmpty()) {\n    // Handle empty queue\
      \ case\n    printf(\"Queue is currently empty\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ non-empty queue case\n    printf(\"Queue contains items\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a constant operation and does not modify the state of the
    QueueMetrics object. It's designed for fast evaluation and should not be used
    in performance-critical paths where frequent checks might impact server responsiveness.
