  method: GetInstanceId
  signature: int InstanceScriptDataReader::GetInstanceId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier of the current instance.
  description: The GetInstanceId method returns the unique identifier assigned to
    the current instance script. This identifier is used internally by TrinityCore
    to track and manage different instance worlds, such as dungeon instances or raid
    encounters. The returned value corresponds to the instance's ID in the database
    and is essential for identifying which specific instance a player is currently
    in. This method is typically called during instance-related events or when managing
    instance-specific data.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique identifier of the current instance.
    A value of 0 typically indicates that the script is not associated with an active
    instance, while positive integers correspond to valid instance IDs found in the
    database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "class MyInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnPlayerEnter(Player*\
      \ player) override\n    {\n        int instanceId = GetInstanceId();\n     \
      \   if (instanceId > 0)\n        {\n            // Perform instance-specific\
      \ actions\n            sLog->outString(\"Player entered instance %d\", instanceId);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within an active InstanceScript context.
    The returned ID is guaranteed to be valid only while the instance script is loaded
    and active.
