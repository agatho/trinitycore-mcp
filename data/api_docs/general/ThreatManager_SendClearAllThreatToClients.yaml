documentation:
  brief: Sends a message to all clients to clear all threat entries for the associated
    unit.
  description: The SendClearAllThreatToClients method is responsible for notifying
    all connected clients that the threat list for the unit managed by this ThreatManager
    should be cleared. This typically occurs when a unit's threat state needs to be
    reset, such as during certain boss encounters or when a creature becomes neutral
    towards players. The method ensures that client-side threat displays are synchronized
    with the server's internal threat management state. It is commonly invoked during
    combat reset scenarios or when transitioning between different phases of an encounter.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing Threat for a Boss Encounter
    code: "void BossAI::ResetThreat()\n{\n    if (me->GetThreatManager())\n    {\n\
      \        me->GetThreatManager()->SendClearAllThreatToClients();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the assumption that the ThreatManager is properly
    initialized and associated with a valid unit. It is typically called during combat
    state transitions or when resetting encounter mechanics. The actual network message
    sent to clients may vary based on the server's configuration and patch version.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause desynchronization between client
    and server threat states, potentially leading to incorrect combat behavior or
    visual glitches for players. This method should only be called when a complete
    threat reset is intended, not during normal combat operations.
