  class: BotWorldEntry
  method: LoadCharacterData
  signature: bool BotWorldEntry::LoadCharacterData()
documentation:
  brief: Loads character data for a bot world entry, initializing its internal state
    from stored information.
  description: The LoadCharacterData method retrieves and initializes all relevant
    character data associated with a bot world entry. This includes loading player-specific
    attributes, inventory items, skills, and other persistent game state information
    from the database or memory cache. The method ensures that the bot's character
    is fully configured before it becomes active in the game world. It typically gets
    invoked during the initialization phase of a bot instance, ensuring that all necessary
    data is available for gameplay operations. This method may perform database queries
    or cache lookups depending on how the bot system is implemented within TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the character data was successfully loaded and initialized;
    otherwise returns false if loading failed due to missing data, database errors,
    or invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "BotWorldEntry entry;\nbool success = entry.LoadCharacterData();\nif (success)\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with bot operations\n    std::cout << \"Bot character data\
      \ loaded successfully.\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle load failure\n\
      \    std::cerr << \"Failed to load bot character data.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the BotWorldEntry object has been
    properly initialized and associated with a valid character. It is recommended
    to check the return value before proceeding with any bot-specific operations that
    depend on loaded data.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the underlying data
    structures may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all required
    dependencies are available before invoking LoadCharacterData.
