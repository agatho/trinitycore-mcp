  class: BattlegroundMap
  method: BattlegroundMap
  signature: void BattlegroundMap::BattlegroundMap(uint32 id, time_t param1, uint32
    InstanceId, Difficulty spawnMode)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a battleground map instance with specified parameters.
  description: The BattlegroundMap constructor initializes a new battleground map
    instance. It sets up the map with a unique identifier, timestamp, instance ID,
    and spawn difficulty mode. This method is typically called during battleground
    creation or loading to establish the map's core properties. The initialization
    process handles internal map setup including player spawning configurations based
    on the provided difficulty mode.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: Unique identifier for the battleground type. This corresponds to
      the battleground template ID used in the game database.
  - name: param1
    description: Timestamp value representing when the battleground instance was created
      or started. Used for tracking duration and timing-related mechanics.
  - name: InstanceId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific instance of this battleground.
      Each battleground instance has its own ID to distinguish multiple simultaneous
      games.
  - name: spawnMode
    description: Difficulty level or spawn mode that determines how players are spawned
      and what content is available. Values typically correspond to Difficulty enum
      values (normal, heroic, etc.).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic battleground map initialization
    code: 'BattlegroundMap bgMap(1234, time(nullptr), 5678, DIFFICULTY_NORMAL);

      // Creates a new battleground map for battleground type 1234 with current timestamp,

      // instance ID 5678, and normal difficulty spawn mode.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Heroic mode battleground initialization
    code: 'uint32 bgId = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattlegroundTemplateId(BG_TYPE_WARSONG_GULCH);

      uint32 instanceId = sMapMgr->GenerateInstanceId();

      BattlegroundMap bgMap(bgId, time(nullptr), instanceId, DIFFICULTY_HEROIC);

      // Initializes a new heroic battleground map for Warsong Gulch with generated
      instance ID.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the battleground management
    system. Developers should not directly instantiate BattlegroundMap objects unless
    implementing custom battleground logic. The method performs essential setup for
    battleground functionality including map configuration and player spawning rules.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of BattlegroundMap should be avoided in normal gameplay
    code as it bypasses proper battleground lifecycle management. The constructor
    assumes valid parameters and does not perform extensive validation, so incorrect
    parameter values may lead to undefined behavior.
