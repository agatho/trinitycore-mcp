  class: InterruptAwareness
  method: GetLastScanTimeMs
  signature: uint32 InterruptAwareness::GetLastScanTimeMs() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the timestamp of the last interrupt scan performed by the InterruptAwareness
    system.
  description: The GetLastScanTimeMs method retrieves the last recorded time when
    the InterruptAwareness system performed an interrupt scan. This is typically used
    to determine how recently the system checked for potential interrupts or interruptions
    in gameplay events such as spell casting, movement, or combat actions. The returned
    value represents a millisecond timestamp since system startup, making it suitable
    for calculating time deltas between scans. This method does not modify any internal
    state and is safe to call from any thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of milliseconds elapsed since system
    startup when the last interrupt scan occurred. If no scan has been performed yet,
    it returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Check time since last interrupt scan
    code: 'uint32 lastScanTime = interruptAwareness->GetLastScanTimeMs();

      uint32 currentTime = getMSTime();

      uint32 timeSinceLastScan = currentTime - lastScanTime;

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Time since last interrupt scan: %u ms", timeSinceLastScan);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other timing functions
    to implement cooldowns or periodic checks. The timestamp returned is based on
    the system's monotonic clock, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of system
    time adjustments.
