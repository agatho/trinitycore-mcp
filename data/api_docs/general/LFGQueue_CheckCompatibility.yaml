  class: LFGQueue
  method: CheckCompatibility
  signature: LfgCompatibility LFGQueue::CheckCompatibility(int check)
documentation:
  brief: Checks compatibility of the player's LFG queue status with current group
    requirements
  description: The CheckCompatibility method evaluates whether a player's current
    LFG (Looking For Group) queue status is compatible with existing group requirements
    or pending matches. It returns a LfgCompatibility enum value that indicates the
    level of compatibility between the player's queued data and the current group
    state. This method is typically used during group formation processes to determine
    if a player can be added to an existing group or if they need to wait for a different
    match. The method considers factors such as role availability, dungeon requirements,
    and player restrictions when making its determination.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'Returns a LfgCompatibility enum value indicating the compatibility status.
    Possible values include: LFG_COMPATIBILITY_OK (compatible), LFG_COMPATIBILITY_DIFFERENT_CONTENT
    (different content requirements), LFG_COMPATIBILITY_TOO_MUCH_PLAYERS (too many
    players for group), LFG_COMPATIBILITY_TOO_FEW_PLAYERS (too few players for group),
    and LFG_COMPATIBILITY_INCONSISTENT (inconsistent group state).'
  examples:
  - title: Basic compatibility check usage
    code: "LfgCompatibility compat = lfgQueue->CheckCompatibility(0);\nif (compat\
      \ == LFG_COMPATIBILITY_OK)\n{\n    // Player can join the group\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player is compatible with current group\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a player is actively queued for LFG
    content. The compatibility check may involve accessing shared data structures
    and should be performed in a thread-safe context. The method does not modify any
    internal state of the queue but rather evaluates it.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of proper LFG queue contexts as it may
    return unexpected results. The returned enum values should be checked carefully
    to ensure proper group formation logic is maintained throughout the LFG system.
