  class: Player
  method: UpdateEnchantTime
  signature: void Player::UpdateEnchantTime(uint32 time)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the enchantment time remaining on items equipped by the player.
  description: The UpdateEnchantTime method adjusts the duration remaining on active
    enchantments applied to items currently equipped by the player. This method is
    typically invoked periodically by the game server to decrement enchantment timers
    and handle expiration of temporary item effects. It ensures that enchantments
    properly expire and that associated visual effects or stat modifications are removed
    from the player's character. The method operates on all equipped items that have
    active enchantments, updating their remaining time based on the provided time
    delta.
  parameters:
  - name: time
    description: The time delta in milliseconds to subtract from enchantment timers.
      This value represents how much time has passed since the last update and is
      used to decrement the remaining duration of active enchantments.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game tick processing
    code: "void GameWorld::UpdatePlayerEnchants(uint32 diff)\n{\n    for (auto& player\
      \ : m_players)\n    {\n        if (player)\n            player->UpdateEnchantTime(diff);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual enchantment time adjustment
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      uint32 timePassed = 1000; // 1 second

      player->UpdateEnchantTime(timePassed);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the game world update loop to maintain
    accurate enchantment timers. It may trigger visual effects or stat updates when
    enchantments expire. The implementation likely iterates through all equipped items
    and calls internal timer decrement logic for each enchanted item.
  warnings: Direct usage of this method should be carefully considered as it affects
    active gameplay mechanics. Improper time values can cause enchantments to expire
    too quickly or remain active longer than intended, potentially affecting game
    balance.
