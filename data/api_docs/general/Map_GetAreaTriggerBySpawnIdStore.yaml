documentation:
  brief: Returns the area trigger container storing all spawned area triggers by their
    spawn ID.
  description: This method provides access to the internal container that holds all
    area triggers currently spawned in the map, indexed by their spawn ID. It allows
    developers to retrieve and manage area triggers that have been created and are
    active within the current map instance. The returned container is read-only and
    provides direct access to the stored area trigger data without requiring additional
    lookup operations. This method is essential for managing area trigger lifecycle
    and ensuring proper handling of spatial triggers in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const reference to the AreaTriggerBySpawnIdContainer which contains
    all currently spawned area triggers in the map, indexed by their spawn ID. The
    container provides direct access to area trigger data without requiring additional
    lookup operations.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Area Trigger Data
    code: "AreaTriggerBySpawnIdContainer const& triggerContainer = map->GetAreaTriggerBySpawnIdStore();\n\
      for (auto itr = triggerContainer.begin(); itr != triggerContainer.end(); ++itr)\n\
      {\n    uint32 spawnId = itr->first;\n    AreaTrigger* trigger = itr->second;\n\
      \    // Process area trigger\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it returns a const reference to an internal
    container. The container itself is managed by the Map class and should not be
    modified directly. Performance considerations include avoiding repeated calls
    to this method when possible, as it provides direct access to stored data.
  warnings: The returned container should not be modified directly as it's read-only.
    Care should be taken when iterating through the container to avoid modifying elements
    during iteration. This method is primarily used for debugging and development
    purposes rather than runtime operations.
