  class: ActionFactory
  method: GetAvailableActions
  signature: int ActionFactory::GetAvailableActions() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of available actions in the action factory.
  description: The GetAvailableActions method returns an integer representing the
    number of actions currently available within the ActionFactory instance. This
    method is typically used to determine how many actions can be executed or processed
    by the AI system. The returned value may depend on various factors such as player
    state, game context, or action availability conditions. It serves as a utility
    for querying the current capacity or status of actions that can be performed.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total count of available actions in the factory.
    A return value of zero indicates no actions are currently available, while positive
    values indicate the number of actionable items.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int actionCount = actionFactory.GetAvailableActions();\nif (actionCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with action execution\n    std::cout << \"Available\
      \ actions: \" << actionCount << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is read-only and does not modify the state of the ActionFactory.
    It should be called frequently to get updated counts, especially in dynamic environments
    where action availability changes often.
