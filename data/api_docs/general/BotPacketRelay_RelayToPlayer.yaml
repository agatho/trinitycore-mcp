api:
  class: BotPacketRelay
  method: RelayToPlayer
  signature: void BotPacketRelay::RelayToPlayer(BotSession * botSession, const WorldPacket
    * packet, Player * targetPlayer)
documentation:
  brief: Relays a packet from a bot session to a specific player in the game world.
  description: The RelayToPlayer method is responsible for forwarding a WorldPacket
    received from a bot session to a designated target player. This functionality
    is typically used in bot-related systems where automated players need to communicate
    with real players or other bots within the game environment. The method ensures
    that the packet data is properly transmitted without modification, maintaining
    the integrity of the original message. It operates within the context of TrinityCore's
    packet handling system and is essential for enabling communication between bot
    entities and player characters.
  parameters:
  - name: botSession
    description: Pointer to the BotSession object representing the source bot session
      from which the packet originates. Must not be null.
  - name: packet
    description: Pointer to the WorldPacket object containing the data to be relayed.
      Must not be null and should contain valid packet data.
  - name: targetPlayer
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the destination player
      who will receive the packet. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Packet Relay Example
    code: 'BotSession* session = ...;

      WorldPacket* packet = new WorldPacket(CMSG_PLAYER_LOGIN, 0);

      Player* target = ...;

      BotPacketRelay::RelayToPlayer(session, packet, target);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that all input parameters are valid and properly initialized.
    The underlying packet transmission mechanism may involve network serialization
    and deserialization, so performance considerations should be taken into account
    when relaying large packets or frequent messages.
  warnings: Ensure that the botSession and targetPlayer pointers are valid before
    calling this method to avoid undefined behavior. Improper handling of packet data
    could lead to client-side errors or disconnects for the target player.
