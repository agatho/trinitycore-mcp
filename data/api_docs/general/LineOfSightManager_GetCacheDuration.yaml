  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: GetCacheDuration
  signature: uint32 LineOfSightManager::GetCacheDuration() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the cache duration setting used for line-of-sight calculations
    in the LineOfSightManager.
  description: The GetCacheDuration method returns the time interval, in milliseconds,
    that determines how long cached line-of-sight results are considered valid before
    requiring a new calculation. This value is crucial for balancing performance and
    accuracy in pathfinding and visibility checks within the TrinityCore engine. The
    cache duration directly impacts how frequently the system recalculates whether
    entities can see each other or navigate through obstacles. A shorter duration
    increases accuracy but may reduce performance, while a longer duration improves
    performance at the cost of potential inaccuracies.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the cache duration in milliseconds.
    This indicates how long line-of-sight results are cached before being invalidated
    and recalculated.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Cache Duration for Performance Tuning
    code: "uint32 cacheDuration = LineOfSightManager::GetCacheDuration();\nif (cacheDuration\
      \ > 1000)\n{\n    // Log warning about potentially outdated LOS calculations\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Warning: LOS cache duration is high (%u ms)\", cacheDuration);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore navigation system.
    The returned value may be configurable via server settings or derived from game
    mechanics such as player movement speed and reaction times. Caching helps reduce
    CPU overhead during frequent visibility checks but must be tuned appropriately
    for gameplay responsiveness.
