  class: OutdoorPvP
  method: OnCreatureCreate
  signature: void OutdoorPvP::OnCreatureCreate(Creature * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the creation of creatures within the OutdoorPvP area, allowing custom
    behavior implementation.
  description: The OnCreatureCreate method is a virtual callback function in the OutdoorPvP
    class that is invoked whenever a Creature object is created within the outdoor
    player versus player zone. This method provides an opportunity for custom OutdoorPvP
    implementations to perform actions such as initializing creature-specific data,
    applying custom AI behaviors, or triggering events based on the creature's presence.
    It serves as part of the event-driven architecture of the OutdoorPvP system and
    allows developers to extend default behavior without modifying core TrinityCore
    logic. The method is typically called during the creature's initialization phase
    when it becomes active in the world.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that has been created within the OutdoorPvP
      zone. This parameter represents the newly instantiated creature instance and
      can be used to access its properties, set AI behavior, or trigger custom logic.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "class MyOutdoorPvP : public OutdoorPvP\n{\npublic:\n    void OnCreatureCreate(Creature*\
      \ creature) override\n    {\n        // Custom logic when a creature is created\
      \ in the PvP area\n        if (creature->GetEntry() == 12345)\n        {\n \
      \           creature->SetFaction(14);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Event Triggering
    code: "class MyOutdoorPvP : public OutdoorPvP\n{\npublic:\n    void OnCreatureCreate(Creature*\
      \ creature) override\n    {\n        // Check if the creature is a specific\
      \ type and trigger an event\n        switch (creature->GetEntry())\n       \
      \ {\n            case 10001:\n                // Trigger custom PvP event\n\
      \                sOutdoorPvPMgr->HandleEvent(creature, EVENT_CREATURE_SPAWN);\n\
      \                break;\n            case 10002:\n                creature->AddAura(12345,\
      \ creature);\n                break;\n        }\n    }\n};"

  notes: This method is called during the creature's initialization phase and should
    not be used for heavy computations as it may impact performance. The creature
    pointer passed in is guaranteed to be valid within this scope, but modifications
    to its state should be done carefully to avoid conflicts with core systems.
  warnings: Do not delete or modify the creature object directly from this method
    unless absolutely necessary, as it may cause memory leaks or undefined behavior.
    Be cautious when modifying faction or other core properties that might affect
    gameplay balance.
