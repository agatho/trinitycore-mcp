  class: SpawnRequestEvent
  method: SpawnRequestEvent
  signature: void SpawnRequestEvent::SpawnRequestEvent(int req, std::function<void
    (bool, int)> cb)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a spawn request event with the specified request ID and callback
    function.
  description: 'The SpawnRequestEvent method is used to trigger a spawn request within
    the TrinityCore framework, typically for handling dynamic object or creature spawning.
    It accepts a request identifier and a callback function that will be executed
    upon completion of the spawn operation. The callback receives two parameters:
    a boolean indicating success or failure of the spawn request, and an integer representing
    the result code or identifier associated with the spawned entity. This method
    is commonly used in game event systems, quest handling, or scripted object spawning
    scenarios where asynchronous behavior is required.'
  parameters:
  - name: req
    description: An integer identifier for the spawn request. This value typically
      represents a unique request ID or type that determines what should be spawned
      (e.g., creature, game object, etc.). Valid values are implementation-specific
      but generally correspond to predefined spawn types or quest-related identifiers.
  - name: cb
    description: 'A std::function callback that will be invoked when the spawn request
      completes. The callback takes two parameters: a boolean indicating whether the
      operation succeeded (true) or failed (false), and an integer result code or
      identifier related to the spawned entity.'
  returns: null

    code: "SpawnRequestEvent(1001, [](bool success, int result) {\n    if (success)\
      \ {\n        std::cout << \"Spawn successful, result: \" << result << std::endl;\n\
      \    } else {\n        std::cout << \"Spawn failed with result: \" << result\
      \ << std::endl;\n    }\n});"

    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest) override {\n   \
      \ SpawnRequestEvent(2005, [player](bool success, int result) {\n        if (success\
      \ && result > 0) {\n            // Spawn creature or object based on result\n\
      \            player->SummonCreature(result, player->GetPositionX(), player->GetPositionY(),\
      \ player->GetPositionZ(), 0);\n        }\n    });\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is asynchronous in nature and does not block execution. The callback
    function may be executed on a different thread depending on the internal implementation
    of TrinityCore's event handling system. Developers should ensure that any resources
    accessed within the callback are thread-safe or properly synchronized.
  warnings: Ensure that the request ID passed to this method corresponds to valid
    spawn configurations in the database, otherwise the callback will likely receive
    a failure status. Avoid performing heavy operations inside the callback function
    as it may impact performance of the game loop.
