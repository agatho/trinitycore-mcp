documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the player assigned to handle the
    ticket
  description: The GetAssignedToGUID method retrieves the globally unique identifier
    of the Game Master or administrator who is currently assigned to resolve a specific
    support ticket. This GUID corresponds to the player account that has taken ownership
    of the ticket in the TrinityCore system. The method provides a way for developers
    and administrators to track which user is responsible for addressing a particular
    ticket. It's commonly used in ticket management systems, logging, and administrative
    interfaces within World of Warcraft servers running on the TrinityCore framework.
    This method does not perform any validation or checks on whether the assigned
    player is still online or valid.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the GUID of the player assigned to handle
    this ticket. A return value of 0 typically indicates that no player has been assigned
    to the ticket yet, while positive integers represent valid player GUIDs. The GUID
    corresponds to the internal database identifier used by TrinityCore for tracking
    player accounts.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check ticket assignment
    code: "Ticket* myTicket = sTicketMgr->GetTicketByGuid(ticketGuid);\nif (myTicket)\n\
      {\n    int assignedGUID = myTicket->GetAssignedToGUID();\n    if (assignedGUID\
      \ != 0)\n    {\n        // Ticket is assigned to player with GUID: assignedGUID\n\
      \        printf(\"Ticket assigned to player GUID: %d\\n\", assignedGUID);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Ticket is not yet assigned\n        printf(\"\
      Ticket is not assigned to any player\\n\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a raw integer GUID value that should be used carefully
    in conjunction with other TrinityCore APIs for player lookups. The returned value
    may be 0 if the ticket has not been assigned yet, which is a valid state and should
    be handled appropriately by calling code.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only returns the stored GUID and does not verify
    whether the player with that GUID still exists or is online. Calling code should
    validate the existence of the assigned player before attempting to interact with
    them directly.
