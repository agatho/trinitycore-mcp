  method: HealInfo
  signature: void HealInfo::HealInfo(int * healer, int * target, uint32 heal, const
    SpellInfo * spellInfo, int schoolMask)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a HealInfo object with healer, target, heal amount, spell info,
    and school mask.
  description: The HealInfo constructor initializes a healing information structure
    used in TrinityCore's combat system. It stores essential data about a healing
    event including the healer's identifier, target's identifier, the amount of healing
    done, the spell that caused the heal, and the magic school mask for the healing
    effect. This structure is typically used internally by the core to track healing
    events, calculate overhealing, and manage healing-related statistics during combat.
    The method sets up internal state variables based on the provided parameters without
    returning any value.
  parameters:
  - name: healer
    description: Pointer to the healer's identifier (GUID). Must point to a valid
      integer representing the unit performing the heal.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target's identifier (GUID). Must point to a valid
      integer representing the unit receiving the heal.
  - name: heal
    description: The amount of healing points applied. Should be a positive integer
      value representing the healing magnitude.
  - name: spellInfo
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure describing the spell that caused
      this heal. Must not be null for valid healing events.
  - name: schoolMask
    description: Bitmask indicating the magic school(s) associated with the healing
      effect. Used for damage type classification and resistance calculations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic HealInfo Initialization
    code: 'HealInfo info(&healerGuid, &targetGuid, 1000, spellInfo, SPELL_SCHOOL_MASK_NORMAL);

      // Initializes a heal info structure for a normal healing event of 1000 points'
    language: cpp
  - title: HealInfo with Holy School Mask
    code: 'uint32 holyMask = SPELL_SCHOOL_MASK_HOLY;

      HealInfo info(&healerGuid, &targetGuid, 1500, spellInfo, holyMask);

      // Initializes heal info for a holy spell healing of 1500 points'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore's combat system and
    should not be called directly in most custom modules. The healer and target pointers
    must point to valid GUIDs, and the SpellInfo pointer must reference a valid spell
    definition. The schoolMask parameter determines how healing interacts with resistances
    and is crucial for proper game mechanics.
  warnings: Do not pass null pointers for healer or target parameters as this will
    likely cause undefined behavior. Ensure that spellInfo points to a valid SpellInfo
    structure, otherwise the healing system may crash or behave unpredictably. Incorrect
    schoolMask values can lead to improper resistance calculations and healing effectiveness.
