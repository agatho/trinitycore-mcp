documentation:
  brief: Updates the armor value of the guardian based on its current stats and equipment.
  description: The UpdateArmor method recalculates and applies the guardian's armor
    value, taking into account base stats, equipment bonuses, and any temporary modifiers.
    This method is typically invoked during stat refresh cycles or when the guardian's
    equipment changes. It ensures that the guardian's defensive capabilities are accurately
    reflected in the game state. The method does not directly modify the armor value
    itself but rather recalculates it from underlying factors such as level, equipment,
    buffs, and debuffs.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Guardian* guardian = ...;

      guardian->UpdateArmor();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the game engine during stat recalculations.
    It may be invoked automatically when equipment is equipped or unequipped, or when
    buffs/debuffs are applied or removed.
