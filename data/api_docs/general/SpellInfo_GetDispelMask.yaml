  method: GetDispelMask
  signature: uint32 SpellInfo::GetDispelMask(int type)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the dispel mask for a spell based on its type.
  description: The GetDispelMask method retrieves the dispel mask value for a specific
    spell type, which determines what types of effects can be removed by dispel spells.
    This method is used to identify the category of dispel effects that a spell can
    remove, such as magic, curse, disease, poison, or holy effects. The dispel mask
    is essential for determining how spells interact with debuffs and for calculating
    the effectiveness of dispel mechanics in World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: 'The spell type to retrieve the dispel mask for. Valid values are
      0-4, representing different dispel categories: 0 = Magic, 1 = Curse, 2 = Disease,
      3 = Poison, 4 = Holy.'
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the dispel mask for the specified spell
    type. The value corresponds to the bitmask of the dispel type, where each bit
    represents a different category of dispel effect that can be removed by the spell.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'uint32 dispelMask = spellInfo->GetDispelMask(0);

      // Returns the dispel mask for magic type'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "SpellInfo* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(12345);\nuint32 mask = spellInfo->GetDispelMask(2);\n\
      // Returns the dispel mask for disease type\nif (mask & DISPEL_MASK_DISEASE)\n\
      {\n    // This spell can remove disease effects\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related functions
    to determine how a spell interacts with dispel mechanics. The dispel mask values
    are defined by constants such as DISPEL_MASK_MAGIC, DISPEL_MASK_CURSE, etc., and
    should be used in combination with bitwise operations for proper functionality.
  warnings: This method requires careful handling of spell type parameters, as incorrect
    usage can lead to misinterpretation of spell effects. The method should not be
    called on non-existent spells or without proper validation of the spell information.
