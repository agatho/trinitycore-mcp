  method: IsFocusDisabled
  signature: bool Spell::IsFocusDisabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell's focus is disabled, preventing spell casting
    when a player lacks proper focus.
  description: The IsFocusDisabled method checks if a spell's focus requirements are
    currently disabled, meaning that the spell cannot be cast because the player does
    not have the required focus. This method is typically used in conjunction with
    spell focus mechanics in World of Warcraft, where certain spells require specific
    focus objects or conditions to be met before casting can proceed. The method returns
    true when focus is disabled and false when focus is enabled. It is commonly used
    in spell handling logic to prevent casting when focus requirements are not satisfied.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell's focus is disabled, indicating that the spell
    cannot be cast due to missing focus requirements; returns false if focus is enabled
    and the spell can proceed with casting.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (spell->IsFocusDisabled()) {\n    // Handle disabled focus case\n  \
      \  // Do not allow spell to cast\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in spell validation logic and may be called
    during spell preparation or casting checks. It's important to note that the method
    does not directly determine focus requirements but rather whether those requirements
    are currently disabled, which can depend on various game state conditions.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with other focus-related methods; it
    specifically checks for disabled focus rather than missing focus. Misusing this
    method could lead to incorrect spell handling logic and potentially prevent valid
    spells from being cast when they should be allowed to proceed.
