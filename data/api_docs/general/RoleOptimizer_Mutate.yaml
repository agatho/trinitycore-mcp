  class: RoleOptimizer
  method: Mutate
  signature: void RoleOptimizer::Mutate(Chromosome & chromosome, float mutationRate)
documentation:
  brief: Applies genetic mutation to a chromosome based on the specified mutation
    rate.
  description: The Mutate method performs genetic algorithm mutation on a given chromosome
    by randomly altering its genes according to a specified probability. This method
    is typically used in evolutionary algorithms or role optimization systems within
    TrinityCore's AI framework. The mutation process helps maintain genetic diversity
    in the population and prevents premature convergence to local optima. It modifies
    the chromosome in-place without returning a new instance.
  parameters:
  - name: chromosome
    description: Reference to the Chromosome object that will be mutated in-place.
      This represents an individual solution in the genetic algorithm with genes that
      can be modified during evolution.
  - name: mutationRate
    description: Float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the probability of each
      gene being mutated. A value of 0.0 means no mutations occur, while 1.0 means
      all genes will be mutated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Mutation Usage
    code: 'RoleOptimizer optimizer;

      Chromosome myChromosome;

      // Initialize chromosome with some genes

      optimizer.Mutate(myChromosome, 0.05f); // 5% mutation rate'
    language: cpp
  - title: High Mutation Rate Example
    code: 'RoleOptimizer optimizer;

      Chromosome playerRoles;

      // Assume playerRoles contains role assignments

      optimizer.Mutate(playerRoles, 0.3f); // 30% mutation rate for exploration'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the chromosome directly and does not return a new object.
    The mutation process is typically stochastic and may produce different results
    on each call with the same parameters. For optimal genetic algorithm performance,
    mutation rates should be kept relatively low (typically between 0.01-0.1).
  warnings: Be cautious when using high mutation rates as they can disrupt good solutions
    and slow down convergence. Ensure that chromosome genes are properly initialized
    before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
