  class: Guild
  method: SetName
  signature: bool Guild::SetName(std::string_view name)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the name of the guild to the specified value.
  description: The SetName method updates the internal name of a guild object. This
    method is typically used when a guild's name needs to be changed, such as during
    a guild rename event. The method performs validation on the provided name to ensure
    it meets the game's requirements for guild names, including length and character
    restrictions. It returns true if the name was successfully updated, or false if
    the new name is invalid or fails validation. This operation directly affects the
    guild's in-memory representation and may trigger updates in the database depending
    on the implementation details of the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The new name to assign to the guild. Must be a valid string that
      adheres to the game's naming rules, including minimum and maximum length constraints,
      and allowed character sets.
  returns: True if the guild name was successfully updated; false otherwise. A return
    value of false typically indicates an invalid input name or failure in validation
    checks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Name Update
    code: "Guild* guild = sObjectMgr->GetGuildById(123);\nif (guild)\n{\n    bool\
      \ success = guild->SetName(\"NewGuildName\");\n    if (success)\n        LOG_INFO(\"\
      server\", \"Guild name updated successfully.\");\n    else\n        LOG_ERROR(\"\
      server\", \"Failed to update guild name.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Guild Name Update with Validation
    code: "std::string newName = \"AlphaGuild\";\nGuild* guild = sObjectMgr->GetGuildById(456);\n\
      if (guild && !newName.empty() && newName.length() <= MAX_GUILD_NAME_LENGTH)\n\
      {\n    bool success = guild->SetName(newName);\n    if (success)\n        LOG_INFO(\"\
      server\", \"Guild renamed to {}\", newName);\n    else\n        LOG_ERROR(\"\
      server\", \"Could not rename guild to {}\", newName);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method may involve database synchronization depending on how the TrinityCore
    implementation handles persistent storage of guild data. It is recommended to
    validate the input name before calling this method to prevent unnecessary processing
    or failed updates.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or empty string may result in undefined
    behavior or failure to update the guild's name. Ensure that all inputs are validated
    according to the game's rules before invoking this function.
