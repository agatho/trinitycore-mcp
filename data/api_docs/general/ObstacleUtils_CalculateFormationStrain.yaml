  class: ObstacleUtils
  method: CalculateFormationStrain
  signature: float ObstacleUtils::CalculateFormationStrain(const int & newPos, const
    int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the strain value for a given formation position within a group.
  description: The CalculateFormationStrain method computes a numerical strain value
    that represents how much a specific position in a group formation deviates from
    an ideal or optimal configuration. This utility is typically used in AI pathfinding
    and group behavior systems to evaluate the effectiveness of different formations.
    The method takes into account the current position and group context to determine
    a float value indicating the level of strain, which can be used for decision-making
    in dynamic group positioning.
  parameters:
  - name: newPos
    description: The index or position within the formation that is being evaluated.
      This represents the specific slot or location in the group's formation structure.
  - name: group
    description: The identifier or reference to the group whose formation is being
      analyzed. This parameter helps determine the context and constraints of the
      formation being evaluated.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated strain for the given formation
    position. Lower values indicate better alignment with optimal formation, while
    higher values suggest greater deviation or inefficiency in positioning.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float strain = ObstacleUtils::CalculateFormationStrain(3, 5); // Evaluates\
      \ position 3 in group 5\nif (strain < 0.5f) {\n    // Formation is considered\
      \ optimal\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Group Management
    code: "int currentPos = GetFormationPosition();\nint groupId = GetCurrentGroupID();\n\
      float strain = ObstacleUtils::CalculateFormationStrain(currentPos, groupId);\n\
      if (strain > 1.0f) {\n    // Trigger formation adjustment logic\n    AdjustFormation(groupId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves internal calculations based on group size, member
    positions, and formation types. It may be used in conjunction with other ObstacleUtils
    methods for comprehensive pathfinding and positioning decisions.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input parameters; invalid newPos or group values
    could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect strain calculations.
