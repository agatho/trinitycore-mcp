  signature: void Unit::AddPlayerToVision(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a player to the unit's vision, allowing the unit to see and interact
    with the player.
  description: This method adds a player to the unit's vision, enabling the unit to
    perceive and interact with the player in the game world. It is typically used
    in scenarios where a unit needs to be aware of a player's presence for combat
    or interaction purposes. The method likely involves updating the unit's visibility
    status or internal list of players it can see, though the exact implementation
    details are not available. This functionality is essential for NPC behavior and
    player interaction mechanics within TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object that should be added to the unit's vision.
      This parameter represents a player entity in the game world, typically a Player
      instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      Player* player = new Player();

      unit->AddPlayerToVision(player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely involves updating internal visibility lists or flags. Performance
    considerations may arise when adding many players to vision simultaneously. Thread
    safety should be considered as this method might be called from different threads
    during gameplay.
  warnings: This method may not be thread-safe and could cause issues if called concurrently
    with other vision-related methods. Care should be taken when using it in multi-threaded
    environments.
