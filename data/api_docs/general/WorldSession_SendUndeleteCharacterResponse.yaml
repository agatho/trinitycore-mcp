    * undeleteInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a response packet to the client indicating the result of a character
    undelete operation.
  description: The SendUndeleteCharacterResponse method is used by the WorldSession
    class to communicate the outcome of a character undelete request back to the connected
    client. This method sends a specific packet containing the result code and optional
    character information related to the undelete operation. The result parameter
    indicates whether the operation was successful, failed due to various reasons
    (such as cooldowns or invalid state), or if there were no pending deletions to
    undelete. When the operation succeeds, an optional CharacterUndeleteInfo structure
    may be included with details about the character being undeleted. This method
    is typically invoked in response to a client-initiated character undelete request,
    ensuring proper synchronization between server and client regarding character
    deletion states.
  parameters:
  - name: result
    description: An integer value indicating the outcome of the undelete operation.
      Possible values include success (0), failure due to cooldown (1), invalid character
      state (2), or other error conditions. The exact meaning of each value depends
      on the implementation in TrinityCore's character deletion system.
  - name: undeleteInfo
    description: A pointer to a WorldPackets::Character::CharacterUndeleteInfo structure
      containing detailed information about the character being undeleted. This parameter
      may be null if no additional information is available or if the operation failed.
      The structure typically includes character GUID, name, and other metadata relevant
      to the undelete process.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Successful Character Undelete Response
    code: 'WorldPackets::Character::CharacterUndeleteInfo info;

      info.Guid = playerGuid;

      info.Name = "ExamplePlayer";

      this->SendUndeleteCharacterResponse(0, &info);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Failed Character Undelete Response Due to Cooldown
    code: this->SendUndeleteCharacterResponse(1, nullptr);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the character management system in TrinityCore and
    relies on proper session state handling. The packet sent by this method is specifically
    designed for the character undelete functionality and should only be called after
    validating the request conditions. It's important to note that the actual character
    undeletion logic must have already been processed before calling this method.
  warnings: Ensure that the result parameter accurately reflects the outcome of the
    undelete operation, as incorrect values may confuse the client or cause unexpected
    behavior. The undeleteInfo pointer should be validated for null before use, though
    it's expected to be null when the operation fails. Improper handling of this method
    can lead to client-side errors or inconsistent character state.
