  class: PathfindingManager
  method: OptimizePath
  signature: int PathfindingManager::OptimizePath(const int & waypoints)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the path by reducing unnecessary waypoints and improving navigation
    efficiency.
  description: The OptimizePath method in the PathfindingManager class is responsible
    for refining and optimizing an existing path that has been previously calculated.
    It reduces redundant waypoints, smooths out the route, and improves overall navigation
    efficiency for units moving through the game world. This optimization process
    helps reduce computational overhead during path execution and can improve performance,
    especially for complex paths with many waypoints. The method typically operates
    on a pre-calculated path stored within the manager's internal state and modifies
    it in-place to achieve better movement behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: waypoints
    description: Reference to an integer representing the number of waypoints in the
      current path that should be optimized. This parameter indicates how many waypoints
      are present in the path being processed.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the optimization
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful optimization, while
    non-zero values may indicate various error conditions such as invalid input parameters,
    empty paths, or internal processing failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Optimization
    code: "PathfindingManager* manager = ...;\nint waypointCount = 10;\nint result\
      \ = manager->OptimizePath(waypointCount);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Path optimization\
      \ successful\n    printf(\"Path optimized successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Handle optimization failure\n    printf(\"Path optimization failed with\
      \ code: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that a path has already been calculated and stored within
    the PathfindingManager instance. The optimization process may modify the internal
    waypoint data structure directly, so any references to the original waypoints
    should be considered stale after calling this method. Performance of this method
    can vary depending on the number of waypoints in the path.
  warnings: Calling this method without a properly initialized or calculated path
    may result in undefined behavior or errors. The method modifies the internal state
    of the PathfindingManager, so it should not be called concurrently from multiple
    threads without proper synchronization mechanisms.
