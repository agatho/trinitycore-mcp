documentation:
  brief: Resets the threat update timer for the current target.
  description: This method resets the internal timer that governs when threat is updated
    for the current target. It is typically used to prevent automatic threat updates
    from occurring too frequently, allowing for more precise control over combat behavior.
    The method ensures that the next threat update will occur after a specified delay,
    preventing potential spamming of threat updates during rapid combat sequences.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'ThreatManager* threatMgr = player->GetThreatManager();

      threatMgr->ResetUpdateTimer();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called when the player is in combat but needs to prevent
    automatic threat updates from occurring. It is commonly used during spell casting
    or when performing actions that might otherwise trigger rapid threat changes.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to inconsistent threat management,
    potentially causing the player to lose control of their target if not properly
    managed.
