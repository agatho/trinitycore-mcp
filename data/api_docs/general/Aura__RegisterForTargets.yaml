documentation:
  brief: Registers the aura for target tracking and management within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  description: The _RegisterForTargets method is an internal utility function used
    by the Aura class to establish and maintain tracking of targets affected by the
    aura. This method ensures that the aura's application and removal logic correctly
    handles target-related events, such as unit death, zoning, or status changes.
    It typically integrates with the core game loop to manage aura state transitions
    and updates. The method is generally called during aura initialization or activation
    phases and may involve internal bookkeeping to maintain a list of affected targets.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Aura Initialization
    code: "void MyAura::Initialize()\n{\n    // ... aura setup code ...\n    _RegisterForTargets();\n\
      \    // ... continue initialization ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is an internal method and should not be called directly by external
    code. It is typically invoked automatically during aura creation or activation.
    The method may perform operations that affect performance if used excessively
    in loops or frequently during combat.
  warnings: Do not call this method manually unless you are extending the core Aura
    functionality. Improper usage can lead to incorrect target tracking, memory leaks,
    or inconsistent aura behavior.
