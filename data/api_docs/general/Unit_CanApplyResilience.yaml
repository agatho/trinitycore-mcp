  class: Unit
  method: CanApplyResilience
  signature: bool Unit::CanApplyResilience() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether resilience can be applied to the unit.
  description: This method checks if the unit is eligible to apply resilience mechanics,
    which typically involves evaluating whether the unit meets specific conditions
    for resilience application. Resilience in World of Warcraft refers to a mechanic
    that reduces incoming damage from critical hits or prevents certain effects from
    triggering. The method likely returns true when the unit has sufficient resources
    or meets criteria for applying resilience, and false otherwise. This functionality
    is often used in combat calculations and damage reduction systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit can apply resilience, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the unit meets the necessary conditions to utilize resilience mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (unit->CanApplyResilience()) {\n    // Apply resilience\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details may vary depending on the specific unit type and game
    context. This method likely involves checking internal state variables or resource
    conditions such as mana, energy, or rage. Performance considerations include avoiding
    unnecessary calls in combat situations.
  warnings: This method should not be used in scenarios where immediate damage calculation
    is required; it's primarily intended for determining eligibility rather than direct
    application.
