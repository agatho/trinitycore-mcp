  description: The UpdateMaxSessionCounters method is responsible for maintaining
    and updating the highest recorded number of concurrent player sessions on the
    world server. This method typically tracks metrics such as the peak number of
    logged-in players, which can be used for server performance monitoring, capacity
    planning, and administrative reporting. It is usually invoked periodically or
    during significant session changes to ensure accurate tracking of server load
    and usage statistics.

    custom session tracking or monitoring logic.
