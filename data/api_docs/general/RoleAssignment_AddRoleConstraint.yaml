api:
  class: RoleAssignment
  method: AddRoleConstraint
  signature: void RoleAssignment::AddRoleConstraint(uint32 playerGuid, GroupRole role,
    RoleCapability capability)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a role constraint for a player within a group, defining their allowed
    capabilities.
  description: The AddRoleConstraint method assigns a specific role capability to
    a player within a group context. This method is used to define what actions or
    permissions a player with a given role can perform. The constraint is typically
    applied during group formation or role assignment processes in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework. It allows for fine-grained control over player roles and
    capabilities within group instances such as dungeons, raids, or battlegrounds.
    This method does not validate the existence of the player or group before applying
    the constraint.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to whom the role constraint
      is applied. Must be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  - name: role
    description: The group role that the player will assume. This defines the player's
      position or function within the group such as Tank, Healer, or Damage Dealer.
  - name: capability
    description: The specific capability or permission level associated with the given
      role. Defines what actions the player can perform while assigned to this role.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Assigning a Tank Role with Full Capabilities
    code: 'RoleAssignment assignment;

      assignment.AddRoleConstraint(123456, GroupRole::TANK, RoleCapability::FULL);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting a Healer Role with Limited Capabilities
    code: 'RoleAssignment assignment;

      assignment.AddRoleConstraint(789012, GroupRole::HEALER, RoleCapability::LIMITED);

      // Used in group creation or role reassignment logic'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal role constraint data structures. It
    should be called only after ensuring the player and group are properly initialized.
    The method does not perform any validation checks on whether the player exists
    or is part of a valid group.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the player or group
    context may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that all parameters are valid before
    calling this function.
