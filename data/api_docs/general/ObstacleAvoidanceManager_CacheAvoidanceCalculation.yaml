  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: CacheAvoidanceCalculation
  signature: void ObstacleAvoidanceManager::CacheAvoidanceCalculation(const std::string
    & key, const AvoidanceManeuver & maneuver)
documentation:
  brief: Caches an avoidance maneuver calculation using a specified key for later
    retrieval.
  description: The CacheAvoidanceCalculation method stores a computed AvoidanceManeuver
    object in an internal cache, associating it with a unique string key. This allows
    the system to quickly retrieve previously calculated avoidance maneuvers without
    recomputing them, improving performance during AI pathfinding and obstacle avoidance
    logic. The cached maneuvers are typically generated based on environmental factors
    such as terrain, obstacles, or dynamic entities in the game world. This method
    is part of the ObstacleAvoidanceManager's optimization strategy to reduce redundant
    calculations.
  parameters:
  - name: key
    description: A unique string identifier used to store and retrieve the avoidance
      maneuver from the cache. Must be non-empty and unique for each distinct maneuver.
  - name: maneuver
    description: The AvoidanceManeuver object containing the calculated avoidance
      path or action. This data is stored in the cache under the provided key.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Caching a Basic Avoidance Maneuver
    code: 'ObstacleAvoidanceManager* manager = ...;

      AvoidanceManeuver maneuver;

      maneuver.targetPosition = {100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f};

      manager->CacheAvoidanceCalculation("avoidance_001", maneuver);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Caching with Dynamic Key Generation
    code: 'ObstacleAvoidanceManager* manager = ...;

      std::string key = "avoidance_" + std::to_string(GetCurrentTime());

      AvoidanceManeuver maneuver;

      maneuver.type = AvoidanceType::StrafeLeft;

      manager->CacheAvoidanceCalculation(key, maneuver);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AvoidanceManeuver object passed in is valid
    and fully initialized. The cache may have a limited size or expiration policy,
    so frequently accessed maneuvers should be cached to ensure performance benefits.
    It is recommended to use descriptive keys to avoid collisions and improve debuggability.
  warnings: Calling this method with an empty key string may lead to undefined behavior
    or cache corruption. Ensure that the AvoidanceManeuver object contains valid data
    before caching, as invalid maneuvers can cause issues during retrieval or usage
    in pathfinding logic.
