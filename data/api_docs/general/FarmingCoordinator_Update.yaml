  class: FarmingCoordinator
  method: Update
  signature: void FarmingCoordinator::Update(int * player, uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the farming coordinator's internal state based on elapsed game time
    and player data.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and maintaining the
    state of the FarmingCoordinator system. It takes a pointer to a player object
    and a time difference value (in milliseconds) to determine how much time has passed
    since the last update. This method likely handles crop growth, resource collection,
    and other farming-related activities that depend on real-time progression within
    the game world. The method operates as part of the game loop, ensuring that farming
    mechanics progress correctly according to the passage of in-game time.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier or index
      in the game's internal player array. This parameter may be used to identify
      which player's farming data should be updated.
  - name: diff
    description: Unsigned 32-bit integer representing the time elapsed since the last
      update call, measured in milliseconds. This value is crucial for determining
      how much farming progress should occur during this update cycle.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      uint32 deltaTime = 1000; // 1 second

      farmingCoordinator->Update(&playerId, deltaTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff) {\n    // ... other updates ...\n \
      \   farmingCoordinator->Update(&playerId, diff);\n    // ... more updates ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game loop or a dedicated update
    thread. The 'diff' parameter should accurately reflect the actual time passed
    to ensure realistic farming progression. Developers should ensure that player
    data pointed to by 'player' remains valid throughout the execution of this method.
  warnings: Passing an invalid player pointer or incorrect delta time values can lead
    to undefined behavior or incorrect farming state updates. Ensure that the player
    identifier is valid and corresponds to a currently active player in the game world.
