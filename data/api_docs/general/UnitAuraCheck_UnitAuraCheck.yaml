  class: UnitAuraCheck
  method: UnitAuraCheck
  signature: void UnitAuraCheck::UnitAuraCheck(bool present, int spellId, int casterGUID)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a unit has a specific aura applied, optionally matching a caster.
  description: The UnitAuraCheck method performs an aura validation on a specified
    unit to determine whether a particular spell aura is currently active. It supports
    optional filtering by the caster's GUID to ensure the aura was applied by a specific
    source. This functionality is commonly used in AI scripts and custom spell logic
    within TrinityCore to make decisions based on the presence or absence of certain
    auras on units. The method does not directly modify any state but can be used
    to trigger conditional behavior in response to aura status.
  parameters:
  - name: present
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to check for aura presence (true)
      or absence (false).
  - name: spellId
    description: The Spell ID of the aura to check for. Must be a valid spell entry
      in the database.
  - name: casterGUID
    description: The GUID of the caster to match against. If zero or invalid, any
      caster will match.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Check for Presence of Healing Aura
    code: UnitAuraCheck(true, 12345, 0); // Checks if the unit has aura ID 12345 from
      any caster
    language: cpp
  - title: Verify Specific Caster's Aura
    code: UnitAuraCheck(true, 67890, player->GetGUID()); // Checks if the unit has
      aura ID 67890 from the player
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI scripts and custom spell handlers to
    make conditional decisions. It leverages internal aura tracking mechanisms of
    TrinityCore and should be called with valid parameters to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell ID provided corresponds to an actual aura in the
    game database, otherwise the check may return incorrect results. Also, passing
    an invalid caster GUID (e.g., non-existent unit) will cause matching to fail unexpectedly.
