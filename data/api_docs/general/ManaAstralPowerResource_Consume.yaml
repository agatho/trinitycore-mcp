  class: ManaAstralPowerResource
  method: Consume
  signature: bool ManaAstralPowerResource::Consume(uint32 manaCost)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified amount of mana from the astral power resource and returns
    whether the operation was successful.
  description: The Consume method attempts to reduce the current astral power resource
    by the specified mana cost. It checks if sufficient resources are available before
    performing the deduction. This method is typically used in spell casting or ability
    usage mechanics where mana is consumed as a resource. The operation will fail
    if the requested mana amount exceeds the available resource. If successful, the
    internal resource counter is decremented accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: manaCost
    description: The amount of mana to consume from the astral power resource. Must
      be a non-negative integer representing the resource cost.
  returns: Returns true if the specified mana cost was successfully deducted from
    the resource, false otherwise. This indicates whether sufficient resources were
    available for consumption.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Mana Consumption
    code: "if (player->GetManaAstralPowerResource()->Consume(100)) {\n    // Mana\
      \ consumed successfully\n    // Proceed with spell casting or ability usage\n\
      } else {\n    // Not enough mana available\n    // Handle insufficient resource\
      \ condition\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spell Casting
    code: "uint32 requiredMana = spell->GetManaCost();\nif (player->GetManaAstralPowerResource()->Consume(requiredMana))\
      \ {\n    // Cast the spell\n    player->CastSpell(target, spellId, true);\n\
      } else {\n    // Send error message to player\n    player->SendSpellFailed(0,\
      \ spellId, SPELL_FAILED_NO_POWER);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the ManaAstralPowerResource.
    It's important to ensure that resource consumption is only performed after validating
    that the action can proceed. The method does not perform any additional game logic
    beyond resource deduction.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking available resources first may lead
    to negative values in the resource counter if not properly validated. Always verify
    that sufficient mana exists before calling this method.
