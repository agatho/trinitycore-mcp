  method: GetIronskinTimeRemaining
  signature: uint32 BrewmasterMonkRefactored::GetIronskinTimeRemaining() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the remaining time in milliseconds for the Ironskin buff.
  description: This method retrieves the duration left on the Ironskin buff, which
    is a defensive ability available to Brewmaster Monks. The returned value represents
    the time remaining until the buff expires, measured in milliseconds. This can
    be used to determine when the buff will end and plan subsequent abilities accordingly.
    The method does not modify any state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the time remaining on the Ironskin buff in
    milliseconds. Returns 0 if the buff is not active.
  examples:
  - title: Check Ironskin Duration
    code: "uint32 timeRemaining = player->GetIronskinTimeRemaining();\nif (timeRemaining\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Ironskin is active, do something\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"world\"\
      , \"Ironskin will expire in {} milliseconds\", timeRemaining);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the player is a Brewmaster Monk and that the Ironskin
    buff state is properly maintained within the class. It's recommended to verify
    the buff's active status before relying on this value.
  warnings: The returned time may be inaccurate if the buff state isn't synchronized
    with the actual game state. Always validate that the buff is indeed active before
    using this value for gameplay logic.
