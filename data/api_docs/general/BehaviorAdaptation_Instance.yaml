documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BehaviorAdaptation class
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the BehaviorAdaptation
    class, ensuring that only one instance of this behavior adaptation manager exists
    throughout the application lifecycle. This method is typically used to access
    global behavior adaptation settings and logic that govern how NPCs adapt their
    actions based on environmental factors, player interactions, or other dynamic
    conditions within the game world. The returned reference provides access to all
    public methods and properties of the BehaviorAdaptation singleton, allowing for
    centralized control over NPC behavioral modifications.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the single BehaviorAdaptation instance. This reference can
    be used to call any public methods or access public members of the BehaviorAdaptation
    class without creating additional instances.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing BehaviorAdaptation Singleton
    code: 'BehaviorAdaptation& behavior = BehaviorAdaptation::Instance();

      // Now use behavior to modify or query NPC behaviors

      behavior.SetAdaptationLevel(2);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Instance in AI Context
    code: "class CustomAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        BehaviorAdaptation& behavior = BehaviorAdaptation::Instance();\n\
      \        if (behavior.IsAdaptive()) {\n            // Apply adaptive behavior\
      \ logic\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it's designed to be called from multiple threads,
    but the underlying singleton instance should be treated as a shared resource.
    The first call to Instance() will initialize the singleton, and subsequent calls
    will return the same instance. This pattern is commonly used in TrinityCore for
    global systems that need to maintain consistent state across all game entities.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton pattern implementation, calling Instance() multiple
    times will always return the same reference. Be cautious when modifying shared
    state through this singleton, as changes may affect all components using it. Avoid
    storing references to the singleton in long-lived objects without proper cleanup
    considerations.
