documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature has a specific quest involved in its questing
    behavior.
  description: This method checks if a creature is involved in a particular quest
    by examining its quest involvement status. It returns true if the creature has
    the specified quest ID in its quest list, indicating that the quest is either
    active or completed and associated with this creature. The method is commonly
    used in quest scripting and quest-related logic to verify quest involvement for
    creatures during quest completion or acceptance scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature has the specified quest ID involved, false
    otherwise. This indicates that the creature's quest involvement status includes
    the given quest ID.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Quest Involvement
    code: "if (creature->hasInvolvedQuest(12345))\n{\n    // Quest is involved with\
      \ this creature\n    // Perform actions related to quest completion\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically involves checking the creature's quest list against
    a provided quest ID. It may involve database queries or internal data structures
    depending on how the quest system is implemented in TrinityCore.
  warnings: Be aware that this method does not verify if the quest is active or completed,
    only that it is involved in the creature's questing behavior. Also note that this
    method might not work correctly if the creature has multiple quest entries with
    same ID but different status.
