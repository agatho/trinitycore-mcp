  method: SetMaxBots
  signature: void BotPopulationManager::SetMaxBots(uint32 maxBots)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum number of bots allowed in the bot population
  description: The SetMaxBots method configures the upper limit for the number of
    bots that can exist within the bot population managed by the BotPopulationManager.
    This value determines how many bots can be created and maintained simultaneously
    in the game world. The method updates an internal configuration parameter that
    is typically used during initialization or runtime adjustment of bot population
    limits. Changes to this setting may affect existing bots if the new limit is lower
    than the current count, potentially causing some bots to be removed from the world.
  parameters:
  - name: maxBots
    description: The maximum number of bots allowed in the population. Must be a non-negative
      integer value representing the desired cap on bot count.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Bot Count to 50
    code: 'BotPopulationManager* manager = BotPopulationManager::Instance();

      manager->SetMaxBots(50);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disabling Bot Population
    code: 'BotPopulationManager* manager = BotPopulationManager::Instance();

      manager->SetMaxBots(0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates an internal configuration value that may be persisted
    across server restarts. The actual enforcement of the limit might occur during
    bot creation or cleanup cycles rather than immediately upon calling this method.
  warnings: Setting a low maximum value may cause existing bots to be removed from
    the world if their current count exceeds the new limit. Ensure that any dependent
    systems are aware of potential bot removals when adjusting this value.
