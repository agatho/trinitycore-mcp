  method: AI
  signature: AreaTriggerAI * AreaTrigger::AI()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the AI instance associated with this area trigger.
  description: The AreaTrigger::AI() method retrieves the AreaTriggerAI instance that
    controls the behavior of the area trigger. This method is typically used to access
    and interact with the AI logic of an area trigger, allowing developers to query
    or modify its state, handle events, or perform custom behaviors. The returned
    pointer is valid as long as the area trigger exists in the world and has been
    properly initialized with an AI component. This method is essential for implementing
    custom area trigger functionality within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the AreaTriggerAI instance associated with this area trigger,
    or nullptr if no AI has been assigned or the area trigger is not valid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to access area trigger AI
    code: "AreaTriggerAI* ai = areaTrigger->AI();\nif (ai)\n{\n    // Use the AI instance\
      \ for custom logic\n    ai->OnTrigger();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking if AI exists before using it
    code: "if (AreaTrigger* trigger = player->GetAreaTrigger(12345))\n{\n    AreaTriggerAI*\
      \ ai = trigger->AI();\n    if (ai)\n    {\n        // Safe to use AI methods\n\
      \        ai->DoSomethingSpecial();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the area trigger has been properly initialized with
    an AI component. If called on a trigger without AI, it will return nullptr. The
    returned pointer should not be deleted or managed manually as it is owned by the
    area trigger object.
  warnings: Calling this method on a destroyed or invalid area trigger may result
    in undefined behavior. Always check for null returns before using the AI instance.
    Avoid storing references to the returned AI pointer beyond the lifetime of the
    area trigger.
