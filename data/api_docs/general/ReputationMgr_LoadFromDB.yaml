documentation:
  brief: Loads player reputation data from the database into memory for use during
    gameplay.
  description: The LoadFromDB method retrieves all reputation entries associated with
    a player from the database and populates the internal reputation cache within
    the ReputationMgr instance. This method is typically called during player login
    or when initializing the reputation system for a character. It ensures that the
    player's current standing with various factions is accurately reflected in the
    game world, allowing for proper interaction with faction-specific NPCs, quests,
    and rewards. The method handles database result processing and updates the internal
    data structures accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Player Login
    code: "void Player::LoadReputation()\n{\n    m_reputationMgr->LoadFromDB();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the database connection is established
    and valid. It assumes that the database result set contains properly formatted
    reputation data for the associated player. The method does not perform any validation
    on the loaded data, so it's expected that the database contains consistent and
    valid entries.
  warnings: Calling this method without a proper database connection or with invalid
    data can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This method modifies internal
    state and should not be called concurrently from multiple threads without appropriate
    synchronization.
