  class: AreaTrigger
  method: SetTimeToTargetPos
  signature: void AreaTrigger::SetTimeToTargetPos(uint32 timeToTargetPos)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the time it takes for the area trigger to reach its target position.
  description: The SetTimeToTargetPos method configures the duration over which an
    area trigger will move from its current position to a specified target position.
    This is commonly used in spell effects or game mechanics where smooth movement
    of triggers is required. The time value is typically expressed in milliseconds
    and affects how quickly the area trigger interpolates between positions during
    its animation or activation sequence. This method does not directly control the
    path but rather the temporal aspect of movement.
  parameters:
  - name: timeToTargetPos
    description: The time in milliseconds that the area trigger should take to reach
      its target position. Valid values are positive integers representing duration.
      A value of 0 may indicate immediate movement or reset behavior depending on
      implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Movement Time for Area Trigger
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;

      trigger->SetTimeToTargetPos(2000); // Set movement to take 2 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Time Adjustment Based on Difficulty
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;

      uint32 time = IsHeroic() ? 1500 : 3000;

      trigger->SetTimeToTargetPos(time); // Adjust based on difficulty level'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during area trigger initialization or activation.
    The actual movement behavior depends on the underlying interpolation system and
    may be influenced by other factors such as target position updates or movement
    constraints. Ensure that time values are reasonable to avoid unexpected visual
    artifacts or gameplay issues.
  warnings: Setting very small time values (e.g., less than 10ms) might cause rendering
    glitches or inconsistent behavior due to client-side interpolation limits. Avoid
    calling this method repeatedly in tight loops as it could impact performance,
    especially if multiple area triggers are involved.
