  brief: Loads and initializes the Blades Edge pillars for arena AI behavior.
  description: The LoadBladesEdgePillars method is responsible for setting up the
    specific pillar objects found in the Blades Edge arena battleground. This method
    likely retrieves or creates the necessary game objects that represent the pillars
    used in the arena's mechanics, such as those involved in the 'Pillar of Fire'
    or similar arena events. It prepares these objects for use by the AI system to
    manage interactions and behaviors during arena matches. The method is typically
    called during the initialization phase of an arena battleground when the arena
    AI needs to be configured with the appropriate environmental elements.

  - title: Basic Usage in Arena Initialization
    code: "void MyArena::Initialize()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n  \
      \  _arenaAI.LoadBladesEdgePillars();\n    // Continue with other arena setup\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the internal arena AI system and may be called
    automatically during battleground setup. Developers should ensure that the arena
    environment is properly initialized before calling this method to avoid potential
    issues with missing or invalid game object references.
