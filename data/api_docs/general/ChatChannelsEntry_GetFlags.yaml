  class: ChatChannelsEntry
  method: GetFlags
  signature: int ChatChannelsEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flag bitmask associated with the chat channel entry.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitmask
    of flags that define the properties and behavior of a specific chat channel. These
    flags typically control permissions, visibility, and other channel-specific settings
    within the TrinityCore framework. The returned value can be used in combination
    with bitwise operations to check or modify individual flag states. This method
    is commonly used when evaluating channel access rights or determining channel
    characteristics during runtime.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the bitmask of flags for this chat channel entry.
    Each bit in the integer corresponds to a specific property or permission setting,
    such as whether the channel is moderated, public, or requires a password.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a channel is moderated
    code: "ChatChannelsEntry* channel = sChatChannelsStore.LookupEntry(1);\nif (channel\
      \ && (channel->GetFlags() & CHANNEL_FLAG_MODERATED)) {\n    // Channel is moderated\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combine flags to verify multiple properties
    code: "ChatChannelsEntry* channel = sChatChannelsStore.LookupEntry(5);\nint flags\
      \ = channel->GetFlags();\nif ((flags & CHANNEL_FLAG_PUBLIC) && !(flags & CHANNEL_FLAG_PASSWORD_PROTECTED))\
      \ {\n    // Public, non-password protected channel\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flag values are defined in the TrinityCore database and may vary between
    different versions or custom configurations. It's important to consult the relevant
    database schema or documentation for specific flag meanings. This method is thread-safe
    as it only reads from a constant data structure.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned value directly; it represents a read-only bitmask.
    Any changes should be made through appropriate setter methods or database updates
    rather than bitwise manipulation of the return value.
