documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the formation center identifier for a group
  description: The GetFormationCenter method returns an integer identifier representing
    the formation center of a group. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework,
    groups can have a designated formation center which is used for positioning and
    movement logic during group activities such as raids or dungeons. This value typically
    corresponds to the GUID of the player who serves as the formation center. The
    method is const, indicating it does not modify the state of the GroupFormation
    object. It provides access to the internal formation center tracking mechanism
    that helps maintain proper group positioning.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the formation center identifier (typically a GUID)
    of the group. Returns 0 if no formation center is set or if the group is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();\nint centerId\
      \ = formation->GetFormationCenter();\nif (centerId != 0)\n{\n    // Process\
      \ the formation center\n    sLog->outString(\"Formation center ID: %d\", centerId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with group management systems
    to maintain proper positioning of players during group activities. The returned
    value should be treated as a GUID and can be used to identify the specific player
    who acts as the formation center.
