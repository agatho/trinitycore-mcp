  signature: uint32 BotScheduler::GetScheduledBotCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of bots scheduled for execution by the bot scheduler.
  description: The GetScheduledBotCount method retrieves the number of bots that are
    currently scheduled for processing within the bot scheduler system. This count
    represents all bots that have been added to the scheduler's queue but have not
    yet been executed or removed. The method provides a way to monitor the workload
    of the bot scheduler and can be useful for debugging, performance monitoring,
    or implementing logic that depends on the number of pending bot tasks. This is
    a read-only operation that does not modify any internal state of the scheduler.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of bots currently scheduled
    for execution. Returns zero if no bots are scheduled.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Bot Load
    code: "uint32 scheduledCount = botScheduler.GetScheduledBotCount();\nif (scheduledCount\
      \ > 100)\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"Warning: High bot load detected (%u bots\
      \ scheduled)\", scheduledCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple read operation on an internal counter. It is
    expected to be fast and thread-safe, as it typically only involves reading a cached
    value or performing a simple atomic increment/decrement operation in the scheduler's
    internal data structures.
