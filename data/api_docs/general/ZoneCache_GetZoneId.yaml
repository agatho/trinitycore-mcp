  class: ZoneCache
  method: GetZoneId
  signature: uint32 ZoneCache::GetZoneId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the zone identifier associated with the current ZoneCache instance.
  description: The GetZoneId method retrieves the unique numerical identifier (zone
    ID) that represents a specific geographical area or zone within the World of Warcraft
    game world. This identifier is used internally by TrinityCore to manage zone-specific
    data, such as zone-based quests, spawn points, and zone-related events. The method
    is typically called on ZoneCache objects which are populated with zone information
    from the game's database or runtime systems. It provides a consistent way to reference
    zones across different subsystems of the server.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the zone identifier. This ID corresponds to
    entries in the game's zone database and uniquely identifies a specific zone or
    area within the World of Warcraft world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ZoneCache* cache = GetZoneCacheForPlayer(player);\nuint32 zoneId = cache->GetZoneId();\n\
      if (zoneId != 0)\n{\n    // Process zone-specific logic\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player is in zone ID: %u\", zoneId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Zone ID for Quest Logic
    code: "uint32 currentZone = player->GetZoneId();\nif (currentZone == 141)\n{\n\
      \    // Player is in Durotar\n    player->AddQuestReward(12345); // Example\
      \ quest reward\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned zone ID may be zero if the ZoneCache instance has not been properly
    initialized or populated with valid zone data. This method is commonly used in
    conjunction with other zone-related APIs to determine a player's current location
    and apply appropriate zone-specific behaviors.
  warnings: Ensure that the ZoneCache object is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as it may return an invalid zone ID if no zone information has been
    loaded. Calling this method on an uninitialized or corrupted ZoneCache instance
    could lead to unexpected behavior in zone-based systems.
