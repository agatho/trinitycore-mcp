documentation:
  brief: Continues a player's taxi flight journey after pausing or interrupting the
    travel.
  description: The ContinueTaxiFlight method allows a player to resume their ongoing
    taxi flight journey that was previously interrupted or paused. This method is
    typically called when a player has been teleported or moved to a different location
    during a flight, or when they have landed at a waypoint and need to continue their
    journey. It ensures that the player's taxi flight state is properly restored and
    continues from where it left off. The method handles the internal state management
    of the taxi system, including updating the player's position and ensuring the
    flight path continues correctly.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->ContinueTaxiFlight();

      // This resumes the taxi flight journey

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method requires that the player's taxi flight state be properly initialized
    and that the player has already started a taxi journey. It is typically used in
    conjunction with other methods like TaxiNodeAdd or TaxiNodeRemove to manage the
    flight path correctly.
  warnings: This method should not be called without ensuring that the player is actually
    on a taxi flight, as calling it when no taxi flight is active can result in errors
    or unexpected behavior. Also, if the player has been teleported during the flight,
    this method may not work as expected unless the teleportation is properly handled.
