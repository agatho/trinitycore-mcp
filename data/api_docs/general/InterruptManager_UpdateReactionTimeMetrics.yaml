  class: InterruptManager
  method: UpdateReactionTimeMetrics
  signature: void InterruptManager::UpdateReactionTimeMetrics(std::chrono::microseconds
    reactionTime)
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal metrics tracking reaction times for interrupt handling in
    the game.
  description: The UpdateReactionTimeMetrics method is responsible for recording and
    maintaining statistical data regarding the time it takes for players or NPCs to
    react to interruptible actions within the TrinityCore framework. This method accepts
    a reaction time measurement in microseconds and updates internal tracking mechanisms
    such as averages, min/max values, or histograms used for performance analysis
    and game balance tuning. The collected metrics are typically utilized by the AI
    system to evaluate responsiveness and adjust behavior patterns accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: reactionTime
    description: A std::chrono::microseconds value representing the measured reaction
      time for an interrupt event. This parameter should be a positive duration indicating
      how long it took from trigger to response.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'InterruptManager* manager = ...;

      std::chrono::microseconds reaction(1500);

      manager->UpdateReactionTimeMetrics(reaction);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Metrics with Dynamic Reaction Time
    code: 'InterruptManager* manager = GetInterruptManager();

      auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      // ... some interruptible action occurs ...

      auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      std::chrono::microseconds reaction = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end
      - start);

      manager->UpdateReactionTimeMetrics(reaction);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the game engine during interrupt
    handling logic. It's important to ensure that reaction times are accurately measured
    and that this function is not invoked with invalid or negative durations, as it
    may skew statistical data.
  warnings: Do not call this method with extremely large or negative values for reactionTime,
    as it could lead to incorrect metric calculations or potential overflow in internal
    data structures. Also, ensure thread safety if this method is called from multiple
    concurrent contexts.
