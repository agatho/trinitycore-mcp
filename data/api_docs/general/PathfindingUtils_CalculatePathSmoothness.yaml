documentation:
  brief: Calculates the smoothness of a path based on waypoint data
  description: This method evaluates the smoothness of a calculated path by analyzing
    the angles and distances between consecutive waypoints. It returns a float value
    representing how smoothly the path transitions from one point to another, with
    higher values indicating smoother paths. The calculation typically considers the
    deviation from straight-line movement and angular changes between segments. This
    functionality is commonly used in AI pathfinding to determine path quality and
    optimize movement behavior for NPCs or creatures.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the smoothness of the path, where higher values
    indicate smoother paths (typically ranging from 0.0 to 1.0). A value of 1.0 represents
    a perfectly smooth path with minimal angular deviation and consistent spacing
    between waypoints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "float smoothness = PathfindingUtils::CalculatePathSmoothness(waypoints);\n\
      if (smoothness > 0.8f) {\n    // Path is considered smooth enough for NPC movement\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that waypoints are provided in sequential order and that
    the path has already been calculated. The calculation may involve trigonometric
    operations to determine angular changes between segments, which could impact performance
    with large numbers of waypoints.
  warnings: This method requires valid waypoint data to produce meaningful results.
    Passing invalid or uninitialized waypoint data may lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect smoothness calculations. Ensure that the path has been properly calculated
    before calling this method.
