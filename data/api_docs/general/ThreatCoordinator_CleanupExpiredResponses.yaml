  brief: Removes expired threat responses from the coordinator's internal tracking
    system.
  description: The CleanupExpiredResponses method is responsible for removing outdated
    or expired threat responses from the ThreatCoordinator's internal data structures.
    This method ensures that the threat management system does not retain stale data
    that could affect AI decision-making or combat behavior. It typically runs periodically
    as part of the game loop or in response to specific events, maintaining the integrity
    and performance of the threat tracking system by purging entries that have exceeded
    their valid time window.

    code: 'ThreatCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.CleanupExpiredResponses();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called automatically by the game engine's update loop
    or as part of a periodic cleanup task. It may involve iterating through a collection
    of threat entries and removing those whose expiration time has passed.
