  class: BotChatCommandHandler
  method: GetLLMProvider
  signature: std::shared_ptr<LLMProvider> BotChatCommandHandler::GetLLMProvider()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the LLM provider instance used by the bot chat command handler
    for natural language processing tasks.
  description: The GetLLMProvider method returns a shared pointer to the LLMProvider
    object that is currently configured and active within the BotChatCommandHandler.
    This provider is responsible for handling large language model interactions, including
    generating responses to player queries, processing commands, and managing conversational
    context. The returned shared_ptr ensures proper memory management and allows multiple
    components to safely access the same LLM provider instance. This method is typically
    called during bot initialization or when dynamic switching of LLM providers is
    required. The method does not perform any validation or setup; it simply returns
    the existing provider instance if one has been initialized, or a null pointer
    if no provider is currently configured.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::shared_ptr<LLMProvider> pointing to the active LLM provider instance,
    or a null pointer if no provider has been initialized within the handler.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "auto llmProvider = botChatCommandHandler.GetLLMProvider();\nif (llmProvider)\
      \ {\n    // Use the LLM provider for processing commands\n    std::string response\
      \ = llmProvider->GenerateResponse(\"Hello, how are you?\");\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Handle case where no LLM provider is configured\n    sLog->outError(\"No LLM\
      \ provider configured for bot chat handler\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Command Processing
    code: "void ProcessPlayerCommand(BotChatCommandHandler& handler, const std::string&\
      \ command) {\n    auto provider = handler.GetLLMProvider();\n    if (!provider)\
      \ {\n        // Fallback to basic command handling\n        return;\n    }\n\
      \    \n    // Use LLM for advanced command interpretation\n    std::string response\
      \ = provider->ProcessCommand(command);\n    // Send response back to player\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned shared_ptr maintains a reference count, so the LLMProvider instance
    will remain alive as long as there are active references to it. This method is
    thread-safe in the sense that it returns an existing pointer without modifying
    internal state, but concurrent access to the underlying provider should be handled
    by the caller if needed. The method assumes that the BotChatCommandHandler has
    already been initialized with a valid LLMProvider instance.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized BotChatCommandHandler may return
    a null pointer, which could lead to crashes if not properly checked. Ensure proper
    error handling when using the returned shared_ptr. If multiple threads access
    this method simultaneously, consider synchronization mechanisms around the provider
    access for thread safety.
