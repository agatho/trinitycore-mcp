api:
  class: QuestPickup
  method: PickupQuest
  signature: bool QuestPickup::PickupQuest(uint32 questId, Player * bot, uint32 questGiverGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the quest pickup process for a specified quest ID and player.
  description: The PickupQuest method is responsible for handling the logic of a player
    picking up a quest from a quest giver. It verifies if the quest can be accepted
    by the player, updates the player's quest log, and triggers any necessary quest-related
    events or updates in the game world. This method typically involves checking prerequisites
    such as quest level requirements, previous quest completion status, and player
    availability to accept new quests. The method returns true upon successful quest
    pickup, or false if the pickup fails due to invalid parameters, quest restrictions,
    or other game logic constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to be picked up. Must correspond
      to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who is picking
      up the quest. Cannot be null.
  - name: questGiverGuid
    description: The GUID of the quest giver (NPC or GameObject) from which the quest
      is being picked up. Used to validate the interaction context.
  returns: Returns true if the quest was successfully picked up and added to the player's
    quest log, false otherwise. Failure may occur due to invalid quest ID, player
    restrictions, or quest giver mismatch.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Pickup
    code: "if (questPickup->PickupQuest(12345, player, 67890)) {\n    // Quest pickup\
      \ successful\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Quest accepted!\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Quest pickup failed\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Could\
      \ not accept quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a player interacts with a valid quest
    giver. It assumes that the quest giver and player are within appropriate proximity
    and that the interaction context is valid. The method internally handles quest
    state updates, database synchronization, and sends relevant packets to the client.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided questId exists in the database, and that the
    bot pointer is valid before calling this method. Passing an invalid questGiverGuid
    may lead to unexpected behavior or quest pickup failures.
