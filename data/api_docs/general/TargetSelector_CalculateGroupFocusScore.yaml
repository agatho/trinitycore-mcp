  class: TargetSelector
  method: CalculateGroupFocusScore
  signature: float TargetSelector::CalculateGroupFocusScore(Unit * target, const SelectionContext
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a focus score for a target unit within a group context.
  description: The CalculateGroupFocusScore method evaluates how prioritized a given
    target unit is for focus targeting within the context of a group. It considers
    factors such as threat level, distance, target type, and other group-specific
    conditions to determine a numerical score. This score is used by the AI system
    to make decisions about which unit should be focused during combat. The method
    requires a valid target unit and selection context to compute the score accurately.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that represents the target for which the
      focus score is calculated. Must not be null.
  - name: context
    description: Reference to a SelectionContext object containing contextual information
      about the current selection state, including group members, threat data, and
      other relevant parameters.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated focus score for the target. Higher
    values indicate higher priority for focus targeting. Returns 0.0f if the target
    is invalid or not suitable for focus.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "float score = selector.CalculateGroupFocusScore(targetUnit, context);\n\
      if (score > 5.0f) {\n    // Focus this target\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using focus score to select best target in group
    code: "float bestScore = 0.0f;\nUnit* bestTarget = nullptr;\nfor (auto& member\
      \ : groupMembers) {\n    float score = selector.CalculateGroupFocusScore(member,\
      \ context);\n    if (score > bestScore) {\n        bestScore = score;\n    \
      \    bestTarget = member;\n    }\n}\nif (bestTarget) {\n    // Set focus on\
      \ bestTarget\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with group AI logic to determine
    optimal focus targets. The score calculation may vary depending on the specific
    implementation and game mechanics, such as threat distribution or target type
    preferences.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit pointer is valid before calling this method;
    passing a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior or an invalid
    score. Also, the context must be properly initialized with relevant group data
    for meaningful results.
