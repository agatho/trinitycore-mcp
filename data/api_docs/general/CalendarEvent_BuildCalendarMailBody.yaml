documentation:
  brief: Constructs and returns the body text of a calendar event invitation email
    for a specific player.
  description: The BuildCalendarMailBody method generates the formatted text content
    for an in-game calendar event invitation email that is sent to a specified player.
    This method constructs a human-readable message containing event details such
    as title, description, date, time, and other relevant information. The generated
    body is intended to be used within the TrinityCore's mail system to notify players
    about upcoming calendar events. It takes into account the invitee's locale and
    formatting preferences to ensure proper display of localized content. This method
    does not send the email itself but prepares the message body for use with the
    game's mail infrastructure.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the formatted body text of the calendar event
    invitation email, ready to be used in a mail system call. The string includes
    all relevant event details formatted appropriately for display in-game.
  examples:
  - title: Generate calendar event mail body for a player
    code: 'CalendarEvent event;

      // Assume event is properly initialized with data

      Player* player = ...; // Get reference to target player

      std::string mailBody = event.BuildCalendarMailBody(player);

      // mailBody now contains the formatted email content for the calendar event'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the calendar system when sending
    invitations. It relies on the CalendarEvent object having valid data populated,
    including title, description, and time information. The method does not perform
    any database operations or external API calls; it only formats existing data.
  warnings: Ensure that the CalendarEvent object has been properly initialized with
    all required fields before calling this method. Failure to do so may result in
    incomplete or malformed email content. This method should not be called directly
    from game logic without proper context, as it's designed for internal use within
    the calendar mail system.
