  brief: Loads and initializes all Battle for Azeroth dungeon data into the DungeonBehavior
    system
  description: The LoadBfADungeons method is responsible for loading and initializing
    all Battle for Azeroth dungeon configurations and data into the DungeonBehavior
    system. This method typically reads dungeon definitions, difficulty settings,
    spawn locations, and other relevant parameters from database tables or configuration
    files. It prepares the dungeon behavior system to handle player entries, quest
    tracking, and reward distribution for Battle for Azeroth content. The method is
    usually invoked during server startup or when the dungeon system needs to refresh
    its internal data structures.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'DungeonBehavior dungeonBehavior;

      dungeonBehavior.LoadBfADungeons();

      // Dungeon data is now loaded and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database queries to fetch dungeon information.
    It may be called during server startup or when content updates are applied. The
    method should only be called once per server instance unless dungeon data needs
    to be refreshed.
