  class: DiseaseManager
  method: DiseaseManager
  signature: void DiseaseManager::DiseaseManager(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a DiseaseManager instance for the specified player bot.
  description: The DiseaseManager constructor initializes internal state and data
    structures required for managing disease-related mechanics for a player bot. This
    includes setting up tracking of active diseases, their durations, and associated
    effects. The method prepares the manager to handle disease application, removal,
    and status updates for the specified player character. It establishes necessary
    references to the player's data and ensures proper integration with the game's
    disease system.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that this DiseaseManager
      will manage diseases for. Must be a valid player instance, cannot be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic DiseaseManager Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get reference to bot player

      DiseaseManager diseaseMgr(myBot);

      // diseaseMgr is now ready to manage diseases for myBot'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per DiseaseManager instance.
    The DiseaseManager assumes the provided Player pointer remains valid throughout
    its lifetime. Internal disease tracking data structures are initialized during
    construction and may consume additional memory proportional to the number of potential
    diseases that can affect the bot.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'bot' will likely result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the Player object is fully initialized before passing
    it to this constructor. The DiseaseManager does not perform automatic cleanup
    of disease effects - that responsibility lies with other system components.
