documentation:
  brief: Updates the motion manager's current movement state and processes pending
    actions.
  description: The MotionMaster::Update method handles the processing of movement-related
    actions for an object, typically a creature or player, within the World of Warcraft
    environment. It manages the execution of various movement behaviors including
    waypoints, follow, flee, or any other motion type that may be active. This method
    is called during each frame update cycle to ensure proper handling of movement
    commands and maintains synchronization between the object's physical position
    and its intended path. The method also checks for any pending movement updates
    or changes in behavior that need to be processed.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // This method is typically called internally\
      \ by the game engine\n    // during each frame update cycle\n    // It processes\
      \ movement states and handles pending actions\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core motion handling system in TrinityCore. It's
    called automatically by the game loop and should not be invoked directly by developers
    unless specifically needed for custom behavior. Performance considerations include
    avoiding excessive calls to this method during high-frequency updates.
