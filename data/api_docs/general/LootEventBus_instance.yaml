documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the LootEventBus class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the LootEventBus
    class, providing global access to a single, shared instance of the loot event
    handling system. This method ensures that only one LootEventBus object exists
    throughout the application lifecycle, allowing various subsystems to register
    for or trigger loot-related events consistently. The returned instance manages
    event callbacks for loot distribution, item acquisition, and related game mechanics
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton LootEventBus instance. The method never returns
    null as the singleton is guaranteed to be initialized during system startup.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "LootEventBus* bus = LootEventBus::instance();\nbus->RegisterLootEvent(LootEventType::LOOT_ITEM_RECEIVED,\
      \ [](Player* player, Item* item) {\n    // Handle loot event\n});"
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Instance for Event Registration
    code: "void InitializeLootSystem() {\n    auto* lootBus = LootEventBus::instance();\n\
      \    lootBus->RegisterLootEvent(LootEventType::LOOT_MONEY_RECEIVED, [](Player*\
      \ player, uint32 amount) {\n        sLog->outString(\"Player %s received %u\
      \ gold\", player->GetName(), amount);\n    });\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as the singleton instance is initialized during
    application startup. The LootEventBus singleton is typically initialized early
    in the TrinityCore server lifecycle and remains valid throughout the server's
    operation.
