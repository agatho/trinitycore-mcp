  signature: bool Map::IsScenario() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current map is a scenario instance.
  description: This method checks if the Map object represents a scenario-based content
    instance, such as a scenario dungeon or raid. It returns true when the map is
    specifically designed for scenario gameplay mechanics, and false otherwise. The
    method is commonly used in game logic to differentiate between regular instances
    and scenario instances, particularly during player encounters and quest handling.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map is a scenario instance, false otherwise. This indicates
    that the map contains scenario-specific content and mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Scenario Check
    code: "if (map->IsScenario())\n{\n    // Handle scenario-specific logic\n    //\
      \ e.g., special quest handling or scenario events\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other map-related methods
    to determine the type of instance a player is currently in. It's important to
    note that this method may return false for maps that are not explicitly scenario
    instances but might contain scenario content.
