  method: GetLastStartTime
  signature: time_t GameEventMgr::GetLastStartTime(uint16 event_id) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the last start time of a specified game event.
  description: The GetLastStartTime method returns the timestamp of when a specific
    game event was last started. This is useful for tracking event schedules, determining
    event cooldowns, or calculating time-based mechanics related to recurring events.
    The method takes a unique event identifier and returns the Unix timestamp (time_t)
    representing the last occurrence of that event's start time. If the event has
    never been started, it may return 0 or a default value indicating no previous
    start time.
  parameters: []
  returns: A time_t value representing the Unix timestamp of when the specified game
    event was last started. Returns 0 if the event has never been started or if the
    event_id is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Last Start Time for Event
    code: "uint16 eventId = 42;\ntime_t lastStartTime = sGameEventMgr->GetLastStartTime(eventId);\n\
      if (lastStartTime > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Event last started at: \" << lastStartTime\
      \ << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n    std::cout << \"Event has never been started.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with game event management systems
    to track recurring events. The returned time_t value can be converted to a human-readable
    date/time format using standard C++ time functions like localtime() or gmtime().
    This method is likely thread-safe as it's a const member function and doesn't
    modify internal state.
