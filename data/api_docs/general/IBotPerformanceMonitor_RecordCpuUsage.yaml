  class: IBotPerformanceMonitor
  method: RecordCpuUsage
  signature: void IBotPerformanceMonitor::RecordCpuUsage(float cpuPercent)
documentation:
  brief: Records the CPU usage percentage for performance monitoring purposes.
  description: The RecordCpuUsage method is used to log or store the current CPU utilization
    percentage within the bot performance monitoring system. This method allows developers
    and system administrators to track how much processing power is being consumed
    by bot operations, which is crucial for maintaining optimal server performance
    and identifying potential bottlenecks in AI-driven gameplay elements. The recorded
    data can be used for analytics, debugging, or adjusting bot behavior based on
    system load. This method does not perform any calculations itself but serves as
    a data recording point for CPU usage metrics collected elsewhere.
  parameters:
  - name: cpuPercent
    description: A floating-point value representing the current CPU usage percentage
      (0.0 to 100.0). Values outside this range may be clamped or result in undefined
      behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'IBotPerformanceMonitor* monitor = GetBotPerformanceMonitor();

      monitor->RecordCpuUsage(45.7f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording CPU Usage in a Loop
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i)\n{\n    float cpu = GetSystemCpuUsage();\n\
      \    monitor->RecordCpuUsage(cpu);\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called periodically by the performance monitoring
    subsystem. It's important to ensure that the cpuPercent value passed is a valid
    floating-point number within the expected range (0.0 - 100.0). The actual storage
    and processing of this data may vary depending on the implementation of the IBotPerformanceMonitor
    interface.
  warnings: Passing invalid values such as negative numbers or values greater than
    100.0 might lead to incorrect performance metrics or system instability. Always
    validate input before calling this method in production environments.
