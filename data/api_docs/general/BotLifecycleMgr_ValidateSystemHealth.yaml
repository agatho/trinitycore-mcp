  brief: Validates the overall health and stability of the bot lifecycle management
    system
  description: The ValidateSystemHealth method performs a comprehensive check of the
    bot lifecycle management system to ensure all components are functioning correctly.
    It verifies that bots are properly initialized, that their states are consistent,
    and that no critical system failures have occurred. This method is typically called
    during system startup, periodic maintenance, or when detecting potential issues
    with bot operations. The validation includes checking memory allocations, verifying
    internal data structures, ensuring thread safety, and confirming that all registered
    bot instances are in valid states. It may also trigger alerts or corrective actions
    if inconsistencies are detected.

  - title: Basic System Health Validation
    code: 'BotLifecycleMgr* mgr = BotLifecycleMgr::Instance();

      mgr->ValidateSystemHealth();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the system scheduler but
    can also be manually triggered for debugging purposes. It may perform resource-intensive
    checks and should not be called too frequently in production environments to avoid
    performance degradation.
