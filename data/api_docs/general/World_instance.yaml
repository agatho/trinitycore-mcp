  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the World class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the World
    class, providing global access to the single World object that represents the
    game world. This method ensures that only one instance of the World class exists
    throughout the application lifecycle. The returned pointer is guaranteed to be
    valid during the server's operation and should not be deleted or managed by the
    caller. This is a core method used extensively throughout TrinityCore's codebase
    to access global world state, configuration settings, and game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton World instance. The returned pointer is never
    null during normal server operation and represents the global game world object
    that manages all active zones, players, and game systems.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to access world configuration
    code: 'World* world = World::instance();

      uint32 maxPlayers = world->getConfig(CONFIG_MAX_PLAYER_COUNT);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing world time and game state
    code: 'World* world = World::instance();

      uint32 gameTime = world->GetGameTime();

      bool isPvP = world->IsPvPMode();

      uint32 realmId = world->GetRealmID();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses the singleton pattern which means all calls to World::instance()
    will return the same object reference. The World instance is created during server
    startup and destroyed at shutdown. This method is thread-safe as it's typically
    called from a single-threaded context, but care should be taken when accessing
    world state from multiple threads.
  warnings: While this is a singleton pattern implementation, developers should avoid
    creating additional World instances or managing the returned pointer manually.
    The World instance lifecycle is managed by the server itself and should not be
    deleted or modified directly.
