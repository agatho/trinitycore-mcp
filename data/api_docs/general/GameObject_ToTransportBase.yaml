  method: ToTransportBase
  signature: const TransportBase * GameObject::ToTransportBase() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the transport base object that a game object is attached to.
  description: This method retrieves the TransportBase object to which the GameObject
    is currently attached. It provides access to the transport's properties and functionality,
    allowing developers to interact with the transport system in World of Warcraft.
    The method is typically used when working with transports such as boats or elevators
    that move objects within the game world. This function is essential for determining
    the current transport state of a GameObject and enabling proper handling of transport-related
    events.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the TransportBase object that the GameObject is attached
    to, or nullptr if the GameObject is not currently attached to any transport.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "GameObject* go = ...;\nconst TransportBase* transport = go->ToTransportBase();\n\
      if (transport != nullptr)\n{\n    // GameObject is attached to a transport\n\
      \    // Do something with the transport\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it may return nullptr if the GameObject
    is not attached to any transport. The returned pointer is valid only while the
    transport exists and should not be used after the transport has been destroyed
    or removed from the game world.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in scenarios involving multiple transports,
    as a GameObject might be attached to different transports at various times during
    its lifecycle. Also, avoid dereferencing the returned pointer without checking
    for null first.
