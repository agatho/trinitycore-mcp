  class: BotAI
  method: IsSolo
  signature: bool BotAI::IsSolo() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot is operating in solo mode without group members.
  description: The IsSolo method checks if the bot is currently running in a solo
    configuration, meaning it is not part of a player group or raid. This method evaluates
    the bot's current party status and returns true if no group members are present,
    indicating that the bot is operating independently. The check typically involves
    examining the bot's Group object and verifying its size or membership status.
    This functionality is essential for bots to adapt their behavior based on whether
    they are solo or in a group context, such as adjusting loot distribution preferences,
    combat strategies, or questing approaches.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot is operating solo (not in a group), false otherwise.
    This indicates that the bot has no fellow group members and is functioning independently.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check solo status
    code: "if (botAI->IsSolo()) {\n    // Bot is solo, adjust behavior accordingly\n\
      \    botAI->SetBehavior(BotBehavior::SOLO);\n} else {\n    // Bot is in a group\n\
      \    botAI->SetBehavior(BotBehavior::GROUP);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsSolo to conditionally execute solo-specific actions
    code: "if (botAI->IsSolo()) {\n    // Execute solo questing logic\n    botAI->PerformSoloQuesting();\n\
      } else {\n    // Execute group-based questing logic\n    botAI->PerformGroupQuesting();\n\
      }\n// Additional logic based on solo status\nif (botAI->IsSolo()) {\n    //\
      \ Solo-specific loot handling\n    botAI->HandleSoloLoot();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on the internal group tracking mechanism of the bot AI
    system. It's important to note that this check may not immediately reflect changes
    in group membership if the bot's state hasn't been updated recently. The implementation
    likely caches the result for performance reasons, so frequent calls might return
    stale data.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a definitive indicator of combat readiness
    since a bot can be solo but still engaged in combat. Additionally, calling this
    method during critical AI processing phases may introduce race conditions if group
    membership changes occur concurrently.
