  brief: Checks if a player has a specific local flag set.
  description: This method determines whether a player has a particular PlayerLocalFlag
    set within their local flags. It is used to verify the presence of specific game
    mechanics or state flags that affect player behavior. The method returns true
    if the specified flag is present, false otherwise. This functionality is essential
    for checking player states and ensuring proper game logic execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified PlayerLocalFlag is set in the player's local
    flags, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic flag check
    code: "if (player->HasPlayerLocalFlag(PlayerLocalFlags::PLAYER_LOCAL_FLAG_PVP_TOGGLE))\
      \ {\n    // Do something\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is implemented as a simple bitwise operation check. Performance
    is generally good, but excessive use in tight loops may impact performance. Thread
    safety depends on the specific flag being checked.
  warnings: Care should be taken when checking flags that might change during gameplay.
    Some flags are only set under specific conditions and may not persist across all
    game states.
