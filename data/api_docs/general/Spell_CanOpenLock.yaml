    lockid, int & skillid, int32 & reqSkillValue, int32 & skillValue)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can open a lock based on skill requirements and
    lock ID.
  description: This method evaluates if a player has sufficient skill level to open
    a specific lock, considering the lock's ID and the required skill value. It checks
    against the spell effect's skill requirements and returns a SpellCastResult indicating
    success or failure. The method is used in conjunction with spell casting mechanics
    to determine if a player can successfully use a lock, typically during lock picking
    or key usage scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: effect
    description: The spell effect information that contains the skill requirements
      and lock ID details for the lock being evaluated.
  - name: lockid
    description: The unique identifier of the lock being checked, typically representing
      a lock type or item ID in World of Warcraft.
  - name: skillid
    description: Reference to the skill ID that is used for checking against the required
      skill level. This value may be modified during the evaluation process.
  - name: reqSkillValue
    description: Reference to the required skill value needed to open the lock, which
      may be adjusted based on the spell effect's requirements.
  - name: skillValue
    description: Reference to the current skill value of the player, which is used
      in comparison with the required skill value during evaluation.
  returns: SpellCastResult representing whether the player can open the lock. Possible
    values include SPELL_CAST_SUCCESS, SPELL_CAST_FAILED, or other related spell cast
    results depending on skill and lock conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Lock Opening Example
    code: "SpellCastResult result = spell->CanOpenLock(effect, lockId, skillId, reqSkillValue,\
      \ skillValue);\nif (result == SPELL_CAST_SUCCESS)\n{\n    // Player can open\
      \ the lock\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player cannot open the lock\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in spell casting logic and requires proper
    handling of skill values and lock IDs. It may involve complex interactions between
    player skills, spell effects, and lock types.
  warnings: Care must be taken when handling references to skillId, reqSkillValue,
    and skillValue as they can affect the outcome of the evaluation. Incorrect handling
    may lead to incorrect results or failure to open locks.
