  class: DefaultTargetSelector
  method: DefaultTargetSelector
  signature: void DefaultTargetSelector::DefaultTargetSelector(const Unit * unit,
    float dist, bool playerOnly, bool withMainTank, int32 aura)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a default target selector with specified parameters for unit
    targeting logic.
  description: The DefaultTargetSelector constructor initializes a target selection
    mechanism used by AI scripts in TrinityCore. It configures the selector to evaluate
    potential targets based on distance, player-only filtering, main tank inclusion,
    and aura requirements. This method sets up internal state that determines how
    units will select their targets during combat behavior. The selector is typically
    used within AI update routines where mobs need to identify appropriate enemies
    to attack.
  parameters:
  - name: unit
    description: Pointer to the unit that owns this target selector. Used as the reference
      point for distance calculations and target evaluation.
  - name: dist
    description: Maximum distance within which targets will be considered. Negative
      values typically indicate no distance restriction.
  - name: playerOnly
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether only player-controlled units should
      be considered as valid targets.
  - name: withMainTank
    description: Boolean flag determining if the main tank (if exists) should be included
      in target selection logic, particularly for threat-based targeting.
  - name: aura
    description: Aura ID that targets must possess to be considered valid. A value
      of -1 indicates no aura requirement.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic DefaultTargetSelector Initialization
    code: DefaultTargetSelector selector(mob, 30.0f, true, false, -1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Target Selection with Aura Requirement
    code: DefaultTargetSelector selector(creature, 25.0f, false, true, 12345);
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any target selection itself; it merely
    sets up the criteria for future target evaluation. The actual target selection
    occurs when calling methods like 'SelectTarget' on the selector instance. Performance
    is generally low as this method only initializes state and does not iterate over
    targets.
  warnings: Ensure that the unit pointer passed is valid and not null, otherwise undefined
    behavior may occur during distance calculations or target evaluation. Be cautious
    with large distance values as they can cause performance issues in densely populated
    areas.
