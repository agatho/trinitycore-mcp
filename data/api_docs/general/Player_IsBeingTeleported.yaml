  signature: bool Player::IsBeingTeleported() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player is currently being teleported by the game system.
  description: This method determines whether a player is in the process of being
    teleported, typically during a teleportation event such as when entering a new
    zone or when a player is moved to a different location. It returns true if the
    player is currently undergoing a teleportation operation, and false otherwise.
    This method is commonly used to prevent certain actions or interactions during
    active teleportation events, ensuring game stability and preventing potential
    exploits or errors during movement.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently being teleported, false otherwise.
    The value indicates whether a teleportation operation is actively in progress.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsBeingTeleported()) {\n    // Do not allow actions\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the game engine to prevent interactions
    during teleportation. It may be called in conjunction with other methods like
    IsInWorld() or IsBeingTeleportedByPlayer() to determine if a player is in a valid
    state for actions.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a direct replacement for checking if
    a player is in a different zone, as it only indicates whether the player is currently
    being teleported, not whether they are in the new zone. It's important to understand
    that this method does not necessarily mean the player has finished teleporting.
