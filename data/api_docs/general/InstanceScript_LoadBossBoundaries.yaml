documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes boss boundary data for instance scripting.
  description: The LoadBossBoundaries method is used within TrinityCore's InstanceScript
    framework to register and initialize boundary definitions for bosses within a
    dungeon or raid instance. This allows the game engine to enforce movement restrictions,
    prevent players from leaving designated areas during boss encounters, and manage
    encounter mechanics that depend on positional constraints. The method typically
    processes a BossBoundaryData structure containing information about each boss's
    allowed movement area, including coordinates, dimensions, and associated flags.
    It is usually called during instance initialization or when loading saved data
    for encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: A constant reference to a BossBoundaryData structure containing boundary
      definitions for bosses in the instance. This includes positional data, area
      constraints, and encounter-specific flags that define how boss movement is restricted
      within the instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "class BossInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    void\
      \ Initialize() override\n    {\n        BossBoundaryData boundaryData;\n   \
      \     // Set up boundary data for bosses\n        LoadBossBoundaries(boundaryData);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple Boss Boundaries
    code: "class MyDungeonScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    void LoadBossBoundaries(const\
      \ BossBoundaryData & data) override\n    {\n        // Process each boundary\
      \ in the data structure\n        for (const auto& boundary : data.boundaries)\n\
      \        {\n            // Apply boundary constraints to boss movement\n   \
      \         // Example: Set up area triggers, teleport restrictions, etc.\n  \
      \      }\n        // Call parent implementation if needed\n        InstanceScript::LoadBossBoundaries(data);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during instance initialization or when restoring
    encounter states. Developers should ensure that boundary data is properly formatted
    and validated before calling this method to avoid runtime errors. The implementation
    may involve internal data structures for tracking boss positions and movement
    restrictions.
  warnings: Improperly configured boundary data can lead to players being unable to
    interact with bosses or experiencing unexpected behavior during encounters. Ensure
    all boundary coordinates are within valid instance limits and that the BossBoundaryData
    structure is correctly populated before calling this method.
