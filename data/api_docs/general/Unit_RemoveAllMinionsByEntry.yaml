  class: Unit
  method: RemoveAllMinionsByEntry
  signature: void Unit::RemoveAllMinionsByEntry(uint32 entry)
documentation:
  brief: Removes all minions from the unit's summon list that match a specific entry
    ID.
  description: This method removes all creatures minions summoned by the Unit that
    have a specific entry ID. It is commonly used in AI scripts to clean up summoned
    creatures when a boss or NPC needs to reset or when certain conditions are met.
    The method operates on the unit's summon list and will remove all minions matching
    the provided entry, regardless of their current state or ownership. This functionality
    is essential for managing summoned creatures in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The creature entry ID to match against the summoned minions. Only
      minions with this specific entry ID will be removed from the summon list.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* pUnit = GetUnit();


      pUnit->RemoveAllMinionsByEntry(12345);

      // Removes all minions with entry ID 12345 from the unit''s summon list'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other summon-related methods
    to manage creature AI behavior. It should be called carefully as it may affect
    the state of summoned creatures and their AI scripts. The method is thread-safe
    when called on a unit that is not currently being processed by an AI script.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method, as removing minions might cause issues
    if the AI script expects those minions to remain active. Also, if multiple minions
    with the same entry ID are present, all will be removed, potentially affecting
    gameplay mechanics.
