  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: LeaveBattleground
  signature: bool AdvancedBehaviorManager::LeaveBattleground()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the process for a player to leave a battleground.
  description: The LeaveBattleground method attempts to remove the player from the
    current battleground instance. This method typically handles the necessary cleanup
    and state transitions required when a player exits a battleground, including removing
    them from the battleground queue, resetting their battleground-related flags,
    and potentially teleporting them to a safe location. The method ensures that the
    player's game state is properly updated to reflect their departure from the battleground
    environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player was successfully removed from the battleground
    and the exit process was initiated; returns false if the player was not in a battleground
    or if the exit process failed for any reason.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (player->GetAdvancedBehaviorManager()->LeaveBattleground()) {\n    //\
      \ Player successfully left the battleground\n    sLog->outString(\"Player has\
      \ left the battleground.\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to leave the battleground\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Failed to leave the battleground for player.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player is actually inside a battleground.
    Calling it outside of a battleground context may result in undefined behavior
    or failed operations. The actual teleportation and state updates are handled asynchronously
    by the core.
  warnings: Do not call this method if the player is already in the process of leaving
    the battleground, as it could lead to inconsistent game states or crashes. Ensure
    that the player object is valid before calling this method.
