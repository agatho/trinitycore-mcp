  signature: int * GuildEventCoordinator::FormEventGroup(uint32 eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a pointer to a new event group associated with the specified
    event ID.
  description: The FormEventGroup method is responsible for creating a new event group
    within the GuildEventCoordinator system. It takes an event identifier as input
    and attempts to form a new group for that event, returning a pointer to the newly
    created group. This method likely manages the internal data structures required
    for organizing guild events into logical groups, which may be used for scheduling,
    tracking, or processing purposes. The returned pointer should be managed carefully
    by the caller to prevent memory leaks or dangling references. This functionality
    is essential for maintaining organized event handling within the guild management
    system of TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the identifier of the newly formed
    event group, or nullptr if the operation fails due to invalid input or internal
    errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;\nint* groupId = coordinator.FormEventGroup(12345);\n\
      if (groupId != nullptr) {\n    std::cout << \"Event group formed with ID: \"\
      \ << *groupId << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"Failed to form event\
      \ group.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves internal state management and may require synchronization
    if used in a multi-threaded environment. The returned integer pointer should be
    treated as a handle to the group, not as a direct value.
  warnings: The caller must ensure that the eventId parameter is valid and corresponds
    to an existing event; otherwise, the method may return nullptr or throw an exception
    depending on implementation details. Improper handling of the returned pointer
    can lead to undefined behavior.
