  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::~AdvancedBehaviorManager()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AdvancedBehaviorManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the AdvancedBehaviorManager class is responsible
    for releasing all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime.
    This includes cleaning up behavior trees, AI state data, and any dynamically allocated
    structures used by the advanced AI system. The destructor ensures proper resource
    deallocation to prevent memory leaks in the TrinityCore server environment. It
    should be called automatically when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted, and it typically performs cleanup operations without throwing exceptions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of AdvancedBehaviorManager
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    AdvancedBehaviorManager manager;\n    // ...\
      \ use manager ...\n    // Destructor called automatically here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of AdvancedBehaviorManager pointer
    code: 'AdvancedBehaviorManager* manager = new AdvancedBehaviorManager();

      // ... use manager ...

      delete manager; // Calls destructor explicitly'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when an object
    goes out of scope or is deleted. It's important to ensure that no other objects
    hold references to the manager during destruction, as this could lead to undefined
    behavior. The destructor should not be called directly on a pointer if the object
    was not allocated with 'new', and it's generally recommended to use smart pointers
    for automatic memory management.
  warnings: Never call the destructor manually on stack-allocated objects, as this
    leads to undefined behavior. Also, ensure that all references to the manager are
    cleared before destruction to avoid dangling pointers or access violations.
