  method: UpdatePositioningMetrics
  signature: void CombatStateAnalyzer::UpdatePositioningMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Updates positioning metrics for combat state analysis.
  description: The UpdatePositioningMetrics method calculates and refreshes key positioning
    data used in combat state analysis. This includes determining relative distances,
    angles, and positional relationships between combatants to inform tactical decisions
    and combat effectiveness assessments. The method is typically invoked during combat
    updates or when positional changes occur, ensuring that the analyzer maintains
    accurate spatial context for its calculations. It does not require any external
    inputs beyond the current combatant positions and states.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update Loop
    code: "void CombatManager::UpdateCombatState()\n{\n    // ... other combat logic\
      \ ...\n    analyzer.UpdatePositioningMetrics();\n    // ... continue with analysis\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is performance-critical during active combat and should be called
    sparingly to avoid unnecessary computational overhead. It relies on up-to-date
    position data from the game world, so it's recommended to call this after any
    significant positional changes.
