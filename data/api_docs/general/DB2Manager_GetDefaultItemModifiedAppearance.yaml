  signature: const ItemModifiedAppearanceEntry * DB2Manager::GetDefaultItemModifiedAppearance(uint32
    itemId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the default item modified appearance entry for a given item ID.
  description: This method fetches the default ItemModifiedAppearanceEntry associated
    with a specific item ID from the DB2 database. It is used primarily in World of
    Warcraft's item appearance system to determine how an item should look by default,
    without any enchantments or modifications applied. The returned entry contains
    information about the item's appearance properties such as visual effects, model
    details, and cosmetic modifiers. This method is typically called during item initialization
    or when displaying item information in the UI.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the ItemModifiedAppearanceEntry structure that defines the
    default appearance properties for the specified item ID. Returns nullptr if no
    matching entry is found in the DB2 data.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Default Appearance for an Item
    code: "const ItemModifiedAppearanceEntry* appearance = sDB2Manager->GetDefaultItemModifiedAppearance(12345);\n\
      if (appearance)\n{\n    // Use appearance data\n    printf(\"Item %u has default\
      \ appearance ID: %u\\n\", 12345, appearance->ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the DB2Manager's internal caching mechanism. The ItemModifiedAppearanceEntry
    data is loaded from the 'ItemModifiedAppearance.db2' file during server startup.
    Ensure that the DB2 files are properly loaded before calling this method, otherwise
    it may return null for valid item IDs.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with invalid or non-existent item IDs
    as it will return nullptr without any error indication. Always check for null
    returns before dereferencing the returned pointer to prevent crashes.
