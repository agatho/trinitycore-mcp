  method: SetAutoOrganizationEnabled
  signature: void GuildBankManager::SetAutoOrganizationEnabled(uint32 guildId, bool
    enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the auto-organization feature for a specified guild's
    bank.
  description: The SetAutoOrganizationEnabled method controls whether a guild's bank
    automatically organizes items when they are deposited. When enabled, the system
    will attempt to sort and place items in optimal slots within the guild bank tabs
    based on item type, quality, and other criteria. This feature helps maintain order
    and efficiency in large guild banks. The method operates on a per-guild basis
    using the provided guild identifier. Changes take effect immediately for subsequent
    bank operations.
  parameters:
  - name: guildId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild whose auto-organization setting
      will be modified. Must correspond to an existing guild in the database.
  - name: enabled
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      the auto-organization feature for the specified guild's bank.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Auto Organization for Guild
    code: GuildBankManager::SetAutoOrganizationEnabled(12345, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Auto Organization for Guild
    code: GuildBankManager::SetAutoOrganizationEnabled(67890, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal guild bank settings in the database or
    cache. It may be called from game commands or administrative interfaces. The auto-organization
    behavior is typically applied when items are deposited into the guild bank, not
    during retrieval.
