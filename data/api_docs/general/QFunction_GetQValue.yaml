  class: QFunction
  method: GetQValue
  signature: float QFunction::GetQValue(const int & state, uint32_t action) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the Q-value for a given state and action in the context of reinforcement
    learning.
  description: The GetQValue method returns the Q-value associated with a specific
    state-action pair. This function is typically used within reinforcement learning
    algorithms to evaluate the expected utility of taking a particular action in a
    given state. The Q-value represents the long-term reward that can be expected
    from following a policy starting from the current state and taking the specified
    action. In the context of TrinityCore's AI systems, this method may be part of
    an agent's decision-making process where actions are selected based on learned
    Q-values.
  parameters:
  - name: state
    description: The current state identifier used to index into the Q-table or Q-function.
      This value typically represents a discrete state in the environment.
  - name: action
    description: The action identifier for which the Q-value is being retrieved. Must
      be a valid action index within the defined action space.
  returns: A float representing the Q-value for the specified state-action pair. The
    value indicates the expected cumulative reward of taking the given action in the
    given state according to the learned policy.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: float qValue = qFunction.GetQValue(5, 2); // Get Q-value for state 5, action
      2
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Decision Making
    code: "int bestAction = 0;\nfloat maxQ = -FLT_MAX;\nfor (uint32_t action = 0;\
      \ action < numActions; ++action) {\n    float q = qFunction.GetQValue(currentState,\
      \ action);\n    if (q > maxQ) {\n        maxQ = q;\n        bestAction = action;\n\
      \    }\n}\n// Use bestAction for next move"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Q-function has been properly initialized and
    updated with training data. The state and action parameters must be within valid
    ranges defined by the system's state and action spaces respectively. Performance
    may degrade if the Q-function is implemented as a sparse table without efficient
    lookup mechanisms.
  warnings: Ensure that the state and action indices are valid before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior or memory access violations. This function
    should not be called with invalid parameters as it might lead to incorrect decision-making
    in reinforcement learning agents.
