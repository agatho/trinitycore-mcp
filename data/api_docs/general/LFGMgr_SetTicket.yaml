  class: LFGMgr
  method: SetTicket
  signature: void LFGMgr::SetTicket(int guid, const WorldPackets::LFG::RideTicket
    & ticket)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the LFG ticket for a player identified by their GUID.
  description: The SetTicket method assigns or updates a Looking For Group (LFG) ride
    ticket for a specific player within the TrinityCore framework. This functionality
    is used to manage player participation in group activities such as dungeons, raids,
    or battlegrounds. The method takes a player's unique identifier (GUID) and a ride
    ticket structure containing relevant LFG data. It updates the internal LFG manager's
    state with this information, allowing the system to track player group preferences
    and availability. This is typically invoked when players join or modify their
    LFG status through the game interface.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose LFG ticket is being
      set. Must be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  - name: ticket
    description: An instance of WorldPackets::LFG::RideTicket containing the LFG group
      information for the player. Includes details such as dungeon ID, difficulty,
      and other relevant group settings.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Player's LFG Ticket
    code: 'uint64 playerGuid = 12345;

      WorldPackets::LFG::RideTicket ticket;

      ticket.DungeonID = 123;

      ticket.Difficulty = DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_NORMAL;

      LFGMgr::Instance()->SetTicket(playerGuid, ticket);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG system and should only be called from within
    the game's core logic or appropriate subsystems. The internal state of the LFG
    manager may be modified directly by this call, so it must be used carefully in
    multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Calling SetTicket with an invalid GUID may result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the player exists and is valid before calling this method.
