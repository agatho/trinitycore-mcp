  class: PlayerbotGroupScript
  method: CheckTargetIconChanges
  signature: void PlayerbotGroupScript::CheckTargetIconChanges(Group * group, GroupState
    & state)
documentation:
  brief: Checks for changes in target icons within a group and updates the group state
    accordingly.
  description: The CheckTargetIconChanges method monitors and evaluates whether any
    target icons assigned to group members have changed since the last check. It is
    typically invoked during bot AI processing to ensure that the group's state reflects
    current target assignments. This method iterates through group members, compares
    their current target icon states against previously stored values, and updates
    the provided GroupState object with any detected changes. The functionality supports
    dynamic targeting strategies in player bot groups where icons are used to indicate
    priority targets or objectives.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group being monitored
      for target icon changes.
  - name: state
    description: Reference to a GroupState object that will be updated with any detected
      changes in target icons.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within bot AI logic
    code: "void PlayerbotAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (Group* group = GetGroup())\n \
      \   {\n        GroupState state;\n        playerbotGroupScript->CheckTargetIconChanges(group,\
      \ state);\n        // Process updated state\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended to be called frequently during bot AI updates. It
    assumes that the Group object passed in is valid and contains active members.
    Performance may degrade if used excessively without proper throttling or caching
    of previous icon states.
  warnings: Ensure that the GroupState object is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as it may rely on previous state values for comparison. Passing a
    null group pointer will likely result in undefined behavior.
