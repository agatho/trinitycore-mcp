  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: GenerateSafePositions
  signature: int MechanicAwareness::GenerateSafePositions(const int & currentPos,
    float searchRadius)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the number of safe positions around a given location
    within a specified radius.
  description: The GenerateSafePositions method determines viable, unobstructed locations
    surrounding a provided position within a defined search radius. It is typically
    used in AI pathfinding or spell targeting logic to identify locations where units
    can safely move or be placed without colliding with obstacles or invalid terrain.
    The method evaluates the current position and searches for valid waypoints or
    positions that meet predefined safety criteria, such as being walkable and free
    from harmful effects or solid objects. This functionality is essential in game
    mechanics involving positioning, avoidance behavior, or area-of-effect spell placement.
  parameters:
  - name: currentPos
    description: The reference position (as an integer) around which safe positions
      are to be calculated. This value typically represents a coordinate or index
      within the game world's spatial system.
  - name: searchRadius
    description: The maximum distance from the current position to search for valid,
      safe locations. Must be a positive floating-point number representing units
      in the game world.
  returns: Returns an integer indicating the total count of valid, safe positions
    found within the specified radius. A return value of zero indicates no safe positions
    were identified, while a positive integer reflects the number of usable locations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find safe positions near a player
    code: int safeCount = mechanicAwareness.GenerateSafePositions(playerPosition,
      10.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using result to iterate through safe positions for spell targeting
    code: "int count = awareness.GenerateSafePositions(targetPos, 5.0f);\nif (count\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Process each safe position\n    for (int i = 0; i < count;\
      \ ++i) {\n        // Access calculated safe position\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal spatial queries against the game world's
    collision system to determine walkability and safety. It may cache results or
    use precomputed navigation data for performance. The exact implementation details
    depend on how MechanicAwareness integrates with TrinityCore's AI and movement
    systems.
  warnings: Ensure that the input position is valid and within the bounds of the current
    map to avoid undefined behavior. The method may return zero if no safe positions
    exist in the specified radius, which should be handled gracefully by calling code.
