documentation:
  brief: Removes the minion from the game world, making it no longer visible or interactable
    by players.
  description: The RemoveFromWorld method is responsible for removing a Minion instance
    from the active game world. This function typically handles the cleanup of the
    minion's presence in the world state, ensuring that it is no longer processed
    by the game engine's update loops and is not visible to any players. The method
    may also manage internal references and state changes necessary to properly detach
    the minion from the world context. It is commonly called when a minion is dismissed,
    despawned, or when its lifecycle ends naturally within the game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Minion Removal
    code: 'Minion* myMinion = ...;

      myMinion->RemoveFromWorld();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on minions that are currently in the world.
    Calling it on a minion that has already been removed may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. The implementation likely involves removing the minion from the world's
    object manager and clearing its associated data structures.
  warnings: Do not call RemoveFromWorld on a minion that is already removed or destroyed,
    as this can result in memory corruption or access violations. Always verify the
    minion's state before invoking this method.
