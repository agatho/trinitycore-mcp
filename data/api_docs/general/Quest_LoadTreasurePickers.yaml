  brief: Loads treasure picker data for quest items.
  description: This method initializes and loads the treasure picker data for quest
    items, which determines how loot is distributed among players when a quest item
    is obtained. It handles the internal data structures required for managing quest-related
    loot distributions and ensures proper initialization of the treasure picker system.
    The method typically runs during quest loading processes to prepare the necessary
    data structures for loot distribution.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Quest quest;

      quest.LoadTreasurePickers(nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during quest initialization and should only
    be invoked once per quest instance. It may involve internal data structures that
    need to be properly initialized before any loot distribution occurs.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by external code; it's an internal
    method used during quest loading process. Calling this method multiple times can
    cause memory issues or incorrect loot distribution.
