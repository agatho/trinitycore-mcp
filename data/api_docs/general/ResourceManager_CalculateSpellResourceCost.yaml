  signature: uint32 ResourceManager::CalculateSpellResourceCost(uint32 spellId, ResourceType
    type)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the resource cost of a spell based on its ID and resource type.
  description: The CalculateSpellResourceCost method determines the amount of a specific
    resource (such as mana, rage, or energy) required to cast a given spell. This
    method is typically used during spell execution to verify that the caster has
    sufficient resources before proceeding with the spell's effects. It retrieves
    the necessary resource cost from internal spell data structures and applies any
    relevant modifiers or calculations based on the current game state or character
    properties. The method ensures accurate resource management within the TrinityCore
    framework, supporting proper gameplay mechanics for spell casting and resource
    consumption.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell for which to calculate the resource
      cost. This ID must correspond to a valid spell entry in the database.
  - name: type
    description: The type of resource to calculate the cost for. Valid values are
      typically defined by the ResourceType enum, such as MANA, RAGE, ENERGY, or RUNE.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the calculated resource cost required
    to cast the specified spell with the given resource type. If the spell does not
    require the specified resource type, or if an error occurs during calculation,
    the method may return zero.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 manaCost = resourceManager.CalculateSpellResourceCost(12345, ResourceType::MANA);

      // Returns the mana cost for spell ID 12345 if it requires mana.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Resource Cost Before Casting
    code: "uint32 energyCost = resourceManager.CalculateSpellResourceCost(67890, ResourceType::ENERGY);\n\
      if (energyCost > 0) {\n    // Proceed with spell casting logic\n    player->ModifyPower(POWER_ENERGY,\
      \ -static_cast<int32>(energyCost));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spell data tables and may be affected by custom
    modifications or expansions. The calculation might include effects from buffs,
    debuffs, or class-specific modifiers that influence resource costs. Ensure the
    spell ID is valid before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid spellId or unsupported ResourceType
    can lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. Always validate inputs and
    handle potential zero returns appropriately when checking for resource requirements.
