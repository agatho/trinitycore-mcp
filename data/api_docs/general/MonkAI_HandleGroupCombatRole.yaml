  signature: void MonkAI::HandleGroupCombatRole()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the monk's group combat role assignment based on current combat state
    and team composition.
  description: The HandleGroupCombatRole method in the MonkAI class determines and
    assigns an appropriate combat role for a monk character within a group context.
    This method evaluates the current combat situation, including target threat levels,
    player health status, and group dynamics to decide whether the monk should assume
    a tanking, healing, or damage-dealing role. It ensures optimal positioning and
    role distribution among group members for effective raid or dungeon combat performance.
    The method typically executes during combat updates and may adjust the monk's
    behavior based on encounter mechanics and class-specific abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat update loop
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) override\n{\n    if (UpdateVictim())\n     \
      \   DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n    \n    // Handle group role assignment during\
      \ combat\n    HandleGroupCombatRole();\n    \n    // Continue with other AI\
      \ logic\n    if (m_events.Empty())\n        return;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the main AI update loop and should
    not be invoked manually unless specifically required for custom behavior. The
    role assignment logic considers both individual player stats and group coordination
    to optimize team performance.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat update contexts as it may cause
    unexpected behavior in role assignments. The method assumes valid group context
    and will not function correctly if the monk is not part of a group.
