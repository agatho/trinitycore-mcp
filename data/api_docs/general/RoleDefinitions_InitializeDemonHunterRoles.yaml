documentation:
  brief: Initializes the role definitions for Demon Hunter specializations within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The InitializeDemonHunterRoles method sets up and configures the default
    role assignments and behaviors specific to Demon Hunters in World of Warcraft.
    This function is typically called during server initialization or when loading
    class-specific configurations. It ensures that all Demon Hunter roles such as
    Havoc, Vengeance, and other specialization-based roles are properly registered
    with the game's role management system. The method likely populates internal data
    structures that determine how Demon Hunters interact with group dynamics, threat
    generation, and ability prioritization within the game mechanics.

  notes: This method is expected to be called once during server startup or class
    configuration loading. It likely interacts with the core role management system
    and may depend on specific game data files or database entries that define Demon
    Hunter roles.
