documentation:
  brief: Resets all runes for the player, making them available for use again
  description: The ResetRunes method restores all cooldowned runes to their default
    state, making them immediately usable by the player. This method is typically
    invoked during player login, level-ups, or when specific game events occur that
    require rune regeneration. The function operates on the player's rune system,
    which is part of the Death Knight class mechanics in World of Warcraft. It ensures
    that all runes are reset to their base cooldown state without any remaining time
    restrictions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Login
    code: "void Player::OnLogin()\n{\n    RuneManager::ResetRunes();\n    // All runes\
      \ are now available for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the player's rune cooldown timers and should
    only be called when appropriate game state transitions occur. The implementation
    likely iterates through all rune types (Blood, Unholy, Frost, Death) and resets
    their cooldown values to zero.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of proper game state transitions may cause
    unexpected behavior in rune usage mechanics. Ensure that rune reset logic aligns
    with the game's intended progression system.
