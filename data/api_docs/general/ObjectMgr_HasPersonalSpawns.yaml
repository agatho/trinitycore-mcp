  class: ObjectMgr
  method: HasPersonalSpawns
  signature: bool ObjectMgr::HasPersonalSpawns(uint32 mapid, int spawnMode, uint32
    phaseId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specific map has personal spawns for the given spawn mode
    and phase ID.
  description: The HasPersonalSpawns method determines if there are any personal spawns
    configured for a specified map, spawn mode, and phase ID. This is commonly used
    in TrinityCore to manage instance-specific or phase-based creature and game object
    spawning. The method evaluates internal data structures that track spawn configurations
    and returns true if matching personal spawns exist, otherwise false. It's typically
    invoked during map loading or spawn initialization processes to ensure proper
    spawn behavior based on the current phase and spawn mode settings.
  parameters:
  - name: mapid
    description: The unique identifier of the map to check for personal spawns. Valid
      values are any valid map ID defined in the game database.
  - name: spawnMode
    description: The spawn mode to evaluate. This typically represents different difficulty
      levels or instance modes (e.g., normal, heroic, mythic). Valid values depend
      on server configuration and expansion support.
  - name: phaseId
    description: The phase ID to check against. Personal spawns may be associated
      with specific phases, allowing for conditional spawning based on current phase
      state.
  returns: Returns true if personal spawns exist for the specified map, spawn mode,
    and phase ID; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (sObjectMgr->HasPersonalSpawns(1234, 0, 567)) {\n    // Process personal\
      \ spawns for map 1234 in normal mode with phase 567\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spawn Logic
    code: "uint32 currentMapId = player->GetMapId();\nuint32 currentPhase = player->GetPhaseMask();\n\
      if (sObjectMgr->HasPersonalSpawns(currentMapId, 1, currentPhase)) {\n    //\
      \ Enable special spawn handling for this phase and map\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spawn configuration data structures that are
    populated during server startup or map loading. It's important to note that the
    method may not account for runtime changes to spawn configurations unless those
    changes are properly synchronized with the ObjectMgr's internal state.
  warnings: The method assumes valid parameters and does not perform explicit validation.
    Passing invalid map IDs, spawn modes, or phase IDs may lead to unexpected behavior
    or incorrect results. Ensure proper parameter bounds checking in calling code.
