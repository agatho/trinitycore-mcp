  signature: bool SmartAIMgr::NotNULL(const SmartScriptHolder & e, uint32 data)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a SmartScriptHolder element is not null and valid for processing
  description: The NotNULL method verifies whether a given SmartScriptHolder element
    contains valid data and is ready for use in the AI system. This method performs
    essential validation to ensure that script entries are properly initialized before
    execution, preventing potential crashes or undefined behavior. It checks internal
    state flags and data integrity of the script holder to determine if it can be
    safely processed by the SmartAI framework. The method is typically used internally
    by the SmartAIMgr to filter out invalid or uninitialized script entries during
    AI processing cycles.
  parameters:
  - name: e
    description: Reference to a SmartScriptHolder object containing AI script data
      to validate
  - name: data
    description: Additional data parameter used for validation context, typically
      contains script-specific configuration or flags
  returns: Returns true if the SmartScriptHolder element is valid and not null, false
    otherwise. A return value of false indicates that the script entry either lacks
    required data, has invalid configuration, or is in an uninitialized state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation check
    code: "SmartScriptHolder holder;\n// ... initialize holder with script data ...\n\
      if (sSmartAIMgr->NotNULL(holder, 0)) {\n    // Process valid script\n    sSmartAIMgr->ExecuteScript(holder);\n\
      } else {\n    // Skip invalid script\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(LOG_FILTER_AI, \"Skipping\
      \ invalid SmartScriptHolder\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in AI processing loop
    code: "for (auto& entry : smartScripts) {\n    if (sSmartAIMgr->NotNULL(entry,\
      \ entry.GetScriptType())) {\n        sSmartAIMgr->ProcessScript(entry);\n  \
      \  } else {\n        TC_LOG_ERROR(LOG_FILTER_AI, \"Invalid script detected during\
      \ processing\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is crucial for maintaining AI system stability and should be
    called before any script execution. The validation performed includes checking
    for null pointers, verifying required fields are populated, and ensuring data
    consistency. Performance-wise, this check is lightweight but essential for preventing
    runtime errors in the AI subsystem.
  warnings: Do not bypass this validation when processing SmartScriptHolder elements
    as it may lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Always validate script entries
    before attempting to execute them in the AI system.
