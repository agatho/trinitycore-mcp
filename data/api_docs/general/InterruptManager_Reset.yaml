documentation:
  brief: Resets the interrupt manager's internal state to its default condition.
  description: The Reset method clears all active interrupts and resets the interrupt
    manager to its initial state. This method is typically invoked when a player or
    creature needs to have their interrupt status cleared, such as after completing
    an action or when transitioning between different game states. It ensures that
    no stale interrupt data remains in memory and allows for clean state management
    within the TrinityCore framework. The operation is generally performed during
    cleanup routines or state transitions to maintain consistency in the game's interrupt
    handling system.

  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'InterruptManager* interruptMgr = player->GetInterruptManager();

      interruptMgr->Reset();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it may affect ongoing interrupt
    states. It is recommended to use this only when the interrupt manager is not actively
    processing interrupts to avoid race conditions.
