  brief: Retrieves the number of members who have met a specific tracking criteria
    within the guild.
  description: The GetMembersTrackingCriteria method returns the count of guild members
    who have fulfilled a particular tracking criteria, such as completing a quest
    or achieving a specific achievement. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with guild tracking systems to monitor member progress and engagement. The criteria
    are defined by a unique identifier (criteriaId) which corresponds to predefined
    tracking events in the game. The method does not modify any state and is read-only
    in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of guild members who have met the specified
    tracking criteria. Returns 0 if no members have met the criteria or if the criteriaId
    is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve member count for a specific achievement
    code: "uint32 achievementCriteriaId = 12345;\nint memberCount = guild->GetMembersTrackingCriteria(achievementCriteriaId);\n\
      if (memberCount > 0)\n{\n    // Process the number of members who have completed\
      \ this achievement\n    sLog->outString(\"%u members have completed achievement\
      \ %u\", memberCount, achievementCriteriaId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely queries internal guild tracking data structures and may
    involve database lookups depending on how the tracking system is implemented.
    It's recommended to cache results if this method is called frequently for performance
    reasons.
