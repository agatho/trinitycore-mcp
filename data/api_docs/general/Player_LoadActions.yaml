documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes the player's action buttons and macros from the database
  description: The LoadActions method retrieves and applies saved action button configurations
    and macro definitions for a player character from the database. This method is
    typically invoked during player login or when the player's action bar data needs
    to be refreshed. It processes stored action data including spell actions, item
    actions, and macro text, ensuring that the player's custom action setup is properly
    restored. The method handles loading of both default and custom action slots,
    and manages any potential conflicts or invalid entries in the saved action data.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Player Login
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    // Load player actions after\
      \ login is complete\n    player->LoadActions(0);\n    // Action bar and macros\
      \ are now restored\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically called during the player login sequence by the
    core system. Developers should not typically call this method directly unless
    implementing custom action loading logic or debugging action data issues. The
    method assumes that database connections and player data are properly initialized.
  warnings: Calling LoadActions without proper player initialization may result in
    undefined behavior or data corruption. This method modifies internal player state
    and should only be invoked when the player object is fully constructed and ready
    for action data processing.
