  class: DependencyValidator
  method: GetPhmapVersion
  signature: std::string DependencyValidator::GetPhmapVersion()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the version string of the phmap library used by the TrinityCore
    server.
  description: The GetPhmapVersion method returns a string representation of the version
    number for the phmap (parallel hash map) library that is integrated into the TrinityCore
    project. This library is commonly used for high-performance hash table implementations
    and is essential for various internal data structures within the core. The returned
    version string typically follows semantic versioning conventions (e.g., '1.5.2').
    This method serves as a utility to provide diagnostic information about the server's
    dependencies, which can be useful for debugging, compatibility checks, or ensuring
    that the correct library versions are being used during development or deployment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the version identifier of the phmap library currently
    linked with the TrinityCore build. The format is typically a semantic version
    string such as '1.5.2' or '2021.09.01'. Returns an empty string if the version
    cannot be determined.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Display Library Version
    code: "DependencyValidator validator;\nstd::string version = validator.GetPhmapVersion();\n\
      if (!version.empty()) {\n    std::cout << \"phmap version: \" << version <<\
      \ std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"Unable to determine phmap version.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for logging or diagnostic purposes. It does
    not perform any runtime operations beyond retrieving a pre-defined version string
    from the library's build configuration, so it has no performance impact. The method
    is thread-safe as it only reads static version information.
