  class: Unit
  method: GetExtraUnitMovementFlags2
  signature: uint32 Unit::GetExtraUnitMovementFlags2() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the extra movement flags2 for the unit, which control additional
    movement behaviors and states.
  description: This method retrieves the extra movement flags2 value associated with
    a Unit object, which is used to determine specific movement behaviors and states
    in World of Warcraft. The returned value represents a bitmask that can be used
    to check or set various movement-related flags such as flight paths, swimming,
    or other special movement conditions. This information is crucial for understanding
    how the unit moves and behaves within the game world, particularly when dealing
    with movement mechanics and state management.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the extra movement flags2 bitmask.
    This value can be used to check specific movement states or behaviors, such as
    flight paths, swimming, or other special movement conditions. The exact meaning
    of individual bits within this bitmask depends on the game's internal implementation
    and may vary based on different movement states.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 flags = unit->GetExtraUnitMovementFlags2();\nif (flags & MOVEFLAG_FLIGHT)\
      \ {\n    // Unit is currently flying\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related
    methods to fully understand a unit's movement state. The returned value may be
    modified by various game mechanics and events, such as buffs or debuffs that affect
    movement behavior.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly for movement calculations unless
    you're familiar with the internal structure of movement flags. Incorrect use of
    these flags can lead to unexpected behavior in unit movement.
