documentation:
  brief: Sets the ratio of bots to players in the game world.
  description: The SetBotToPlayerRatio method configures the proportion of AI-controlled
    bots relative to real players within the TrinityCore server environment. This
    setting affects how many non-player characters (bots) are spawned or maintained
    in relation to active player characters. The ratio is typically expressed as a
    floating-point value where 1.0 represents one bot for every player, 0.5 represents
    half as many bots as players, and so forth. This method is commonly used in bot
    management systems to control server load, testing environments, or gameplay balance
    adjustments.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Bot-to-Player Ratio to 1:1
    code: BotPopulationManager::SetBotToPlayerRatio(1.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Configure Low Bot Population
    code: BotPopulationManager::SetBotToPlayerRatio(0.25f);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal recalculations of bot population based
    on current player count. It may be subject to server configuration limits or require
    specific permissions to modify during runtime.
  warnings: Modifying this ratio while players are actively connected might cause
    immediate changes in bot behavior or spawning patterns, potentially affecting
    gameplay balance or performance.
