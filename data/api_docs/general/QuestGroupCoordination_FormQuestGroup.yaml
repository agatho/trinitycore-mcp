  class: QuestGroupCoordination
  method: FormQuestGroup
  signature: bool QuestGroupCoordination::FormQuestGroup(Player * initiator, uint32
    questId, uint32 maxMembers)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to form a new quest group with the specified initiator player, quest
    ID, and maximum member count.
  description: The FormQuestGroup method is responsible for creating a new quest coordination
    group within the TrinityCore framework. It takes an initiating player, a quest
    identifier, and a maximum number of members as parameters. This method ensures
    that the player can form a group for cooperative questing, managing group creation
    logic including validation of the quest's group requirements, checking if the
    player is eligible to start a new group, and setting up internal tracking structures
    for group coordination. The method returns true upon successful group formation
    or false if the operation fails due to invalid parameters, quest restrictions,
    or existing group limitations.
  parameters:
  - name: initiator
    description: Pointer to the Player object who initiates the quest group formation.
      This player must be in a valid state to create a group and must have permission
      to start the specified quest.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier for the quest that the group will be formed around.
      The quest must support group participation and be valid within the game's quest
      system.
  - name: maxMembers
    description: Maximum number of players allowed in the quest group. Must be a positive
      integer, typically between 1 and 5 depending on the quest type and server configuration.
  returns: Returns true if the quest group was successfully formed with all specified
    parameters and conditions met; otherwise returns false if the formation failed
    due to invalid input, quest restrictions, or other game logic constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Group Formation
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player object\nuint32 questId = 12345;\n\
      uint32 maxMembers = 5;\nbool success = sQuestGroupCoordination->FormQuestGroup(player,\
      \ questId, maxMembers);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Group successfully created\n\
      \    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_QUEST_GROUP_FORMED);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Failed\
      \ to form group\n    player->GetSession()->SendNotification(LANG_QUEST_GROUP_FAILED);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal quest group tracking and coordination systems.
    It may perform checks against existing groups, player state, and quest eligibility
    before forming a new group. The maximum member count is enforced by the game's
    quest system and should align with standard WoW group sizes.
  warnings: Do not call this method without ensuring that the player object is valid
    and in a proper session state. Incorrect usage of questId or maxMembers can lead
    to failed group creation or unexpected behavior in quest coordination.
