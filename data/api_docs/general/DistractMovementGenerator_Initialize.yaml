  class: DistractMovementGenerator
  method: Initialize
  signature: void DistractMovementGenerator::Initialize(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the distract movement generator with specified parameters.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the DistractMovementGenerator with provided
    parameters, configuring how the AI-controlled unit will behave during a distraction
    state. This typically involves setting up movement patterns or behaviors that
    simulate being distracted by an external stimulus. The method prepares internal
    state variables and ensures the generator is ready to execute its intended movement
    behavior within the game's AI system.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer parameter that controls the distraction behavior.
      Valid values typically include configuration flags or duration settings that
      determine how long the unit remains distracted and what type of movement pattern
      is used.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'DistractMovementGenerator distractGen;

      int distractionDuration = 5000; // 5 seconds

      int* param = &distractionDuration;

      distractGen.Initialize(param);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system when a creature
    enters a distracted state. It's important to ensure that the parameter passed
    points to valid memory and contains appropriate values for the desired distraction
    behavior.
  warnings: Passing an invalid pointer or incorrect parameter value may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes within the AI subsystem. Always validate parameters before
    calling this method.
