  signature: int PvPCombatAI::GetHunterDefensiveCooldowns(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the defensive cooldowns available to a hunter in PvP combat.
  description: The GetHunterDefensiveCooldowns method returns an integer value representing
    the defensive cooldowns currently active or available for a hunter class player
    within PvP combat scenarios. This method is typically used by the AI system to
    determine which defensive abilities can be utilized by a hunter during combat.
    The returned value likely corresponds to specific cooldown states or bit flags
    indicating different defensive abilities such as Feign Death, Misdirection, or
    other PvP-specific defensive mechanics. The method takes a pointer to a player
    object as input and returns an integer that encodes the state of these defensive
    cooldowns.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object for which defensive cooldowns are being
      retrieved. This parameter must point to a valid Player instance representing
      a hunter class character engaged in PvP combat.
  returns: An integer value encoding the current state of defensive cooldowns available
    to the hunter. The specific bit flags or numerical values represent different
    defensive abilities that can be used, such as Feign Death, Misdirection, or other
    PvP defensive mechanics. Returns 0 if no defensive cooldowns are active or available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "Player* hunter = ...; // Get hunter player instance\nint cooldowns = ai->GetHunterDefensiveCooldowns(hunter);\n\
      if (cooldowns & 1) // Check if Feign Death is available\n{\n    // Use Feign\
      \ Death ability\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking multiple defensive abilities
    code: "Player* hunter = ...;\nint cooldowns = ai->GetHunterDefensiveCooldowns(hunter);\n\
      \n// Check for specific defensive abilities\nbool feignDeathAvailable = (cooldowns\
      \ & 0x01) != 0;\nbool misdirectionAvailable = (cooldowns & 0x02) != 0;\nbool\
      \ evadeAvailable = (cooldowns & 0x04) != 0;\n\nif (feignDeathAvailable && !IsInCombat())\n\
      {\n    // Use Feign Death to escape combat\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PvPCombatAI system and is specifically designed
    for hunter class players in PvP environments. The exact bit flag mapping for defensive
    cooldowns should be determined through reverse engineering or official documentation.
    The method assumes that the player parameter points to a valid hunter class character
    with active PvP combat state.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed to this method is valid and represents
    a hunter class character in PvP combat, otherwise behavior is undefined. The return
    value encoding should be verified against current game mechanics as cooldown flags
    may change between different versions of TrinityCore or World of Warcraft.
