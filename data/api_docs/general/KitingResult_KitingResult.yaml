documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new KitingResult object with default values.
  description: The KitingResult constructor initializes a new instance of the KitingResult
    class. This method sets up the internal state of the kiting result object, preparing
    it for use in combat or movement-related calculations within the TrinityCore framework.
    The constructor typically initializes member variables to their default states,
    ensuring that subsequent operations on the object behave predictably. In the context
    of World of Warcraft gameplay, kiting results are often used to determine successful
    evasion or pursuit mechanics during player versus creature encounters.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new KitingResult instance
    code: 'KitingResult result;

      // The result object is now initialized with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called automatically when declaring a KitingResult
    variable. Developers should be aware that the object's internal state may need
    to be explicitly set after construction depending on the intended use case.
