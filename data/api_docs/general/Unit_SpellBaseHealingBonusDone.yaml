    mask. It considers various factors like spell power, buffs effects, and class-specific
    bonuses to determine the total base healing bonus. The method is typically used
    in healing calculations to determine how much additional healing is provided by
    the unit's base attributes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the base healing bonus done for the
    specified school mask. A negative value may indicate a reduction in healing, while
    positive values indicate increased healing.

    and is used in conjunction with other methods like SpellHealingBonusDone and SpellHealingBonusDone.
    It should be called during spell calculations to properly determine the base healing
    contribution.
  warnings: This method may return zero or negative values depending on the unit's
    state and class-specific bonuses, so care must be taken when interpreting results.
    Also, this method does not account for any temporary buffs or effects that might
    modify the value.
