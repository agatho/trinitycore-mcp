  class: PositionManager
  method: FindOptimalPosition
  signature: MovementResult PositionManager::FindOptimalPosition(const MovementContext
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal movement position for a unit based on
    the provided movement context.
  description: The FindOptimalPosition method determines the best possible position
    for a unit to move to, considering various factors such as terrain, obstacles,
    and movement constraints defined in the MovementContext. This method is typically
    used during pathfinding and movement execution to ensure units navigate the game
    world efficiently and realistically. The method evaluates the context provided
    by the MovementContext parameter and returns a MovementResult containing either
    the calculated optimal position or an error code indicating why the calculation
    failed. It's commonly invoked when a unit needs to move toward a target location
    while avoiding collisions and adhering to game physics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a MovementResult object that contains either the calculated optimal
    position coordinates or an error code indicating failure conditions such as invalid
    input, unreachable positions, or internal calculation errors. The result can be
    used to update the unit's position or determine alternative movement strategies.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of FindOptimalPosition
    code: "MovementContext context;\ncontext.targetPosition = Position(100.0f, 200.0f,\
      \ 300.0f);\ncontext.movementType = MovementType::GROUND;\nMovementResult result\
      \ = positionManager.FindOptimalPosition(context);\nif (result.success)\n{\n\
      \    // Use result.position for movement\n    unit->UpdatePosition(result.position);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform complex calculations involving pathfinding algorithms
    and collision detection. It's recommended to call this method only when necessary
    to avoid performance bottlenecks. The method assumes that the MovementContext
    has been properly initialized with valid parameters before invocation.
  warnings: Calling this method without properly setting up the MovementContext can
    lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. Ensure all required fields in
    the context are populated before invoking this method, especially target position
    and movement type.
