  signature: void Item::AddArtifactPower(const ArtifactPowerData * artifactPower)
documentation:
  brief: Adds artifact power to the item's artifact properties.
  description: The AddArtifactPower method is used to incrementally add artifact power
    to an Item object that represents an artifact. This method modifies the internal
    artifact power state of the item, typically used during artifact progression or
    when gaining power through gameplay mechanics such as completing artifact quests
    or using artifact abilities. The method takes a pointer to an ArtifactPowerData
    structure which contains information about the specific artifact power being added.
    This functionality is integral to the artifact system in World of Warcraft, particularly
    within the TrinityCore emulation framework where items can have dynamic artifact
    properties that evolve over time.
  parameters:
  - name: artifactPower
    description: A pointer to an ArtifactPowerData structure containing information
      about the artifact power to be added. This structure typically includes data
      such as the power ID, current rank, and associated requirements for the artifact
      power being applied.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding artifact power to an item
    code: "ArtifactPowerData powerData;\n// Initialize powerData with appropriate\
      \ values\npowerData.powerId = 12345;\npowerData.rank = 1;\n\nItem* item = player->GetItemByEntry(ITEM_ID_ARTIFACT);\n\
      if (item && item->IsArtifact()) {\n    item->AddArtifactPower(&powerData);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the artifact system implementation in TrinityCore
    and requires that the Item object be an actual artifact. The method does not validate
    whether the artifact power being added is valid or within bounds; such validation
    should typically occur before calling this method. Performance-wise, this operation
    is generally lightweight as it only updates internal state variables.
  warnings: Ensure that the ArtifactPowerData pointer passed to this method is valid
    and properly initialized. Passing a null pointer will likely cause undefined behavior
    or crashes. Additionally, calling this method on non-artifact items may result
    in unexpected behavior or data corruption.
