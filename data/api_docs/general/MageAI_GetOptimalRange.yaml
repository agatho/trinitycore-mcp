  class: MageAI
  method: GetOptimalRange
  signature: float MageAI::GetOptimalRange(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal spell casting range for the MageAI unit
    targeting a specified unit.
  description: The GetOptimalRange method determines the ideal distance at which a
    mage AI should cast its spells against a target unit. This calculation considers
    factors such as the mage's spell range limitations, the target's movement capabilities,
    and the AI's tactical behavior. The returned float value represents the distance
    in yards. This method is crucial for proper spell targeting and ensures that mages
    maintain appropriate distances during combat to maximize effectiveness while avoiding
    unnecessary movement or spell failures.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the optimal casting range in yards. This value
    indicates the distance at which the mage should position itself for effective
    spell casting against the target unit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float optimalRange = mageAI->GetOptimalRange(targetUnit);\nif (optimalRange\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Use the calculated range to determine if movement is needed\n\
      \    if (mageUnit->GetDistance(targetUnit) > optimalRange)\n        mageUnit->MoveTowards(targetUnit,\
      \ optimalRange);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely incorporates AI decision-making logic that evaluates spell
    types, target mobility, and environmental factors. It may be called frequently
    during combat to adjust positioning dynamically.
