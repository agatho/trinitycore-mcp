  brief: Initializes a new InterruptResult object with default values
  description: The InterruptResult constructor initializes a new instance of the InterruptResult
    class. This method sets up the internal state of the interrupt result object,
    typically preparing it for use in handling spell interruption scenarios within
    the TrinityCore framework. The constructor ensures that all member variables are
    properly initialized to their default states, which is essential for maintaining
    data integrity when processing spell interrupts or other game events that may
    require interrupt handling. This initialization occurs automatically when a new
    InterruptResult object is created and is part of the standard object lifecycle
    in the WoW server architecture.

  - title: Creating an InterruptResult instance
    code: 'InterruptResult result;

      // The result object is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called implicitly when creating a new InterruptResult
    object. Developers should be aware that the object's internal state is initialized
    to default values, which may include zero-initialization of numeric fields or
    null-initialization of pointers. The constructor does not perform any complex
    initialization logic and is meant to provide basic object setup.
  warnings: Since this is a constructor, it should not be called explicitly unless
    creating a new object instance. Calling this method directly on an already-constructed
    object may lead to undefined behavior if the object's memory has already been
    initialized or if there are existing resources that need proper cleanup before
    re-initialization.
