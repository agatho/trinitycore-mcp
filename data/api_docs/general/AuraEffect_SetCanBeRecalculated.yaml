  class: AuraEffect
  method: SetCanBeRecalculated
  signature: void AuraEffect::SetCanBeRecalculated(bool val)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the aura effect can be recalculated during combat.
  description: The SetCanBeRecalculated method controls whether an AuraEffect instance
    is allowed to be recalculated by the game engine during active combat situations.
    This flag determines if the aura's properties, such as stat modifications or damage
    values, can be dynamically adjusted based on changing conditions or triggers.
    When set to true, the aura effect may be recalculated; when false, it remains
    static. This functionality is crucial for managing dynamic auras that should adapt
    to player actions or environmental changes during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: val
    description: Boolean value indicating whether the aura effect can be recalculated.
      True allows recalculation, false prevents it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Recalculation for a Custom Aura Effect
    code: 'AuraEffect* aura = ...; // Get reference to an aura effect

      aura->SetCanBeRecalculated(true); // Allow the aura to be recalculated during
      combat'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Recalculation for a Passive Buff
    code: 'AuraEffect* passiveBuff = ...; // Get reference to a passive buff aura

      passiveBuff->SetCanBeRecalculated(false); // Prevent the buff from being recalculated,
      keeping it static'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects how aura effects behave during combat. Setting
    this flag incorrectly can lead to unexpected behavior in dynamic auras. The recalculation
    process may involve performance overhead, especially for frequently triggered
    auras.
  warnings: Modifying this flag after an aura has already been applied to a unit can
    cause inconsistent behavior. Always ensure that this flag is set before the aura
    is activated or applied to maintain predictable gameplay mechanics.
