  class: IcicleTracker
  method: IsMaxIcicles
  signature: bool IcicleTracker::IsMaxIcicles() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the current icicle count has reached the maximum allowed limit.
  description: The IsMaxIcicles method determines if the number of icicles currently
    active or tracked by the IcicleTracker instance has reached its defined maximum
    capacity. This method is typically used in game mechanics involving resource management,
    stacking effects, or cooldown systems where a maximum threshold must be enforced.
    The check is performed against an internal counter that tracks the current icicle
    state and compares it to the maximum allowable value. This method does not modify
    any state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current icicle count equals or exceeds the maximum
    allowed icicles, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Logic
    code: "if (icicleTracker.IsMaxIcicles()) {\n    // Handle maximum icicles reached\n\
      \    player->SendNotification(\"Maximum icicles reached!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Icicle Spawning
    code: "if (!icicleTracker.IsMaxIcicles()) {\n    // Spawn a new icicle\n    icicleTracker.AddIcicle();\n\
      } else {\n    // Prevent spawning more icicles\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Cannot spawn more icicles at this time.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple comparison operation and has minimal performance
    impact. It is thread-safe as long as the underlying icicle counter is properly
    synchronized in multi-threaded contexts.
  warnings: Ensure that the IcicleTracker instance is properly initialized before
    calling this method, otherwise unexpected behavior may occur if internal state
    variables are not set correctly.
