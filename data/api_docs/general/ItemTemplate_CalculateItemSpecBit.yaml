documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a unique bit identifier for an item based on the player's
    specialization.
  description: The CalculateItemSpecBit method computes a unique bit position that
    represents the relationship between an item template and a specific character
    specialization. This bit identifier is typically used in item filtering, requirement
    checking, or specialization-specific item handling within the TrinityCore framework.
    The method takes into account the item's properties and the provided specialization
    entry to determine which bit in a bitmask corresponds to that specialization for
    this particular item. It ensures that each item-specialization combination maps
    to a unique bit position, enabling efficient bitwise operations when evaluating
    item compatibility with character specializations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::size_t value representing the calculated bit position within a specialization
    bitmask. This value can be used directly in bitwise operations to check if an
    item is compatible with or restricted by a specific specialization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const ChrSpecializationEntry* spec = sChrSpecializationStore.LookupEntry(257);\
      \ // Arms Warrior\nstd::size_t bit = itemTemplate->CalculateItemSpecBit(spec);\n\
      if (bit != 0) {\n    // Item has a specialization-specific bit set\n    printf(\"\
      Item has specialization bit: %zu\\n\", bit);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the TrinityCore item system for
    managing specialization-based item restrictions and requirements. The returned
    bit position should be treated as an index into a bitmask, where each bit corresponds
    to a unique specialization. Performance is generally efficient as it involves
    simple lookups and calculations without heavy computation.
  warnings: Ensure that the ChrSpecializationEntry pointer passed to this method is
    valid and not null; otherwise, behavior may be undefined or cause crashes. This
    method assumes that item templates and specialization entries are properly initialized
    before use.
