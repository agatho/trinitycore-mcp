  method: CheckDiskRequirements
  signature: bool DependencyValidator::CheckDiskRequirements()
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the system meets the minimum disk space requirements for TrinityCore
    operation.
  description: The CheckDiskRequirements method validates that the system has sufficient
    available disk space to support TrinityCore's operational needs. This includes
    verifying that the database directory, log files, and other required storage locations
    have adequate free space. The method typically performs checks against predefined
    thresholds and returns true if all requirements are met, or false if any disk
    requirement is not satisfied. This validation is crucial for preventing runtime
    errors due to insufficient storage during server operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all disk space requirements are satisfied, false otherwise.
    A return value of false indicates that one or more directories do not meet the
    minimum required disk space thresholds.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in server startup
    code: "if (!sDependencyValidator->CheckDiskRequirements())\n{\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Insufficient disk space for TrinityCore operation.\");\n    return false;\n\
      }\nsLog->outString(\"All disk requirements satisfied.\");"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform file system operations that could impact performance
    on systems with slow storage. It's recommended to call this validation early in
    the server initialization process before other resource-intensive operations begin.
  warnings: The method does not automatically resolve insufficient disk space conditions;
    it only reports the status. Administrators must manually ensure sufficient disk
    space is available before proceeding with server startup if this check fails.
