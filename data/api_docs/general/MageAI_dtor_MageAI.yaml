documentation:
  brief: Destroys a MageAI instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The MageAI destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up all resources
    allocated to the MageAI object. This includes releasing any dynamically allocated
    memory, resetting internal state variables, and ensuring that no dangling pointers
    or memory leaks occur when the AI instance is destroyed. In the context of TrinityCore's
    AI system, this destructor ensures that the mage's AI behavior is cleanly terminated
    without affecting other game entities or systems. The destruction process typically
    involves calling parent class destructors and cleaning up any AI-specific data
    structures or references.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Destruction of MageAI Instance
    code: 'MageAI* mageAI = new MageAI(creature);

      // ... use the mage AI ...

      delete mageAI; // Triggers ~MageAI() destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically called when a MageAI object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted. It's important to ensure that all references to the
    MageAI instance are properly managed to prevent use-after-free errors. The destructor
    should not be called directly unless you're certain about the object's lifecycle.
  warnings: Never manually call the destructor; instead, let the C++ runtime handle
    destruction through proper object lifetime management or explicit deletion. Improper
    handling of AI object lifetimes can lead to memory leaks or crashes in the TrinityCore
    server.
