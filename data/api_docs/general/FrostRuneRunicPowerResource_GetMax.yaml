  class: FrostRuneRunicPowerResource
  method: GetMax
  signature: uint32 FrostRuneRunicPowerResource::GetMax() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum runic power value for a frost rune resource.
  description: The GetMax method retrieves the upper limit of runic power that can
    be accumulated for frost runes. This value represents the total capacity of the
    frost rune resource, typically corresponding to the maximum amount of runic power
    that can be stored before reaching the cap. The method is commonly used in conjunction
    with other runic power management functions to determine resource limits and calculate
    current resource percentages. This value remains constant during a player's session
    unless modified by game mechanics such as talent changes or equipment upgrades.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum runic power capacity for frost
    runes. This value typically corresponds to the total amount of runic power that
    can be accumulated before reaching the resource limit, often set to a fixed value
    like 100 or 1000 depending on game implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'FrostRuneRunicPowerResource resource;

      uint32 maxPower = resource.GetMax();

      printf("Maximum frost rune power: %u\n", maxPower);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Management Check
    code: 'FrostRuneRunicPowerResource* frostResource = player->GetFrostRuneResource();

      uint32 current = frostResource->GetCurrent();

      uint32 max = frostResource->GetMax();

      float percentage = (float)current / (float)max * 100.0f;

      printf("Frost rune power: %.1f%%\n", percentage);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during gameplay for resource management
    and UI updates. The returned value should be cached when possible to avoid repeated
    calls in performance-critical sections of code. The maximum value may vary based
    on player level, talents, or gear modifications.
  warnings: Do not modify the return value as it represents a constant resource limit.
    Calling this method on a null resource pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure proper initialization of the FrostRuneRunicPowerResource object before
    calling this method.
