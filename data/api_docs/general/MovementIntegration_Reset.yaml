documentation:
  brief: Resets the movement integration state to its default values.
  description: The Reset method initializes or reinitializes the internal state of
    the MovementIntegration class, clearing any existing movement data and preparing
    it for a new movement sequence. This method is typically invoked when a creature
    or player's movement needs to be restarted or cleared, such as after completing
    a path or when transitioning between different movement states. It ensures that
    all movement-related flags, waypoints, and internal counters are reset to their
    initial conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'MovementIntegration integration;

      integration.Reset();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initiating a new movement sequence to
    ensure clean state. It does not affect the object's position or orientation directly,
    but rather resets its internal movement tracking mechanisms.
