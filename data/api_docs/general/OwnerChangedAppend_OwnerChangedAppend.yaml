  method: OwnerChangedAppend
  signature: void OwnerChangedAppend::OwnerChangedAppend(const int & guid)
documentation:
  brief: Appends a new owner GUID to the owner changed list for tracking object ownership
    changes in the game world.
  description: The OwnerChangedAppend method is used to add a new globally unique
    identifier (GUID) to a list that tracks when an object's ownership has been modified.
    This functionality is typically utilized within TrinityCore's core systems to
    maintain synchronization of object ownership across the game world, particularly
    for items, creatures, or game objects that may change hands during gameplay. The
    method does not perform any validation on the input GUID and simply appends it
    to an internal collection. It is generally called as part of a larger ownership
    change mechanism and should be used in conjunction with other related methods
    such as OwnerChangedClear or OwnerChangedGet to manage the complete lifecycle
    of ownership tracking.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The globally unique identifier (GUID) of the new owner to append
      to the ownership change list. This value should represent a valid object GUID
      from the game world, such as a player or creature GUID.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Appending a Player's GUID to Ownership List
    code: 'OwnerChangedAppend playerGUID;

      playerGUID.OwnerChangedAppend(player->GetGUID());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Item Ownership Change in a Trade Scenario
    code: "void HandleItemTrade(Player* oldOwner, Player* newOwner, Item* item)\n\
      {\n    // Clear previous ownership changes\n    OwnerChangedClear();\n    \n\
      \    // Append the new owner's GUID\n    OwnerChangedAppend newOwnerGUID;\n\
      \    newOwnerGUID.OwnerChangedAppend(newOwner->GetGUID());\n    \n    // Proceed\
      \ with trade logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger ownership tracking system and should be used
    carefully in performance-sensitive contexts. It is recommended to batch multiple
    GUID appends together rather than calling this method individually for each change.
    The internal list may grow significantly during extended gameplay sessions, so
    consider clearing or resetting the list periodically if memory usage becomes a
    concern.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without proper initialization or management
    of the ownership tracking system can lead to incorrect behavior in object ownership
    state. Avoid calling this method with invalid or null GUIDs as it may cause undefined
    behavior in the underlying data structures.
