  method: ShouldSpawnNext
  signature: bool StartupSpawnOrchestrator::ShouldSpawnNext() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the next object in the startup spawn sequence should be
    spawned.
  description: The ShouldSpawnNext method evaluates the current state of the startup
    spawn orchestrator to decide if the next entity in the sequence should be spawned.
    This method is typically used during server initialization or zone loading to
    control the timing and order of object spawning. It checks internal counters,
    conditions, or flags that determine spawn readiness. The method does not modify
    any state but returns a boolean value indicating whether spawning should proceed
    to the next item in the sequence.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the next object in the startup spawn sequence should be
    spawned; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spawn logic
    code: "if (orchestrator.ShouldSpawnNext()) {\n    // Proceed with spawning next\
      \ object\n    SpawnNextObject();\n} else {\n    // Wait or skip to next frame\n\
      \    return;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often used in conjunction with other spawn-related methods
    like StartSpawning(), Reset(), and GetSpawnCount(). It's designed to be called
    frequently during initialization phases where controlled object spawning is required.
    The implementation may rely on internal timers, counters, or game state flags.
