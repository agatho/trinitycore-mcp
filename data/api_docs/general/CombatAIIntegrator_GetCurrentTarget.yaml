  class: CombatAIIntegrator
  method: GetCurrentTarget
  signature: int * CombatAIIntegrator::GetCurrentTarget() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the current target identifier of the combat AI integrator.
  description: The GetCurrentTarget method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID)
    of the current target that the CombatAIIntegrator is engaged with. This identifier
    typically represents a unit such as a player or creature in the game world. The
    returned pointer may be null if no target is currently selected, which can happen
    when the AI is idle or has finished its combat routine. The method provides access
    to the target's identity without exposing the full target object, allowing for
    efficient reference checking and interaction with the target through other API
    methods. This functionality is essential for maintaining proper targeting logic
    in AI-driven combat systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the current target. Returns
    nullptr if no target is currently selected or if the AI is not actively engaged
    in combat.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check current target
    code: "int* targetGuid = integrator->GetCurrentTarget();\nif (targetGuid != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Target exists, proceed with combat logic\n    printf(\"Current target\
      \ GUID: %d\\n\", *targetGuid);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No active target\n    printf(\"\
      No current target\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using target GUID to verify combat state
    code: "CombatAIIntegrator* ai = GetCombatAIIntegrator();\nint* currentTarget =\
      \ ai->GetCurrentTarget();\nif (currentTarget != nullptr && *currentTarget >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Valid target exists, check if it's still in combat range\n \
      \   Unit* targetUnit = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*currentTarget);\n    if (targetUnit\
      \ && targetUnit->IsInWorld())\n    {\n        // Target is valid and accessible\n\
      \        DoCombatAction(targetUnit);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned pointer points to an internal value managed by the CombatAIIntegrator.
    It should not be modified directly, as doing so may corrupt the AI's target tracking
    state. The value pointed to is only valid during the lifetime of the current combat
    cycle and may change after each AI update tick. This method is typically called
    within combat update loops where targeting decisions are made.
  warnings: Do not store the returned pointer beyond the scope of a single AI update
    cycle, as it may become invalid. The pointer should never be dereferenced without
    checking for null first. Modifying the value pointed to by this method can cause
    undefined behavior and disrupt AI targeting logic.
