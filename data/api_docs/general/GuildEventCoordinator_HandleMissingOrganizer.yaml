  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::HandleMissingOrganizer(uint32 eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the case where a guild event organizer is missing by attempting to
    find and assign a new organizer.
  description: The HandleMissingOrganizer method in the GuildEventCoordinator class
    is responsible for managing scenarios where a guild event's designated organizer
    has become unavailable or invalid. This typically occurs when the original organizer
    leaves the guild, becomes offline, or otherwise cannot fulfill their role. The
    method searches for a suitable replacement organizer from among active guild members
    who meet the necessary criteria (such as having appropriate permissions or being
    online). If a valid replacement is found, it assigns that member as the new organizer
    for the specified event. This ensures continuity of guild event management and
    prevents events from being left in an unmanageable state due to missing leadership.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild event for which the organizer
      is missing. This ID must correspond to a valid event currently managed by the
      GuildEventCoordinator.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.HandleMissingOrganizer(12345); // Handles missing organizer for
      event with ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Event Management System
    code: "void OnGuildMemberLeave(Player* player) {\n    // Find any events where\
      \ this player was the organizer\n    for (auto& event : guildEvents) {\n   \
      \     if (event.organizerGuid == player->GetGUID()) {\n            coordinator.HandleMissingOrganizer(event.id);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GuildEventCoordinator has access to a list of
    active guild members and their current status. It may involve database lookups
    or cache queries to determine eligibility for organizer roles. The implementation
    should be thread-safe if called from concurrent contexts, especially when dealing
    with event state changes.
  warnings: The method does not validate whether the eventId is valid before processing;
    callers should ensure that the eventId corresponds to an existing event managed
    by this coordinator. Additionally, if no suitable replacement organizer can be
    found, the event may remain without proper leadership, potentially causing issues
    in event execution or tracking.
