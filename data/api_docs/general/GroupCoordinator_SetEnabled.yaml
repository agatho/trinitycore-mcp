  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: SetEnabled
  signature: void GroupCoordinator::SetEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the group coordinator functionality.
  description: The SetEnabled method controls whether the GroupCoordinator is active
    and processing group-related operations. When enabled, the coordinator handles
    group invitations, member management, and synchronization tasks. When disabled,
    it suspends all group coordination activities while maintaining internal state.
    This method is typically used to temporarily pause group functionality during
    server maintenance or when transitioning between different game states.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      the group coordinator
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Group Coordinator
    code: 'GroupCoordinator* coordinator = sGroupCoordinator->GetGroupCoordinator();

      coordinator->SetEnabled(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Group Coordinator During Maintenance
    code: 'GroupCoordinator* coordinator = sGroupCoordinator->GetGroupCoordinator();

      coordinator->SetEnabled(false);

      // Perform maintenance tasks

      coordinator->SetEnabled(true); // Re-enable after maintenance'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method does not validate the current state of the group coordinator before
    changing its enabled status. It's recommended to check the current state using
    a corresponding GetEnabled() method if available, and ensure that disabling the
    coordinator doesn't leave groups in an inconsistent state.
  warnings: Disabling the group coordinator while players are actively participating
    in groups may cause synchronization issues or unexpected behavior. Always ensure
    proper cleanup or notification of affected players before disabling the coordinator.
