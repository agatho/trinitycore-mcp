  signature: bool BattlePetManager::ShouldSwitchPet(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player's current battle pet should be switched based
    on combat conditions.
  description: The ShouldSwitchPet method evaluates the current state of the player's
    battle pet and determines if it is advisable to switch to a different pet. This
    decision is typically made during active combat scenarios where pet performance,
    health, or abilities may affect the outcome. The method considers factors such
    as pet health status, available pet abilities, and environmental conditions relevant
    to the battle. It returns true if switching is recommended, false otherwise. This
    method does not perform the actual switch but rather provides a decision point
    for the calling code to determine appropriate action.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current battle pet should be switched based on combat
    logic and conditions; false if no switch is recommended or if the pet is already
    optimal for the current situation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat decision making
    code: "if (battlePetManager->ShouldSwitchPet(nullptr)) {\n    // Initiate pet\
      \ switching logic\n    player->SwitchBattlePet();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during active battle states and may depend
    on internal pet state tracking. It's recommended to call this method before making
    any pet switch decisions to ensure optimal combat performance.
  warnings: Do not assume that a return value of true will always result in a successful
    pet switch; additional logic should be implemented to handle the actual switching
    process. The method may return false even if the current pet is underperforming,
    depending on game rules and conditions.
