  class: Trigger
  method: SetActive
  signature: void Trigger::SetActive(bool active)
documentation:
  brief: Activates or deactivates the trigger object.
  description: The SetActive method is used to enable or disable a trigger within
    the TrinityCore framework. This method controls whether the trigger will respond
    to player interactions or events. When activated, the trigger becomes functional
    and can execute its associated scripts or actions. When deactivated, the trigger
    ignores all incoming events until reactivated. The state change is typically managed
    through game logic or quest systems where triggers need to be dynamically enabled
    or disabled based on player progress or conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: active
    description: Boolean value indicating the desired state of the trigger. If true,
      the trigger will be activated and become functional. If false, the trigger will
      be deactivated and will ignore all events.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trigger Activation
    code: "Trigger* trigger = sObjectMgr->GetTrigger(12345);\nif (trigger)\n{\n  \
      \  trigger->SetActive(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Trigger Deactivation
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player reference\nTrigger* trigger = sObjectMgr->GetTrigger(67890);\n\
      if (trigger && player->HasQuest(54321))\n{\n    trigger->SetActive(false);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state flag of the Trigger object.
    The change takes effect immediately without requiring any additional processing
    or delay. Triggers are commonly used in quest systems, instance events, and scripted
    areas where dynamic activation is required.
