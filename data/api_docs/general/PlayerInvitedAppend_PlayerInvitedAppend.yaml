  class: PlayerInvitedAppend
  method: PlayerInvitedAppend
  signature: void PlayerInvitedAppend::PlayerInvitedAppend(const std::string & playerName)
documentation:
  brief: Appends a player name to the list of invited players for a group or instance.
  description: The PlayerInvitedAppend method adds a specified player name to an internal
    collection of invited players, typically used in group creation or instance invitation
    systems within TrinityCore. This method is commonly invoked when a player is invited
    to join a dungeon, raid, or party. The appended player name is usually stored
    in a container such as a std::set or std::vector for tracking purposes. It does
    not directly send invitations or modify player state; rather, it maintains the
    list of players who have been invited to participate in a specific group activity.
  parameters:
  - name: playerName
    description: The name of the player to be added to the invited list. Must be a
      valid, non-empty string representing an existing character in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PlayerInvitedAppend append;

      append.PlayerInvitedAppend("Aelarion");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Invitations Example
    code: 'PlayerInvitedAppend append;

      append.PlayerInvitedAppend("Thrain");

      append.PlayerInvitedAppend("Borin");

      append.PlayerInvitedAppend("Dwalin");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal group management system and should be
    used in conjunction with other invitation-related functions to fully implement
    group creation or instance joining logic. The actual invitation process (e.g.,
    sending messages or updating UI) is typically handled separately by other systems.
  warnings: Ensure that the playerName parameter is validated before calling this
    method to avoid invalid entries. This method does not perform any checks for whether
    the player exists in the game world, so calling it with a non-existent name may
    lead to inconsistencies in group management logic.
