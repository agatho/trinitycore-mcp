  class: AreaTrigger
  method: GetTimeSinceCreated
  signature: uint32 AreaTrigger::GetTimeSinceCreated() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the time elapsed since the area trigger was created
    in milliseconds.
  description: The GetTimeSinceCreated method computes the duration, in milliseconds,
    that has passed since this AreaTrigger object was instantiated. This value is
    typically used to determine how long an area trigger has been active or to manage
    its lifecycle, such as when it should expire or be removed from the game world.
    The method relies on internal timing mechanisms and assumes the object's creation
    timestamp is properly initialized. It does not require any parameters and returns
    a 32-bit unsigned integer representing the time elapsed since creation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value indicating the number of milliseconds that have passed since
    the area trigger was created. This value will be zero if called immediately after
    construction, and increases steadily over time until the trigger is destroyed
    or removed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Trigger Age
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = ...; // Assume this is a valid AreaTrigger pointer\n\
      uint32 ageInMs = trigger->GetTimeSinceCreated();\nif (ageInMs > 10000) {\n \
      \   // Trigger has been active for more than 10 seconds\n    trigger->Remove();\
      \ // Remove the trigger\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Time Since Creation for Conditional Logic
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;\nuint32 elapsed = trigger->GetTimeSinceCreated();\n\
      if (elapsed < 5000) {\n    // Do something only during the first 5 seconds\n\
      \    trigger->SetFlag(AREATRIGGER_FLAGS_INACTIVE);\n} else if (elapsed >= 15000)\
      \ {\n    // Trigger has been active for more than 15 seconds\n    trigger->Remove();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method depends on the internal timing system of TrinityCore, which uses
    high-resolution timers. The returned value is monotonic and increases steadily
    unless the object is destroyed or reset. It's important to note that this function
    may not reflect real-world time accurately if the server experiences significant
    lag or clock adjustments.
  warnings: Do not rely on this method for precise timing in critical gameplay mechanics
    without considering potential server-side timing inconsistencies. Also, ensure
    that the AreaTrigger object is valid and has been properly initialized before
    calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
