documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the counter portion of the ObjectGuid
  description: The GetCounter method extracts and returns the counter value component
    from an ObjectGuid. In TrinityCore's object identification system, ObjectGuids
    are composed of multiple parts including a type identifier, a counter, and a low
    GUID. The counter is used to distinguish between different instances of objects
    of the same type within the same world. This method specifically isolates and
    returns only the counter portion of the full GUID structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the LowType value representing the counter component of the ObjectGuid.
    This value is typically used internally by the server to differentiate between
    multiple objects of the same type (e.g., multiple creatures with the same entry
    ID).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Unit>(12345);

      uint32 counter = guid.GetCounter();

      printf("Counter value: %u\n", counter);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The counter portion of an ObjectGuid is part of a larger 64-bit identifier
    structure. This method only returns the lower portion of that structure, which
    is sufficient for most game logic operations involving object identification and
    tracking.
