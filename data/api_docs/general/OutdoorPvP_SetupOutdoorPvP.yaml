  brief: Initializes and configures the OutdoorPvP system for the current map
  description: The SetupOutdoorPvP method is responsible for initializing the OutdoorPvP
    (Outdoor Player vs Player) system for a specific map or zone. It sets up all necessary
    data structures, registers event handlers, and prepares the outdoor PvP environment
    for player interactions. This method typically gets called during the map initialization
    phase when the server loads the outdoor PvP zones. The method ensures that all
    outdoor PvP objectives, capture points, and related game mechanics are properly
    configured and ready to handle player activities such as capturing territories,
    triggering rewards, and managing faction-based conflicts.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the OutdoorPvP system was successfully initialized and
    configured; returns false if initialization failed or if the system is already
    set up.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Setup Usage
    code: "OutdoorPvP* outdoorPvP = new OutdoorPvP();\nif (outdoorPvP->SetupOutdoorPvP())\
      \ {\n    // Outdoor PvP system is ready for use\n    sLog->outString(\"Outdoor\
      \ PvP system initialized successfully.\");\n} else {\n    // Initialization\
      \ failed\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to initialize Outdoor PvP system.\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per OutdoorPvP instance during initialization.
    It is typically invoked by the map loading process and should not be called manually
    unless you are implementing custom outdoor PvP zones. The method may perform database
    operations to load configuration data for capture points, objectives, and faction
    settings.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times on the same OutdoorPvP instance can
    lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks. Ensure that this method is only invoked
    during proper initialization phases and not during active gameplay. Do not call
    this method if the OutdoorPvP system has already been set up.
