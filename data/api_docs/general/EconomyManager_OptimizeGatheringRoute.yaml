  class: EconomyManager
  method: OptimizeGatheringRoute
  signature: void EconomyManager::OptimizeGatheringRoute(const int & nodes)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the gathering route for economy-related activities based on node
    count.
  description: The OptimizeGatheringRoute method calculates and applies an optimized
    path for resource gathering operations within the game world. This method is typically
    used by the EconomyManager to improve efficiency when players or NPCs collect
    resources from multiple nodes. It analyzes the spatial distribution of gathering
    nodes and determines the most efficient sequence to visit them, minimizing travel
    time and maximizing resource collection effectiveness. The optimization considers
    factors such as node proximity, travel distance, and potential resource availability.
  parameters:
  - name: nodes
    description: Reference to an integer representing the number of gathering nodes
      to optimize the route for. This value determines how many nodes will be included
      in the optimization calculation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Route Optimization
    code: 'EconomyManager economyMgr;

      int nodeCount = 5;

      economyMgr.OptimizeGatheringRoute(nodeCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Route Optimization Based on Player Input
    code: 'EconomyManager economyMgr;

      int playerSelectedNodes = GetPlayerGatheringNodeCount();

      economyMgr.OptimizeGatheringRoute(playerSelectedNodes);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs pathfinding calculations using internal algorithms
    to determine optimal node visitation order. It may cache optimized routes for
    performance improvements during repeated calls with similar parameters.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of gathering nodes or
    with invalid node counts may result in undefined behavior. Ensure that the EconomyManager
    is properly configured before invoking this optimization routine.
