  method: AfterRelocation
  signature: void GameObject::AfterRelocation()
documentation:
  brief: Updates GameObject's position after relocation to maintain spatial accuracy
    and server-client synchronization.
  description: The AfterRelocation method is invoked when a GameObject's position
    changes, ensuring that the object's spatial representation is correctly updated
    in the game world. This method handles the necessary adjustments for maintaining
    accurate positioning within the server's spatial system, particularly important
    for objects that can move or are subject to dynamic relocation such as doors,
    traps, or other interactive elements. It ensures that the GameObject's position
    reflects the new coordinates and maintains proper synchronization with client-side
    updates.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void exampleFunction() {\n    GameObject* go = new GameObject();\n    //\
      \ ... perform relocation\n    go->AfterRelocation();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically during relocation events, but
    may be manually invoked when position changes are made outside normal game mechanics.
    Performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary calls if the object's
    position hasn't changed.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect positioning and synchronization
    issues with clients, potentially causing visual glitches or game mechanics failures.
