  brief: Loads group data from the database into the Group object
  description: The LoadGroupFromDB method retrieves all relevant group information
    from the database and populates the current Group instance with that data. This
    includes loading group members, leader information, loot settings, and other group-specific
    properties. The method is typically called during group initialization or when
    a player rejoins a group. It ensures that the in-memory representation of the
    group matches the persistent data stored in the database.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Group* group = new Group();

      group->LoadGroupFromDB(nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the database connection is already established and
    that the group ID has been set on the Group object. It may trigger additional
    database queries to load member data and other related information.
