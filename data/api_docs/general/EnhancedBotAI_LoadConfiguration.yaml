documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads the configuration settings for the EnhancedBotAI instance.
  description: The LoadConfiguration method is responsible for initializing and loading
    all necessary configuration parameters required by the EnhancedBotAI class. This
    method typically reads from configuration files, database entries, or hardcoded
    defaults to set up internal bot behavior settings such as combat strategies, movement
    patterns, and interaction rules. It ensures that the AI has all the required data
    before it begins executing any bot logic. The method is usually called during
    the initialization phase of a bot instance and should be invoked only once per
    instance lifecycle.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'EnhancedBotAI* bot = new EnhancedBotAI();

      bot->LoadConfiguration();

      // Bot is now configured and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any other AI methods to ensure proper
    initialization. It may involve file I/O or database queries, so performance could
    be impacted if configuration files are large or located remotely.
