  signature: const BattlePetSpeciesEntry * BattlePetMgr::GetBattlePetSpeciesByCreature(int
    creatureId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the battle pet species entry associated with a given creature ID.
  description: The GetBattlePetSpeciesByCreature method is used to fetch the BattlePetSpeciesEntry
    data structure that corresponds to a specific creature ID. This functionality
    is essential for identifying and managing battle pets within the World of Warcraft
    game environment, particularly in systems that handle pet battles and creature
    interactions. The method acts as a lookup mechanism to map creature identifiers
    to their respective battle pet species definitions, which contain properties such
    as pet type, quality, and visual appearance data. It's commonly used when processing
    pet-related events or determining whether a creature can be considered a battle
    pet.
  parameters:
  - name: creatureId
    description: The unique identifier of the creature for which to retrieve the battle
      pet species entry. This should correspond to a valid creature template ID defined
      in the game's database.
  returns: A pointer to the BattlePetSpeciesEntry structure that matches the provided
    creature ID, or nullptr if no matching entry is found. The returned pointer is
    const, indicating it should not be modified directly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const BattlePetSpeciesEntry* species = battlePetMgr->GetBattlePetSpeciesByCreature(12345);\n\
      if (species)\n{\n    // Use the species data\n    std::cout << \"Species ID:\
      \ \" << species->ID << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking if Creature is a Battle Pet
    code: "int creatureId = player->GetCreature()->GetEntry();\nconst BattlePetSpeciesEntry*\
      \ species = battlePetMgr->GetBattlePetSpeciesByCreature(creatureId);\nif (species\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // This creature is a battle pet\n    player->SendPetBattleSlotUpdate();\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Not a battle pet\n    player->SendNotification(\"This creature\
      \ cannot be used in pet battles.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation, so performance may vary depending
    on the internal data structure used for storing battle pet species entries. It
    is recommended to cache results when frequently accessing the same creature IDs.
    The method assumes that the BattlePetMgr has been properly initialized with all
    necessary battle pet data from the game database.
  warnings: Ensure that the creatureId parameter is valid and corresponds to an actual
    creature in the database, otherwise the method will return nullptr. Avoid modifying
    the returned BattlePetSpeciesEntry pointer as it points to const data. Be aware
    that this method may not be thread-safe if multiple threads access the same BattlePetMgr
    instance concurrently.
