  class: TimedFleeingMovementGenerator
  method: Update
  signature: bool TimedFleeingMovementGenerator::Update(int * param0, int param1)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the timed fleeing movement generator to control NPC escape behavior.
  description: The Update method is responsible for managing the state and progression
    of a creature's timed flee behavior. It handles the logic for when a creature
    should begin fleeing, how long it should flee for, and when to stop the fleeing
    action. This method is typically called during the AI update cycle to ensure that
    fleeing movements are properly executed and terminated based on time constraints
    or external conditions such as threat removal or target loss.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the fleeing movement is still active or has been successfully
    updated; false if the fleeing behavior has completed or encountered an error.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call in AI Context
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_fleeTimer >\
      \ 0)\n    {\n        if (!m_movementGenerator->Update(&m_fleeTimer, diff))\n\
      \        {\n            // Fleeing has ended\n            m_fleeTimer = 0;\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the movement generator system and relies on internal
    timers to manage flee duration. The implementation assumes that the creature's
    movement data and target information are properly initialized before calling Update.
