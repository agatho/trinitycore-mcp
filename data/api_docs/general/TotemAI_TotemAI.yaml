  class: TotemAI
  method: TotemAI
  signature: void TotemAI::TotemAI(Creature * creature, int scriptId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a totem AI instance for the specified creature with the given
    script ID.
  description: The TotemAI constructor initializes the AI behavior for totem creatures
    within the TrinityCore framework. This method sets up the necessary internal state
    and configuration for the totem AI to function correctly, including assigning
    the associated creature object and script identifier. The totem AI handles the
    behavior of totems such as healing ward, fire resistance totem, or other totem
    types that are summoned by players. This initialization is typically called during
    the creation of totem creatures in the game world, ensuring they have proper AI
    functionality for their designated purpose. The script ID parameter determines
    which specific AI behavior script is applied to the totem.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the totem being initialized.
      This must be a valid creature instance that represents a totem summoned by a
      player.
  - name: scriptId
    description: Integer identifier specifying which AI script should be applied to
      this totem. This determines the specific behavior and functionality of the totem,
      such as healing, damage reduction, or elemental protection.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic TotemAI Initialization
    code: 'Creature* totem = ...; // Valid creature instance

      int scriptId = 12345;

      TotemAI* ai = new TotemAI(totem, scriptId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Different Totem Types
    code: 'Creature* fireTotem = ...;

      Creature* healTotem = ...;


      // Initialize fire totem with script ID 1001

      TotemAI* fireAi = new TotemAI(fireTotem, 1001);


      // Initialize healing totem with script ID 1002

      TotemAI* healAi = new TotemAI(healTotem, 1002);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The constructor should only be called during creature creation or when a
    totem is summoned. The creature parameter must not be null and should represent
    a valid totem type. The scriptId should correspond to an existing AI script definition
    in the TrinityCore database.
  warnings: Passing a null creature pointer will likely cause a crash or undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the scriptId corresponds to a valid AI script before calling
    this constructor. This method does not perform any validation of the creature
    type, so it's up to the caller to ensure the creature is actually a totem.
