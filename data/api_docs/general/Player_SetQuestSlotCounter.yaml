  class: Player
  method: SetQuestSlotCounter
  signature: void Player::SetQuestSlotCounter(uint16 slot, uint8 counter, uint16 count)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the quest counter for a specific quest slot in the player's quest log.
  description: This method updates the quest counter value for a specified quest slot,
    allowing players to track progress toward quest completion. The method modifies
    the internal quest tracking data structure, enabling developers to control quest
    progression and completion status. It is commonly used when implementing quest
    mechanics or when modifying quest progress during gameplay. This method directly
    affects how quest progress appears in the player's quest log and can influence
    quest completion behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The quest slot index (0-25) that represents the position of the quest
      in the player's quest log
  - name: counter
    description: The current progress counter value for the specified quest slot,
      typically representing the number of times a quest objective has been completed
  - name: count
    description: The maximum count value that represents the total required progress
      for this quest, usually indicating how many times an objective needs to be completed
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetQuestSlotCounter(0, 1, 5); // Set quest slot 0 to progress 1/5'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      uint16 slot = 3;

      uint8 counter = 2;

      uint16 count = 10;

      player->SetQuestSlotCounter(slot, counter, count);

      // Sets quest slot 3 to progress 2/10'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's internal quest tracking data.
    It should be used carefully as it affects how quest progress appears in the UI.
    The method is typically called when implementing quest completion or when modifying
    quest progress during gameplay. Performance considerations include that this method
    may trigger updates to the player's quest log display.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without proper understanding
    of the quest system. Incorrect usage can lead to quest progression issues or incorrect
    quest completion status. Care must be taken when setting counter values to ensure
    they match the expected progress values for the quest.
