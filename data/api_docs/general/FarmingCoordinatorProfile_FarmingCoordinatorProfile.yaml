documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the FarmingCoordinatorProfile class with default
    values.
  description: The FarmingCoordinatorProfile constructor initializes a new instance
    of the FarmingCoordinatorProfile class. This method sets up the internal state
    and data members required for managing farming-related operations within the TrinityCore
    framework. It typically configures default settings, allocates necessary resources,
    and prepares the object for use in the game's farming system. The constructor
    is called automatically when a new FarmingCoordinatorProfile object is created,
    ensuring that all member variables are properly initialized before any other methods
    are invoked.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new FarmingCoordinatorProfile instance
    code: 'FarmingCoordinatorProfile profile;

      // The profile object is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called implicitly when declaring a FarmingCoordinatorProfile
    variable. Developers should be aware that any initialization logic within this
    constructor may impact performance if called frequently. The constructor does
    not accept parameters, so all configuration must be done through member functions
    or external setup methods after object creation.
