  class: PetAI
  method: _AttackStart
  signature: void PetAI::_AttackStart(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates attack behavior against a specified target for the pet AI.
  description: The _AttackStart method is responsible for triggering the pet's attack
    behavior towards a given target. It is typically invoked when the pet AI determines
    that it should begin attacking an enemy unit. This method handles the initial
    setup of the attack sequence, including setting the target and initiating the
    appropriate combat state. The method does not directly perform damage calculations
    but rather prepares the pet to engage in combat with the specified target. It
    integrates with the broader pet AI system to manage combat behavior and decision-making.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or index
      within the game world. This parameter specifies which unit the pet should begin
      attacking.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Attack Start Usage
    code: 'PetAI* petAI = player->GetPet()->AI();

      int targetId = 12345;

      petAI->_AttackStart(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal AI logic and should not be called directly
    from external code without proper context. The target parameter must point to
    a valid entity within the game world, otherwise undefined behavior may occur.
