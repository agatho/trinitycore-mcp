  class: ObjectCache
  method: GetStats
  signature: const CacheStats & ObjectCache::GetStats() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves cache statistics including hit rate, miss count, and total entries
    for monitoring ObjectCache performance.
  description: The GetStats method provides detailed performance metrics for the ObjectCache
    instance. It returns a constant reference to a CacheStats structure that contains
    information about cache efficiency such as hit rate, number of misses, total entries,
    and other relevant statistics. This method is typically used for debugging, performance
    monitoring, or optimizing cache behavior within the TrinityCore server. The returned
    statistics are updated dynamically as cache operations occur, making it useful
    for real-time performance analysis.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a CacheStats structure containing detailed cache
    performance metrics including hit rate, miss count, and total entries.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ObjectCache* cache = ObjectCache::GetGlobalCache();

      const CacheStats& stats = cache->GetStats();

      std::cout << "Cache Hit Rate: " << stats.hitRate << "%" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring
    code: "void LogCachePerformance()\n{\n    ObjectCache* cache = ObjectCache::GetGlobalCache();\n\
      \    const CacheStats& stats = cache->GetStats();\n    \n    if (stats.totalEntries\
      \ > 0)\n    {\n        float hitPercentage = (stats.hits / static_cast<float>(stats.totalEntries))\
      \ * 100.0f;\n        TC_LOG_INFO(\"cache\", \"Cache Performance - Hits: %u,\
      \ Misses: %u, Hit Rate: %.2f%%\",\n                   stats.hits, stats.misses,\
      \ hitPercentage);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned CacheStats reference is valid only until the next call to GetStats
    or until the ObjectCache instance is modified. This method is thread-safe and
    can be called from any thread. The statistics are updated atomically, ensuring
    consistency of data even under concurrent access.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned CacheStats object as it's a constant reference.
    Modifying it may lead to undefined behavior. Be aware that frequent calls to GetStats
    may have performance implications in high-frequency scenarios.
