  class: IBotPerformanceMonitor
  method: RecordDatabaseLatency
  signature: void IBotPerformanceMonitor::RecordDatabaseLatency(uint64 microseconds)
documentation:
  brief: Records database latency measurement in microseconds for performance monitoring.
  description: The RecordDatabaseLatency method captures and stores a database operation
    latency measurement expressed in microseconds. This method is typically used by
    bot systems or performance monitoring components within TrinityCore to track how
    long database queries take to complete. The recorded values help identify performance
    bottlenecks and optimize database interactions. The method does not perform any
    validation on the input value, so it's expected that callers provide valid latency
    measurements. This data may be used for logging, reporting, or real-time performance
    adjustments in bot behavior or server resource management.
  parameters:
  - name: microseconds
    description: The database operation latency measured in microseconds. This value
      represents the time elapsed between initiating a database query and receiving
      the result. Valid values are non-negative integers representing time duration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint64 latency = 1500; // 1.5 milliseconds

      botPerformanceMonitor->RecordDatabaseLatency(latency);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Latency from Query Timing
    code: 'auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      // ... database query execution ...

      auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      uint64 microseconds = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end
      - start).count();

      botPerformanceMonitor->RecordDatabaseLatency(microseconds);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a performance monitoring system that aggregates
    latency data for analysis. It's designed to be called frequently during bot operation
    or database-intensive operations. The implementation may store these values in
    memory buffers or write them to logs depending on the monitor's configuration.
  warnings: Ensure that the microseconds parameter represents actual measured time
    and not arbitrary values, as incorrect measurements could skew performance analysis.
    This method should not be called with negative values as it may cause unexpected
    behavior in monitoring systems.
