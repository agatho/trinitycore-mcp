  method: CanClassKiteEffectively
  signature: bool KitingUtils::CanClassKiteEffectively(uint8 playerClass)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified player class can effectively perform kiting
    mechanics in World of Warcraft.
  description: The CanClassKiteEffectively method evaluates if a given player class
    possesses the necessary attributes, abilities, or gameplay characteristics to
    execute effective kiting strategies. Kiting in World of Warcraft refers to the
    technique of maintaining distance from enemies while dealing damage, often using
    ranged attacks or spells. This method likely considers factors such as class-specific
    movement speed, available abilities (like crowd control or mobility spells), and
    general combat mechanics that support or hinder kiting effectiveness. The function
    returns true if the class is deemed capable of kiting effectively, and false otherwise.
    It serves as a utility for game logic systems that need to determine class suitability
    for certain gameplay strategies or AI behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether the specified player class can
    effectively kite enemies. True signifies the class is capable of effective kiting,
    while false indicates it cannot.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "bool canKite = KitingUtils::CanClassKiteEffectively(CLASS_MAGE);\nif (canKite)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with kiting-related logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in AI Decision Making
    code: "void UnitAI::Update()\n{\n    if (CanClassKiteEffectively(GetUnit()->getClass()))\n\
      \    {\n        // Apply kiting-based tactics\n        DoKitingBehavior();\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Fall back to melee or other strategies\n\
      \        UseAlternativeCombatStrategy();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by TrinityCore's AI and combat systems.
    It may be updated with new class mechanics or balance changes in patch updates.
    The implementation details are not visible, but it probably relies on predefined
    class data tables or configuration flags.
  warnings: Do not assume all classes can kite effectively; some classes (like certain
    melee classes) might inherently lack the necessary mechanics for effective kiting.
    This method should be used carefully in AI logic where class-specific behavior
    is critical.
