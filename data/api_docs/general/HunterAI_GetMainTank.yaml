  class: HunterAI
  method: GetMainTank
  signature: Player * HunterAI::GetMainTank()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the main tank target for the hunter's AI behavior.
  description: The GetMainTank method retrieves the Player object that is designated
    as the primary tank target within the HunterAI's current context. This is typically
    used in AI decision-making to determine which player should be targeted for threat
    generation or control abilities. The returned player may be null if no valid main
    tank has been assigned or if the hunter is not in a combat situation where a main
    tank is relevant.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Player object representing the main tank, or nullptr if
    no main tank is currently defined or applicable.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for main tank
    code: "Player* mainTank = hunterAI->GetMainTank();\nif (mainTank)\n{\n    // Perform\
      \ actions targeting the main tank\n    hunter->CastSpell(mainTank, SPELL_AIMED_SHOT,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles and may return different
    values depending on the current combat state and target selection logic. The returned
    Player pointer should be validated before use to prevent null dereference errors.
  warnings: The returned Player pointer might be invalidated if the main tank leaves
    the zone or becomes disconnected. Always validate the pointer before using it
    in spell casting or other actions that require a valid target.
