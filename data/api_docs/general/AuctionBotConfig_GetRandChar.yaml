documentation:
  brief: Generates and returns a random character value for use in auction bot configurations.
  description: The GetRandChar method generates a pseudo-random integer value that
    is typically used within the AuctionBot system to provide variability in auction
    behavior, such as randomizing item qualities, bid amounts, or other auction parameters.
    This method is part of the AuctionBotConfig class which manages various configuration
    settings for the auction bot functionality in TrinityCore. The generated value
    is intended to be used in scenarios where randomized behavior is desired to simulate
    more natural marketplace dynamics. The method does not require any input parameters
    and returns a single integer representing the random character value.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing a randomly generated character code or identifier,
    typically used within auction bot configurations for varying auction properties
    such as item quality, rarity, or other randomized attributes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Auction Configuration
    code: "int randomChar = auctionBotConfig.GetRandChar();\n// Use the random character\
      \ value to set a randomized auction property\nif (randomChar > 50) {\n    //\
      \ Apply high-quality item settings\n} else {\n    // Apply standard item settings\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses a pseudo-random number generator seeded during class
    initialization or system startup. The exact range and distribution of returned
    values may depend on internal configuration parameters within the AuctionBotConfig
    class. Developers should be aware that repeated calls to this method will produce
    different values unless the random seed is fixed.
  warnings: Since this method generates pseudo-random values, it's important to understand
    that the sequence of values can be predictable if the underlying random number
    generator is not properly seeded or if the same seed is used repeatedly. This
    could lead to inconsistent auction behavior in certain scenarios.
