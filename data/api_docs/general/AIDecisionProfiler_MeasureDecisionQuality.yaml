  method: MeasureDecisionQuality
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::MeasureDecisionQuality()
documentation:
  brief: Measures and evaluates the quality of AI decisions made by the AIDecisionProfiler.
  description: The MeasureDecisionQuality method assesses the effectiveness and accuracy
    of AI decision-making processes within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    likely collects data on decision outcomes, compares them against expected or optimal
    results, and generates metrics that quantify decision quality. It is typically
    used in AI profiling and optimization scenarios to improve NPC behavior and decision
    logic. The method may involve analyzing various factors such as decision response
    time, success rate, and alignment with game state objectives. This functionality
    is crucial for maintaining balanced gameplay and ensuring that AI-controlled entities
    behave logically and effectively within the World of Warcraft environment.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Profiling
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      profiler.MeasureDecisionQuality();

      // This call evaluates current AI decision quality metrics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI profiling system and may require
    prior initialization of decision tracking mechanisms. It could be called periodically
    to monitor AI performance or triggered after significant gameplay events.
