  class: Player
  method: SendQuestUpdate
  signature: void Player::SendQuestUpdate(uint32 questId, bool updateInteractions,
    bool updateGameObjectQuestGiverStatus)
documentation:
  brief: Sends quest update information to the player's client for a specified quest
    ID.
  description: The SendQuestUpdate method is used to notify the player's client about
    changes in quest status, including interaction counts and GameObject quest giver
    status. This method ensures that the client's UI reflects the current state of
    the quest, such as progress updates or completion status. It is typically invoked
    when quest objectives are modified, completed, or when the player interacts with
    quest-related objects. The method allows for selective updates to avoid unnecessary
    network traffic by enabling or disabling specific update types.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to update. This value must correspond
      to a valid quest in the game's database.
  - name: updateInteractions
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to update interaction counts for
      the quest. If true, updates the number of times the player has interacted with
      quest-related objects.
  - name: updateGameObjectQuestGiverStatus
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to update the status of GameObjects
      that act as quest givers. If true, refreshes the visibility and interactivity
      of quest giver objects in the client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Update
    code: player->SendQuestUpdate(12345, true, false);
    language: cpp
  - title: Update Both Interactions and GameObject Status
    code: player->SendQuestUpdate(67890, true, true);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly communicates with the client via network packets to
    synchronize quest data. It should be used sparingly to prevent excessive network
    traffic and maintain performance. The method does not validate whether the quest
    exists or is active; it assumes the caller has already performed necessary checks.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper quest state validation may result in
    incorrect UI updates or client-side errors. Ensure that the quest ID corresponds
    to an actual quest in the database, and that the player is currently on that quest
    before invoking this method.
