documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified unit is classified as a tank in the context
    of target selection.
  description: The IsTank method evaluates whether a given Unit object is considered
    a tank within the game's AI targeting logic. This typically involves checking
    if the unit has tanking capabilities, such as having a high amount of threat,
    specific class roles (like Warrior or Paladin), or other mechanics that designate
    them as a primary target for enemy attacks. The method is commonly used in AI
    decision-making processes to prioritize targets based on their role within a group
    or encounter. It may consider factors like the unit's current aggro level, class
    specialization, and whether they are actively tanking enemies.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target unit is classified as a tank; otherwise returns
    false. A unit might be considered a tank if it has high threat, is a melee class
    with tanking abilities, or is actively fulfilling the role of tanking in combat.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a target is a tank
    code: "if (targetSelector.IsTank(targetUnit)) {\n    // Handle tank-specific logic\n\
      \    DoTankBehavior();\n} else {\n    // Handle non-tank logic\n    DoNormalBehavior();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsTank in a target selection context
    code: "Unit* bestTarget = nullptr;\nfor (auto& unit : nearbyUnits) {\n    if (!bestTarget\
      \ || (targetSelector.IsTank(unit) && !targetSelector.IsTank(bestTarget))) {\n\
      \        bestTarget = unit;\n    }\n}\n// Now bestTarget is either the first\
      \ tank found or a non-tank if no tanks exist"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal game state tracking such as threat
    tables and class-specific role assignments. It's important to note that in dynamic
    combat situations, a unit's tanking status may change frequently based on threat
    generation or role swapping.
  warnings: Ensure that the Unit pointer passed to this method is valid and not null
    before calling IsTank, as dereferencing an invalid pointer will cause undefined
    behavior. Additionally, be aware that this method might not account for temporary
    buffs or debuffs that alter a unit's tanking capabilities.
