  signature: void CooldownStackingOptimizer::InitializePriestCooldowns()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the cooldown tracking system for priest class abilities.
  description: 'The InitializePriestCooldowns method sets up internal data structures
    and state management for tracking cooldowns of priest-specific abilities within
    the CooldownStackingOptimizer framework. This method prepares the system to monitor
    and optimize the usage of priest spells such as Power Word: Shield, Flash Heal,
    and other cooldown-based abilities. It establishes baseline cooldown timers and
    prepares the optimizer to make strategic decisions about spell usage based on
    current cooldown states and game mechanics.'

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'CooldownStackingOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.InitializePriestCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called once during the initialization phase of a priest's
    AI behavior. It prepares the internal cooldown tracking system but does not actually
    start monitoring cooldowns - that occurs through other methods in the class.
