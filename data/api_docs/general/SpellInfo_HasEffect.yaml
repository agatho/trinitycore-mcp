  signature: bool SpellInfo::HasEffect(int effect) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a spell has a specific effect type.
  description: The HasEffect method determines if a SpellInfo object contains a particular
    effect type. This is useful for identifying spells that have specific mechanics
    such as damage over time, healing, or aura effects. The method returns true if
    the specified effect exists within the spell's effect list, and false otherwise.
    It can be used to validate spell behavior during gameplay or when processing spell
    data in the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell contains the specified effect type, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (spellInfo->HasEffect(EFFECT_SCHOOL_DAMAGE)) {\n    // Spell has a school\
      \ damage effect\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    to determine the nature of spells. It may be called frequently during spell processing,
    so performance considerations should be taken into account when using it in loops.
  warnings: This method does not validate whether the effect index is valid or not;
    it simply checks if the effect exists within the spell's effect list. Care should
    be taken to ensure that the effect parameter corresponds to a valid effect type.
