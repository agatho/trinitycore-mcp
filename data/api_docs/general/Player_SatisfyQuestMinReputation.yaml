documentation:
  brief: Satisfies the minimum reputation requirement for a quest
  description: This method checks if the player has sufficient reputation to complete
    the specified quest. It verifies whether the player's current reputation level
    meets or exceeds the minimum required reputation threshold for the quest. The
    method returns true if the player satisfies the reputation requirements, false
    otherwise. This functionality is essential for quest completion mechanics in World
    of Warcraft and TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: qInfo
    description: Pointer to the Quest object containing the reputation requirements
      that need to be satisfied
  - name: msg
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to display a message if reputation
      requirements are not met. If true, displays a message to the player; if false,
      no message is shown.
  returns: Returns true if the player's reputation level meets or exceeds the minimum
    required threshold for the quest, false otherwise. The method may return false
    if the player lacks sufficient reputation or if the quest has no reputation requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "bool result = player->SatisfyQuestMinReputation(quest, true);\nif (result)\n\
      {\n    // Player can proceed with quest\n    // Do something here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "const Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\nbool result\
      \ = player->SatisfyQuestMinReputation(quest, false);\nif (result)\n{\n    //\
      \ Player satisfies reputation requirements\n    // Proceed with quest completion\
      \ logic\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player does not satisfy reputation requirements\n\
      \    // Handle accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during quest completion checks to ensure players
    have sufficient reputation before allowing them to turn in quests. It's important
    to note that this method may be called multiple times during quest processing,
    and the reputation requirements are usually tied to specific faction requirements.
  warnings: This method should not be used for checking general reputation levels
    as it only verifies minimum requirements for a specific quest. Be careful when
    using this method with quests that have no reputation requirements, as it might
    return false even if the player has sufficient reputation for other reasons.
