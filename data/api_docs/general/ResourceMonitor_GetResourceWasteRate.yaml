  class: ResourceMonitor
  method: GetResourceWasteRate
  signature: float ResourceMonitor::GetResourceWasteRate(ResourceType type)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the rate of resource waste for the specified resource
    type.
  description: The GetResourceWasteRate method computes the proportion of resources
    that are wasted over time for a given resource type. This is typically used in
    game mechanics to track inefficiencies in resource usage, such as mana spent on
    failed spells or health points lost due to damage mitigation. The method aggregates
    data from internal tracking mechanisms and returns a normalized float value between
    0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 indicates no waste and 1.0 indicates complete waste. This
    function is essential for performance analysis and balancing gameplay elements
    related to resource management.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the resource waste rate for the specified resource
    type. The value ranges from 0.0 (no waste) to 1.0 (complete waste). Returns 0.0
    if the resource type is invalid or no tracking data exists for that resource.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float wasteRate = resourceMonitor->GetResourceWasteRate(ResourceType::MANA);\n\
      if (wasteRate > 0.5f)\n{\n    // Log warning about high mana waste\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      High mana waste detected: %.2f\", wasteRate);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Type Switch Example
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < MAX_RESOURCE_TYPES; ++i)\n{\n    ResourceType type\
      \ = static_cast<ResourceType>(i);\n    float rate = resourceMonitor->GetResourceWasteRate(type);\n\
      \    if (rate > 0.1f)\n    {\n        sLog->outString(\"Warning: %s waste rate\
      \ is %.2f\", GetResourceTypeName(type), rate);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal resource tracking data that may not be populated
    until after certain game events have occurred. The returned values are averaged
    over a time window to provide stable metrics. For accurate results, ensure the
    ResourceMonitor has sufficient data collection time before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method before resource tracking has begun may return inaccurate
    or zero values. The method assumes valid ResourceType enum values; invalid inputs
    may produce undefined behavior or return 0.0.
