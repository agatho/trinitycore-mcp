  class: InterruptManager
  method: ShouldInterrupt
  signature: bool InterruptManager::ShouldInterrupt(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an interrupt should be triggered on the specified target
    unit.
  description: The ShouldInterrupt method evaluates whether a given unit is eligible
    for an interrupt based on various game mechanics and conditions. This method is
    typically used within the context of spell casting or ability usage to determine
    if an ongoing cast or channel can be interrupted by external factors such as damage,
    movement, or specific interrupt triggers. It checks the target's current state,
    including whether it is casting a spell, channeling an effect, or otherwise engaged
    in an activity that could be interrupted. The method returns true if the target
    meets all criteria for interruption, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target unit can be interrupted based on current conditions;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Logic
    code: "if (interruptManager->ShouldInterrupt(targetUnit)) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ interrupt logic\n    targetUnit->InterruptSpell();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal state tracking of the target unit,
    such as spell casting status or channeling effects. It may also consider factors
    like immunity flags or special interrupt rules defined by game mechanics.
