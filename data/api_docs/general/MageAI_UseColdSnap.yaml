  method: UseColdSnap
  signature: void MageAI::UseColdSnap()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the Cold Snap ability for a Mage AI character, resetting all spell
    cooldowns.
  description: The UseColdSnap method is responsible for activating the Mage's Cold
    Snap ability within the AI system. This ability resets all spell cooldowns for
    the mage, allowing them to immediately cast any previously on-cooldown spells.
    The method typically integrates with the AI's spell casting logic and may involve
    checking for valid targets, ensuring the ability is not on cooldown, and managing
    the AI's overall spell selection strategy. It serves as a key utility in high-level
    Mage AI decision-making, particularly in scenarios where rapid spell reapplication
    is beneficial.

    code: "void SomeMageAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (m_mage->GetHealthPct() < 30)\n\
      \    {\n        m_mage->UseColdSnap();\n        // Proceed with emergency spell\
      \ casting\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the MageAI class during combat decision-making.
    It assumes that the AI has already validated that Cold Snap can be used (e.g.,
    not on cooldown, in a valid state). The implementation likely interacts with the
    underlying TrinityCore spell system to reset cooldowns and may trigger additional
    AI events or state changes.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without proper cooldown checks or AI state
    validation could lead to unexpected behavior. Ensure that the MageAI instance
    is properly initialized before calling this method, as it relies on internal AI
    state management.
