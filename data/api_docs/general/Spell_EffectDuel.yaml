documentation:
  brief: Initiates a duel between two players, handling the duel mechanics and player
    interactions.
  description: The EffectDuel method is responsible for managing the duel process
    within the TrinityCore framework. It handles the initiation of duels between players,
    including setting up the duel conditions, checking if both players are in a valid
    state to engage in combat, and managing the duel outcome when one player surrenders
    or wins. This method typically involves checking the player's current state, ensuring
    they can participate in duels, and handling the necessary game mechanics such
    as disabling PvP flagging, setting up duel timers, and managing the duel results.
    The method is part of the Spell class and is called during spell effects that
    involve player versus player combat.

  notes: This method is typically called during spell effects that involve player
    versus player combat. It requires proper handling of player state and game mechanics
    to ensure valid duel conditions. Performance considerations include ensuring no
    race conditions occur when managing duel states.
  warnings: The method may not be directly callable by external code; it's usually
    invoked through the Spell system. Care should be taken to ensure that players
    are in valid duel states before calling this method, as invalid state can lead
    to game crashes or unexpected behavior.
