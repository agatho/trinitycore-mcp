  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: GroupUpForObjective
  signature: bool BattlegroundAI::GroupUpForObjective(int * player, const BGObjective
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Groups players together for a specific battleground objective.
  description: The GroupUpForObjective method attempts to organize players into groups
    based on their proximity and role requirements for completing a given battleground
    objective. This method is typically used during battlegrounds like Warsong Gulch
    or Arathi Basin where coordinated group efforts are needed to capture or defend
    objectives such as flags or bases. It evaluates the current state of players in
    the battleground, checks if they meet the necessary conditions to participate
    in the objective, and groups them accordingly. The method returns true if successful
    in grouping players for the objective, and false otherwise. This functionality
    is crucial for maintaining organized gameplay and ensuring that objectives can
    be effectively contested or captured by teams.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player ID or index within
      the battleground's player list.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a BGObjective object that defines the specific objective
      type, location, and state for which players should be grouped.
  returns: Returns true if the method successfully groups players for the specified
    objective, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate insufficient
    players, invalid objective state, or failure to meet grouping criteria.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (bgAI->GroupUpForObjective(&playerId, objective)) {\n    // Players\
      \ have been successfully grouped for the objective\n    sLog->outString(\"Players\
      \ grouped for objective.\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to group players\n   \
      \ sLog->outString(\"Failed to group players for objective.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Objective State Check
    code: "BGObjective* obj = bg->GetObjective(0);\nif (obj && obj->IsUnderAttack())\
      \ {\n    int playerId = 12345;\n    if (bgAI->GroupUpForObjective(&playerId,\
      \ *obj)) {\n        // Proceed with objective-related logic\n        bgAI->HandleObjectiveCapture(obj);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground AI system and relies on internal
    player tracking and objective state management. It assumes that players are already
    registered in the battleground and that the objective has been properly initialized.
    The grouping logic may vary depending on the battleground type and current game
    rules.
  warnings: Do not call this method without verifying that the objective is valid
    and active. Improper usage might lead to incorrect player grouping or unexpected
    behavior during battleground events.
