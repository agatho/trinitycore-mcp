  class: WarriorAI
  method: RecordInterruptAttempt
  signature: void WarriorAI::RecordInterruptAttempt(::Unit * target, uint32 spellId,
    bool success)
documentation:
  brief: Records an interrupt attempt by a warrior AI unit against a target.
  description: The RecordInterruptAttempt method logs information about a spell interruption
    attempt made by a WarriorAI-controlled unit. This method tracks whether the interrupt
    was successful or not, and stores relevant data for AI behavior analysis. It is
    typically called during combat when a warrior attempts to interrupt an enemy's
    casting. The method updates internal tracking structures that may be used for
    tactical decision-making or performance monitoring within the AI system.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object being interrupted. Must not be null and
      must represent a valid target in combat.
  - name: spellId
    description: The identifier of the spell being interrupted. Used to track which
      specific spell was targeted for interruption.
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the interrupt attempt succeeded (true)
      or failed (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupt Recording
    code: "void SomeWarriorAI::OnSpellCast(Unit* target, uint32 spellId)\n{\n    bool\
      \ interruptSuccess = TryInterruptSpell(target, spellId);\n    RecordInterruptAttempt(target,\
      \ spellId, interruptSuccess);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Interrupt Tracking
    code: "void WarriorAI::HandleCombatAction()\n{\n    if (me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\n\
      \    {\n        Unit* currentTarget = me->getVictim();\n        if (currentTarget)\n\
      \        {\n            uint32 interruptSpellId = GetInterruptingSpellId();\n\
      \            bool success = DoInterruptSpell(currentTarget, interruptSpellId);\n\
      \            RecordInterruptAttempt(currentTarget, interruptSpellId, success);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal counters or logs for AI performance analysis.
    It should be called only during active combat situations where interrupts are
    possible. The method does not perform any direct spell interruption logic itself,
    but rather records the outcome of such actions.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is valid and in combat before calling
    this method. Passing a null target or invalid unit pointer may cause undefined
    behavior. This method should only be invoked when an actual interrupt attempt
    occurs, not for general tracking purposes.
