documentation:
  brief: Clears all AFK reports from the player's report list.
  description: The ClearAfkReports method removes all AFK (Away From Keyboard) reports
    that have been stored in the player's report list. This method is typically used
    to reset the player's AFK status and clear any accumulated AFK reports, allowing
    the player to resume normal gameplay activities without being flagged as AFK.
    The method does not affect the player's AFK status itself, but rather clears the
    reports that may have been generated during the AFK period.

      player->ClearAfkReports();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a player returns from AFK status, or
    during gameplay events that reset the AFK state. It's important to note that this
    method does not actually change the player's AFK status; it only clears stored
    reports.
