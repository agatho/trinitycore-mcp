  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: CoordinateEmergencyEvacuation
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::CoordinateEmergencyEvacuation(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates an emergency evacuation for all members of a specified group
    within an instance.
  description: The CoordinateEmergencyEvacuation method initiates an immediate evacuation
    process for all players belonging to a given group within a dungeon or raid instance.
    This function is typically invoked during critical game events such as instance
    timeouts, server maintenance, or emergency scenarios where players need to be
    rapidly removed from the current instance environment. The method ensures that
    all group members are teleported to a designated safe location outside the instance,
    preserving their items and status while preventing further interaction with the
    instance content. It handles the necessary cleanup of instance-related data and
    updates player states accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players to be evacuated.
      Must not be null and must contain at least one valid player member.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Emergency Evacuation of a Raid Group
    code: "Group* raidGroup = sObjectMgr->GetGroupById(12345);\nif (raidGroup)\n{\n\
      \    sInstanceCoordination->CoordinateEmergencyEvacuation(raidGroup);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Evacuation Based on Instance State
    code: "if (instance->GetStatus() == INSTANCE_STATUS_TIMEOUT)\n{\n    Group* group\
      \ = instance->GetGroup();\n    if (group)\n    {\n        sInstanceCoordination->CoordinateEmergencyEvacuation(group);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the instance is in a state where evacuation
    is appropriate. The function performs immediate teleportation without any delay,
    so it's important to ensure that all preconditions are met before invocation.
    The method internally manages the group's instance data and player states, making
    it safe for use during emergency situations.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Always validate that the group exists and contains valid members before
    invoking this function. Additionally, repeated calls to this method on the same
    group may cause unexpected state changes if not properly synchronized.
