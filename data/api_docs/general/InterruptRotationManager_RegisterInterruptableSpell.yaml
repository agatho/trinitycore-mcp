  class: InterruptRotationManager
  method: RegisterInterruptableSpell
  signature: void InterruptRotationManager::RegisterInterruptableSpell(const InterruptableSpell
    & spell)
documentation:
  brief: Registers an interruptable spell with the rotation manager for handling spell
    interruptions during combat.
  description: The RegisterInterruptableSpell method adds a new spell to the internal
    collection of spells that can be interrupted during player or NPC rotations. This
    allows the system to track and manage which spells are eligible for interruption
    based on various game mechanics such as spell casting, movement, or external effects.
    The method typically integrates with the core interrupt handling logic of TrinityCore's
    AI and combat systems, ensuring that specific spells can be properly canceled
    or modified during active gameplay scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: spell
    description: A constant reference to an InterruptableSpell object containing the
      spell data to register. This includes information such as spell ID, interrupt
      conditions, and cooldown properties.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Registration of a Spell
    code: 'InterruptableSpell mySpell;

      mySpell.spellId = 12345;

      mySpell.interruptibleByMovement = true;

      mySpell.interruptibleByDamage = false;

      rotationManager.RegisterInterruptableSpell(mySpell);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering Multiple Spells in Loop
    code: "std::vector<InterruptableSpell> spellsToRegister = {\n    {12345, true,\
      \ false},\n    {12346, false, true},\n    {12347, true, true}\n};\nfor (const\
      \ auto& spell : spellsToRegister) {\n    rotationManager.RegisterInterruptableSpell(spell);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during initialization or configuration phases
    of a custom AI module. It's important to ensure that the InterruptableSpell object
    passed to this method has valid data, especially the spellId field, as invalid
    entries may cause runtime errors or unexpected behavior in interrupt handling
    logic.
  warnings: Do not register spells with duplicate IDs unless intentional; this can
    lead to undefined behavior or overwriting of existing entries. Also, be cautious
    when registering spells that are not actually used in gameplay, as they may consume
    unnecessary memory and processing resources.
