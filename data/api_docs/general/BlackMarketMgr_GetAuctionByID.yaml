documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a black market auction entry by its unique identifier.
  description: The GetAuctionByID method fetches a specific BlackMarketEntry from
    the black market manager using its unique marketId. This method is used to access
    individual auction entries within the black market system, which allows players
    to bid on and purchase items. The method performs a lookup in an internal data
    structure that stores all active black market auctions. It returns a pointer to
    the BlackMarketEntry if found, or nullptr if no entry exists with the specified
    ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the BlackMarketEntry object corresponding to the given marketId,
    or nullptr if no such entry exists.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Check Black Market Entry
    code: "BlackMarketEntry* entry = blackMarketMgr->GetAuctionByID(12345);\nif (entry\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process the black market auction\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Found black market item: %u\", entry->itemId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      No black market entry found with ID 12345\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation which may have performance implications
    if called frequently in tight loops. The returned pointer is valid only as long
    as the BlackMarketEntry exists in the manager's internal storage and should not
    be stored for extended periods without proper reference management.
  warnings: The returned pointer can be null, so always check for nullptr before dereferencing.
    Do not assume that a non-null return value means the auction is still active or
    valid for bidding.
