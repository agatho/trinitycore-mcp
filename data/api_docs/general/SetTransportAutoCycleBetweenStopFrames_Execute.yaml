  method: Execute
  signature: void SetTransportAutoCycleBetweenStopFrames::Execute(GameObjectTypeBase
    & type) const
documentation:
  brief: Sets the transport auto cycle behavior between stop frames for a game object
    type.
  description: This method configures whether a transport GameObject will automatically
    cycle through its stop frames when moving. It modifies the GameObjectTypeBase
    to enable or disable this automatic cycling behavior, which is essential for proper
    transport animation and movement logic in World of Warcraft. The method operates
    on the provided GameObjectTypeBase reference and adjusts internal flags or settings
    that control transport movement patterns. This functionality is typically used
    during transport initialization or configuration within the TrinityCore server
    implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: Reference to the GameObjectTypeBase object whose auto cycle behavior
      will be modified. This parameter represents the specific game object type configuration
      being adjusted.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Configure Transport Auto Cycle for GameObject Type
    code: 'SetTransportAutoCycleBetweenStopFrames command;

      GameObjectTypeBase transportType;

      command.Execute(transportType);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal transport state flags within the GameObjectTypeBase
    structure. It should be called during transport initialization or configuration
    phases, not during active gameplay to avoid unexpected behavior.
