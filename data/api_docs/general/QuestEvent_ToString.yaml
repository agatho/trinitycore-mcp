documentation:
  brief: Converts a QuestEvent object into a human-readable string representation
  description: The ToString method provides a textual representation of a QuestEvent
    object, typically used for debugging, logging, or displaying quest-related event
    information in a readable format. This method is commonly utilized within the
    TrinityCore framework to serialize quest events for various system outputs such
    as console logs, database entries, or user interfaces. The implementation likely
    includes key identifiers and state information of the quest event to aid in tracking
    and troubleshooting quest progression mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing a formatted representation of the QuestEvent object
    that includes relevant identifying information and current state values
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Debug Logging
    code: 'QuestEvent event;

      std::string eventString = event.ToString();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("quest", "Current quest event: %s", eventString.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: The exact format of the returned string may vary based on the internal implementation
    and could include quest ID, event type, state flags, or other relevant metadata.
    This method is typically not performance-critical but should be used judiciously
    in high-frequency logging scenarios.
