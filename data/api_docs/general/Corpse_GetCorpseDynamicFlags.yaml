  class: Corpse
  method: GetCorpseDynamicFlags
  signature: int Corpse::GetCorpseDynamicFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the dynamic flags of the corpse object.
  description: The GetCorpseDynamicFlags method retrieves the dynamic flags associated
    with a Corpse object. These flags represent various runtime states and properties
    of the corpse, such as whether it is looted, despawned, or has specific visual
    effects applied. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, dynamic flags
    are used to manage the behavioral and visual aspects of game objects during their
    lifecycle. This method provides read-only access to these flags without modifying
    them.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the current dynamic flags of the corpse.
    Each bit in the returned integer corresponds to a specific flag, allowing bitwise
    operations to check or manipulate individual flag states.
  examples:
  - title: Check if corpse is looted
    code: "if (corpse->GetCorpseDynamicFlags() & CORPSE_DYNFLAG_LOOTABLE)\n{\n   \
      \ // Corpse can be looted\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Log all dynamic flags
    code: 'int flags = corpse->GetCorpseDynamicFlags();

      LOG_INFO("server", "Corpse dynamic flags: {}", flags);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The dynamic flags are managed internally by the TrinityCore server and may
    change based on game events such as player looting or corpse despawning. Developers
    should not modify these flags directly through this method; instead, use appropriate
    setter methods or core functions.
  warnings: Do not assume that flag values are static across different server versions
    or patches. Always verify flag meanings against current TrinityCore source code
    or documentation to avoid unexpected behavior in custom modules.
