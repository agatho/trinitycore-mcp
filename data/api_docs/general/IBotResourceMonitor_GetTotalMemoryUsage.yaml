  method: GetTotalMemoryUsage
  signature: uint64 IBotResourceMonitor::GetTotalMemoryUsage() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total memory usage across all bot instances managed
    by the resource monitor.
  description: The GetTotalMemoryUsage method aggregates the memory consumption of
    all active bot instances under the supervision of the IBotResourceMonitor. This
    includes memory allocated for bot behavior trees, AI state data, internal buffers,
    and any associated resources. The returned value represents a cumulative count
    in bytes, providing insight into overall system resource utilization by bots.
    This method is typically used for performance monitoring, resource allocation
    decisions, or identifying potential memory leaks within the bot subsystem. It's
    important to note that the measurement may include overhead from memory management
    systems and could vary slightly between calls due to dynamic allocation patterns.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the total memory usage in bytes across all
    monitored bot instances. Returns zero if no bots are currently active or managed
    by the monitor.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Memory Usage Check
    code: 'uint64 totalMemory = sBotResourceMonitor->GetTotalMemoryUsage();

      TC_LOG_INFO("bot", "Total bot memory usage: {} KB", totalMemory / 1024);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Resource Usage Over Time
    code: 'uint64 initial = sBotResourceMonitor->GetTotalMemoryUsage();

      // ... perform bot operations ...

      uint64 final = sBotResourceMonitor->GetTotalMemoryUsage();

      TC_LOG_INFO("bot", "Memory delta: {} KB", (final - initial) / 1024);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a summation across all active bot instances, which may
    involve iterating through internal data structures. For systems with many bots,
    this operation could have a minor performance impact. The memory values returned
    are approximate and include both allocated and potentially reserved memory from
    the system's perspective.
  warnings: The returned value is not thread-safe and should not be relied upon for
    real-time resource management decisions without proper synchronization. Additionally,
    memory usage may fluctuate rapidly during bot activity, so repeated calls might
    yield different results even within short time intervals.
