  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: IsTargetContested
  signature: bool ObjectiveTracker::IsTargetContested(uint32 targetId, float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a target object is currently contested within a specified
    radius.
  description: The IsTargetContested method checks if a given target object is contested,
    meaning it is currently being contested for control by players or factions within
    the specified radius. This method is typically used in objective-based gameplay
    systems such as captures, battles, or contested zones where multiple parties may
    be vying for control of a specific target. The method evaluates the contest status
    based on player proximity and faction affiliations within the defined radius.
  parameters:
  - name: targetId
    description: The unique identifier of the target object to check for contested
      status. This typically corresponds to an object like a capture point, flag,
      or contested zone.
  - name: radius
    description: The radius in yards within which to search for players or factions
      contesting the target. Defines the area of influence for the contest evaluation.
  returns: Returns true if the target is currently contested by players or factions
    within the specified radius, otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (objectiveTracker->IsTargetContested(12345, 10.0f))\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ contested target logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Target is currently contested!\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Capture Point Logic
    code: "void UpdateCapturePoint(uint32 capturePointId)\n{\n    if (objectiveTracker->IsTargetContested(capturePointId,\
      \ 5.0f))\n    {\n        // Apply contested effects or update UI\n        UpdateContestedUI(capturePointId);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Target is not contested\n        ClearContestedEffects(capturePointId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks on player faction affiliations, proximity
    to the target, and current contest state. It may be used in conjunction with other
    objective tracking methods to manage dynamic gameplay elements such as contested
    zones or capture points.
  warnings: Ensure that the targetId corresponds to a valid object that supports contest
    evaluation. Invalid target IDs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
