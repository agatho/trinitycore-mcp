documentation:
  brief: Removes single-target auras that are not owned by the current unit
  description: This method removes all auras that target a single unit (such as charm,
    fear, or mind control effects) and are not owned by the current unit. It is typically
    used during phase changes to ensure proper aura management when switching between
    different game states or phases. The method operates on the principle that only
    auras owned by the unit itself should remain active, while non-owned single-target
    auras are cleared.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetAI()->GetUnit();

      unit->RemoveNotOwnSingleTargetAuras();

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with phase change logic to ensure
    proper aura cleanup during transitions between different game states. It may be
    called automatically during certain phase changes or manually when needed.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it can remove important auras
    that affect gameplay, particularly those related to control mechanics such as
    charm or fear effects. Improper usage could lead to loss of control over player
    characters or NPCs.
