  class: QuestCompletion
  method: HandleGroupObjectiveConflict
  signature: void QuestCompletion::HandleGroupObjectiveConflict(Group * group, uint32
    questId, uint32 objectiveIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Handles conflicts that arise when group members have conflicting quest objectives.
  description: The HandleGroupObjectiveConflict method resolves inconsistencies in
    quest progress among group members, particularly when individual players have
    completed different objectives within the same quest. This method ensures that
    group quest completion remains synchronized and prevents partial or conflicting
    progress states. It typically activates when a group member's objective completion
    conflicts with the overall group's quest state, such as when one player has completed
    an objective while others have not yet started it. The method may adjust quest
    tracking, update group members' progress, or notify players of the conflict requiring
    resolution.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players whose quest objectives
      are being checked for conflicts. Must be a valid group pointer; null pointers
      will cause undefined behavior.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest in which conflicting objectives
      have been detected. This ID must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: The index of the specific objective within the quest that has caused
      the conflict. Objectives are typically zero-indexed, and this value should reference
      a valid objective within the quest's structure.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group quest handling
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    QuestCompletion::HandleGroupObjectiveConflict(myGroup,\
      \ 12345, 2);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore quest system
    when group-based quest progress becomes inconsistent. Developers should ensure
    that all group members are properly synchronized before calling this method to
    avoid unexpected behavior or quest state corruption.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid parameters (e.g., null group pointer,
    non-existent quest ID, or out-of-bounds objective index) can lead to crashes or
    corrupted quest data. Always validate inputs before invoking this function.
