  class: ComplaintTicket
  method: GetTargetCharacterGuid
  signature: int ComplaintTicket::GetTargetCharacterGuid() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier of the target character associated with a
    complaint ticket.
  description: The GetTargetCharacterGuid method returns the globally unique identifier
    (GUID) of the player character that is the subject of a complaint ticket. This
    GUID is used internally by TrinityCore to uniquely identify players across the
    game world and is essential for linking complaints to specific user accounts.
    The method does not perform any validation on whether the target character actually
    exists or is online, as it simply retrieves the stored GUID value from the ticket's
    internal data structure. This identifier can be used in conjunction with other
    APIs to fetch detailed character information or to verify permissions when handling
    complaints.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the target character. This value is
    typically a positive integer that uniquely identifies the player character within
    the game world's database. A return value of zero may indicate an invalid or unset
    target character GUID, though this behavior depends on the implementation details
    of the ticket system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ComplaintTicket* ticket = sComplaintsMgr->GetTicketByGuid(ticketGuid);\n\
      if (ticket)\n{\n    int targetGuid = ticket->GetTargetCharacterGuid();\n   \
      \ if (targetGuid > 0)\n    {\n        // Use the GUID to retrieve character\
      \ information\n        Player* targetPlayer = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(MAKE_NEW_GUID(targetGuid,\
      \ 0, HIGHGUID_PLAYER));\n        if (targetPlayer)\n        {\n            //\
      \ Process the complaint against this player\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is marked as const, indicating it does not modify the state of
    the ComplaintTicket object. The returned GUID should be used carefully with appropriate
    validation checks to ensure it corresponds to a valid character in the game world.
    In TrinityCore's architecture, GUIDs are typically managed through the ObjectAccessor
    system and follow specific high GUID types for different object categories.
  warnings: This method only returns the stored GUID without verifying its validity
    or existence. Using the returned GUID directly in operations that require active
    players may result in null pointers if the character is not currently logged in
    or has been deleted. Always validate the GUID against actual game objects before
    performing operations on them.
