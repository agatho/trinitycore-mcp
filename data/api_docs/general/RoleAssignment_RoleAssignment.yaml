documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new RoleAssignment object with default values.
  description: The RoleAssignment constructor initializes a new instance of the RoleAssignment
    class. This method sets up the internal state of the role assignment object, typically
    initializing member variables to their default values or null states. In the context
    of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server implementation, this constructor is
    likely used when creating role assignment instances for players or game entities
    that require role-based permissions or responsibilities within the game world.
    The method ensures that all necessary internal data structures are properly allocated
    and initialized before the object can be used for role assignment operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new RoleAssignment instance
    code: 'RoleAssignment* assignment = new RoleAssignment();

      // The assignment object is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called implicitly when creating objects on
    the stack or explicitly when using dynamic allocation. Developers should be aware
    that this method may perform memory allocation and initialization operations that
    could impact performance in high-frequency scenarios.
