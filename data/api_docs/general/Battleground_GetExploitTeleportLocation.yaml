  class: Battleground
  method: GetExploitTeleportLocation
  signature: const WorldSafeLocsEntry * Battleground::GetExploitTeleportLocation(int
    param0)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the safe location entry for teleporting players who have exploited
    battleground mechanics.
  description: The GetExploitTeleportLocation method returns a pointer to a WorldSafeLocsEntry
    structure that defines the coordinates and map information for safely teleporting
    players who have triggered exploit-related events in a battleground. This typically
    occurs when a player performs an action that violates game rules, such as using
    client-side exploits or exploiting server-side bugs. The returned location is
    usually a designated safe zone within the battleground where the player can be
    teleported to prevent further disruption of gameplay. This method is part of TrinityCore's
    anti-exploit system and ensures that disruptive players are moved to a safe area
    without causing map or gameplay issues.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a WorldSafeLocsEntry structure containing the teleport location
    data, or nullptr if no valid exploit teleport location exists for this battleground.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in battleground event handling
    code: "void HandleExploitDetected(Battleground* bg, Player* player)\n{\n    const\
      \ WorldSafeLocsEntry* safeLoc = bg->GetExploitTeleportLocation(0);\n    if (safeLoc)\n\
      \    {\n        player->TeleportTo(safeLoc->map_id, safeLoc->x, safeLoc->y,\
      \ safeLoc->z, 0);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during anti-exploit checks and should only
    be called from within battleground context. The returned WorldSafeLocsEntry pointer
    must not be cached or stored as it may change between calls. Implementation relies
    on battleground-specific configuration data.
  warnings: Do not assume the returned pointer is always valid - always check for
    nullptr before using it. Improper handling of this method's return value can lead
    to crashes or incorrect teleportation behavior in battlegrounds.
