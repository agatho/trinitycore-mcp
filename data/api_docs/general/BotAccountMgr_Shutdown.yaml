documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the bot account manager system, cleaning up all active bot accounts
    and associated resources.
  description: The Shutdown method terminates the bot account manager functionality
    by gracefully closing all active bot accounts, releasing their associated memory
    and resources, and ensuring no lingering processes remain. This method is typically
    invoked during server shutdown or when disabling bot support to prevent resource
    leaks and ensure clean system state. It performs necessary cleanup operations
    such as saving account data, disconnecting bot characters, and clearing internal
    data structures related to bot management. The method does not accept any parameters
    and returns nothing upon completion.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: BotAccountMgr::instance()->Shutdown();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during server shutdown or when explicitly
    disabling bot functionality. Calling this method while bots are actively in use
    may result in unexpected behavior or data loss. The implementation assumes that
    all bot accounts have been properly disconnected before calling Shutdown.
