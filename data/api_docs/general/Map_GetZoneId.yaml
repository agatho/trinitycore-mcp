  class: Map
  method: GetZoneId
  signature: uint32 Map::GetZoneId(const PhaseShift & phaseShift, const Position &
    pos)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the zone identifier associated with a given phase shift and position.
  description: The GetZoneId method returns the unique zone identifier for a specific
    phase shift and position within the game world. This method is essential for determining
    which zone a player or object belongs to based on their current phase and location.
    It plays a crucial role in game mechanics such as zone-based content, quest tracking,
    and area triggers. The method considers both the phase shift and position parameters
    to accurately determine the zone ID, making it vital for proper game functionality
    and localization.
  parameters:
  - name: phaseShift
    description: The phase shift object that defines the current phase of the player
      or object. This determines which zone the object belongs to based on phase relationships.
  - name: pos
    description: The position object containing X, Y, Z coordinates that determine
      where in the world the zone ID is calculated. This helps identify the specific
      zone based on spatial location.
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the zone identifier (ID) of the current zone
    based on phase and position. The value will be 0 if no valid zone is found or
    if the object is not in a valid zone.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: uint32 zoneId = map->GetZoneId(phaseShift, pos);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example with error handling
    code: "if (zoneId != 0)\n{\n    // Process zone ID\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ invalid zone case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other zone-related methods
    to determine zone-based content or triggers. Performance considerations include
    the need to properly calculate phase shift and position values for accurate zone
    identification.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as incorrect phase shifts or
    positions can lead to invalid zone IDs. This method should not be used in contexts
    where precise positioning is critical.
