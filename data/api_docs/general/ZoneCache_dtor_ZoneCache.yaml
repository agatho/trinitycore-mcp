documentation:
  brief: Destroys the ZoneCache instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~ZoneCache destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    and resources allocated by the ZoneCache class. This method is automatically invoked
    when a ZoneCache object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures
    proper deallocation of internal data structures such as cached zone information,
    player tracking data, and any dynamically allocated memory. The destructor typically
    handles cleanup tasks like releasing references to game objects, clearing internal
    caches, and ensuring no memory leaks occur during the object's lifetime. This
    method does not take any parameters and performs no return operations.

  - title: Basic Destruction of ZoneCache
    code: 'ZoneCache* cache = new ZoneCache();

      // ... use the cache ...

      delete cache; // Triggers ~ZoneCache destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime when an object
    is destroyed, so explicit invocation is not required. Developers should ensure
    that no other objects hold references to the ZoneCache before it is destroyed
    to prevent dangling pointers.
