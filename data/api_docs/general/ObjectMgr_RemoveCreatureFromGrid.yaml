documentation:
  brief: Removes a creature from its grid cell in the world map
  description: The RemoveCreatureFromGrid method removes a creature object from the
    grid-based spatial partitioning system used by TrinityCore's world management.
    This function is typically called when a creature moves out of a grid cell's boundaries
    or is despawned from the game world. The method updates internal data structures
    to ensure that the creature is no longer referenced in its previous grid location,
    preventing memory leaks and maintaining consistency in the object manager's spatial
    indexing system. This operation is crucial for proper memory management and performance
    optimization in large-scale world instances.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an array of integers containing creature identification
      and grid position data. The array typically includes the creature's GUID, grid
      coordinates, and possibly other spatial metadata required for removal from the
      grid system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic creature removal from grid
    code: 'int creatureData[3] = {12345, 10, 15}; // GUID, X grid coord, Y grid coord

      ObjectMgr::instance()->RemoveCreatureFromGrid(creatureData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's internal grid management system and
    should only be called by the ObjectMgr or related subsystems. The data parameter
    must contain valid grid coordinates and creature identifiers to prevent undefined
    behavior. Performance-wise, this operation is optimized for frequent calls during
    creature movement updates.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or uninitialized data can cause memory
    corruption or crashes. Always ensure that the creature has been properly removed
    from all relevant systems before calling this function. This method does not perform
    any validation of the provided data, so callers must guarantee data integrity.
