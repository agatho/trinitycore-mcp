  class: InterruptRotationManager
  method: RegisterInterrupter
  signature: void InterruptRotationManager::RegisterInterrupter(int bot, uint32 interruptSpellId,
    uint32 range)
documentation:
  brief: Registers an interrupter for a bot with specified spell ID and range.
  description: The RegisterInterrupter method adds a new interrupt capability to a
    bot's rotation manager, allowing it to interrupt enemy casters within a defined
    range using a specific spell. This functionality is crucial for managing threat
    and preventing enemy spells from completing during combat scenarios. The method
    stores the interrupt spell ID and range for later use in decision-making logic
    during the bot's AI execution cycle. It does not validate whether the spell ID
    is actually an interrupt spell or if the range is valid, so callers should ensure
    proper parameters are provided.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: The identifier of the bot that will use this interrupter. This typically
      represents a player character in the game world.
  - name: interruptSpellId
    description: The Spell ID of the interrupt spell to be used by the bot. This should
      correspond to a valid interrupt spell in the game's spell database.
  - name: range
    description: The maximum range (in yards) within which the bot can interrupt enemy
      casters. Defines how far away an enemy must be for the interrupt to be considered.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupter Registration
    code: 'InterruptRotationManager* irm = ...;

      irm->RegisterInterrupter(12345, 2139, 8);

      // Registers a bot with ID 12345 to interrupt enemies within 8 yards using spell
      ID 2139 (Counterspell)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Interrupters for Different Spells
    code: 'InterruptRotationManager* irm = ...;

      irm->RegisterInterrupter(54321, 47528, 10); // Spell ID 47528: Mind Freeze

      irm->RegisterInterrupter(54321, 1766, 5);   // Spell ID 1766: Kick'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely stores interrupter data in an internal map or list associated
    with the bot. The actual interrupting behavior is probably handled by a separate
    method that checks this registered data during combat decisions. Performance-wise,
    frequent registration calls may cause overhead if not batched.
  warnings: Ensure that interruptSpellId corresponds to a valid interrupt spell; otherwise,
    the bot will attempt to cast an invalid spell which could result in errors or
    unexpected behavior. The range parameter should be reasonable for the intended
    use case to avoid performance issues or unrealistic AI behavior.
