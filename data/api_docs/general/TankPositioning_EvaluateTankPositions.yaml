  class: TankPositioning
  method: EvaluateTankPositions
  signature: int TankPositioning::EvaluateTankPositions(const int & candidates, const
    CombatPositionContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the optimal tank positioning strategy based on combat
    context and candidate positions.
  description: The EvaluateTankPositions method determines the best positioning strategy
    for a tank character within a combat scenario. It analyzes the provided candidates
    and contextual combat data to compute an optimal position that maximizes survivability
    or damage output, depending on the configured role. The method considers factors
    such as threat distribution, enemy positioning, and available terrain features.
    This function is typically used in AI-driven combat decision-making systems for
    tank characters in TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft environments.
  parameters:
  - name: candidates
    description: An integer representing the number of candidate positions to evaluate
      for optimal tank placement. Valid values are positive integers indicating the
      count of potential positions.
  - name: context
    description: A CombatPositionContext object containing detailed information about
      the current combat situation, including enemy locations, threat levels, and
      environmental factors that influence positioning decisions.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the index of the best evaluated tank
    position among the candidates. A return value of -1 indicates an error or invalid
    input, while any non-negative integer corresponds to a valid candidate position
    index.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int result = tankPositioning.EvaluateTankPositions(5, combatContext);\n\
      if (result >= 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Best position index: \" << result <<\
      \ std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"Error evaluating positions.\" <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with context preparation
    code: "CombatPositionContext ctx;\nctx.enemyPositions = {Position(10, 20), Position(30,\
      \ 40)};\nctx.threatLevels = {50, 75};\nctx.terrainFeatures = {TerrainFeature::HighGround,\
      \ TerrainFeature::LowGround};\n\nint bestPosition = tankPositioning.EvaluateTankPositions(3,\
      \ ctx);\nif (bestPosition >= 0) {\n    // Apply the recommended position to\
      \ the tank's movement logic\n    tank->SetPosition(ctx.candidatePositions[bestPosition]);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the CombatPositionContext is properly initialized
    with valid data before calling. The candidates parameter should be carefully managed
    to avoid excessive computational overhead during evaluation. Performance can be
    affected by the number of candidate positions and complexity of context data.
  warnings: Ensure that the candidates integer does not exceed predefined limits to
    prevent buffer overflows or excessive memory usage. Passing invalid or uninitialized
    CombatPositionContext objects may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
