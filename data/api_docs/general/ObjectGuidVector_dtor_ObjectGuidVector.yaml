documentation:
  brief: Destroys an ObjectGuidVector instance and releases all associated memory.
  description: The destructor for the ObjectGuidVector class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory used by the vector. This method is automatically
    invoked when an ObjectGuidVector object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, ObjectGuidVector
    is typically used to manage collections of ObjectGuid values, which represent
    unique identifiers for game objects such as players, creatures, items, and game
    objects. The destructor ensures proper cleanup of these identifiers without memory
    leaks.

  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of ObjectGuidVector
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    ObjectGuidVector guidVector;\n    // ... populate\
      \ guidVector with data ...\n    // Destructor automatically called here when\
      \ guidVector goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and does not need
    to be manually invoked. It's important to note that ObjectGuidVector likely inherits
    from or uses standard container types (such as std::vector) internally, so its
    destruction behavior follows standard C++ RAII principles.
