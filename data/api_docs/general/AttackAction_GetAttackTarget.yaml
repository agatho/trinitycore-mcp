  method: GetAttackTarget
  signature: ::Unit * AttackAction::GetAttackTarget(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current attack target of the bot's unit.
  description: The GetAttackTarget method returns a pointer to the Unit object that
    the bot's unit is currently attacking or targeting. This method is typically used
    within AI logic to determine what enemy unit the bot should focus on. The returned
    Unit pointer may be null if the bot has no active target, which can happen when
    the bot is idle or when all targets have been defeated. In the context of TrinityCore's
    AI system, this method provides access to the core targeting mechanism that drives
    combat behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the ::Unit object representing the current attack target,
    or nullptr if no target is currently selected.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (Unit* target = attackAction.GetAttackTarget(ai)) {\n    // Bot has\
      \ a target, proceed with combat actions\n    ai->GetBot()->Attack(target);\n\
      } else {\n    // No target, find a new one\n    ai->SetNextTarget(ai->GetNearbyEnemy());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state of the bot's AI system and may return
    different results depending on the current AI decision-making process. The returned
    Unit pointer is only valid while the target unit exists and is in the same map
    instance.
  warnings: Be sure to check for null returns before dereferencing the returned Unit
    pointer, as attempting to use a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Also note that the target may change between calls if the AI re-evaluates targets
    based on combat conditions.
