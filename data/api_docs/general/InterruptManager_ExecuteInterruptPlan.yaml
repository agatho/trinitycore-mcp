  class: InterruptManager
  method: ExecuteInterruptPlan
  signature: bool InterruptManager::ExecuteInterruptPlan(const InterruptPlan & plan)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a stored interrupt plan for handling spell or ability interruptions
    in the game.
  description: The ExecuteInterruptPlan method processes and applies an interrupt
    plan that defines how a spell or ability should be interrupted under specific
    conditions. This method is typically used within the context of AI behavior trees
    or combat logic to manage when and how interrupts occur during gameplay. It evaluates
    the provided interrupt plan against current game state conditions and performs
    necessary actions such as stopping ongoing spells, resetting cooldowns, or triggering
    related events. The method ensures proper synchronization with the game's core
    systems to maintain consistency in spell interruption mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the interrupt plan was successfully executed and all associated
    actions were completed without errors; returns false if execution failed due to
    invalid plan data, missing dependencies, or system constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupt Plan Execution
    code: "InterruptPlan plan;\nplan.SetSpellId(12345);\nplan.SetInterruptType(INTERRUPT_TYPE_SPELL);\n\
      bool success = interruptManager.ExecuteInterruptPlan(plan);\nif (success)\n\
      {\n    // Handle successful interruption\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the context of TrinityCore's AI and combat systems.
    It requires that all referenced spell IDs exist in the database and that proper
    game state conditions are met for interruption to occur. The method may perform
    blocking operations during execution, so it should be called from appropriate
    threads or contexts to avoid performance issues.
  warnings: Calling this method without properly initializing the interrupt plan can
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure all required fields in the InterruptPlan
    are populated before calling this method. Avoid calling from high-frequency update
    loops as it may impact performance.
