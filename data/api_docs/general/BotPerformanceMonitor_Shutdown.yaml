documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the bot performance monitoring system and releases all associated
    resources.
  description: The Shutdown method terminates the bot performance monitoring functionality
    within the TrinityCore server environment. It ensures that all active monitoring
    threads are properly stopped, any ongoing performance data collection is halted,
    and all allocated memory and system resources used by the BotPerformanceMonitor
    are released. This method should be called during server shutdown or when deactivating
    the bot monitoring system to prevent resource leaks and ensure clean system state.
    The method performs no operations if the monitor is not currently active.

  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically during server shutdown sequences.
    It's important to ensure that no bot-related operations are actively running when
    this method is called to avoid potential race conditions or data corruption.
