  signature: int ScheduledChangeAI::Permissible(const int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the permissiveness level of the AI for a given creature
  description: The Permissible method is used to evaluate whether the ScheduledChangeAI
    class can be applied to a specific creature. It returns an integer value indicating
    the level of permissiveness, which typically determines if the AI should be allowed
    to take control of the creature. In TrinityCore's AI system, this method is part
    of the AI selection process where different AI types may have varying levels of
    permissiveness based on creature type or other conditions. The return value usually
    follows a standard convention where higher values indicate greater willingness
    to use the AI.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the creature's entry ID or type
      identifier used for permissiveness evaluation
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the permissiveness level. Positive
    values typically indicate willingness to use this AI, with higher values suggesting
    stronger preference. Zero usually means the AI is not suitable, and negative values
    may indicate strong disapproval or incompatibility.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Permissible Check
    code: "int result = ai->Permissible(&creatureEntry);\nif (result > 0) {\n    //\
      \ AI can be used for this creature\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI initialization or assignment. The
    exact meaning of return values may vary depending on the specific AI implementation
    and game context. It's important to note that permissiveness levels are often
    compared against other AI implementations to determine which one should be selected.
  warnings: Incorrect interpretation of return values can lead to AI selection issues.
    Developers should ensure they understand the expected range and meaning of these
    values before implementing custom AI logic.
