  brief: Moves the resource ownership of an RBACPermission object to another RBACPermission
    object.
  description: The RBACPermission move constructor transfers all resources from the
    source RBACPermission object (passed as an rvalue reference) to the current object.
    This operation is typically used to efficiently transfer ownership of internal
    data structures without performing deep copies. After the move, the source object
    is left in a valid but unspecified state, meaning it should not be used for further
    operations unless reassigned. This constructor is part of the C++ move semantics
    implementation and is commonly used in containers or when passing objects by value
    in performance-critical code paths within the TrinityCore framework.

  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing an RBACPermission Object
    code: 'RBACPermission perm1;

      // ... initialize perm1 ...

      RBACPermission perm2 = std::move(perm1); // Move construct perm2 from perm1

      // perm1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor leverages C++ move semantics to avoid expensive copy operations.
    It's important to understand that after moving, the source object should not be
    accessed unless it is subsequently assigned or reassigned. The implementation
    assumes that the moved-from object is in a valid state for destruction.
  warnings: Do not use the source object after moving it; doing so results in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that any pointers or references to the moved object are not used
    post-move unless explicitly reinitialized.
