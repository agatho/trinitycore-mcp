  class: DeathKnightAI
  method: RecordAbilityUsage
  signature: void DeathKnightAI::RecordAbilityUsage(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Records the usage of a specified Death Knight ability by storing its spell
    ID for tracking purposes.
  description: The RecordAbilityUsage method is used within the DeathKnightAI class
    to log when a specific Death Knight ability (spell) has been utilized. This functionality
    allows for tracking and analysis of ability usage patterns, which can be important
    for performance monitoring, balancing adjustments, or implementing cooldown systems.
    The method takes a spell ID as input and stores it internally, likely for later
    retrieval or reporting. It is typically called when an ability is successfully
    cast or activated during combat. No explicit preconditions are required, but the
    spell ID should correspond to a valid Death Knight spell within the game's database.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the Death Knight spell being recorded.
      This value must match a valid spell entry in the TrinityCore database that corresponds
      to a Death Knight ability.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void MyDeathKnightAI::OnSpellCast(SpellInfo const* spellInfo)\n{\n    if\
      \ (spellInfo->Id == 47541) // Death Coil\n    {\n        RecordAbilityUsage(spellInfo->Id);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger tracking system for Death Knight abilities
    and may interact with internal data structures such as ability cooldowns or usage
    counters. It does not perform any direct spell effects; it only records the event.
