documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the NPC has a valid flight path node available for interaction.
  description: The HasFlightPath method determines if the current NPC interaction
    manager instance has a flight path associated with the specified node ID. This
    functionality is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to verify if
    an NPC can provide flight services or if a specific flight point is accessible
    to the player. The method performs a lookup within the internal flight path data
    structures and returns true if a valid flight path exists for the given node,
    otherwise false. It is commonly called during NPC dialogue or flight master interactions
    to determine what options should be presented to the player.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified node ID corresponds to a valid flight path
    that can be accessed by the player; returns false otherwise. A return value of
    false may indicate that the node does not exist, is not yet unlocked for the player,
    or is not part of the current flight network.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Flight Path Check
    code: "if (npcInteractionManager.HasFlightPath(12345)) {\n    // Player can access\
      \ flight path from node 12345\n    player->SendFlightPathList();\n} else {\n\
      \    // No flight path available for this node\n    player->SendNoFlightPath();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal flight path data structures and may involve
    database lookups or cached data. Performance is generally good as it uses optimized
    lookup mechanisms, but frequent calls in tight loops should be avoided. The method
    assumes that the NPCInteractionManager instance has been properly initialized
    with valid NPC context.
  warnings: Ensure that the node ID passed to this method corresponds to an actual
    flight path node defined in the game's database. Passing invalid or non-existent
    node IDs may result in unexpected behavior or false negatives. This method should
    only be called when the NPC interaction context is valid and the player has appropriate
    access rights.
