documentation:
  brief: Destroys a PvPCombatAI instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the PvPCombatAI class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used by the AI instance.
    This method ensures proper deallocation of internal data structures, such as behavior
    trees, action queues, or cached target information, when a PvPCombatAI object
    is no longer needed. It is automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted. The destructor does not take any parameters and performs
    no return operations. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this method plays
    a crucial role in preventing memory leaks during combat AI lifecycle management.

  - title: Basic Destruction of PvPCombatAI
    code: 'PvPCombatAI* ai = new PvPCombatAI();

      // ... use the AI object ...

      delete ai; // Triggers ~PvPCombatAI() destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime when an object
    is destroyed. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. The destructor ensures that all internal AI
    state is properly cleaned up, including any pointers or references to game objects.
