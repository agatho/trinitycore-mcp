documentation:
  brief: Notifies the movement generator that a point movement has been completed
  description: The MovementInform method is called when a point-based movement has
    finished executing. This method is typically invoked by the AI system or movement
    manager to signal that a creature or unit has reached its designated destination
    point. It serves as a callback mechanism for handling post-movement logic, such
    as triggering additional actions, transitioning to a new state, or notifying other
    systems about the completion of the movement sequence. The method does not take
    any parameters and is used primarily for event-driven communication within the
    TrinityCore AI framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Movement Inform Usage
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void MovementInform(uint32\
      \ type, uint32 id) override {\n        if (type == POINT_MOTION_TYPE && id ==\
      \ 1)\n            DoSomethingAfterMovement();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the movement generator pattern in TrinityCore's AI
    system. It should be overridden by derived classes to implement custom behavior
    upon movement completion. The method is typically called from within the movement
    update loop or when a pathfinding operation concludes.
  warnings: Ensure that any logic implemented in MovementInform does not block the
    main thread, as this can cause performance issues. Also, verify that the movement
    type and ID parameters match expected values to prevent unexpected behavior.
