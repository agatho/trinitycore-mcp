  signature: uint32 ManaHolyPowerResource::GetAvailable() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current available mana or holy power amount for the resource.
  description: The GetAvailable method retrieves the current value of the mana or
    holy power resource. This value represents how much of the resource is currently
    accessible to the player or unit. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    this method is typically used to determine the available resource before spending
    it on abilities or spells. The returned value is usually a uint32 representing
    the quantity of mana or holy power points that can be consumed.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current amount of mana or holy power available
    for use. This value will be zero if no resources are available, or it will reflect
    the actual resource count if resources are present.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Available Mana
    code: "uint32 availableMana = player->GetPower(POWER_MANA);\nif (availableMana\
      \ >= 100)\n{\n    // Player can cast a spell requiring 100 mana\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Available Holy Power for Divine Storm
    code: "Unit* target = GetVictim();\nif (target && player->GetPower(POWER_HOLY_POWER)\
      \ >= 3)\n{\n    // Cast Divine Storm which consumes 3 holy power\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ 184575, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with resource spending operations
    to validate whether a unit has sufficient resources before performing actions.
    It's important to note that the returned value may change between the time of
    calling this method and when the resource is actually consumed, especially in
    multi-threaded environments or during complex spell sequences.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in conditions where the resource might
    be modified by other systems (e.g., during combat or spell effects). The value
    returned should not be assumed to remain constant between calls, as external factors
    can modify the resource amount.
