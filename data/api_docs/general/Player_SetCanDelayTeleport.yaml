  class: Player
  method: SetCanDelayTeleport
  signature: void Player::SetCanDelayTeleport(bool setting)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the player can delay teleportation events.
  description: This method controls whether a player's teleportation actions can be
    delayed or interrupted. When enabled, teleportation events may be postponed under
    certain conditions such as combat or specific game mechanics. This is typically
    used to prevent unwanted teleports during critical gameplay moments. The setting
    affects the internal teleportation state management within the Player class and
    influences how teleportation requests are processed by the game engine.
  parameters:
  - name: setting
    description: Boolean value indicating whether teleport delays should be allowed.
      True enables delay capability, false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable teleport delay for a player
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->SetCanDelayTeleport(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable teleport delay during combat
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nif (player->IsInCombat()) {\n    player->SetCanDelayTeleport(false);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal player state flags that affect teleportation
    behavior. It's commonly used in conjunction with combat state management and quest
    triggers to ensure appropriate teleportation timing during gameplay events.
  warnings: Changing this setting during active teleportation sequences may result
    in undefined behavior or immediate teleportation regardless of the delay setting.
