  class: LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter
  method: SetMaxBots
  signature: void LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter::SetMaxBots(uint32 maxBots)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum number of bots that can be spawned by the legacy bot spawner
    adapter.
  description: The SetMaxBots method configures the upper limit for the number of
    bots that the LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter instance is allowed to create and manage.
    This method is typically used during initialization or configuration phases to
    define how many virtual players (bots) can exist within a given context, such
    as in a test environment or bot-controlled scenario. The value set here directly
    influences the behavior of bot spawning operations and may affect system resource
    allocation. It's important to note that this setting does not immediately affect
    already spawned bots; it only controls future spawning attempts.
  parameters:
  - name: maxBots
    description: The maximum number of bots allowed to be spawned by this adapter
      instance. Must be a non-negative integer value representing the upper bound
      for bot count.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Bot Count
    code: 'LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter adapter;

      adapter.SetMaxBots(50);

      // This configures the adapter to allow up to 50 bots to be spawned.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Bot Limit Adjustment
    code: 'LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter* spawner = GetBotSpawner();

      spawner->SetMaxBots(100);

      // Adjusts the maximum bot count dynamically during runtime.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates an internal member variable that tracks the maximum
    allowed bot count. It may also trigger validation or recalculation of internal
    data structures related to bot management, though the exact implementation details
    are not provided in the source code.
  warnings: Modifying the maximum bot count while bots are actively spawning or running
    might lead to inconsistent behavior or resource issues if not handled carefully.
    Ensure that any changes to this value are made before starting new bot operations.
