  class: MoveSpline
  method: Velocity
  signature: float MoveSpline::Velocity() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current velocity of the spline movement.
  description: The Velocity method calculates and returns the instantaneous velocity
    of a MoveSpline object, which represents the speed at which a unit is moving along
    a defined spline path. This value is typically used in movement calculations for
    NPCs, players, or game objects that follow complex paths. The returned velocity
    is usually expressed in yards per second, reflecting the real-time movement speed
    of the entity. This method is particularly useful for determining how fast an
    object is traveling at any given moment during spline-based movement operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current velocity of the spline movement
    in yards per second. The value is always non-negative, with 0 indicating a stationary
    state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Velocity Check
    code: "MoveSpline* spline = unit->movespline;\nfloat currentVelocity = spline->Velocity();\n\
      if (currentVelocity > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Unit is currently moving\n    printf(\"\
      Moving at %.2f yards/second\\n\", currentVelocity);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Velocity-Based Movement Logic
    code: "MoveSpline* spline = unit->movespline;\nfloat velocity = spline->Velocity();\n\
      if (velocity < 1.0f)\n{\n    // Slow movement detected, possibly trigger animation\
      \ or state change\n    unit->SetWalk(true);\n}\nelse if (velocity > 5.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Fast movement detected, possibly trigger run animation\n    unit->SetRun(true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spline calculations and may return different
    values during various stages of movement (start, middle, end). The velocity is
    computed based on the current spline segment and time elapsed since the last update.
    For accurate results, ensure that the MoveSpline object is properly initialized
    and actively updating.
  warnings: The returned velocity value can be zero even when a unit appears to be
    moving if the movement is being calculated in a way that doesn't reflect actual
    motion (e.g., during pathfinding or teleportation). Avoid relying solely on this
    value for complex movement logic without considering other movement states.
