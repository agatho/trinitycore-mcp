  method: PlayerNotFoundAppend
  signature: void PlayerNotFoundAppend::PlayerNotFoundAppend(const std::string & playerName)
documentation:
  brief: Appends a player name to the list of not found players.
  description: The PlayerNotFoundAppend method is used to add a specified player name
    to an internal collection or list that tracks players who were not found during
    lookup operations. This functionality is typically utilized in systems where player
    lookups may fail, such as when processing commands or events related to non-existent
    characters. The method does not perform any validation on the input name and simply
    stores it for potential later use, such as logging, reporting, or batch processing
    of failed lookups. It's commonly part of a larger system that manages player-related
    data and handles cases where expected players do not exist in the database or
    are otherwise inaccessible.
  parameters:
  - name: playerName
    description: The name of the player to append to the not found list. This should
      be a valid string representing a character name, typically following World of
      Warcraft naming conventions (1-12 characters, alphanumeric and underscore allowed).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PlayerNotFoundAppend appendHandler;

      appendHandler.PlayerNotFoundAppend("Shadowmoon");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Command Handler Context
    code: "void HandleFindPlayerCommand(ChatHandler* handler, const std::string& playerName)\n\
      {\n    if (!sObjectMgr->GetPlayerByName(playerName))\n    {\n        PlayerNotFoundAppend\
      \ appendHandler;\n        appendHandler.PlayerNotFoundAppend(playerName);\n\
      \        handler->PSendSysMessage(\"Player '%s' not found.\", playerName.c_str());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system that tracks failed player lookups.
    The internal storage mechanism for the list of not found players should be thread-safe
    if used in multi-threaded environments such as those common in TrinityCore's server
    architecture. Consider performance implications when appending many names to this
    list, especially during bulk operations.
  warnings: Ensure that playerName is properly sanitized or validated before calling
    this method to avoid potential issues with malformed data. If the internal storage
    mechanism is not thread-safe, concurrent access from multiple threads may lead
    to undefined behavior or data corruption.
