  class: MLPerformanceTracker
  method: AnalyzePerformanceTrends
  signature: void MLPerformanceTracker::AnalyzePerformanceTrends()
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes performance trends collected by the MLPerformanceTracker to identify
    patterns and anomalies in system behavior.
  description: The AnalyzePerformanceTrends method processes historical performance
    data gathered by the MLPerformanceTracker class. It evaluates metrics such as
    CPU usage, memory consumption, and frame rates over time to detect trends, outliers,
    and potential performance bottlenecks. This analysis is crucial for optimizing
    game performance and identifying issues that may affect player experience. The
    method typically runs periodically or upon request to provide insights into system
    behavior and helps inform decisions related to resource allocation and performance
    tuning.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MLPerformanceTracker tracker;

      tracker.AnalyzePerformanceTrends();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve computationally intensive operations that could impact
    performance if called too frequently. It's recommended to schedule this analysis
    during low-activity periods or as a background task.
  warnings: The method assumes that performance data has been properly collected and
    stored prior to execution. Calling it without sufficient historical data may produce
    unreliable results or trigger unexpected behavior.
