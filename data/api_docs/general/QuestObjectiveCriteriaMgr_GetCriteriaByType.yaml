    asset) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the criteria value associated with a specific quest objective type
    and asset.
  description: The GetCriteriaByType method fetches the criteria value linked to a
    given quest objective type and asset identifier. This is used internally by the
    TrinityCore framework to manage quest progress tracking, particularly for objectives
    that require specific conditions or assets to be met. The method operates on a
    cached or stored mapping of criteria data and returns a constant reference to
    an integer representing the criteria value. It's typically invoked during quest
    update checks or when evaluating whether a player has fulfilled a particular objective
    condition.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: An integer identifier representing the type of quest objective (e.g.,
      kill, collect, interact). Valid values are defined by the game's internal quest
      objective system.
  - name: asset
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific asset related to the
      quest objective (e.g., creature entry ID, item ID, or zone ID). The meaning
      of this value depends on the objective type specified.
  returns: A constant reference to an integer that represents the criteria value associated
    with the given objective type and asset. This value is typically used in quest
    progression logic to determine if a player's actions meet the required conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve criteria for killing a specific creature
    code: int criteriaValue = questObjectiveCriteriaMgr.GetCriteriaByType(QUEST_OBJECTIVE_KILL_CREATURE,
      12345); // Returns criteria value for killing creature with entry ID 12345
    language: cpp
  - title: Check criteria for collecting a specific item
    code: const int& criteria = questObjectiveCriteriaMgr.GetCriteriaByType(QUEST_OBJECTIVE_COLLECT_ITEM,
      67890); // Retrieves criteria value for collecting item with entry ID 67890
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the internal data structures containing criteria
    mappings are properly initialized before calling. It is designed to be thread-safe
    as part of the core quest management system, but performance may vary depending
    on how frequently it's called during quest updates.
  warnings: Ensure that both 'type' and 'asset' parameters are valid identifiers recognized
    by the game's quest objective system; invalid inputs may lead to unexpected behavior
    or incorrect quest progression. This method returns a reference to an internal
    value, so modifying the returned value directly is not recommended.
