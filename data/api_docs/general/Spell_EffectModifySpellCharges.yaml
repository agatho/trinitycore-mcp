documentation:
  brief: Modifies spell charges for the current spell instance
  description: This method adjusts the charge count of the spell being executed, typically
    used in conjunction with spell effects that modify charge requirements or usage.
    It allows developers to dynamically alter the number of charges available for
    a spell, which can affect gameplay mechanics such as cooldowns, resource consumption,
    and spell activation behavior. The method operates on the current spell instance
    and modifies its charge parameters without affecting other spells or their charges.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Charge Modification Example
    code: "void Spell::EffectModifySpellCharges()\n{\n    // Modify the current spell's\
      \ charge count\n    // Implementation details depend on specific spell effects\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details may vary depending on how the spell effect is defined
    in the spell database. This method should be called only when the spell instance
    is active and valid. Performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary calls
    during spell processing.
