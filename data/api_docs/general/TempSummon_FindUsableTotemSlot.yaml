documentation:
  brief: Finds the first available totem slot for the summoner
  description: This method searches through the summoner's totem slots to locate an
    unused or expired slot. It is used internally by the game engine to determine
    where a new totem can be placed. The method iterates through the totem slots and
    returns the index of the first slot that is either empty or contains an expired
    totem. If all slots are occupied by active totems, it returns -1 indicating no
    usable slot is available. This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper
    totem placement and ensuring that players can summon new totems without overwriting
    existing ones unnecessarily.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a std::ptrdiff_t representing the index of the first usable totem
    slot. Returns -1 if no usable slot is found, indicating all slots are occupied
    by active totems.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find an available totem slot
    code: "TempSummon* summon = ...; // Get a reference to a temporary summon\nstd::ptrdiff_t\
      \ slotIndex = summon->FindUsableTotemSlot(nullptr);\nif (slotIndex != -1)\n\
      {\n    // A usable slot was found at index 'slotIndex'\n    // Proceed with\
      \ totem placement logic\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No available slots, handle accordingly\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the summoner's totem slots are managed through an
    internal array or container. The implementation likely checks for both empty slots
    and expired totems to determine usability. This method is typically called during
    totem summoning processes before placing a new totem.
  warnings: This method may not be thread-safe if multiple threads access the same
    summoner's totem slots simultaneously. Care should be taken when calling this
    method in concurrent environments. Additionally, the return value of -1 indicates
    no available slot, which might require special handling in game logic to prevent
    summoning failures.
