documentation:
  brief: Destroys a GuildIntegration instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the GuildIntegration class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the guild integration
    object. This method is automatically invoked when a GuildIntegration object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures proper resource deallocation
    and prevents memory leaks within the TrinityCore framework's guild management
    system. The destructor typically handles cleanup of internal data structures,
    cached guild information, and any temporary allocations used during guild-related
    operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of GuildIntegration object
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    GuildIntegration integration;\n    // ... use\
      \ integration ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when integration goes\
      \ out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of GuildIntegration pointer
    code: 'GuildIntegration* integration = new GuildIntegration();

      // ... use integration ...

      delete integration; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a critical part of the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
    pattern in C++. It ensures that all resources associated with a GuildIntegration
    object are properly released when the object is destroyed. Developers should not
    manually call this destructor unless explicitly managing memory through raw pointers.
  warnings: Do not call this destructor directly unless you're explicitly managing
    memory with raw pointers. The destructor should only be invoked automatically
    by the C++ runtime during object destruction. Calling it manually can lead to
    undefined behavior or double-free errors.
