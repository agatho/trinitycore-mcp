  class: TargetManager
  method: TargetManager
  signature: void TargetManager::TargetManager(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a TargetManager instance for the specified player bot.
  description: The TargetManager constructor initializes internal target tracking
    structures for a given player bot. This method sets up the necessary data structures
    and state required for managing combat targets, looting targets, and other target-related
    functionality within the TrinityCore framework. The initialization process typically
    involves setting up target lists, clearing existing targets, and preparing the
    manager to handle target-related operations for the specified player character.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that this TargetManager
      will manage targets for. Must be a valid player instance, typically a controlled
      AI player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic TargetManager Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player

      TargetManager targetManager(myBot);

      // The target manager is now initialized and ready to manage targets for myBot'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during the creation or initialization
    phase of an AI bot. It's important that the Player pointer passed is valid and
    represents a controlled character, as invalid pointers can lead to undefined behavior.
    The TargetManager may perform internal setup operations such as initializing target
    tracking lists and resetting target states.
