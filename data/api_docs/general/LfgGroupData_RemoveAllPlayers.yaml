documentation:
  brief: Removes all players from the LFG group data container.
  description: The RemoveAllPlayers method clears all player entries from the LfgGroupData
    object, effectively resetting the group's player list. This method is typically
    used when a group is disbanded or when all members need to be removed from the
    LFG system. The operation is performed in a single call and does not return any
    value. It is important to note that this method directly modifies the internal
    state of the LfgGroupData object, so it should only be called when the group's
    player list is no longer needed or when preparing for a new group composition.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LfgGroupData groupData;

      // ... add players to groupData ...

      groupData.RemoveAllPlayers(); // Removes all players from the group'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly manipulates the internal player list of the LfgGroupData
    object. It is recommended to verify that no other systems are actively using the
    group data before calling this method to prevent potential dangling references
    or unexpected behavior.
