  brief: Checks whether the instance lock has been extended beyond its original duration.
  description: The IsExtended method determines if an instance lock has been prolonged
    past its initial expiration time. This functionality is typically used in World
    of Warcraft's instance management system to handle extended dungeon or raid locks,
    such as those created when players use certain items or complete specific objectives
    that extend their lock duration. The method returns a boolean value indicating
    the current state of the lock extension.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the instance lock has been extended beyond its original
    duration; otherwise returns false.

  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with instance lock management
    systems to determine if a player's access to an instance has been prolonged. It
    may be called during various game events such as when checking player permissions
    or when handling instance reset timers.
