  method: OnCombatStart
  signature: void WarlockAI::OnCombatStart(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes combat behavior for a warlock unit when entering combat with
    a target.
  description: The OnCombatStart method is invoked when a WarlockAI-controlled unit
    enters combat mode. This method initializes the AI's combat behavior, typically
    setting up initial spell casting patterns, targeting logic, and combat state management.
    It is called automatically by the TrinityCore framework when the unit's combat
    state transitions to active. The method prepares the warlock for engaging in combat
    with the specified target, potentially configuring abilities like summoning pets,
    initiating aura application, or starting a combat rotation sequence.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that the warlock is beginning combat with.
      This represents the enemy unit that triggered the combat start event.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Custom Warlock AI
    code: "class MyWarlockAI : public WarlockAI {\npublic:\n    void OnCombatStart(Unit*\
      \ target) override {\n        // Call base implementation\n        WarlockAI::OnCombatStart(target);\n\
      \        \n        // Custom combat initialization logic\n        if (target)\n\
      \            DoCast(target, SPELL_SHADOW_BOLT);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI's initialization phase when
    entering combat. It should not be called manually unless implementing custom behavior
    that requires explicit reinitialization of combat state.
