  method: OnCombatStart
  signature: void PlayerbotGroupManager::OnCombatStart(uint32 groupId, int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the start of combat for a specified group in the playerbot system
  description: The OnCombatStart method is invoked when a player bot group enters
    combat mode. It initializes combat-related behaviors and strategies for the group,
    setting up target selection logic and combat state management. This method typically
    gets called by the core game loop or combat detection systems when enemy engagement
    occurs. The method ensures that all bots within the specified group begin executing
    their combat routines and maintain proper targeting behavior during active combat
    situations.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: Unique identifier for the player bot group that has entered combat.
      This ID corresponds to a specific group managed by the PlayerbotGroupManager.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the initial target for the group's
      combat actions. May be NULL if no initial target is specified or if target selection
      should be deferred.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic combat start handling
    code: "void example() {\n    PlayerbotGroupManager* groupMgr = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetGroupManager();\n\
      \    int targetId = 12345;\n    groupMgr->OnCombatStart(1, &targetId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat start with null target
    code: "void example() {\n    PlayerbotGroupManager* groupMgr = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetGroupManager();\n\
      \    groupMgr->OnCombatStart(2, nullptr);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore playerbot AI
    system when combat state transitions occur. The implementation should handle group
    synchronization and ensure all bots in the group are properly initialized for
    combat behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that groupId corresponds to an existing group managed by PlayerbotGroupManager,
    otherwise undefined behavior may occur. The target pointer must be valid if not
    null.
