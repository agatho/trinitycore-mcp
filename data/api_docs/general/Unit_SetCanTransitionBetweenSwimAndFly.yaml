  class: Unit
  method: SetCanTransitionBetweenSwimAndFly
  signature: bool Unit::SetCanTransitionBetweenSwimAndFly(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the ability for a unit to transition between swimming
    and flying states.
  description: This method controls whether a Unit can switch between swim and fly
    states, which is essential for managing movement mechanics in World of Warcraft.
    It affects how the unit handles movement transitions when entering or leaving
    water bodies. The method returns true if the setting was successfully applied,
    false otherwise. This functionality is particularly important for creatures that
    need to be able to move through both land and water environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the transition capability was successfully set, false otherwise.
    A return value of false typically indicates that the operation failed due to invalid
    state or other constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* unit = new Unit;\nbool result = unit->SetCanTransitionBetweenSwimAndFly(true);\n\
      if (result) {\n    // Transition between swim and fly is enabled\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely affects internal movement state flags within the Unit
    class. Implementation details may involve checking current movement state or updating
    internal flags related to swimming/flying transitions.
  warnings: Improper use of this method could lead to unexpected behavior in unit
    movement, especially when dealing with creatures that should not be able to transition
    between swim and fly states.
