  class: CalendarEvent
  method: SetTextureId
  signature: void CalendarEvent::SetTextureId(int32 textureId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the texture ID for a calendar event, determining its visual representation
    in the game interface.
  description: The SetTextureId method assigns a specific texture identifier to a
    CalendarEvent object, which controls how the event appears in the World of Warcraft
    calendar UI. This texture ID typically corresponds to an entry in the game's asset
    database that defines the visual icon for the event. The method directly modifies
    the internal state of the calendar event and is commonly used when creating or
    updating events to ensure they display with the correct visual styling. No validation
    is performed on the input value, so developers should ensure the provided texture
    ID is valid within the game's context.
  parameters:
  - name: textureId
    description: The integer identifier of the texture to be used for this calendar
      event. This value maps to a specific icon in the game's asset system that will
      be displayed in the calendar interface.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Texture ID for a New Event
    code: 'CalendarEvent* event = new CalendarEvent();

      event->SetTextureId(12345);

      // The event will now display with texture ID 12345 in the calendar UI'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating an Existing Event's Texture
    code: "CalendarEvent* existingEvent = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(67890);\nif (existingEvent)\n\
      {\n    existingEvent->SetTextureId(54321);\n    // The event's visual representation\
      \ in the calendar will be updated\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the event's internal state and does not trigger
    any automatic UI updates. If the texture ID is invalid or doesn't exist in the
    game assets, the calendar may display a default icon or no icon at all. The texture
    ID should be consistent with the values defined in the game's database for calendar
    events.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or non-existent textureId may result in visual artifacts
    or missing icons in the calendar UI. Ensure that the provided value corresponds
    to a valid texture entry in the game assets before calling this method.
