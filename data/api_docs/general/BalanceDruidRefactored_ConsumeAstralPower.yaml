  class: BalanceDruidRefactored
  method: ConsumeAstralPower
  signature: void BalanceDruidRefactored::ConsumeAstralPower(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes the specified amount of astral power from the balance druid's resource
    pool.
  description: The ConsumeAstralPower method reduces the current astral power available
    to a balance druid by the specified amount. This method is typically invoked when
    the druid uses abilities that require astral power as a resource, such as Starfire
    or Moonfire. The method ensures that the druid has sufficient astral power before
    consuming it, and will not allow negative values to be set. It is an integral
    part of the balance druid's gameplay mechanics, directly affecting spell casting
    and resource management.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of astral power to consume from the druid's current
      resource pool. Must be a non-negative integer representing the power units to
      deduct.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Astral Power Consumption
    code: 'BalanceDruidRefactored* druid = ...;

      druid->ConsumeAstralPower(50); // Deducts 50 units of astral power'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Astral Power Usage
    code: "BalanceDruidRefactored* druid = ...;\nif (druid->GetAstralPower() >= 100)\n\
      {\n    druid->ConsumeAstralPower(100);\n    // Proceed with spell casting\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the druid has sufficient astral power
    to avoid unintended behavior. The implementation likely includes bounds checking
    to prevent underflow of the astral power value.
  warnings: Calling this method with an amount greater than the current astral power
    may lead to undefined behavior or resource corruption if not properly validated
    beforehand.
