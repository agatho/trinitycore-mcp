  class: CombatManager
  method: SuppressPvPCombat
  signature: void CombatManager::SuppressPvPCombat(UnitFilter * unitFilter)
documentation:
  brief: Suppresses PvP combat for units matching the specified filter.
  description: The SuppressPvPCombat method prevents units that match the provided
    UnitFilter from engaging in PvP combat. This functionality is typically used to
    disable PvP interactions between specific players or factions during events, quests,
    or when certain conditions are met. The method operates on a per-unit basis and
    applies the suppression to all matching units within the current combat context.
    It does not affect PvE combat or other non-PvP related combat mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: unitFilter
    description: A pointer to a UnitFilter object that defines which units should
      have their PvP combat suppressed. The filter determines the criteria for unit
      selection, such as faction, player class, or custom conditions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Suppress PvP Combat for All Players in a Specific Faction
    code: 'UnitFilter* factionFilter = new FactionUnitFilter(14); // Horde faction

      combatManager->SuppressPvPCombat(factionFilter);

      // All Horde players will no longer be able to engage in PvP combat'
    language: cpp
  - title: Suppress PvP Combat for Specific Player Classes
    code: 'UnitFilter* classFilter = new ClassUnitFilter(CLASS_WARRIOR, CLASS_PALADIN);

      combatManager->SuppressPvPCombat(classFilter);

      // Warrior and Paladin players will not be able to participate in PvP combat'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the combat state of units without removing them from
    combat. The suppression remains active until explicitly cleared or until the unit's
    combat state is reset. It is recommended to use this method in conjunction with
    appropriate cleanup routines to prevent unintended side effects.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may result in unexpected PvP behavior or player
    frustration. Ensure that PvP suppression is only applied when necessary and properly
    documented. Be cautious when applying filters that might inadvertently suppress
    combat for unintended units.
