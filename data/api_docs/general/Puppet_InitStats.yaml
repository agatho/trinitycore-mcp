  class: Puppet
  method: InitStats
  signature: void Puppet::InitStats(int * summoner, int duration)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the statistics and properties of a Puppet object with summoner
    reference and duration.
  description: The InitStats method configures the initial state and behavior of a
    Puppet instance within the TrinityCore framework. It sets up internal statistics,
    such as health, mana, and other combat-related attributes, based on the provided
    summoner reference and duration parameters. This method is typically invoked during
    the creation or activation of a puppet character, ensuring that it behaves consistently
    with the summoner's capabilities and the specified time-based limitations. The
    method does not return any value but modifies the internal state of the Puppet
    object directly.
  parameters:
  - name: summoner
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the summoner's identifier or reference.
      This parameter defines the source of the puppet's abilities and stats, typically
      linking it to a specific player or creature.
  - name: duration
    description: An integer value specifying the time duration (in milliseconds) for
      which the puppet will remain active. This determines how long the puppet exists
      before automatically despawning or deactivating.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Puppet Initialization
    code: 'Puppet* puppet = new Puppet();

      int summonerId = 12345;

      int durationMs = 30000;

      puppet->InitStats(&summonerId, durationMs);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called immediately after creating a Puppet object to
    ensure proper initialization. It may internally call other setup functions like
    SetHealth(), SetMaxHealth(), and ApplyDuration(). The summoner parameter must
    point to a valid entity in the game world; otherwise, undefined behavior might
    occur.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of the summoner pointer or invalid duration values can
    lead to crashes or unexpected behavior. Always validate inputs before calling
    InitStats, especially when dealing with dynamic summoner references.
