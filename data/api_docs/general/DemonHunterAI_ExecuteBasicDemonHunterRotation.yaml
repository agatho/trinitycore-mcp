  method: ExecuteBasicDemonHunterRotation
  signature: void DemonHunterAI::ExecuteBasicDemonHunterRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the basic rotation logic for a Demon Hunter AI, determining and
    applying the appropriate abilities based on combat state and resource management.
  description: The ExecuteBasicDemonHunterRotation method implements the core decision-making
    logic for a Demon Hunter AI during combat. It evaluates the current game state
    including target health, available resources (such as Fury or Pain), and cooldowns
    to determine which abilities should be cast next. This method is typically called
    during each AI update cycle and orchestrates the execution of spells like Fel
    Blade, Eye Beam, and other class-specific abilities according to optimal rotation
    principles. The method ensures that the Demon Hunter maintains proper resource
    usage and positioning while maximizing damage output or survivability depending
    on the configured playstyle.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's ID or index within
      the AI's internal target tracking system. This parameter allows the method to
      identify which entity the Demon Hunter should focus its actions on.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    int targetId = GetVictim()->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n\
      \    ExecuteBasicDemonHunterRotation(&targetId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Rotation Logic
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::ExecuteBasicDemonHunterRotation(int* target)\n{\n \
      \   if (!target || *target <= 0)\n        return;\n\n    Unit* targetUnit =\
      \ ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*this, *target);\n    if (!targetUnit || !targetUnit->IsAlive())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // Core rotation logic would go here\n    // e.g., check\
      \ for cooldowns, resource levels, and cast appropriate spells\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AI has already established a valid combat target
    and that all necessary state tracking variables are properly initialized. The
    implementation may vary depending on the specific Demon Hunter specialization
    (Havoc or Vengeance) and should be adapted accordingly.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is always valid before calling this method
    to prevent undefined behavior. Improper handling of resource management can lead
    to suboptimal performance or inability to execute key abilities.
