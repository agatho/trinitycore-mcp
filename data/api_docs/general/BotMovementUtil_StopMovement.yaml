  class: BotMovementUtil
  method: StopMovement
  signature: void BotMovementUtil::StopMovement(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Stops the movement of a specified bot character.
  description: The StopMovement method halts the movement of a bot character identified
    by its unique identifier. This function is typically used in AI-driven bot behavior
    to cease any ongoing movement actions, such as walking, running, or following
    paths. It ensures that the bot's movement state is reset and that no further movement
    commands are processed until explicitly resumed. The method operates on a single
    bot instance at a time and is commonly invoked when the bot needs to pause its
    current activity, such as during combat, looting, or when waiting for a specific
    condition to be met.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of
      the bot character to stop moving. The value must correspond to a valid active
      bot within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int botGuid = 12345;

      BotMovementUtil::StopMovement(&botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Bot Validation
    code: "if (IsBotActive(botGuid)) {\n    BotMovementUtil::StopMovement(&botGuid);\n\
      \    // Bot movement has been stopped\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not directly interact with the game's physics engine but
    rather updates the bot's internal movement state. It is recommended to call this
    function before changing the bot's behavior or when transitioning between different
    AI states to ensure consistent movement control.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot GUID passed to this function is valid and corresponds
    to an active bot; otherwise, calling StopMovement may result in undefined behavior
    or errors. Avoid calling this method from multiple threads simultaneously without
    proper synchronization.
