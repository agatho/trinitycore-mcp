api:
  class: BotSpawnerOptimized
  method: SetEnabled
  signature: void BotSpawnerOptimized::SetEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the bot spawner functionality.
  description: The SetEnabled method controls whether the BotSpawnerOptimized class
    will spawn or manage bots within the game world. When enabled, the spawner actively
    monitors conditions and creates bot characters according to configured parameters.
    When disabled, all bot spawning activities are halted, though existing bots remain
    in the world until they are naturally removed or despawned. This method is typically
    used to toggle the behavior of automated bot management systems during server
    maintenance, testing, or gameplay adjustments.
