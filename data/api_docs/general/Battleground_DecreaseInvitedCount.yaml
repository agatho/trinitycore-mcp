  method: DecreaseInvitedCount
  signature: void Battleground::DecreaseInvitedCount(int team)
documentation:
  brief: Decrements the invited player count for the specified team in the battleground.
  description: The DecreaseInvitedCount method reduces the number of players that
    have been invited to join a specific team within a battleground. This method is
    typically used during battleground matchmaking and initialization processes to
    track how many players have accepted invitations to join each team. The method
    takes a single integer parameter representing the team ID, which is usually 0
    for Alliance and 1 for Horde. It modifies an internal counter that tracks invited
    players, ensuring proper synchronization of player counts during battleground
    setup.
  parameters:
  - name: team
    description: The team identifier for which to decrease the invited count. Valid
      values are typically 0 for Alliance and 1 for Horde.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Decrease Invited Count for Alliance Team
    code: "Battleground* bg = sObjectAccessor->GetBattleground(player->GetBattlegroundId());\n\
      if (bg)\n{\n    bg->DecreaseInvitedCount(0); // Decrease Alliance invited count\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground invitation system and should only
    be called during appropriate battleground initialization phases. The internal
    counter should never go below zero, as this would indicate an invalid state in
    the battleground's player tracking system.
