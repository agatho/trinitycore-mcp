  class: EquipmentManager
  method: CalculateItemTemplateScore
  signature: float EquipmentManager::CalculateItemTemplateScore(int * player, const
    int * itemTemplate)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a score value for an item template based on player
    context and item properties.
  description: The CalculateItemTemplateScore method computes a numerical score that
    represents how valuable or useful a specific item template is for a given player.
    This score is typically used in equipment management systems to determine item
    prioritization, comparison, or recommendation logic within the game. The calculation
    considers various factors such as item level, stats, enchantments, and player
    class or specialization. The method requires a pointer to the player data structure
    and a pointer to the item template data to perform its evaluation.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer array representing the player's data context.
      This typically includes player level, class, specialization, and other relevant
      attributes that influence item scoring.
  - name: itemTemplate
    description: Pointer to an integer array containing the item template data. This
      includes item type, stats, level, quality, and other properties used in the
      scoring algorithm.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated score for the item template within
    the given player context. Higher scores indicate more valuable or beneficial items
    for that specific player. The exact scale and interpretation of the score depend
    on internal game logic and may vary based on item type and player class.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int playerData[10] = {80, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}; // Level 80 Warrior\n\
      int itemTemplate[20] = {12345, 100, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\
      \ 0, 0, 0, 0}; // Sample item\nfloat score = equipmentManager.CalculateItemTemplateScore(playerData,\
      \ itemTemplate);\nif (score > 50.0f) {\n    // Item is considered highly valuable\
      \ for this player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely uses internal algorithms that weight different item attributes
    differently based on player class and specialization. The exact scoring mechanism
    may be subject to balance adjustments in game updates. This function is typically
    used in inventory management, gear recommendation systems, or loot evaluation
    logic.
  warnings: Ensure that both input pointers are valid and properly initialized before
    calling this method. Passing null or uninitialized pointers will likely result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. The returned score values should not be directly
    compared across different player classes without proper normalization.
