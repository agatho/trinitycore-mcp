  class: FlameShockTracker
  method: GetFlameShockTimeRemaining
  signature: uint32 FlameShockTracker::GetFlameShockTimeRemaining(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the time remaining in milliseconds for a flame shock effect on the
    specified unit.
  description: The GetFlameShockTimeRemaining method retrieves the duration left for
    a flame shock debuff applied to a specific unit identified by its GUID. This method
    is typically used in combat mechanics to determine how much time remains before
    the flame shock effect expires. The returned value represents the milliseconds
    remaining until the effect dissipates, allowing for accurate timing of spell effects
    and cooldowns. It's commonly used in conjunction with other aura tracking systems
    to manage spell interactions and player status updates.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the unit whose flame shock time remaining
      is being queried. This should be a valid object GUID from the TrinityCore world
      object system.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the milliseconds remaining for the
    flame shock effect to expire. If no flame shock is active on the specified unit,
    this method typically returns 0 or a default value indicating no active effect.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Flame Shock Duration on Target
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetSelectedUnit();\nif (target)\n{\n    uint32 timeRemaining\
      \ = flameShockTracker->GetFlameShockTimeRemaining(target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      \    if (timeRemaining > 0)\n    {\n        // Flame shock is active, display\
      \ remaining time\n        ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Flame shock has %u ms remaining.\", timeRemaining);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n\
      \        // No flame shock effect is active\n        ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      No flame shock effect is active.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the FlameShockTracker maintains an internal mapping
    of GUIDs to their respective flame shock durations. The implementation likely
    relies on aura tracking systems within TrinityCore's spell management framework.
    Performance-wise, this is a fast lookup operation as it typically uses hash maps
    or similar data structures for O(1) access time.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid unit in the current
    world context, as invalid GUIDs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
    This method should not be called on units that do not support aura tracking or
    are not part of the active combat system.
