  method: CollectMetrics
  signature: void IBotMetricsCollector::CollectMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Collects and processes bot-related performance and activity metrics for monitoring
    and analysis.
  description: The CollectMetrics method is responsible for gathering various performance
    and activity data points related to bot operations within the TrinityCore environment.
    This includes tracking resource usage, command execution times, AI decision-making
    cycles, and overall system load. The collected data is typically used for debugging,
    optimization, and ensuring that bot behavior remains within acceptable performance
    thresholds. The method does not require any input parameters and performs its
    operations internally, updating internal metric structures or writing to log files
    as needed. This method is generally called periodically by the core system or
    manually during diagnostic sessions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Diagnostic Context
    code: 'IBotMetricsCollector* metricsCollector = sBotManager->GetMetricsCollector();

      metricsCollector->CollectMetrics(); // Triggers metric collection for all active
      bots'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may have performance implications if called too frequently, as
    it involves collecting and processing potentially large amounts of data. It's
    recommended to call this method at appropriate intervals rather than continuously.
    The collected metrics are typically not immediately available for retrieval but
    are stored internally for later analysis or export.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method in high-frequency loops or during critical performance-sensitive
    operations as it may introduce latency. Ensure that the bot manager and related
    systems are properly initialized before invoking this method to prevent undefined
    behavior.
