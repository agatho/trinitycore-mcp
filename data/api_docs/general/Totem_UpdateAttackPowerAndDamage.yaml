  class: Totem
  method: UpdateAttackPowerAndDamage
  signature: void Totem::UpdateAttackPowerAndDamage(bool param0)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the attack power and damage values for a totem based on its current
    state and associated effects.
  description: The UpdateAttackPowerAndDamage method recalculates and applies any
    changes to the totem's attack power and damage statistics. This typically occurs
    when the totem's owner gains or loses buffs, debuffs, or other status effects
    that influence combat capabilities. The method ensures that the totem reflects
    accurate combat stats in alignment with its summoner's current condition and any
    applicable auras or modifiers. It is usually invoked automatically by the game
    engine during state changes or periodic updates rather than being called directly
    by scripts or plugins.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether to force an update regardless of
      current state. When true, the method will recalculate all values even if no
      changes have occurred since last update.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: totem->UpdateAttackPowerAndDamage(false);
    language: cpp
  - title: Forced Update
    code: totem->UpdateAttackPowerAndDamage(true);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine during combat
    state updates or when a totem's owner experiences stat changes. Developers should
    not generally call this method manually unless implementing custom behavior or
    debugging.
  warnings: Calling this method with force=true may cause performance overhead if
    done excessively without proper conditions. Avoid calling it in tight loops or
    high-frequency update contexts.
