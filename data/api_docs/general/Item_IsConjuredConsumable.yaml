documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the item is a conjured consumable.
  description: This method checks if an item is a conjured consumable, which means
    it's a temporary item created by spells like Conjure Food or Conjure Water. These
    items are typically used for short-term effects and have specific properties that
    distinguish them from regular consumables. The method returns true if the item
    is a conjured consumable, false otherwise. This functionality is important for
    game mechanics related to spell effects, item usage, and temporary item management.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item is a conjured consumable, false otherwise. A conjured
    consumable is an item created by spells such as Conjure Food or Conjure Water
    that has special properties and is typically used for short-term effects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByGuid(guid);\nif (item->IsConjuredConsumable())\
      \ {\n    // Handle conjured consumable\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other item properties checks
    to determine item behavior. Implementation relies on internal item flags and properties
    that distinguish conjured items from regular consumables.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only applies to items created by conjuring spells,
    not to regular consumable items. The method may return false for items that are
    not conjured but have similar effects.
