  method: HasPendingEventForSeat
  signature: bool Vehicle::HasPendingEventForSeat(int8 seatId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a vehicle has a pending event scheduled for a specific seat.
  description: The HasPendingEventForSeat method determines whether there is an event
    currently queued or scheduled to be executed for a given seat on the vehicle.
    This functionality is typically used in vehicle AI and event handling systems
    to manage seat-specific actions such as passenger boarding, disembarking, or other
    state transitions. The method returns true if an event exists for the specified
    seat, and false otherwise. It is commonly called during vehicle update cycles
    or when checking the status of seat operations before initiating new ones.
  parameters:
  - name: seatId
    description: The identifier of the seat to check for pending events. This value
      typically corresponds to a seat index within the vehicle's seat configuration,
      ranging from 0 to the maximum number of seats defined for that vehicle type.
  returns: Returns true if there is at least one pending event scheduled for the specified
    seat; otherwise returns false. A pending event may represent an action such as
    a passenger entering or leaving the seat, or a seat-specific animation or state
    change.
  examples:
  - title: Check for Pending Events on Seat 0
    code: "if (vehicle->HasPendingEventForSeat(0))\n{\n    // Handle case where seat\
      \ 0 has a pending event\n    // e.g., delay further actions until current event\
      \ completes\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Prevent Concurrent Seat Operations
    code: "for (int8 i = 0; i < vehicle->GetSeatCount(); ++i)\n{\n    if (!vehicle->HasPendingEventForSeat(i))\n\
      \    {\n        // Proceed with assigning passenger to seat i\n        vehicle->AssignPassengerToSeat(passenger,\
      \ i);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Skip this seat as it's already processing\
      \ an event\n        continue;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in conjunction with vehicle event management
    systems and should be called frequently during vehicle update loops to ensure
    proper sequencing of events. The implementation likely uses internal data structures
    such as queues or lists to track pending seat events, which may have performance
    implications if many seats are being checked simultaneously.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in tight loops or high-frequency update
    contexts, as checking all seats repeatedly could impact performance. Also, ensure
    that the seatId passed is within valid bounds for the vehicle type to avoid undefined
    behavior.
