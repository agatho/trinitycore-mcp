documentation:
  brief: Destroys a SpellHistory object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The SpellHistory destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    and resources allocated by the SpellHistory class. This includes releasing any
    internal data structures that track spell cooldowns, charges, and global cooldowns
    for a unit. The destructor ensures proper cleanup when a SpellHistory instance
    is no longer needed, preventing memory leaks and maintaining the integrity of
    the spell system. It is automatically called when the object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of SpellHistory
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    SpellHistory* history = new SpellHistory();\n\
      \    // ... use history ...\n    delete history; // Destructor called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-based SpellHistory destruction
    code: "void AnotherFunction()\n{\n    SpellHistory history;\n    // ... use history\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor automatically called when history goes out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is typically invoked automatically by the C++ runtime when
    objects go out of scope or are explicitly deleted. In TrinityCore, SpellHistory
    objects are often managed through smart pointers or container classes, so explicit
    destruction may not always be necessary. The destructor ensures that all internal
    cooldown tracking data is properly cleared to prevent dangling references.
