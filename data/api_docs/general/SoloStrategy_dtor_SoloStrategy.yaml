documentation:
  brief: Destroys a SoloStrategy instance and releases all associated resources
  description: The SoloStrategy destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    and resources allocated during the lifetime of a SoloStrategy object. This includes
    releasing any dynamically allocated data structures, clearing internal state,
    and ensuring proper cleanup of AI behavior components. The destructor is automatically
    invoked when a SoloStrategy object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this method ensures that no memory
    leaks occur when AI strategies are removed or replaced during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of SoloStrategy object
    code: 'SoloStrategy* strategy = new SoloStrategy();

      // ... use the strategy ...

      delete strategy; // Destructor automatically called here'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic destruction in scope
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    SoloStrategy localStrategy;\n    // ... use\
      \ localStrategy ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when function exits\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a virtual function in the base AI strategy class hierarchy,
    ensuring proper polymorphic destruction. Developers should not manually call this
    destructor unless explicitly managing object lifecycle through custom allocation/deallocation
    patterns.
  warnings: Never manually invoke the destructor on stack-allocated objects as it
    will lead to undefined behavior. Ensure all derived classes properly implement
    their own destructors if they manage additional resources.
