documentation:
  brief: Initiates an attack between two entities in the combat system
  description: The AttackStart method begins a combat interaction between an attacker
    and victim within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically invoked
    when one unit (such as a player or creature) initiates an attack against another
    unit. It establishes the initial combat state, registers the attack event, and
    may trigger various combat-related callbacks or actions depending on the game
    mechanics implementation. The method returns a CombatEvent object representing
    the newly created attack event.
  parameters:
  - name: attacker
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the entity initiating the attack
  - name: victim
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the entity being attacked
  returns: A CombatEvent object representing the newly created attack event that has
    been initiated between the specified attacker and victim.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Attack Start Example
    code: CombatEvent event = combatEvent.AttackStart(12345, 67890);
    language: cpp
  - title: Attack Start with Combat Logic Integration
    code: "uint64 attackerGuid = player->GetGUID();\nuint64 victimGuid = creature->GetGUID();\n\
      CombatEvent event = combatEvent.AttackStart(attackerGuid, victimGuid);\n// Process\
      \ the combat event further\nif (event.IsValid()) {\n    // Handle attack logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core combat system and should be used carefully
    to avoid unintended combat state changes. It assumes valid GUIDs for both attacker
    and victim parameters, and may internally validate these identifiers before proceeding.
  warnings: Ensure that both attacker and victim GUIDs are valid and represent existing
    units in the world before calling this method. Incorrect GUIDs may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes within the combat system.
