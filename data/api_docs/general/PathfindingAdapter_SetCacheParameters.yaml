  class: PathfindingAdapter
  method: SetCacheParameters
  signature: void PathfindingAdapter::SetCacheParameters(uint32 maxSize, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Configures cache size and duration parameters for pathfinding operations.
  description: Sets the maximum cache size and duration for the pathfinding adapter's
    internal caching mechanism. This method allows fine-tuning of memory usage and
    cache validity period for pathfinding results. The cache parameters directly affect
    performance and memory consumption during AI pathfinding calculations in World
    of Warcraft environments. Changes take effect immediately and may impact ongoing
    pathfinding operations.
  parameters:
  - name: maxSize
    description: Maximum number of cached paths to store. Valid range is typically
      100-1000000, with higher values consuming more memory but potentially reducing
      recomputation overhead.
  - name: duration
    description: Cache duration in milliseconds before entries expire. Valid range
      is typically 1000-300000 (1 second to 5 minutes), affecting how long cached
      paths remain valid.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cache Configuration
    code: 'PathfindingAdapter adapter;

      adapter.SetCacheParameters(5000, 30000); // 5000 max entries, 30 seconds duration'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Tuning Example
    code: 'PathfindingAdapter adapter;

      // For high-traffic areas with frequent path requests

      adapter.SetCacheParameters(10000, 60000); // 10k entries, 1 minute duration

      // For low-traffic areas to save memory

      adapter.SetCacheParameters(1000, 15000); // 1k entries, 15 seconds duration'
    language: cpp
  notes: The cache parameters are critical for balancing performance and memory usage.
    Larger caches improve performance by reducing recomputation but consume more memory.
    Shorter durations ensure fresher path data but may increase computation load.
    This method should be called during initialization or configuration changes, not
    during active pathfinding operations.
  warnings: Setting maxSize too high may cause memory exhaustion in environments with
    many concurrent pathfinding requests. Setting duration too low may result in excessive
    recomputation overhead. Changes to cache parameters during active pathfinding
    may cause inconsistent behavior for ongoing path calculations.
