  method: GetActiveSessionCount
  signature: uint32 BotResourcePool::GetActiveSessionCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of active bot sessions managed by this resource pool.
  description: The GetActiveSessionCount method retrieves the number of currently
    active bot sessions associated with the BotResourcePool instance. This count represents
    how many bots are actively engaged in gameplay or processing tasks within the
    pool's scope. The method is typically used for monitoring, performance tracking,
    and resource management purposes. It provides a snapshot of the current load on
    the resource pool without modifying any internal state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of active bot sessions currently
    managed by this resource pool. Returns zero if no sessions are active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Active Sessions
    code: 'BotResourcePool* pool = sBotAI->GetResourcePool();

      uint32 activeCount = pool->GetActiveSessionCount();

      TC_LOG_INFO("bot.ai", "Active bot sessions: %u", activeCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Active Session Count for Resource Allocation
    code: "BotResourcePool* pool = sBotAI->GetResourcePool();\nuint32 count = pool->GetActiveSessionCount();\n\
      if (count > 100)\n{\n    TC_LOG_WARN(\"bot.ai\", \"High bot load detected: %u\
      \ active sessions\", count);\n    // Implement throttling or scaling logic here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple read operation on an internal counter and is
    generally fast. It does not involve any locking mechanisms in most implementations,
    but developers should verify thread safety if the pool is accessed from multiple
    threads. The returned value reflects the state at the moment of the call and may
    change immediately after.
  warnings: The active session count can fluctuate rapidly in high-load scenarios.
    Relying on this value for critical decisions without considering its dynamic nature
    may lead to race conditions or inconsistent behavior. Avoid making performance-critical
    decisions based solely on this count without proper synchronization.
