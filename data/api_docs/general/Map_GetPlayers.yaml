documentation:
  brief: Returns all players currently present in the map
  description: The GetPlayers method retrieves a const reference to the PlayerList
    containing all players currently located within the map. This method is essential
    for managing player interactions and performing operations on all players in a
    specific map instance. The returned list is typically used for iterating through
    players, checking player presence, or implementing game mechanics that require
    access to all players in the map. It's important to note that this method returns
    a const reference, meaning modifications to the returned list will not affect
    the actual player list within the map.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const reference to the PlayerList which contains all players
    currently present in the map. The list may be empty if no players are currently
    in the map, or it may contain multiple players if several are present.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Map* map = player->GetMap();\nconst PlayerList& players = map->GetPlayers();\n\
      for (PlayerList::const_iterator itr = players.begin(); itr != players.end();\
      \ ++itr)\n{\n    Player* player = *itr;\n    // Do something with player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be safely called from multiple threads.
    Performance considerations are minimal as the method simply returns a reference
    to an existing list without performing any expensive operations. The PlayerList
    returned is typically implemented using std::list or similar container, so iterating
    through it has O(n) complexity.
  warnings: The returned PlayerList should not be modified directly as it's a const
    reference. Any modifications to the list would not affect the actual player list
    in the map. Also note that players may be removed from the list during iteration
    if they leave the map or are removed from the game world.
