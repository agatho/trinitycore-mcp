  signature: bool Player::IsAdvancedCombatLoggingEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether advanced combat logging is enabled for the player.
  description: This method checks if the player has advanced combat logging enabled,
    which provides detailed combat log information including critical hits, damage
    absorption, and other advanced combat mechanics. It is used primarily for debugging
    and development purposes to verify combat logging settings. The method returns
    true when advanced combat logging is active and false otherwise, allowing developers
    to conditionally enable or disable certain combat-related features based on the
    player's logging status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if advanced combat logging is enabled for the player, false
    otherwise. This indicates whether detailed combat log information is being recorded
    and processed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsAdvancedCombatLoggingEnabled()) {\n    // Enable advanced\
      \ combat logging features\n    // Log critical hits and damage absorption\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other combat logging methods
    to determine the overall combat logging state of a player. It may be affected
    by game settings, client configurations, or server-side logging policies. Performance
    implications are minimal as this is a simple boolean check.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining combat effectiveness or
    damage output in gameplay scenarios, as it only indicates logging status, not
    actual combat performance. It's primarily intended for development and debugging
    purposes.
