    spell_id) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the begin and end iterators for the spell learn spell map associated
    with the specified spell ID.
  description: The GetSpellLearnSpellMapBounds method returns a pair of iterators
    that define the range of entries in the SpellLearnSpellMap for a given spell ID.
    This map stores information about which spells are learned by other spells, typically
    used for skill and ability progression mechanics in World of Warcraft. The returned
    SpellLearnSpellMapBounds object contains both the starting and ending iterator
    positions that can be used with standard STL container iteration techniques to
    traverse all entries related to the specified spell ID. This method is commonly
    used when checking or iterating through spells that are learned as a result of
    casting a particular spell, such as profession abilities or talent ranks.
  parameters: []
  returns: A SpellLearnSpellMapBounds object containing the begin and end iterators
    for the spell learn spell map entries associated with the specified spell ID.
    The bounds represent a valid range within the internal spell learning data structure
    that can be used for iteration purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Iterating through learned spells for a given spell ID
    code: "SpellLearnSpellMapBounds bounds = sSpellMgr->GetSpellLearnSpellMapBounds(12345);\n\
      for (auto itr = bounds.first; itr != bounds.second; ++itr)\n{\n    uint32 learnedSpellId\
      \ = itr->second.spellId;\n    // Process each spell that is learned by casting\
      \ spell 12345\n    printf(\"Learned spell ID: %u\\n\", learnedSpellId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal data structures of the SpellMgr class and should
    only be called from within the core TrinityCore codebase or carefully managed
    external systems. The returned iterators are valid only as long as the underlying
    map structure remains unchanged, so any modification to spell learning data during
    iteration may invalidate the bounds.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the spell learning data structures directly through
    these iterators. The SpellLearnSpellMapBounds should only be used for read-only
    traversal of the data. Calling this method with an invalid spell ID may return
    empty bounds, which should be checked before attempting to iterate.
