api:
  class: KitingUtils
  method: EstimateTimeToReachPlayer
  signature: float KitingUtils::EstimateTimeToReachPlayer(Unit * threat, Player *
    player)
documentation:
  brief: Estimates the time it will take for a threat unit to reach a player based
    on movement speed and distance.
  description: The EstimateTimeToReachPlayer method calculates the estimated time
    in seconds for a given Unit (typically an enemy mob or NPC) to reach a Player.
    This calculation is based on the distance between the two entities and their respective
    movement speeds. The method is commonly used in kiting AI logic to determine optimal
    timing for evasive maneuvers, spell casting, or positioning. It assumes both entities
    are actively moving toward each other and does not account for complex pathfinding
    or obstacles in the environment.
  parameters:
  - name: threat
    description: Pointer to the Unit (enemy) that is pursuing the player. Must be
      a valid object with movement data.
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player entity being pursued. Must be a valid object
      with movement data.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the estimated time in seconds for the
    threat unit to reach the player. A negative value may indicate an error or invalid
    input parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in kiting AI
    code: "float timeToReach = KitingUtils::EstimateTimeToReachPlayer(enemyUnit, player);\n\
      if (timeToReach < 2.0f) {\n    // Player is close, initiate evasive action\n\
      \    player->CastSpell(player, SPELL_EVASIVE_MANEUVER, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using result for conditional logic
    code: "Unit* threat = player->GetThreatManager().GetHostileTarget();\nif (threat\
      \ && threat->IsInWorld()) {\n    float timeToReach = KitingUtils::EstimateTimeToReachPlayer(threat,\
      \ player);\n    if (timeToReach > 0.0f && timeToReach < 5.0f) {\n        //\
      \ Time to reach is reasonable, consider using a ranged attack\n        player->CastSpell(threat,\
      \ SPELL_RANGED_ATTACK, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs basic distance and speed calculations without considering
    environmental factors like terrain, obstacles, or complex movement paths. It is
    intended for use in AI decision-making where approximate timing is sufficient.
    The method may return inaccurate results if either unit is not in a valid state
    (e.g., dead, unmounted, or not moving).
  warnings: Ensure that both Unit and Player pointers are valid before calling this
    function to avoid undefined behavior. Do not rely on the result for precise movement
    prediction; it's meant for general AI timing decisions.
