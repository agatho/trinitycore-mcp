  class: EnergyComboResource
  method: Update
  signature: void EnergyComboResource::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the energy combo resource state for the specified player bot.
  description: The Update method manages the internal state of an energy combo resource
    associated with a player bot. It typically handles the replenishment, consumption,
    or modification of energy-based combo points that are used in various combat mechanics
    such as energy-based abilities, combo point generation, and resource management
    for classes like Rogues or other energy-based specializations. This method is
    generally called during game ticks or when specific events occur that affect the
    player's energy combo state.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose energy combo
      resource will be updated. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'EnergyComboResource resource;

      Player* bot = ...; // Assume valid player pointer

      resource.Update(bot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Combat Loop Context
    code: "void OnCombatUpdate(Player* player)\n{\n    EnergyComboResource comboResource;\n\
      \    comboResource.Update(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the AI system or game loop to synchronize
    the energy combo resource state with current gameplay conditions. It may internally
    interact with player's energy, combo point counters, and cooldowns.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is valid and not destroyed before
    this method is called; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur.
