  signature: void ObstacleAvoidanceManager::RemoveObstacle(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes an obstacle from the obstacle avoidance system by its unique identifier.
  description: The RemoveObstacle method removes a specific obstacle from the AI's
    obstacle avoidance system using its unique global identifier (GUID). This method
    is typically used during pathfinding to dynamically update the navigation mesh
    by removing previously registered obstacles such as destructible objects, moving
    creatures, or temporary environmental hazards. The system maintains an internal
    list of active obstacles and this function allows for their removal to ensure
    accurate path calculations. It's important that the GUID provided corresponds
    to a valid obstacle that was previously added to the system; otherwise, the operation
    may have no effect or potentially cause undefined behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique global identifier (GUID) of the obstacle to be removed.
      This value must correspond to an existing obstacle that has been previously
      registered with the ObstacleAvoidanceManager.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a destructible object from pathfinding
    code: "void OnDestructibleDestroyed(Unit* destroyer, WorldObject* destructible)\n\
      {\n    if (auto* obstacleManager = sObjectMgr->GetObstacleAvoidanceManager())\n\
      \    {\n        obstacleManager->RemoveObstacle(destructible->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove multiple obstacles in a loop
    code: "void RemoveAllObstaclesInArea(Position const& center, float radius)\n{\n\
      \    if (auto* obstacleManager = sObjectMgr->GetObstacleAvoidanceManager())\n\
      \    {\n        std::vector<int> toRemove;\n        for (auto const& obstacle\
      \ : obstacleManager->GetActiveObstacles())\n        {\n            if (obstacle->GetPosition().DistTo(center)\
      \ <= radius)\n                toRemove.push_back(obstacle->GetGUID());\n   \
      \     }\n        for (int guid : toRemove)\n            obstacleManager->RemoveObstacle(guid);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI pathfinding subsystem and should be called
    from within a thread-safe context when dealing with dynamic world objects. The
    underlying implementation likely uses a hash map or similar data structure for
    fast lookup, so performance is generally O(1) for removal operations.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in
    silent failure or undefined behavior. Ensure that the obstacle was previously
    added to the manager before attempting to remove it.
