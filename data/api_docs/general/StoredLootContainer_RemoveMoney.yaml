documentation:
  brief: Removes all money from the stored loot container.
  description: The RemoveMoney method clears all monetary components from a StoredLootContainer
    instance, effectively setting the container's money amount to zero. This operation
    is typically invoked when loot is being distributed or when a container's contents
    are being fully consumed. The method does not affect item entries within the container,
    only the currency component. This functionality is integral to the World of Warcraft
    loot system, ensuring proper monetary distribution and container state management.

  examples:
  - title: Remove money from a stored loot container
    code: 'StoredLootContainer* container = new StoredLootContainer();

      // ... populate container with items and money ...

      container->RemoveMoney();

      // Container now has no money, but items remain'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly called during loot distribution processes in TrinityCore.
    It's important to note that this only affects the monetary value and does not
    modify item entries within the container. The operation is atomic and does not
    involve database transactions directly.
