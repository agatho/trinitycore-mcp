  class: PathfindingManager
  method: GetNeighborNodes
  signature: int PathfindingManager::GetNeighborNodes(const int & center, float spacing)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves neighboring nodes for a given center node within a specified spacing
    distance.
  description: The GetNeighborNodes method is used in pathfinding operations to identify
    and return a list of adjacent nodes that are within a defined spatial range from
    a central node. This functionality is critical for navigation systems in World
    of Warcraft, particularly when calculating movement paths for NPCs or players.
    The method operates on a graph-based representation of the game world where each
    node represents a navigable point. It uses the provided spacing parameter to determine
    which neighboring nodes are considered valid candidates for path traversal. The
    returned integer typically indicates the number of neighbor nodes found or an
    error code if the operation fails.
  parameters:
  - name: center
    description: The identifier of the central node from which to find neighbors.
      This is typically a unique index or coordinate-based reference within the pathfinding
      graph.
  - name: spacing
    description: The maximum distance allowed between the center node and its neighbors.
      Nodes that fall outside this range will not be included in the result set.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of neighbor nodes found within
    the specified spacing distance. A negative value may indicate an error condition,
    such as invalid input parameters or internal pathfinding system failure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int centerNode = 100;\nfloat maxSpacing = 5.0f;\nint neighborCount = pathfinder.GetNeighborNodes(centerNode,\
      \ maxSpacing);\nif (neighborCount >= 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Found \" << neighborCount\
      \ << \" neighbors\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cerr << \"Error retrieving\
      \ neighbors\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Node Processing
    code: "int centerNode = 100;\nfloat spacing = 3.0f;\nint neighborCount = pathfinder.GetNeighborNodes(centerNode,\
      \ spacing);\nif (neighborCount > 0) {\n    std::vector<int> neighbors(neighborCount);\n\
      \    // Assuming there's a way to retrieve the actual neighbor IDs\n    for\
      \ (int i = 0; i < neighborCount; ++i) {\n        // Process each neighbor node\n\
      \        int nodeId = neighbors[i];\n        // Perform pathfinding logic here\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger navigation mesh system and may depend
    on precomputed graph data structures. It's important to note that the spacing
    parameter defines a spherical neighborhood around the center node, not a cubic
    or other geometric shape. Performance can be affected by the density of nodes
    in the graph and how efficiently the underlying spatial indexing is implemented.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'center' parameter refers to a valid node within the pathfinding
    system's graph; otherwise, the method may return an error or undefined behavior.
    Be cautious when using very small spacing values as they might result in no neighbors
    being found even if nodes exist nearby.
