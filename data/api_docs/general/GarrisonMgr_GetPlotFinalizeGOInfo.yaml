    garrPlotInstanceID) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the game object information associated with a specific garrison
    plot finalize action.
  description: The GetPlotFinalizeGOInfo method retrieves the FinalizeGarrisonPlotGOInfo
    structure that contains data about the game object to be spawned or used when
    finalizing a garrison plot. This is typically invoked during the process of completing
    a garrison building placement or upgrade, where a specific visual or functional
    game object needs to be instantiated at the plot's location. The method takes
    a garrPlotInstanceID parameter which uniquely identifies the plot instance in
    the current garrison context. It returns a pointer to the FinalizeGarrisonPlotGOInfo
    structure if found, otherwise it returns nullptr.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a FinalizeGarrisonPlotGOInfo structure containing the game
    object data for the specified plot instance, or nullptr if no such information
    exists for the given garrPlotInstanceID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const FinalizeGarrisonPlotGOInfo* goInfo = garrisonMgr->GetPlotFinalizeGOInfo(12345);\n\
      if (goInfo)\n{\n    // Use the game object info to spawn or interact with the\
      \ finalize GO\n    // For example, spawn a visual effect at the plot location\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the garrison system's internal mechanics and is primarily
    used by the core game logic when processing plot finalization events. The returned
    pointer should not be stored or used beyond the scope of the current operation
    as it may become invalid.
  warnings: Ensure that the garrPlotInstanceID parameter corresponds to a valid and
    active plot instance in the current garrison context, otherwise the method will
    return nullptr. Avoid caching the returned pointer as it may point to temporary
    data structures.
