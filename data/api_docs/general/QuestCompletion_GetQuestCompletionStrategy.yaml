  class: QuestCompletion
  method: GetQuestCompletionStrategy
  signature: QuestCompletionStrategy QuestCompletion::GetQuestCompletionStrategy(uint32
    botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the quest completion strategy associated with a specified bot GUID.
  description: The GetQuestCompletionStrategy method fetches the configured quest
    completion strategy for a given bot identified by its unique global identifier
    (GUID). This strategy defines how the bot should approach completing quests, including
    whether it prioritizes quest objectives, manages quest timers, or handles specific
    quest mechanics. The method is typically used in AI-driven questing systems where
    different bots may have varying approaches to quest completion based on their
    role or configuration. It's important to note that this method assumes a valid
    bot GUID and will return a default strategy if no specific one is configured for
    the provided GUID.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique global identifier (GUID) of the bot whose quest completion
      strategy is being retrieved. This value must be a valid 32-bit unsigned integer
      representing a bot in the game world.
  returns: Returns a QuestCompletionStrategy enum value that represents how the bot
    should handle quest completion for the specified GUID. Possible values may include
    strategies such as 'Standard', 'Fast', 'Efficient', or other custom-defined strategies
    depending on the implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 botGuid = 12345;\nQuestCompletionStrategy strategy = questCompletion.GetQuestCompletionStrategy(botGuid);\n\
      if (strategy == QuestCompletionStrategy::Standard)\n{\n    // Handle standard\
      \ quest completion logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Strategy in AI Logic
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateQuestCompletion()\n{\n    uint32 botGuid = GetBotGUID();\n\
      \    QuestCompletionStrategy strategy = questCompletion.GetQuestCompletionStrategy(botGuid);\n\
      \    switch (strategy)\n    {\n        case QuestCompletionStrategy::Fast:\n\
      \            // Optimize for speed\n            break;\n        case QuestCompletionStrategy::Efficient:\n\
      \            // Balance time and resources\n            break;\n        default:\n\
      \            // Default behavior\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the questing AI system in TrinityCore, and its performance
    depends on how efficiently the internal mapping from bot GUIDs to strategies is
    maintained. It's recommended to cache strategy results when used frequently to
    avoid repeated lookups.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid corresponds to an active bot; otherwise,
    the method may return a default or invalid strategy. Incorrect handling of returned
    strategies could lead to unexpected questing behavior in bots.
