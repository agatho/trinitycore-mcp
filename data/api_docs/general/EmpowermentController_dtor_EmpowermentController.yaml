  signature: void EmpowermentController::~EmpowermentController()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an EmpowermentController instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~EmpowermentController destructor is automatically invoked when
    an EmpowermentController object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This
    method ensures proper cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory, registered
    callbacks, or internal state managed by the controller. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, this class likely manages empowerment effects such
    as those applied to players or creatures during specific game events or abilities.
    The destructor guarantees that no memory leaks occur and that all subsystems are
    cleanly shut down before the object is removed from memory.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of EmpowermentController instance
    code: 'EmpowermentController* controller = new EmpowermentController();

      // ... use controller ...

      delete controller; // Triggers ~EmpowermentController'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic destruction via stack allocation
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    EmpowermentController controller;\n    // ...\
      \ use controller ...\n    // ~EmpowermentController called automatically when\
      \ function exits\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing object
    lifetime. It is important to ensure that all references to the controller are
    cleared before deletion to prevent dangling pointers. The implementation likely
    includes cleanup of internal data structures and deregistration from any event
    systems or callbacks.
  warnings: Never manually invoke the destructor unless you're implementing custom
    memory management. Calling ~EmpowermentController directly on an object that hasn't
    been allocated with 'new' can result in undefined behavior. Also, ensure no other
    code holds references to the controller after deletion.
