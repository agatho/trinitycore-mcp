  method: ~IBotSession
  signature: void IBotSession::~IBotSession()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the bot session instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~IBotSession destructor is responsible for cleaning up all resources
    allocated during the lifetime of an IBotSession object. This includes releasing
    memory, closing connections, and performing any necessary cleanup operations to
    ensure no resource leaks occur. The destructor is automatically invoked when a
    bot session object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context
    of TrinityCore's bot system, this method ensures that all bot-related data structures,
    network connections, and game state information are properly disposed of, preventing
    memory leaks and maintaining system stability.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Destructor Usage
    code: 'IBotSession* session = new IBotSession();

      // ... perform bot operations ...

      delete session; // Triggers ~IBotSession destructor'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic Destruction with Scope
    code: "void CreateAndUseBotSession() {\n    IBotSession session;\n    // ... use\
      \ the session ...\n    // Destructor automatically called when session goes\
      \ out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing memory.
    It's typically invoked automatically by the C++ runtime when objects go out of
    scope or are deleted. Ensure that all derived classes properly implement their
    own destructors to clean up their specific resources before this base destructor
    is called.
  warnings: Never manually invoke the destructor unless you're implementing custom
    memory management. Calling it explicitly on stack-allocated objects will result
    in undefined behavior. Also, be aware that if any derived class has virtual methods,
    the destructor should be declared as virtual to ensure proper cleanup chain execution.
