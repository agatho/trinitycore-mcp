  signature: void BotAI::DeactivateStrategy(const std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Deactivates a specified AI strategy for the bot
  description: The DeactivateStrategy method removes a named AI strategy from the
    active strategy list of the BotAI instance. This allows for dynamic control over
    which strategies the bot employs during gameplay. The method operates on the internal
    strategy management system, disabling the specified strategy without necessarily
    removing it from memory. Strategies can be reactivated later using the ActivateStrategy
    method. This functionality is essential for implementing flexible AI behavior
    that can adapt to changing game conditions or player interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The unique identifier string of the strategy to deactivate. This
      must match the name used when the strategy was originally added or activated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Strategy Deactivation
    code: 'BotAI* botAI = ...;

      botAI->DeactivateStrategy("CombatStrategy");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Strategy Deactivation
    code: "BotAI* botAI = ...;\nif (botAI->IsStrategyActive(\"HealingStrategy\"))\
      \ {\n    botAI->DeactivateStrategy(\"HealingStrategy\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the BotAI object and should be
    used carefully in multi-threaded environments. The strategy name is case-sensitive
    and must exactly match the registered strategy name.
  warnings: Attempting to deactivate a non-existent strategy will typically result
    in no operation, but may produce warnings or errors depending on implementation
    details. Ensure that strategies are properly activated before attempting to deactivate
    them.
