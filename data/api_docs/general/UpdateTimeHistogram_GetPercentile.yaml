documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the time value at a specified percentile within the
    histogram.
  description: The GetPercentile method retrieves the time value that corresponds
    to a given percentile in the UpdateTimeHistogram. This is useful for performance
    analysis, where you might want to know the time threshold exceeded by a certain
    percentage of operations. The method operates on pre-computed histogram data and
    returns the value at which the specified percentile of recorded update times fall
    below or at that point. It's commonly used in profiling and monitoring systems
    to understand latency distributions across different parts of the game engine
    or subsystems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the time value (in milliseconds or microseconds,
    depending on implementation) at which the specified percentile of recorded update
    times occur. For example, if percentile is 95, it returns the time value below
    which 95% of all recorded update times fall.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve 99th Percentile Update Time
    code: 'UpdateTimeHistogram histogram;

      // ... populate histogram with data ...

      uint32 ninetyNinePercentile = histogram.GetPercentile(99);

      std::cout << "99th percentile update time: " << ninetyNinePercentile << " ms"
      << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the histogram has been properly populated with data
    before calling. The percentile parameter should be between 0 and 100 inclusive;
    values outside this range may result in undefined behavior or incorrect results.
    This method is typically used for statistical analysis of performance metrics.
  warnings: Ensure that the histogram contains sufficient data points to provide meaningful
    percentiles. Calling GetPercentile on an empty or minimally populated histogram
    may return inaccurate or misleading values. Also, be aware that percentile calculations
    are approximate and depend on how the underlying histogram bins are constructed.
