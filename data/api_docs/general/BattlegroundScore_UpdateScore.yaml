  class: BattlegroundScore
  method: UpdateScore
  signature: void BattlegroundScore::UpdateScore(int type, int value)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the battleground score for a specific type with the given value.
  description: The UpdateScore method is used to modify a player's score in a battleground
    based on the specified type and value. This method is typically called during
    battleground events such as capturing objectives, killing enemies, or completing
    quests that affect the player's score. The method updates the internal score tracking
    for the battleground participant, which is essential for determining win/loss
    conditions and awarding rewards at the end of the match. It ensures that all scoring
    changes are properly recorded and synchronized within the battleground system.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type of score to update. This parameter typically represents
      different categories of scoring such as kills, objectives captured, or other
      battleground-specific metrics. Valid values depend on the specific battleground
      type and its scoring system.
  - name: value
    description: The numeric value to add or subtract from the current score for the
      specified type. This can be positive or negative depending on whether points
      are being awarded or deducted. The value is usually an integer representing
      the magnitude of the score change.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Incrementing Kill Score
    code: 'BattlegroundScore* score = player->GetBattlegroundScore();

      score->UpdateScore(BG_SCORE_KILLING_BLOW, 1); // Adds one killing blow to the
      player''s score'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Objective Capture Score
    code: 'BattlegroundScore* score = player->GetBattlegroundScore();

      score->UpdateScore(BG_SCORE_OBJECTIVE_CAPTURE, 10); // Awards 10 points for
      capturing an objective'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active battleground sessions when
    the player is participating in a match. The score updates are typically synchronized
    with the battleground's scoring system and may trigger UI updates or event notifications.
    Developers should ensure that the type parameter corresponds to valid score types
    defined by the battleground implementation.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a battleground session may result in undefined
    behavior or data corruption. Ensure that all score modifications are properly
    validated before calling this method, especially when dealing with negative values
    that could potentially reduce a player's score below zero.
