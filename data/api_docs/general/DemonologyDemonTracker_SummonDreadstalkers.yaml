  brief: Summons dreadstalkers for a demonology warlock
  description: The SummonDreadstalkers method is responsible for creating and summoning
    dreadstalker pets for a demonology warlock class. This method typically handles
    the logic for spawning the dreadstalker minions that assist the player in combat.
    The summoned creatures are usually bound to the warlock's pet system and follow
    specific mechanics related to demonology specialization. This method may also
    manage the cooldowns, resource costs, or other game balance aspects associated
    with summoning these particular demons.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage in spell effect
    code: "void DemonologyWarlockSpell::HandleDreadstalkerSummon() {\n    if (Player*\
      \ player = GetCaster()->ToPlayer()) {\n        if (DemonologyDemonTracker* tracker\
      \ = player->GetDemonologyDemonTracker()) {\n            tracker->SummonDreadstalkers();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger demonology specialization system and
    may interact with other pet-related systems. It should only be called when the
    warlock has sufficient resources (such as soul shards) to summon dreadstalkers.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called outside of appropriate game contexts
    such as during combat or when the player does not have a valid demonology specialization.
    Calling this method without proper checks may result in unexpected behavior or
    crashes.
