documentation:
  brief: Updates the AI's target selection based on current threat and aggro conditions.
  description: The UpdateTargeting method is responsible for recalculating and selecting
    the appropriate combat target for a creature or NPC controlled by the ClassAI
    system. It evaluates the current threat list, considers target priority rules,
    and updates the AI's internal target reference. This method typically runs during
    each AI update cycle and ensures that the AI maintains an optimal target based
    on game mechanics such as threat generation, faction relationships, and combat
    behavior. The method does not directly engage in combat but prepares the AI for
    subsequent actions by ensuring it has a valid target.

  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void ExampleCreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateTargeting())\n\
      \        return;\n    // Proceed with combat logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI update loop and should
    not be invoked manually unless implementing custom targeting logic. The method
    may perform threat calculations and target switching, which can impact performance
    if called too frequently without proper throttling.
