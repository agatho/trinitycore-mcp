documentation:
  brief: Initializes the priority order for evoker equipment slots.
  description: The InitializeEvokerPriorities method sets up the default priority
    sequence for evoker class equipment slots. This method is typically called during
    player initialization or when switching to the evoker class to ensure proper equipment
    management and slot prioritization. It configures the internal data structures
    that determine which equipment slots are considered more important for item assignment,
    such as weapon, off-hand, and armor slots. The priorities affect how the game
    assigns items to players based on their class-specific needs and gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'EquipmentManager* mgr = player->GetEquipmentManager();

      mgr->InitializeEvokerPriorities();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during player initialization or class switching.
    It modifies internal priority arrays that affect equipment assignment behavior
    throughout the player's session.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times during a session may cause unexpected
    behavior in equipment management. Ensure it is only invoked when necessary to
    avoid performance overhead.
