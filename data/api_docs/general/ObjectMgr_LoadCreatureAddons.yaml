documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes creature addon data from the database into memory for
    use during runtime.
  description: The LoadCreatureAddons method retrieves all creature addon records
    from the database table 'creature_addon' and stores them in internal memory structures
    for efficient access during game runtime. This method is typically called during
    server startup or world loading phases to ensure that creature addons such as
    movement behaviors, auras, and other AI-related data are properly loaded and available.
    It processes each record and associates it with the corresponding creature based
    on the GUID field, enabling creatures to have customized behaviors beyond their
    base templates. The method does not return any value but modifies internal state
    of the ObjectMgr singleton.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadData()\n{\n    sObjectMgr->LoadCreatureAddons();\n    //\
      \ Other loading operations...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically during server startup by the
    core initialization process. It's important to note that this method assumes the
    database connection is already established and the 'creature_addon' table exists
    with proper schema. The loaded data is stored in a map structure for fast lookup
    by creature GUID.
  warnings: Modifying or reloading creature addons while the server is running may
    lead to inconsistent behavior or crashes if not handled carefully. This method
    should only be called during safe initialization phases when no active creatures
    are being processed.
