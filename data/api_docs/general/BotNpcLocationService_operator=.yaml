documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one BotNpcLocationService object to another
  description: The assignment operator for the BotNpcLocationService class performs
    a deep copy of all member data from the source object to the target object. This
    method is essential for managing bot NPC location data within the TrinityCore
    framework, particularly when transferring or duplicating location configurations
    between different instances. The operation ensures that both objects maintain
    independent copies of the data while preserving all location-related properties
    such as coordinates, map identifiers, and associated metadata. This functionality
    is crucial for maintaining consistent bot behavior across different game scenarios
    and player interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotNpcLocationService object whose contents will be copied
      to this instance
  returns: A reference to the current BotNpcLocationService object, allowing for chained
    assignment operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Operation
    code: 'BotNpcLocationService source;

      BotNpcLocationService target = source; // Uses assignment operator

      // Or alternatively:

      target = source; // Direct assignment'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'BotNpcLocationService first, second, third;

      // ... populate first and second with location data ...

      third = second = first; // Chained assignment

      // Both second and third now contain copies of first''s data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements deep copying to prevent shared memory references
    between objects. In the context of TrinityCore's bot AI system, this ensures that
    individual bot instances maintain their own independent location data without
    unintended side effects when multiple bots reference similar locations.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this operator with large datasets or frequently
    reassigned objects, as deep copying may have performance implications in high-frequency
    scenarios. Ensure proper initialization of the source object before assignment
    to avoid undefined behavior.
