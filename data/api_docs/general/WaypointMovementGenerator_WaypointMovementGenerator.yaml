    path, bool repeating, int duration, int speed, int speedSelectionMode, int waitTimeRangeAtPathEnd,

documentation:
  brief: Initializes a waypoint movement generator with specified path and movement
    parameters for creature AI.
  description: The WaypointMovementGenerator constructor initializes a movement generator
    that controls a creature's movement along a predefined path. It configures various
    aspects of the movement including whether the path repeats, duration, speed settings,
    wait times at path ends, wandering behavior, and spline path generation. This
    is used primarily in AI scripts to define how creatures navigate through waypoints
    in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: path
    description: Identifier for the waypoint path to follow. Must reference a valid
      path defined in the database.
  - name: repeating
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the path should loop continuously (1)
      or stop at the end (0).
  - name: duration
    description: Total time in milliseconds to complete one full cycle of the path.
      Zero means use default timing.
  - name: speed
    description: Movement speed modifier for the creature. Values are typically based
      on TrinityCore's speed system.
  - name: speedSelectionMode
    description: 'Controls how speed is applied: 0 = normal, 1 = forced walk, 2 =
      forced run, etc.'
  - name: waitTimeRangeAtPathEnd
    description: Random wait time in milliseconds at path endpoints. Zero means no
      wait.
  - name: wanderDistanceAtPathEnds
    description: Maximum distance the creature may wander from path end points when
      waiting. Zero disables wandering.
  - name: followPathBackwardsFromEndToStart
    description: Boolean flag to make the creature follow the path in reverse order
      after reaching the end (1) or not (0).
  - name: exactSplinePath
    description: Flag to enable exact spline path following for precise movement along
      waypoints (1) or approximate (0).
  - name: generatePath
    description: Boolean flag to indicate if the path should be auto-generated from
      waypoint data (1) or use existing path (0).
  - name: param10
    description: Additional parameter for future extensions or custom behavior. Currently
      unused in standard TrinityCore.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Waypoint Movement Initialization
    code: WaypointMovementGenerator generator(1234, true, 0, 100, 0, 0, 0, false,
      false, false, 0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Repeating Path with Wait and Wander
    code: WaypointMovementGenerator generator(5678, true, 30000, 150, 2, 5000, 10,
      false, true, true, 0);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system when setting
    up creature movement. The path identifier must correspond to a valid waypoint
    path in the database. Speed values are relative to base movement speed and should
    be adjusted according to creature type and intended behavior.
  warnings: Incorrect path identifiers will cause runtime errors or undefined behavior.
    Setting high wait times without proper path design may lead to AI getting stuck.
    Use with caution when combining multiple movement parameters as they can interact
    in unexpected ways.
