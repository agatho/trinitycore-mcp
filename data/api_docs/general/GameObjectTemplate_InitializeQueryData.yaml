documentation:
  brief: Initializes query data for the game object template, setting up internal
    structures for database queries.
  description: The InitializeQueryData method prepares and initializes the internal
    query data structures used by the GameObjectTemplate class. This method is typically
    called during the loading phase of game object templates to ensure that all necessary
    database query parameters and prepared statements are properly set up. It handles
    the configuration of SQL query bindings, result set handling, and any other query-related
    initialization required for efficient database access when working with game objects.
    The method ensures that subsequent queries against the game object template data
    can be executed without additional setup overhead.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = new GameObjectTemplate();

      goTemplate->InitializeQueryData();

      // Template is now ready for database queries'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the object template's initialization
    phase. It is typically invoked automatically by the core loading system when templates
    are being loaded from the database. The method performs no direct database operations
    itself, but prepares the internal structures for future query execution.
