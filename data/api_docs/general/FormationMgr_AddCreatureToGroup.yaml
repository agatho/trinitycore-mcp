  class: FormationMgr
  method: AddCreatureToGroup
  signature: void FormationMgr::AddCreatureToGroup(int leaderSpawnId, Creature * creature)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a creature to a formation group led by a specified leader creature.
  description: The AddCreatureToGroup method integrates a given creature into an existing
    formation group, designating the creature with the specified leader spawn ID as
    its leader. This functionality is essential for managing AI behavior in groups
    such as mobs that should follow a specific formation or leader. The method typically
    operates within the context of creature AI systems and group management within
    TrinityCore's framework. It assumes that the leader creature has already been
    initialized and is part of the world's creature database. The creature being added
    will inherit movement patterns and behaviors associated with its designated group.
  parameters:
  - name: leaderSpawnId
    description: The unique spawn identifier of the leader creature in the formation
      group. This ID must correspond to a valid creature that is already spawned in
      the world.
  - name: creature
    description: A pointer to the Creature object that will be added to the formation
      group. The creature must not be null and should be a valid instance within the
      game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Creature to a Formation Group
    code: 'Creature* myCreature = ...; // Assume this is a valid creature

      FormationMgr::AddCreatureToGroup(12345, myCreature);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal data structures that maintain
    formation group membership. It may perform checks to ensure the leader exists
    and is valid before adding the creature. The actual implementation details are
    not provided, but it's expected to be thread-safe in the context of TrinityCore's
    architecture.
  warnings: Ensure that the leaderSpawnId corresponds to a creature that is already
    spawned and active in the world; otherwise, the behavior may be undefined or result
    in errors. Additionally, calling this method on an already-grouped creature might
    lead to unexpected AI behavior if not handled properly.
