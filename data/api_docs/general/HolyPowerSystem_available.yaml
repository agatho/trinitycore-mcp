documentation:
  brief: Checks if holy power is available for use by the player
  description: The available() method determines whether the HolyPowerSystem has sufficient
    resources or conditions met to allow holy power usage. This typically checks if
    the player has enough holy power points, if the system is not on cooldown, and
    if all prerequisites for holy power activation are satisfied. The method returns
    true when holy power can be consumed or activated, and false otherwise. This check
    is essential for gameplay mechanics involving holy power-based abilities such
    as those used by paladins in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if holy power is available for use, false if it is not available
    due to cooldowns, insufficient resources, or other system constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage check
    code: "if (player->GetHolyPowerSystem()->available()) {\n    // Player can use\
      \ holy power abilities\n    player->UseHolyPowerAbility();\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Holy power is not available, handle accordingly\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Holy power is not available.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs lightweight checks without modifying system state.
    It may cache previous results for performance reasons in high-frequency usage
    scenarios.
