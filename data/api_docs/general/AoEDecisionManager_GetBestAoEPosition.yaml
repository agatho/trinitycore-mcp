  signature: int AoEDecisionManager::GetBestAoEPosition(uint32 spellId) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines the optimal position for casting an area of effect spell based
    on current target and environment conditions.
  description: The GetBestAoEPosition method evaluates the most effective location
    to cast an area of effect spell by analyzing the current spell ID, target positioning,
    and environmental factors such as terrain and obstacle avoidance. This method
    is typically used in AI decision-making processes for NPCs to maximize the impact
    of their AoE abilities while minimizing self-damage or inefficient targeting.
    It considers factors like spell range, target proximity, and potential friendly
    fire scenarios to compute an optimal casting position. The returned value represents
    a positional index or identifier that can be used by the spell casting system
    to determine where exactly the AoE effect should originate.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the best calculated position index for
    casting the area of effect spell. A negative value may indicate failure to find
    a suitable position, while positive values typically correspond to valid positions
    within the AI's internal coordinate system or target list indices.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in NPC AI
    code: "int bestPosition = ai->GetBestAoEPosition(12345);\nif (bestPosition >=\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with casting at the computed position\n    unit->CastSpellAtPosition(bestPosition,\
      \ 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal pathfinding and targeting systems
    to evaluate viable positions. It may cache results or use heuristics for performance
    optimization in high-frequency AI decisions. The exact implementation details
    depend on how the spell's AoE properties are defined within the TrinityCore framework.
  warnings: The method assumes valid spell data exists for the provided spellId. Using
    an invalid spell ID could result in undefined behavior or incorrect positioning
    calculations. Additionally, this method should not be called during critical sections
    of AI execution where thread safety is required.
