  brief: Saves player traits to database
  description: This method saves the player's trait points and associated data to
    the database, ensuring that all trait-related information is properly stored.
    It typically involves writing trait information such as talent points, skill levels,
    and other character-specific attributes to the database. The method is part of
    the player's save process and ensures trait data persistence across sessions.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->_SaveTraits(0);

      // Saves traits to database with transaction 0'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include handling of database transactions and ensuring
    trait data is properly saved. Performance considerations involve database write
    operations which may impact server performance if called frequently.
  warnings: This method should not be called during active gameplay without proper
    transaction handling, as it could lead to data inconsistencies or database corruption.
