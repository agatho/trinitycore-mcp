  signature: void VengeanceDemonHunterRefactored::UpdateBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the vengeance demon hunter's buffs and auras based on current combat
    state and resource levels.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and updating all
    active buffs and auras specific to the Vengeance Demon Hunter class. This includes
    checking for buff expiration, applying new buffs based on player actions or resource
    thresholds, and ensuring that the demon hunter maintains optimal combat effectiveness.
    The method typically integrates with the core TrinityCore AI system to synchronize
    buff states with the player's current abilities, talents, and combat events. It
    may also handle interactions between different buff types and ensure proper stacking
    or replacement of overlapping effects.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void VengeanceDemonHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other\
      \ AI logic ...\n    m_vengeanceDemonHunter->UpdateBuffs();\n    // ... rest\
      \ of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Event Handling
    code: "void VengeanceDemonHunterRefactored::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    // Initialize\
      \ combat state\n    UpdateBuffs();\n}\n\nvoid VengeanceDemonHunterRefactored::OnDamageDealt(Unit*\
      \ target)\n{\n    // Trigger buff updates after damage events\n    UpdateBuffs();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles and should be invoked
    regularly to maintain accurate buff states. The implementation may involve checking
    internal cooldowns, resource levels (such as fury or pain), and combat state transitions.
    It's important that this method does not block or perform heavy computations as
    it's often called from time-critical AI update paths.
  warnings: Avoid calling UpdateBuffs directly from within other buff-related methods
    to prevent potential recursion or infinite loops. Ensure that any modifications
    to the player's aura state through this method are properly synchronized with
    the TrinityCore server's aura management system.
