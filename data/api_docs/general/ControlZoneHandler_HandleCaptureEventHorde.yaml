  class: ControlZoneHandler
  method: HandleCaptureEventHorde
  signature: void ControlZoneHandler::HandleCaptureEventHorde(GameObject * controlZone)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when the Horde captures a control zone in World of Warcraft.
  description: The HandleCaptureEventHorde method is responsible for processing the
    logic that occurs when the Horde faction successfully captures a control zone
    object within the game world. This typically involves updating the zone's controlling
    faction, triggering related quest events, and potentially modifying game state
    such as resource generation or territorial dominance. The method operates on a
    GameObject parameter representing the control zone being captured, ensuring proper
    synchronization of faction ownership and associated game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: controlZone
    description: A pointer to the GameObject representing the control zone that is
      being captured by the Horde faction. This object must be a valid control zone
      with appropriate faction-related data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in event handler
    code: "void OnGameObjectUse(Player* player, GameObject* go) {\n    if (go->GetGOInfo()->type\
      \ == GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_CONTROL_ZONE) {\n        ControlZoneHandler handler;\n\
      \        handler.HandleCaptureEventHorde(go);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with faction tracking systems and may trigger
    updates to player reputation, quest progress, or territorial control flags. It
    should only be called when the Horde is actually victorious in capturing the zone.
  warnings: Ensure that the GameObject passed is indeed a valid control zone before
    calling this method. Incorrect usage may lead to undefined behavior or game state
    corruption.
