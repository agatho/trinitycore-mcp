documentation:
  brief: Adds the scene object to the world environment, making it visible and active
    in the game world.
  description: The AddToWorld method integrates a SceneObject into the active game
    world by registering it with the appropriate world systems. This includes adding
    the object to spatial partitioning grids, enabling collision detection, and ensuring
    that the object is processed by the game loop for updates and interactions. The
    method typically performs necessary initialization steps required for an object
    to become part of the live game state. It should only be called on objects that
    have been properly constructed and configured before being added to the world.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SceneObject* sceneObj = new SceneObject();

      // Configure the scene object...

      sceneObj->AddToWorld();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should not be called on objects that are already in the world,
    as it may cause duplicate registrations or memory corruption. It is typically
    invoked during object creation or when reactivating an object that was previously
    removed from the world.
  warnings: Calling AddToWorld on an already added object can lead to undefined behavior
    including crashes or inconsistent game state. Ensure proper lifecycle management
    of SceneObjects to avoid double-add scenarios.
