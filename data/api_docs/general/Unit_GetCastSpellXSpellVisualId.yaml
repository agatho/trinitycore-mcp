documentation:
  brief: Returns the SpellVisualId associated with a spell's cast.
  description: This method retrieves the SpellVisualId that is linked to a specific
    spell's cast, which determines the visual effects displayed in-game. It is used
    primarily for identifying the visual representation of spells during casting,
    particularly in relation to spell effects and animations. The method is typically
    called when examining spell data or when determining what visual effect should
    be displayed for a given spell. This functionality is essential for maintaining
    proper gameplay mechanics and ensuring accurate visual representation of spell
    effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the SpellVisualId associated with the spell's cast, which represents
    the visual effect identifier used in-game to display the spell's animation or
    effect. The value is typically a numeric ID that corresponds to entries in the
    SpellVisual.dbc file.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: uint32 visualId = unit->GetCastSpellXSpellVisualId(spellInfo);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core spell handling system in TrinityCore and
    relies on internal spell data structures. It should be used carefully as it may
    not always return valid visual IDs depending on the spell's configuration or if
    the spell has no associated visual effect.
  warnings: This method may return zero if the spell does not have a SpellVisualId
    defined, which can happen for certain spells or when the spell data is incomplete.
    Care should be taken to validate the returned value before using it in visual
    effects.
