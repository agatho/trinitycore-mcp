documentation:
  brief: Accepts a shared quest for the player, adding it to their quest log if valid.
  description: The AcceptSharedQuest method attempts to accept a shared quest for
    the player character. This method is typically used in the context of shared quests,
    where multiple players can participate in the same quest instance. It validates
    whether the quest can be accepted by the player, checks prerequisites such as
    level requirements and previous quest completion, and adds the quest to the player's
    active quest log if all conditions are met. The method returns true upon successful
    acceptance or false if the quest cannot be accepted due to various validation
    failures.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the shared quest was successfully accepted and added to
    the player's quest log, or false if the quest could not be accepted due to validation
    failures such as level requirements, previous quest completion, or other game
    logic constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Accept a shared quest by ID
    code: "if (player->GetQuestManager()->AcceptSharedQuest(12345)) {\n    // Quest\
      \ accepted successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Player accepted shared quest\
      \ 12345\");\n} else {\n    // Quest could not be accepted\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Failed to accept shared quest 12345\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player is in a valid state to
    accept quests, such as being logged in and not in combat. The method internally
    checks for quest prerequisites and may trigger related quest events or updates
    to the player's quest log.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of player state may result
    in unexpected behavior or quest acceptance failures. Ensure that the quest ID
    is valid and that the player meets all necessary conditions before calling this
    method.
