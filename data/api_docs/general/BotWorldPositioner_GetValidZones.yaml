  class: BotWorldPositioner
  method: GetValidZones
  signature: int BotWorldPositioner::GetValidZones(uint32 level, int faction) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the list of valid zones for a bot based on level and faction.
  description: The GetValidZones method determines which zones in the game world are
    appropriate for a bot to operate in, given its level and faction. This method
    is used by the bot AI system to ensure that bots are placed in zones where they
    can function effectively without being out of place or encountering invalid content.
    The method likely checks against zone restrictions, level requirements, and faction-specific
    boundaries to return a list of valid zones. It's an essential part of the bot
    positioning logic within TrinityCore's AI framework.
  parameters:
  - name: level
    description: The level of the bot for which valid zones are being determined.
      This affects zone accessibility based on level requirements and restrictions.
  - name: faction
    description: The faction of the bot (e.g., Alliance or Horde). This determines
      faction-specific zone access and restrictions that apply to the bot's positioning.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of valid zones found for the
    specified level and faction. A return value of zero indicates no valid zones were
    found, while a positive integer indicates the count of applicable zones.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get valid zones for a level 10 Alliance bot
    code: "int zoneCount = positioner.GetValidZones(10, ALLIANCE);\nif (zoneCount\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Proceed with bot positioning logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the result to iterate through valid zones
    code: "uint32 botLevel = 25;\nint faction = HORDE;\nint validZones = positioner.GetValidZones(botLevel,\
      \ faction);\nfor (int i = 0; i < validZones; ++i) {\n    // Process each valid\
      \ zone\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the bot AI system to filter zones
    before attempting to position bots. The implementation may involve checking against
    internal zone tables or configuration files that define zone restrictions based
    on level and faction. It's important to note that this method returns a count
    rather than an actual list of zone IDs, so additional methods may be needed to
    retrieve specific zone information.
  warnings: This method should not be called with invalid level values (e.g., negative
    numbers or levels beyond the game's maximum) as it could lead to undefined behavior.
    Additionally, since this is part of a bot AI system, calling it during active
    bot operations might affect performance if zones are frequently recalculated.
