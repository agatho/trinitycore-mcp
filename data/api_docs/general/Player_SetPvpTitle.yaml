  signature: void Player::SetPvpTitle(uint8 pvpTitle)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's PvP title to the specified value.
  description: This method allows a player to change their PvP title by setting it
    to a specific uint8 value. The PvP title determines the honor title displayed
    in the player's chat and character sheet, which is used for PvP-related activities
    such as arena team rankings and battleground wins. This method affects the player's
    display and can be used to update the title based on various game mechanics including
    honor points or PvP ranking. It should only be called when the player is in a
    PvP state, typically during combat or when entering a PvP zone.
  parameters:
  - name: pvpTitle
    description: The uint8 value representing the desired PvP title to set. Valid
      values range from 0 to 255, where 0 represents no title and higher values correspond
      to specific honor titles based on game mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Player PvP Title
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetPvpTitle(10);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when updating
    a player's honor status or during PvP-related events. It may trigger updates to
    the player's display and should be used carefully to avoid unintended side effects.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of PvP zones may result in incorrect display
    or behavior. Ensure that the player is actually in PvP state before calling this
    method.
