documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum timer value for the specified mirror timer type
  description: The getMaxTimer method retrieves the maximum allowable time value for
    a given mirror timer type. Mirror timers in World of Warcraft are used to track
    various time-based effects such as feign death, mind control, and other temporary
    status effects that have limited durations. This method is typically used by the
    game engine to validate timer values and ensure they do not exceed their defined
    maximum limits. The returned value represents the upper bound of time (in milliseconds)
    that can be set for the specified timer type.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int32 value representing the maximum allowable time in milliseconds
    for the specified mirror timer type. A negative value may indicate an invalid
    timer type or error condition.
  examples:
  - title: Get maximum feign death timer
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nint32 maxFeignTimer = player->getMaxTimer(MIRROR_TIMER_FEIGN_DEATH);\n\
      if (maxFeignTimer > 0)\n{\n    // Use the maximum timer value\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Maximum feign death timer: %d ms\", maxFeignTimer);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal timer management system for mirror timers.
    The implementation likely uses a lookup table or enum-based system to map timer
    types to their respective maximum values. The method should be called only when
    timer validation is required, as it may involve internal lookups that could impact
    performance if used excessively.
  warnings: Do not use this method to directly set timer values; it only returns maximum
    allowable values. Using invalid timer types may result in undefined behavior or
    negative return values. This method should not be called from time-critical code
    paths due to potential internal validation overhead.
