  class: TradeData
  method: GetSpell
  signature: int TradeData::GetSpell() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the spell ID associated with the trade data.
  description: The GetSpell method retrieves the spell identifier that is linked to
    the current trade data instance. This is typically used in the context of crafting
    or trading systems where a specific spell effect or enchantment is applied during
    a trade operation. The returned value represents the database entry for the spell,
    which may be used to validate or apply the spell's effects to items being traded.
    This method does not perform any validation on the spell ID itself, and it simply
    returns the stored value from the internal data structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the spell ID associated with this trade data instance.
    A value of 0 typically indicates no spell is linked to the trade, while positive
    integers correspond to valid spell entries in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Spell ID from Trade Data
    code: "TradeData* tradeData = new TradeData();\nint spellId = tradeData->GetSpell();\n\
      if (spellId > 0)\n{\n    // Apply the spell effect to an item\n    sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(spellId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter and does not modify any internal state. It
    assumes that the TradeData object has been properly initialized with a valid spell
    ID. The returned spell ID should be validated against the spell database before
    attempting to use it in gameplay mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that the TradeData instance is fully initialized before calling
    this method, as an uninitialized or improperly constructed object may return unexpected
    values. Also, be cautious when using the returned spell ID without verifying its
    existence in the spell database.
