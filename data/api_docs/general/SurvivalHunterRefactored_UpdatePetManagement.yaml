  brief: Manages the hunter's pet behavior and actions during survival gameplay.
  description: The UpdatePetManagement method is responsible for updating and controlling
    the hunter's pet's behavior in survival mode. It handles pet AI decisions such
    as targeting enemies, following the hunter, attacking when appropriate, and managing
    pet health and abilities. This method ensures that the pet acts in accordance
    with survival hunter tactics, including maintaining distance from threats, using
    appropriate abilities based on combat state, and responding to the hunter's commands
    or situational awareness. The method is typically called during the AI update
    cycle to keep the pet's behavior synchronized with the current game state.

  - title: Basic Pet Management Update
    code: "void UpdatePetManagement()\n{\n    // Called every AI tick\n    if (m_pet\
      \ && m_pet->IsAlive())\n    {\n        // Update pet's target\n        if (m_target)\n\
      \            m_pet->AI()->AttackStart(m_target);\n        \n        // Handle\
      \ pet movement and positioning\n        if (m_pet->GetDistance(m_hunter) > 20.0f)\n\
      \            m_pet->GetMotionMaster()->MoveFollow(m_hunter, PET_FOLLOW_DISTANCE,\
      \ PET_FOLLOW_ANGLE);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the AI update cycle to ensure
    proper pet behavior. It relies on the hunter's current target and positioning
    to make decisions about pet actions. The implementation may vary based on specific
    survival hunter builds or gear configurations.
  warnings: Improper handling of pet targeting can cause pets to attack friendly units
    or fail to engage enemies. Ensure that target validation is performed before issuing
    commands to the pet.
