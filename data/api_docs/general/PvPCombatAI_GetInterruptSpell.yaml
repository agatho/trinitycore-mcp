documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell ID of the interruptible spell currently being cast by
    the player
  description: The GetInterruptSpell method is used in PvPCombatAI to determine which
    spell is currently being interrupted. This method is typically called during combat
    scenarios where a player's casting is being disrupted, such as when they are hit
    by an interrupt spell or when their casting is broken by environmental factors.
    The method returns the unique identifier of the spell that is currently in the
    process of being interrupted. It is important to note that this method relies
    on internal state tracking within the AI system and may return 0 if no spell is
    currently being interrupted or if the player's state does not support interrupt
    detection.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the spell ID of the spell currently being
    interrupted. Returns 0 if no spell is being interrupted or if the method cannot
    determine the current spell state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for interruptible spells
    code: "uint32 interruptSpellId = ai->GetInterruptSpell();\nif (interruptSpellId\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Handle the interrupted spell\n    sLog->outString(\"Player\
      \ interrupted spell ID: %u\", interruptSpellId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PvP combat AI system and should only be called
    when the AI is actively managing a player's combat state. The returned spell ID
    corresponds to the Spell.dbc entry, making it useful for spell-specific handling
    or logging purposes.
  warnings: The method may return 0 in cases where no spell is currently being interrupted
    or if the AI state is not properly initialized. Always validate the return value
    before using it in critical gameplay logic.
