  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: EvaluateItemUpgrades
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::EvaluateItemUpgrades(const int & rewards, Player *
    bot)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates item upgrades for quest rewards and updates the bot's inventory
    accordingly.
  description: The EvaluateItemUpgrades method assesses the quality and potential
    upgrades of items that are awarded as quest rewards. It determines whether the
    player's current inventory contains better versions of the reward items, and if
    so, it may replace or enhance them. This functionality is typically used in automated
    questing bots to optimize item acquisition and ensure the most valuable gear is
    retained. The method operates on a single reward parameter and modifies the bot's
    inventory state directly. It assumes that the player has already completed the
    quest and received the rewards.
  parameters:
  - name: rewards
    description: An integer representing the index or identifier of the specific quest
      reward to evaluate for upgrades.
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will be
      evaluated for item upgrades. Must not be null.
  returns: None. This method performs in-place evaluation and modification of the
    bot's inventory.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of EvaluateItemUpgrades
    code: 'int rewardIndex = 0;

      Player* myBot = ...; // Assume initialized player object

      QuestTurnIn questTurnIn;

      questTurnIn.EvaluateItemUpgrades(rewardIndex, myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the automated questing system and is typically invoked
    after a quest completion event. It does not handle multiple rewards at once; each
    reward must be evaluated separately. The evaluation logic may consider item level,
    stats, and potential enchantments.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid
    runtime errors. This method modifies the player's inventory directly, which could
    affect quest progression or item tracking if not used carefully in automated systems.
