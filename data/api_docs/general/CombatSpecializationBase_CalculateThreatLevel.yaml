    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the threat level generated by this combat specialization
    against a specified target.
  description: The CalculateThreatLevel method computes the amount of threat generated
    by the current combat specialization when applied to a given target unit. This
    value is used internally by the game's threat system to determine which units
    are prioritized for attacks and how aggro is distributed among enemies. The calculation
    typically considers factors such as the attacker's damage output, weapon speed,
    skill levels, and target characteristics. This method is commonly invoked during
    combat actions like melee attacks or spell casts to update the threat table. It
    is important to note that this method does not directly modify the threat table
    but rather provides a value that can be used by other systems to adjust threat
    levels.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated threat level. Higher values indicate
    greater threat generation, which typically results in the unit being more likely
    to be targeted by the enemy. The exact scale and interpretation may vary based
    on game mechanics and specialization-specific modifiers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Calculation
    code: 'float threatLevel = player->GetCombatSpecialization()->CalculateThreatLevel(targetUnit);

      // Use threatLevel to determine aggro priority or modify combat behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat events and should be used with
    care in performance-critical sections. The returned value may vary depending on
    the specific specialization and its active abilities. It's recommended to cache
    this value if it will be used multiple times within a single combat cycle.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat context unless you're certain
    about the target unit's state, as it may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    threat calculations. The method assumes that the target unit is valid and in combat.
