  signature: bool CreatureAI::IsEngaged() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the creature is currently engaged in combat with a target.
  description: The IsEngaged method determines whether the creature AI is actively
    engaged in combat, meaning it has an active target and is in the process of attacking
    or being attacked. This method typically returns true when the creature's current
    target is valid and the creature is in combat state, and false otherwise. The
    check involves verifying that the creature has a valid target and that the target
    is within engagement range or has been flagged as engaged. This method is commonly
    used in AI behavior logic to determine if special combat actions should be executed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is currently engaged in combat with a valid
    target, false otherwise. The method will return false if the creature has no target,
    the target is invalid, or the creature is not in an active combat state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!IsEngaged())\n    {\n\
      \        // Creature is not engaged, perform idle behavior\n        return;\n\
      \    }\n    \n    // Creature is engaged, perform combat actions\n    DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Combat Behavior
    code: "bool CreatureAI::CanUseSpecialAbility()\n{\n    if (IsEngaged() && GetVictim()->GetHealthPct()\
      \ < 30)\n    {\n        // Only use special ability when engaged and target\
      \ is low on health\n        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the creature's internal combat state management. It
    typically checks the validity of the current victim, engagement range, and combat
    flags. The method may not reflect real-time changes immediately if the AI update
    cycle is delayed. This is a read-only method that does not modify any internal
    state.
  warnings: Do not use this method to determine if a creature has ever been engaged
    in combat during its lifetime - it only reflects current engagement status. Be
    aware that this check may return false even if the creature was recently in combat
    but has since lost its target or exited combat state.
