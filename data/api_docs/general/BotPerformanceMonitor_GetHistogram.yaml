  method: GetHistogram
  signature: const UpdateTimeHistogram & BotPerformanceMonitor::GetHistogram() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the histogram data structure containing performance timing statistics
    for bot updates.
  description: The GetHistogram method provides access to a histogram that tracks
    the timing distribution of bot update operations. This histogram is used to monitor
    and analyze the performance characteristics of bot behavior execution, helping
    identify potential bottlenecks or performance regressions in the AI system. The
    returned UpdateTimeHistogram object contains statistical data such as average,
    minimum, maximum, and percentile distributions of update times. This method is
    typically called by monitoring systems or diagnostic tools to gather performance
    metrics for bot subsystems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an UpdateTimeHistogram object containing the performance
    timing statistics for bot updates. The histogram includes data points representing
    the distribution of update execution times, enabling analysis of performance patterns
    and potential issues in the bot AI system.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Performance Histogram
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      const UpdateTimeHistogram& histogram = monitor.GetHistogram();

      std::cout << "Average update time: " << histogram.GetAverage() << " ms" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned histogram object is read-only and should not be modified directly.
    The histogram data is updated incrementally as bot updates occur, making it suitable
    for real-time performance monitoring. This method is thread-safe and can be called
    from any thread context.
