  brief: Removes enchantment duration references from an item.
  description: This method removes all enchantment duration references from a given
    item, effectively clearing any active enchantment effects that would normally
    be applied to the item. It is typically used during item removal or when item
    is being destroyed or modified in some way. The method ensures that no enchantment
    durations are maintained for the specified item, which can be important for preventing
    memory leaks or incorrect behavior in game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to the Item object from which enchantment duration references
      should be removed. This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid
      item instance.
  returns: null

      Item* item = new Item();

      player->RemoveEnchantmentDurationsReferences(item);'

  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when items
    are being modified or removed from player inventory. It should be used carefully
    as it may affect gameplay mechanics related to item enchantments and their durations.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect behavior in item enchantment
    systems, potentially causing memory leaks or incorrect application of enchantment
    effects. Ensure that the item pointer is valid before calling this method.
