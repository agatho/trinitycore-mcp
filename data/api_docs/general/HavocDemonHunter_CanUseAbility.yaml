  class: HavocDemonHunter
  method: CanUseAbility
  signature: bool HavocDemonHunter::CanUseAbility(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a Havoc Demon Hunter can use a specified ability based on current
    game state and resource requirements.
  description: The CanUseAbility method evaluates whether a Havoc Demon Hunter character
    is eligible to cast or activate a given spell or ability. It considers various
    factors such as mana cost, cooldown status, player state (e.g., stunned, rooted),
    and class-specific restrictions. This method is typically used in AI decision-making
    logic to determine valid actions during combat. The check includes verifying that
    the player has sufficient resources and that the ability is not on cooldown or
    otherwise restricted by game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell or ability to be checked for usability.
      This ID corresponds to entries in the Spell.dbc file and must represent a valid
      Demon Hunter ability.
  returns: Returns true if the Havoc Demon Hunter can use the specified ability, considering
    all relevant game state conditions; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (player->ToHavocDemonHunter()->CanUseAbility(203782)) {\n    // Execute\
      \ Vengeful Retreat if available\n    player->CastSpell(target, 203782, true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat AI Decision Making
    code: "if (unit->ToHavocDemonHunter() && unit->ToHavocDemonHunter()->CanUseAbility(198013))\
      \ {\n    // Use Fel Rush if possible\n    unit->CastSpell(target, 198013, true);\n\
      } else if (unit->ToHavocDemonHunter()->CanUseAbility(203782)) {\n    // Otherwise\
      \ try Vengeful Retreat\n    unit->CastSpell(target, 203782, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform actual casting or resource deduction; it only
    evaluates eligibility. It may be called frequently during AI updates, so performance
    is important. The implementation likely checks internal cooldowns, resource availability,
    and player status flags.
  warnings: Ensure that spellId corresponds to a valid Demon Hunter ability before
    calling this method, as invalid IDs might lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    results. This function should not be used in place of proper spell validation
    logic in combat systems.
