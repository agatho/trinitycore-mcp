  class: DB2Manager
  method: HasContentTuningLabel
  signature: bool DB2Manager::HasContentTuningLabel(uint32 contentTuningId, int32
    label) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific content tuning label exists for the given content tuning
    ID.
  description: The HasContentTuningLabel method determines whether a particular content
    tuning label is associated with a specified content tuning ID. This functionality
    is used in World of Warcraft's database system to validate or retrieve information
    about content tuning configurations, which are essential for managing difficulty
    levels and dynamic content adjustments in instances and raids. The method performs
    a lookup within the DB2 data structures to verify the existence of the label for
    the provided tuning ID.
  parameters:
  - name: contentTuningId
    description: The unique identifier for the content tuning configuration. This
      value corresponds to an entry in the ContentTuning.db2 file and typically represents
      a specific difficulty or instance variant.
  - name: label
    description: The label ID to check for existence within the specified content
      tuning. This is usually a numeric identifier that maps to a particular label
      defined in the game's localization or content tuning data.
  returns: Returns true if the specified label exists for the given content tuning
    ID; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a Content Tuning Label Exists
    code: "if (sDB2Manager->HasContentTuningLabel(1234, 5678)) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ logic assuming the label exists\n    printf(\"Label 5678 is associated with\
      \ content tuning 1234\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle case where label does\
      \ not exist\n    printf(\"Label 5678 is not found for content tuning 1234\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal DB2 data caching and should be used with caution
    in performance-critical sections. It assumes that the DB2 files have been properly
    loaded and indexed before being called.
