documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current role assigned to the bot within the combat behavior
    system
  description: The GetCurrentRole method returns the BotRole enum value that represents
    the current tactical role of the bot in combat. This role determines how the bot
    behaves during encounters, including target selection, spell usage, and positioning
    strategies. The method provides read-only access to the bot's active role and
    is typically used by the combat behavior integration system to make decisions
    about which actions to perform based on the assigned role. The returned role may
    change dynamically during combat based on encounter conditions or player input.
  parameters: []
  returns: A BotRole enum value indicating the current tactical role of the bot. Possible
    values include roles such as TANK, HEALER, DAMAGE_DEALER, or SPECIALIST depending
    on the implementation and context of the combat behavior system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BotRole currentRole = combatBehavior->GetCurrentRole();\nif (currentRole\
      \ == BotRole::TANK)\n{\n    // Execute tank-specific actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Role-Based Action Selection
    code: "CombatBehaviorIntegration* behavior = playerBot->GetCombatBehavior();\n\
      BotRole role = behavior->GetCurrentRole();\nswitch (role)\n{\n    case BotRole::HEALER:\n\
      \        // Use healing spells\n        break;\n    case BotRole::DAMAGE_DEALER:\n\
      \        // Focus on damage output\n        break;\n    default:\n        //\
      \ Default combat behavior\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    returned BotRole value should not be modified directly as it's managed by the
    combat behavior system. The role may be updated automatically during combat based
    on encounter dynamics or player commands.
  warnings: Do not assume the role remains constant throughout a combat encounter.
    The bot's role can change dynamically, so always retrieve the current role before
    making role-specific decisions. Avoid caching the return value for extended periods
    as it may become stale.
