documentation:
  brief: Destroys a CooldownStackingOptimizer instance and releases all associated
    resources.
  description: The destructor for the CooldownStackingOptimizer class is responsible
    for cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the optimizer.
    This method ensures that when a CooldownStackingOptimizer object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted, all internal data structures are properly deallocated
    to prevent memory leaks. In the context of TrinityCore's spell and cooldown management
    system, this destructor may clean up tracking information for cooldown stacks
    related to abilities or items. The destruction process typically involves releasing
    any cached cooldown data, clearing internal lists or maps, and ensuring that no
    dangling pointers remain in the system.

  - title: Basic Object Destruction
    code: 'CooldownStackingOptimizer* optimizer = new CooldownStackingOptimizer();

      // ... use the optimizer ...

      delete optimizer; // Triggers ~CooldownStackingOptimizer()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically invoked during object destruction and should
    not be called manually. It's important to ensure that all references to the optimizer
    are cleared before deletion to avoid use-after-free errors.
