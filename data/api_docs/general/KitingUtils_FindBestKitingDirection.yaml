  class: KitingUtils
  method: FindBestKitingDirection
  signature: int KitingUtils::FindBestKitingDirection(Player * bot, const int & threats)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the optimal kiting direction for a bot player based on threat
    distribution.
  description: The FindBestKitingDirection method calculates and returns the best
    directional movement for a player bot to maintain distance from threats while
    engaging in combat. This utility is commonly used in AI-driven gameplay mechanics
    where the bot must balance offensive actions with defensive positioning. The method
    evaluates the current threat configuration and determines an optimal escape or
    movement direction that maximizes survival chances. It considers factors such
    as threat angles, bot's current position, and potential movement paths to avoid
    incoming attacks.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that requires kiting
      direction calculation.
  - name: threats
    description: Reference to an integer value indicating the number of active threats
      or enemies surrounding the bot.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the optimal kiting direction. The
    value typically corresponds to a specific angle or movement vector (e.g., 0-359
    degrees) that the bot should follow to best evade threats while maintaining engagement.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: 'int direction = KitingUtils::FindBestKitingDirection(bot, threatCount);

      bot->SetFacing(direction);

      bot->MoveForward();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat state machine
    code: "if (bot->IsInCombat()) {\n    int kitingDir = KitingUtils::FindBestKitingDirection(bot,\
      \ GetThreatCount(bot));\n    if (kitingDir != -1) {\n        bot->SetFacing(kitingDir);\n\
      \        bot->MoveBackward();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other AI utilities to create
    a comprehensive kiting behavior. The implementation likely involves vector mathematics
    and threat angle calculations to determine the safest escape path. Performance-wise,
    this function should be lightweight as it's called frequently during combat states.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot has valid threat data before calling this method;
    otherwise, incorrect movement directions may be calculated. This method assumes
    the bot is in a combat state and may not behave correctly if called outside of
    such contexts.
