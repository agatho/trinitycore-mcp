documentation:
  brief: Handles emergency healing for group members in a dungeon environment
  description: The HandleHealingEmergency method is responsible for managing urgent
    healing situations within a dungeon scenario. It evaluates the current health
    status of group members and applies appropriate healing mechanisms to prevent
    player deaths during critical encounters. This method typically activates when
    a group member reaches a critical health threshold or when an emergency healing
    trigger occurs. The function ensures that healing resources are allocated efficiently
    while maintaining game balance and preventing exploitation of healing mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing members who may require emergency
      healing. This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid group
      in the dungeon environment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Dungeon Encounter
    code: "void SomeDungeonAI::OnPlayerDeath(Player* player)\n{\n    Group* group\
      \ = player->GetGroup();\n    if (group)\n    {\n        dungeonBehavior.HandleHealingEmergency(group);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Emergency Healing with Health Threshold Check
    code: "void DungeonBehavior::HandleHealingEmergency(Group* group)\n{\n    if (!group)\
      \ return;\n    \n    for (GroupReference* ref = group->GetFirstMember(); ref;\
      \ ref = ref->next())\n    {\n        Player* member = ref->getSource();\n  \
      \      if (member && member->IsInWorld() && member->GetHealth() < member->GetMaxHealth()\
      \ * 0.2f)\n        {\n            // Apply emergency healing\n            member->SetHealth(member->GetMaxHealth()\
      \ * 0.5f);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active dungeon encounters where
    group-based healing mechanics are applicable. The implementation assumes that
    the Group object contains valid player references and that appropriate health
    checks have been performed before calling this function.
  warnings: Ensure that the group parameter is validated before calling this method
    to prevent null pointer exceptions. Improper handling of emergency healing can
    lead to game balance issues or unintended player behavior during critical encounters.
