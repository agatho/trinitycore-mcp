  class: PassiveAI
  method: Permissible
  signature: int PassiveAI::Permissible(const int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the permissiveness level of the PassiveAI for a given creature.
  description: The Permissible method in PassiveAI is used to evaluate whether this
    AI behavior should be assigned to a specific creature. It returns an integer value
    indicating the level of permissiveness, which influences the AI selection process
    within TrinityCore's creature AI system. A higher return value indicates a stronger
    preference for this AI type. This method typically checks creature properties
    such as entry ID, faction, or other criteria to determine suitability. The returned
    value is used by the AI system to decide which AI handler should be assigned to
    a creature instance.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the creature's entry ID or identifier
      used for permissiveness evaluation.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the permissiveness level. Positive
    values suggest suitability, zero means not suitable, and negative values may indicate
    strong disapproval or special handling requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Selection
    code: "int PassiveAI::Permissible(const int* entry)\n{\n    if (*entry == 12345)\
      \ // Example creature ID\n        return PERMIT_BASE_PROACTIVE;\n    else if\
      \ (*entry == 67890)\n        return PERMIT_BASE_IDLE;\n    else\n        return\
      \ PERMIT_BASE_NO;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore AI system's framework and is called
    during creature initialization. The return values are typically defined by constants
    like PERMIT_BASE_PROACTIVE, PERMIT_BASE_IDLE, or PERMIT_BASE_NO in the core codebase.
  warnings: Incorrect implementation may lead to AI assignment failures or unexpected
    behavior. Developers should ensure that the logic properly evaluates creature
    identifiers and returns appropriate permissiveness levels based on game requirements.
