  method: IsQuestObjectiveForSpawnTracking
  signature: bool ObjectMgr::IsQuestObjectiveForSpawnTracking(uint32 spawnTrackingId,
    uint32 questObjectiveId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a quest objective is tracked for spawn events.
  description: Determines whether a specific quest objective, identified by its ID,
    is configured to be tracked for spawn-related events in the game world. This functionality
    is typically used to manage quest progress tracking when creatures or game objects
    are spawned or despawned. The method verifies internal mappings between spawn
    tracking identifiers and quest objectives to ensure accurate quest state updates
    during dynamic world events.
  parameters:
  - name: spawnTrackingId
    description: The unique identifier for the spawn tracking entry that defines how
      spawns should be monitored for quest purposes.
  - name: questObjectiveId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest objective being checked for spawn
      tracking association.
  returns: Returns true if the specified quest objective is associated with the given
    spawn tracking ID and should be tracked; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a Quest Objective is Tracked
    code: "if (sObjectMgr->IsQuestObjectiveForSpawnTracking(12345, 67890)) {\n   \
      \ // Handle spawn tracking logic for this quest objective\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal data structures such as maps or lookup
    tables that associate spawn tracking entries with quest objectives. It's important
    to ensure that these mappings are correctly initialized before calling this method.
