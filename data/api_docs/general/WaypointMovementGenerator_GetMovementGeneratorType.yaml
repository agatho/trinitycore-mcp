documentation:
  brief: Returns the movement generator type identifier for waypoint-based movement.
  description: The GetMovementGeneratorType method retrieves the unique type identifier
    associated with the WaypointMovementGenerator class. This identifier is used internally
    by the TrinityCore AI system to distinguish different types of movement generators
    and route behavior appropriately. The returned value typically corresponds to
    a predefined enumeration or constant that represents waypoint-based movement logic
    within the game's movement system.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the movement generator type identifier for waypoint-based
    movement. This value is usually a constant defined in the MovementGeneratorTypes
    enum, commonly representing MGTYPE_WAYPOINT (typically 7) or similar.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Movement Generator Type
    code: "WaypointMovementGenerator* wpGen = new WaypointMovementGenerator();\nint\
      \ type = wpGen->GetMovementGeneratorType();\nif (type == MGTYPE_WAYPOINT)\n\
      {\n    // Handle waypoint movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI decision-making processes to determine
    how a creature should move. The returned integer value is often compared against
    predefined constants in the MovementGeneratorTypes enumeration to route execution
    flow appropriately.
