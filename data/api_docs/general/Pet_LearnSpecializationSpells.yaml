  signature: void Pet::LearnSpecializationSpells()
documentation:
  brief: Teaches the pet all specialization spells based on its current specialization.
  description: The LearnSpecializationSpells method is responsible for granting a
    pet all applicable specialization-specific spells. This method typically gets
    invoked when a pet's specialization changes or when the pet is initialized with
    a specific specialization. It ensures that the pet has access to the correct set
    of abilities that correspond to its current specialization level, such as those
    available to hunter pets with different specializations like Beast Mastery, Marksmanship,
    or Survival. The method iterates through the pet's specialization data and adds
    relevant spells to the pet's spell book. This process is crucial for maintaining
    proper gameplay balance and ensuring that pets perform according to their designated
    roles within the game mechanics.

    code: "Pet* myPet = player->GetPet();\nif (myPet)\n{\n    myPet->LearnSpecializationSpells();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the pet's specialization is properly
    set. It assumes that the pet has a valid specialization state and will not perform
    any action if the specialization data is invalid or uninitialized.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring the pet has a proper specialization
    may result in no spells being learned, or potentially unexpected behavior if the
    specialization data is corrupted.
