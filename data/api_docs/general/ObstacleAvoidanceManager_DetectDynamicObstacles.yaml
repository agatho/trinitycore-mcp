  method: DetectDynamicObstacles
  signature: int ObstacleAvoidanceManager::DetectDynamicObstacles(const DetectionContext
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Detects and processes dynamic obstacles in the game world for AI pathfinding.
  description: The DetectDynamicObstacles method scans the current detection context
    for dynamically generated obstacles such as moving creatures, environmental effects,
    or temporary barriers that could impede movement. It integrates with the TrinityCore's
    AI system to update obstacle data used by pathfinding algorithms. The method typically
    runs during AI update cycles and modifies internal obstacle state based on detected
    entities within the specified detection range. This functionality is crucial for
    ensuring NPCs navigate realistically around changing environmental conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer indicating the number of dynamic obstacles successfully
    detected and processed. A return value of zero indicates no obstacles were found,
    while positive values represent the count of processed obstacles. Negative values
    may indicate errors during detection or processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic obstacle detection usage
    code: "ObstacleAvoidanceManager* manager = player->GetAI()->GetObstacleAvoidanceManager();\n\
      int obstacleCount = manager->DetectDynamicObstacles(context);\nif (obstacleCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Handle detected obstacles\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"ai\", \"Detected\
      \ %d dynamic obstacles\", obstacleCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update ticks and should not be
    invoked excessively to avoid performance degradation. The detection context must
    contain valid data about the current position, orientation, and detection range
    of the entity performing the scan.
  warnings: Improperly configured detection contexts may lead to false positives or
    missed obstacles. Ensure that the DetectionContext is properly initialized with
    accurate position and radius values before calling this method.
