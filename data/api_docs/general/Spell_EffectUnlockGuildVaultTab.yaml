documentation:
  brief: Unlocks guild vault tab access for the player.
  description: This method enables the player to access their guild's vault tab, allowing
    them to retrieve items from the guild bank. It typically occurs during spell effects
    that grant access to guild resources or when a player gains permission to use
    guild bank tabs. The method is part of the broader spell system that manages guild-related
    gameplay mechanics and player permissions.

    code: "void Spell::EffectUnlockGuildVaultTab() {\n    // Implementation would\
      \ unlock the guild vault tab\n    // for the current player\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves checking if the player has proper guild permissions
    before unlocking the vault tab. It may also interact with the guild bank system
    to ensure correct synchronization of tab access.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player is actually in a guild,
    as attempting to unlock a vault tab without guild membership can lead to errors
    or invalid behavior.
