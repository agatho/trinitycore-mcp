  brief: Appends channel notification data to the provided packet for announcements.
  description: The Append method is responsible for adding channel-related notification
    data to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify packet. This method is typically
    used in the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation to
    populate announcement packets with relevant channel information, such as join/leave
    messages, moderation actions, or other channel-specific events. The method modifies
    the provided packet in-place without returning any value. It is part of the AnnouncementsOnAppend
    class which handles the construction of channel notifications for clients.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify packet object
      that will be populated with channel notification data. This parameter is modified
      in-place by the method.

  - title: Basic usage of Append method
    code: 'WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      AnnouncementsOnAppend announcementHandler;

      announcementHandler.Append(notifyPacket);

      // notifyPacket now contains the channel notification data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on a packet object that is typically sent to clients.
    The implementation likely populates various fields of the ChannelNotify packet
    based on internal state or configuration settings. Developers should ensure that
    the provided packet object is properly initialized before calling this method.
