  signature: void ArenaAI::Execute5v5Strategy(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the 5v5 arena strategy for the player
  description: The Execute5v5Strategy method is responsible for implementing the artificial
    intelligence behavior specific to 5v5 battlegrounds within the ArenaAI class.
    This method determines how a player-controlled unit should act during a 5v5 arena
    match, including targeting decisions, spell casting priorities, and movement patterns
    based on the current game state and opponent behavior. It integrates with the
    broader arena matchmaking and combat systems to provide strategic gameplay for
    AI-controlled players in competitive 5v5 scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player index or identifier
      within the arena team. This parameter is used to determine which specific player's
      strategy should be executed and may influence targeting, positioning, and resource
      allocation decisions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of Execute5v5Strategy
    code: 'int playerIndex = 0;

      arenaAI->Execute5v5Strategy(&playerIndex);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during arena battleground updates and should
    be invoked regularly to maintain proper AI behavior. The implementation likely
    involves state machines or decision trees that evaluate combat conditions, health
    levels, mana availability, and enemy positions to make tactical decisions.
  warnings: The method expects a valid player index to be passed; passing an invalid
    or uninitialized pointer may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure the
    player parameter points to a valid arena team member before calling this method.
