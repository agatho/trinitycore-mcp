  class: LootCoordination
  method: GetGlobalCoordinationMetrics
  signature: LootCoordinationMetrics LootCoordination::GetGlobalCoordinationMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves global loot coordination metrics for the current instance
  description: The GetGlobalCoordinationMetrics method returns a LootCoordinationMetrics
    structure containing statistical data about loot distribution across all players
    in the current loot coordination context. This includes information such as total
    loot items, coordinated decisions made, and overall success rates of loot allocation.
    The method provides insight into how efficiently and fairly loot is being distributed
    among group members during a coordinated loot session.
  parameters: []
  returns: A LootCoordinationMetrics object containing aggregated statistics about
    the current loot coordination session, including counts of items, decisions, and
    success metrics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'LootCoordinationMetrics metrics = lootCoordination->GetGlobalCoordinationMetrics();

      printf("Total Items: %d\n", metrics.totalItems);

      printf("Successful Decisions: %d\n", metrics.successfulDecisions);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active loot coordination sessions.
    The returned metrics are updated in real-time as decisions are made and items
    are distributed. Performance is optimized for frequent calls but may have slight
    overhead during high-activity periods.
