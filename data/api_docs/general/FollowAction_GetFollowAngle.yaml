  class: FollowAction
  method: GetFollowAngle
  signature: float FollowAction::GetFollowAngle() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the angle at which a unit should follow its target.
  description: The GetFollowAngle method computes the angular offset required for
    a unit to maintain proper positioning while following another unit. This angle
    is typically used in AI behavior to determine the direction a creature or player
    should move relative to their target. The calculation considers the current orientation
    and position of both the follower and the target, ensuring smooth and realistic
    movement patterns during follow actions. This method is commonly invoked within
    the context of creature AI systems where units need to maintain a specific spatial
    relationship with their targets.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the angle in radians that defines the direction
    offset for following behavior. Positive values indicate a clockwise rotation from
    the target's facing direction, while negative values represent counter-clockwise
    rotation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Context
    code: "float angle = followAction->GetFollowAngle();\n// Use the calculated angle\
      \ to adjust movement direction\nif (angle > 0.1f)\n{\n    unit->SetFacingTo(angle);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Movement Logic
    code: 'float targetAngle = followAction->GetFollowAngle();

      float currentFacing = unit->GetOrientation();

      float desiredFacing = currentFacing + targetAngle;

      unit->SetFacingTo(desiredFacing);

      unit->MoveTowardsTarget(targetAngle);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking of both the follower and target
    units. It assumes that the target unit exists and has valid position data. The
    returned angle is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related methods
    to ensure proper positioning during follow behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid target or when the target is not in
    the same map may result in undefined behavior or incorrect calculations. Always
    verify that the target unit is accessible before invoking this method.
