documentation:
  brief: Returns the effect index of the aura effect.
  description: The GetEffIndex method retrieves the index of the current aura effect
    within its parent aura. In World of Warcraft's spell system, auras can have multiple
    effects (often referred to as 'effects' or 'modifiers'), and each effect is identified
    by an index. This index typically corresponds to the order in which the effects
    are defined in the spell database. The returned value is used internally by the
    game engine to distinguish between different effects of the same aura, such as
    applying damage and healing effects simultaneously from one spell. This method
    does not require any parameters and always returns a valid integer representing
    the effect's position.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the index of this aura effect within its parent
    aura. The index usually starts at 0 for the first effect, and increments for each
    subsequent effect in the aura.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Effect Index from Aura
    code: "AuraEffect* auraEffect = player->GetAura(12345, 0);\nif (auraEffect)\n\
      {\n    int effIndex = auraEffect->GetEffIndex();\n    // Use effIndex to determine\
      \ which effect this is\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterate Through Aura Effects
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetSelectedUnit();\nif (target)\n{\n    Aura* aura\
      \ = target->GetAura(12345);\n    if (aura)\n    {\n        for (uint8 i = 0;\
      \ i < aura->GetEffectCount(); ++i)\n        {\n            AuraEffect* eff =\
      \ aura->GetEffect(i);\n            if (eff)\n            {\n               \
      \ int index = eff->GetEffIndex();\n                // Process effect based on\
      \ its index\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The effect index is determined at aura creation time and remains constant
    for the lifetime of the aura. It's important to note that this index may not correspond
    directly to the spell effect ID in the database, but rather represents the position
    of the effect within the aura's internal structure.
