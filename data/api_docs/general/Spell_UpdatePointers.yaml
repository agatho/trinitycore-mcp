  signature: bool Spell::UpdatePointers()
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal pointers and references within the spell object to ensure
    consistency with current game state
  description: The UpdatePointers method is responsible for maintaining the integrity
    of spell object references by updating internal pointers to target units, items,
    and other game objects. This method ensures that all references within the spell
    remain valid after potential changes in the game world such as unit movement,
    destruction, or state modifications. It typically gets called during spell execution
    phases when the spell needs to verify that its targets and sources are still valid
    and accessible. The method performs necessary validation checks on all referenced
    objects and updates internal pointers accordingly to prevent dangling references
    or access violations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all pointer updates were successful and references remain
    valid; returns false if any pointer update failed or if the spell object became
    invalid during the update process
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell execution context
    code: "if (spell->UpdatePointers()) {\n    // Proceed with spell execution\n \
      \   spell->Cast();\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid spell state\n    spell->Finish();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the spell system during spell
    lifecycle management. Developers should not normally need to call this method
    directly unless implementing custom spell behavior or debugging pointer issues.
    The method may perform expensive validation operations and should be used judiciously
    in performance-critical code paths.
  warnings: Calling UpdatePointers() on a spell that has already been finished or
    destroyed can lead to undefined behavior. This method should only be called when
    the spell is in an active state and references are expected to be valid.
