  method: AddHeirloom
  signature: void CollectionMgr::AddHeirloom(uint32 itemId, uint32 flags)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a heirloom item to the player's collection with specified flags.
  description: The AddHeirloom method is used to grant a player a specific heirloom
    item within the CollectionMgr system. This method allows for adding heirlooms
    with custom flags that may affect how the item is displayed or handled in the
    game. It typically integrates with the player's collection tracking system, ensuring
    that the heirloom is properly recorded and available for use. The method does
    not return any value, indicating it performs a direct action rather than computation.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the heirloom item to be added. This must
      correspond to a valid item entry in the game's database.
  - name: flags
    description: Flags that define special properties or behaviors for the heirloom.
      These flags can control aspects such as visibility, usability, or collection
      status of the item.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CollectionMgr* mgr = player->GetCollectionMgr();

      mgr->AddHeirloom(12345, 0x01);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Heirloom with Special Flags
    code: 'CollectionMgr* mgr = player->GetCollectionMgr();

      uint32 flags = COLLECTION_FLAG_VISIBLE | COLLECTION_FLAG_USABLE;

      mgr->AddHeirloom(67890, flags);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player's collection manager is
    initialized and valid. It assumes that the item ID exists in the game's item database
    and that the flags are properly defined according to the collection system's flag
    definitions.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid itemId may result in undefined behavior
    or errors within the collection system. Ensure all parameters are validated before
    calling this function, especially when dealing with dynamic or user-provided data.
