  class: Player
  method: DurabilityLoss
  signature: void Player::DurabilityLoss(Item * item, double percent)
documentation:
  brief: Applies durability loss to an item based on a specified percentage.
  description: The Player::DurabilityLoss method handles the reduction of durability
    for a given item according to a specified percentage. This method is typically
    used in game mechanics where items lose durability during combat or other player
    actions. It operates on the item's current durability and applies the loss based
    on the provided percentage value, ensuring that the item's condition is properly
    updated. The method may be called during various gameplay scenarios such as weapon
    damage, armor degradation, or when items are used in specific game events.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: A pointer to the Item object whose durability will be reduced. This
      parameter must not be null and represents an item currently equipped or in inventory.
  - name: percent
    description: The percentage value representing how much durability should be lost
      from the item. This is typically a double value between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0
      represents 100% loss of durability.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Durability Loss Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      Item* item = new Item();

      player->DurabilityLoss(item, 0.5); // Loss of 50% durability'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by game systems when items are
    damaged during combat or other gameplay events. The implementation may involve
    checking item's current durability and applying the specified percentage loss
    accordingly.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to incorrect item condition
    states, potentially causing items to become unusable or lose their functionality
    prematurely.
