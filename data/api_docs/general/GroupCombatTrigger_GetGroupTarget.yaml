  method: GetGroupTarget
  signature: Unit * GroupCombatTrigger::GetGroupTarget(Group * group) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the primary target unit of a group during combat.
  description: The GetGroupTarget method identifies and returns the main target unit
    that a specified group is currently engaging in combat with. This function is
    typically used within AI systems to determine the focus of group-based combat
    behaviors. The returned Unit pointer represents the target that the group's members
    are attacking or defending against, which may be an enemy player, creature, or
    game object. The method does not perform any modifications to the group state
    or target assignments; it simply retrieves the current combat target information.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Unit object representing the group's current combat target.
    Returns nullptr if the group is not in combat or has no defined target.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "if (Unit* target = groupCombatTrigger->GetGroupTarget(group)) {\n    //\
      \ Proceed with attack logic against the target\n    if (target->IsDead()) {\n\
      \        // Handle target death\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Target Validity Before Action
    code: "Unit* target = groupCombatTrigger->GetGroupTarget(group);\nif (target &&\
      \ !target->IsDead() && target->IsInWorld()) {\n    // Safe to perform actions\
      \ on the target\n    group->GetLeader()->AI()->AttackStart(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal combat state of the group and may return
    different values depending on the current engagement status. It is recommended
    to verify that the returned Unit pointer is valid before using it in any operations,
    as nullptr can be returned if no target exists or if the group is not actively
    engaged in combat.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned Unit pointer will remain valid beyond
    the scope of the current function call. The target may change during combat, and
    the group's combat state should be checked regularly to ensure accurate behavior.
    Also, always check for nullptr before dereferencing the returned pointer to prevent
    potential crashes.
