  method: ActivateEmergencyMode
  signature: void ObstacleAvoidanceManager::ActivateEmergencyMode()
documentation:
  brief: Activates emergency mode in the obstacle avoidance manager to prioritize
    collision avoidance behavior.
  description: The ActivateEmergencyMode method enables emergency collision avoidance
    protocols within the ObstacleAvoidanceManager. This function typically triggers
    immediate path recalculations and prioritizes avoiding obstacles over normal movement
    behaviors. It is commonly invoked when the AI agent detects an imminent collision
    or when external systems signal a need for emergency maneuvering. The method does
    not accept any parameters and performs no return operations, directly modifying
    internal state to enable emergency avoidance routines.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Emergency Mode Activation
    code: 'ObstacleAvoidanceManager* manager = player->GetMovementInterface()->GetObstacleAvoidanceManager();

      manager->ActivateEmergencyMode();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the AI agent is in a state where obstacle
    avoidance is critical. It may temporarily disable other movement behaviors to
    ensure collision avoidance takes precedence. The emergency mode typically remains
    active until manually deactivated or until the immediate threat has been resolved.
  warnings: Calling this method repeatedly without proper state management can lead
    to excessive path recalculations and performance degradation. Ensure that emergency
    mode is properly managed and deactivated when no longer needed to prevent unintended
    behavior.
