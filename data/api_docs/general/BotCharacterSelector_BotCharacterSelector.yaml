documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the BotCharacterSelector class for managing
    AI-controlled character selection.
  description: The BotCharacterSelector constructor initializes the internal state
    and data structures required for selecting and managing bot characters within
    the TrinityCore framework. This method sets up default configurations, registers
    necessary event handlers, and prepares the selector to interact with the game's
    player and character systems. The initialization process ensures that the bot
    character selection mechanism is ready to handle requests for character creation,
    assignment, and management in automated gameplay scenarios.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a new BotCharacterSelector instance
    code: 'BotCharacterSelector selector;

      // The constructor automatically initializes all internal components

      // Ready to use for bot character selection operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during the initialization phase of the
    TrinityCore server or when a new bot management system is instantiated. It performs
    no heavy operations and should complete quickly. The actual character selection
    logic is handled by other methods in the class.
