  method: UnloadMap
  signature: void StaticMapTree::UnloadMap()
documentation:
  brief: Unloads all data associated with a static map tree, freeing memory and resources.
  description: The UnloadMap method is responsible for releasing all memory and resources
    that are allocated for a specific static map tree. This includes unloading collision
    data, height maps, and any other map-related structures that were previously loaded
    into memory. The method ensures that no memory leaks occur when a map is no longer
    needed, such as when a player leaves a zone or when the server shuts down. It
    typically resets internal state variables to indicate that the map has been unloaded
    and can be safely reloaded later if necessary.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "StaticMapTree* mapTree = sMapMgr->GetStaticMapTree(0, 0);\nif (mapTree)\n\
      {\n    mapTree->UnloadMap();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when it's safe to unload the map data.
    It's typically used during map transitions or server shutdowns. The method assumes
    that no active references to the map data exist after calling this function.
  warnings: Calling UnloadMap while other threads are accessing the map data may lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure proper synchronization before invoking
    this method.
