documentation:
  brief: Marks the learning experiment as successful, updating internal state and
    triggering associated completion logic.
  description: The MarkSuccessful method is used to indicate that a scoped learning
    experiment has completed successfully. This method updates the internal state
    of the experiment to reflect its successful conclusion, potentially triggering
    any registered callbacks or notifications. It is typically invoked when an experiment's
    objectives have been met without errors or failures. The method does not accept
    any parameters and performs no return operations, serving purely as a state transition
    mechanism within the learning framework.

  notes: This method should only be called after the experiment has been properly
    initialized and is in a valid state for completion. Calling this method multiple
    times may have undefined behavior depending on implementation details.
