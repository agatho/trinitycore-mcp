  class: RoleAssignment
  method: ExecuteRaidStrategy
  signature: void RoleAssignment::ExecuteRaidStrategy(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a raid strategy for the specified group, assigning roles to players
    based on class, specialization, and other factors.
  description: The ExecuteRaidStrategy method is responsible for determining and assigning
    appropriate roles to players within a raid group. This method analyzes the composition
    of the group, including player classes, specializations, and available roles,
    to ensure optimal distribution of responsibilities such as tanking, healing, and
    damage dealing. It typically integrates with TrinityCore's raid management systems
    to dynamically adjust role assignments during raid encounters or when group compositions
    change. The method does not return any value but modifies the internal state of
    the group's role assignments.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the raid group for which
      the strategy will be executed. Must not be null and should represent a valid
      raid group with members.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Raid Setup
    code: "Group* raidGroup = sObjectMgr->GetGroupById(12345);\nif (raidGroup)\n{\n\
      \    RoleAssignment roleAssign;\n    roleAssign.ExecuteRaidStrategy(raidGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Raid Encounter Trigger
    code: "void OnRaidStart(Player* player)\n{\n    Group* group = player->GetGroup();\n\
      \    if (group && group->isRaidGroup())\n    {\n        RoleAssignment roleAssign;\n\
      \        roleAssign.ExecuteRaidStrategy(group);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during raid initialization or when a new
    member joins the group. It assumes that all players in the group have valid class
    and specialization data. The actual role assignment logic may vary depending on
    the configured raid strategy module within TrinityCore.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed to this method is valid and represents
    an active raid group, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. This method modifies
    the internal state of the group and should not be called concurrently with other
    methods modifying the same group.
