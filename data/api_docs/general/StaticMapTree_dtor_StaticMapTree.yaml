documentation:
  brief: Destroys a StaticMapTree instance and releases all associated memory resources.
  description: The ~StaticMapTree destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    allocated by the StaticMapTree class. This includes releasing any internal data
    structures such as bounding volume hierarchies, collision meshes, or spatial partitioning
    trees that are used for efficient map traversal and collision detection in TrinityCore's
    terrain system. The destructor ensures proper resource deallocation to prevent
    memory leaks when a StaticMapTree object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    This method is automatically invoked during object destruction and should not
    be called manually.

  - title: Automatic Destruction of StaticMapTree
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    StaticMapTree* tree = new StaticMapTree();\n\
      \    // ... use the tree ...\n    delete tree; // Destructor called here automatically\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor performs cleanup operations that are essential for maintaining
    memory integrity in TrinityCore's map system. It is important to note that StaticMapTree
    objects should only be destroyed through proper deletion mechanisms (either via
    'delete' or smart pointers) to ensure all resources are properly released.
