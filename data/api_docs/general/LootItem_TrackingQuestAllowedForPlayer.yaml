    questId, const int & conditions)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player is allowed to track a specific quest for loot item purposes.
  description: The TrackingQuestAllowedForPlayer method determines whether a given
    player can track a specific quest associated with a loot item. This functionality
    is typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's loot system, where certain
    quests may be restricted based on player progress or game conditions. The method
    evaluates both the player's current state and the specified quest ID against internal
    tracking rules to decide if the quest can be tracked for loot purposes. It ensures
    that players cannot track quests that would otherwise break game balance or progression
    mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose tracking permissions are being
      checked. Must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest to check tracking permissions for.
      Should correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: conditions
    description: Reference to an integer representing additional conditions or flags
      that may affect tracking eligibility. Values are typically defined by internal
      game logic.
  returns: Returns true if the player is allowed to track the specified quest for
    loot item purposes; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (lootItem->TrackingQuestAllowedForPlayer(player, 12345, conditions))\
      \ {\n    // Allow tracking of quest 12345 for this loot item\n    player->SetQuestTracker(12345);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with multiple checks
    code: "bool canTrack = lootItem->TrackingQuestAllowedForPlayer(player, questId,\
      \ conditions);\nif (canTrack && player->GetQuestStatus(questId) == QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE)\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with tracking logic only if quest is incomplete and tracking\
      \ is allowed\n    player->AddQuestTracker(questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal quest tracking systems and may
    involve database lookups or cached state checks. It's important to ensure that
    the player pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing a null player pointer will result in undefined behavior. Ensure
    all parameters are validated before invoking this method, especially when dealing
    with dynamic quest data.
