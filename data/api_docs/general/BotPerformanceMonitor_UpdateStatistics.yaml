    & metric)
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal performance statistics with the provided metric data
  description: The UpdateStatistics method is responsible for collecting and processing
    performance metrics from bot operations within the TrinityCore framework. It accepts
    a PerformanceMetric object containing timing, resource usage, or other relevant
    data points that help monitor the efficiency and behavior of AI-controlled bots.
    This method typically integrates with the broader BotPerformanceMonitor system
    to maintain aggregated statistics over time, enabling developers and administrators
    to identify performance bottlenecks or optimize bot behavior. The method does
    not return any value but modifies internal state variables used for reporting
    and analysis purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: metric
    description: A const reference to a PerformanceMetric object containing timing
      data, resource consumption values, or other performance-related measurements
      from bot operations. This parameter is required and must contain valid metric
      data for the update process to be meaningful.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PerformanceMetric metric;

      metric.executionTimeMs = 150;

      metric.memoryUsageKB = 2048;

      botPerformanceMonitor.UpdateStatistics(metric);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot AI Loop
    code: "void BotAI::Update()\n{\n    auto startTime = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \    // Bot logic here\n    auto endTime = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \    \n    PerformanceMetric metric;\n    metric.executionTimeMs = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(endTime\
      \ - startTime).count();\n    metric.memoryUsageKB = GetMemoryUsage();\n    \n\
      \    botPerformanceMonitor.UpdateStatistics(metric);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within bot AI update loops or performance-critical
    sections. It's designed to be lightweight and non-blocking, though frequent calls
    may impact overall system performance if not properly throttled. The internal
    statistics aggregation may use thread-safe data structures depending on implementation
    details.
  warnings: Ensure that the PerformanceMetric object passed contains valid data before
    calling this method, as invalid or uninitialized values could skew collected statistics.
    Avoid calling this method in high-frequency loops without proper rate limiting
    to prevent performance degradation.
