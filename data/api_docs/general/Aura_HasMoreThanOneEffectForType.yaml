  method: HasMoreThanOneEffectForType
  signature: bool Aura::HasMoreThanOneEffectForType(AuraType auraType) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the aura has more than one effect of the specified aura type.
  description: This method determines whether the current aura instance applies multiple
    effects of the same aura type. It is commonly used in World of Warcraft's spell
    system to evaluate complex auras that may have multiple layered effects. The method
    iterates through all active effects of the aura and counts how many match the
    provided aura type. This functionality is essential for certain game mechanics
    such as stacking effects, proc conditions, or special aura interactions where
    the number of effects matters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if there are more than one effect of the specified aura type;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check for Multiple Stacking Effects
    code: "if (aura->HasMoreThanOneEffectForType(SPELL_AURA_MOD_DAMAGE_PERCENT_TAKEN))\
      \ {\n    // Apply special handling for multiple damage reduction effects\n \
      \   // e.g., adjust stacking behavior or cap calculations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal effect tracking within the Aura class. It
    assumes that aura effects are properly initialized and registered with the aura
    instance before being queried. Performance-wise, this check involves iterating
    over all active effects, so frequent calls should be avoided in performance-critical
    code paths.
  warnings: Ensure that the aura type passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an actual spell effect type. Passing invalid or uninitialized aura types may
    lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect results.
