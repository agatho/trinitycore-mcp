  signature: void Unit::ReplaceAllPvpFlags(UnitPVPStateFlags flags)
documentation:
  brief: Replaces all PvP flags on the unit with the specified flags.
  description: This method replaces all existing PvP flags on a Unit object with the
    provided flags. It is used to set or reset the PvP state of a unit, typically
    in the context of player versus player combat. The method operates by clearing
    all current PvP flags and setting new ones based on the input parameter. This
    functionality is essential for managing player status during PvP encounters and
    can be used to toggle between different PvP states such as PVP flag, FFA flag,
    or neutral flag.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: The UnitPVPStateFlags value that specifies the new PvP state to apply
      to the unit. This parameter defines whether the unit is in a PvP state (flag),
      FFA state (flag), or neutral state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting PvP Flags
    code: 'Unit* target = player->GetSelectedUnit();

      Unit::ReplaceAllPvpFlags(target, UnitPVPStateFlags::PVP_FLAG);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Resetting PvP Flags
    code: 'Unit* target = player->GetSelectedUnit();

      Unit::ReplaceAllPvpFlags(target, UnitPVPStateFlags::NEUTRAL);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly affects the PvP state
    of a unit. It is typically called during PvP combat scenarios or when setting
    up player versus player encounters. The method may also trigger updates to the
    unit's visual representation and status effects.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect PvP state handling,
    which may cause issues with player behavior in PvP zones or affect game mechanics
    such as player vs player combat. Care should be taken when applying flags to ensure
    they are appropriate for the current context.
