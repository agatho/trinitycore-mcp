  method: GetCasterGUID
  signature: int Aura::GetCasterGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of the caster who applied the aura.
  description: The GetCasterGUID method returns the globally unique identifier of
    the unit that originally cast the aura. This GUID is used internally by TrinityCore
    to track which entity applied the effect. The returned value represents a 32-bit
    integer identifier that uniquely identifies the caster within the game world.
    It's important to note that this method may return zero if the aura was not applied
    by a valid unit, such as in cases of environment-based or self-applied effects.
    This identifier can be used to retrieve the actual caster object from the world
    using appropriate TrinityCore APIs.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the aura's caster. Returns 0 if the
    aura has no valid caster (e.g., self-applied or environment-based auras).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Identify Caster
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    uint32 casterGUID\
      \ = aura->GetCasterGUID();\n    if (casterGUID)\n    {\n        Unit* caster\
      \ = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*player, casterGUID);\n        if (caster)\n   \
      \     {\n            // Process the caster\n            sLog->outString(\"Aura\
      \ applied by: %s\", caster->GetName().c_str());\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned GUID is a 32-bit value that uniquely identifies units in the
    TrinityCore world. This method does not perform any validation on whether the
    caster still exists or is valid; it simply returns the stored GUID value. It's
    recommended to verify the existence of the caster object using ObjectAccessor::GetUnit()
    before attempting to use the returned GUID.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned GUID directly without verifying the
    caster's existence, as the caster may have been destroyed or removed from the
    world since the aura was applied. Always validate that the returned GUID corresponds
    to a valid unit object before accessing its properties.
