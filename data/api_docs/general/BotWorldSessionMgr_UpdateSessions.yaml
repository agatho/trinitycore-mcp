  method: UpdateSessions
  signature: void BotWorldSessionMgr::UpdateSessions(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates all active bot world sessions with the specified time difference.
  description: The UpdateSessions method processes and updates the state of all currently
    active bot world sessions in the TrinityCore server. It is typically called from
    the main game loop to ensure that bot behaviors, AI states, and session data are
    synchronized with the passage of time. This method handles internal session management
    tasks such as updating timers, processing queued actions, and maintaining session
    validity. The method accepts a time delta (diff) parameter which represents the
    milliseconds elapsed since the last update call, allowing for accurate time-based
    calculations in bot behavior.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = sWorld->GetUpdateDiff();\n    sBotWorldSessionMgr->UpdateSessions(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called regularly from the main game update
    loop. It's important that the time difference (diff) parameter accurately reflects
    real-time passage for proper bot behavior simulation. The method may internally
    iterate through all active sessions, so performance can scale with the number
    of active bots.
