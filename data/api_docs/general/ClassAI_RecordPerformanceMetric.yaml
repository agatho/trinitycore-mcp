  class: ClassAI
  method: RecordPerformanceMetric
  signature: void ClassAI::RecordPerformanceMetric(const int & metric, int value)
documentation:
  brief: Records a performance metric value for the AI class instance.
  description: The RecordPerformanceMetric method is used to log and store performance-related
    data for an AI instance, typically for profiling or debugging purposes. This method
    accepts a metric identifier and its corresponding value, allowing developers to
    track various aspects of AI behavior such as execution time, decision-making cycles,
    or resource usage. The method does not return any value but contributes to internal
    performance monitoring systems within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: metric
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific performance metric
      type. Valid values are defined by the AI subsystem and typically correspond
      to predefined constants or enums.
  - name: value
    description: The numeric value associated with the specified metric. This can
      represent time durations, counts, or other measurable quantities related to
      AI performance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Recording AI Decision Time
    code: "class MyClass : public ClassAI {\npublic:\n    void SomeMethod() {\n  \
      \      int decisionTime = 150; // milliseconds\n        RecordPerformanceMetric(1,\
      \ decisionTime); // Metric ID 1 represents decision time\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking AI Update Cycle Duration
    code: "void MyClass::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff) {\n    uint32 startTime = getMSTime();\n\
      \    // ... AI logic here ...\n    uint32 endTime = getMSTime();\n    RecordPerformanceMetric(2,\
      \ (int)(endTime - startTime)); // Metric ID 2 for update cycle time\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with performance monitoring
    tools or debug systems within TrinityCore. It may be optimized away in release
    builds depending on compile-time flags. The metric identifiers should align with
    those defined in the AI subsystem's performance tracking system.
  warnings: Ensure that the metric identifier passed to this method corresponds to
    a valid predefined constant, as invalid IDs might lead to undefined behavior or
    ignored data in performance tracking systems.
