documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes game object quest starter data from the database.
  description: The LoadGameobjectQuestStarters method populates internal data structures
    with information about which game objects initiate quests in the World of Warcraft
    server. This method is typically called during server startup or database reload
    operations to ensure that quest relationships with game objects are properly established.
    It reads relevant entries from the database tables containing quest starter mappings
    and caches this data for efficient lookup during gameplay. The method does not
    return any value but modifies internal state used by the quest system when players
    interact with game objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeWorld()\n{\n    ObjectMgr::instance()->LoadGameobjectQuestStarters();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically during server startup as part
    of the ObjectMgr initialization sequence. It's important to note that this method
    should only be called after the database connection is established and valid.
    The loaded data is cached internally and used by the quest system when players
    interact with game objects.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may lead to
    duplicate entries in internal caches. Do not invoke this method while active player
    sessions are present unless you're certain about concurrency implications.
