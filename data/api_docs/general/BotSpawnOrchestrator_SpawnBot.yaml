  class: BotSpawnOrchestrator
  method: SpawnBot
  signature: bool BotSpawnOrchestrator::SpawnBot(const int & request)
documentation:
  brief: Spawns a bot using the provided request identifier and returns true on success.
  description: The SpawnBot method is responsible for initiating the creation process
    of a bot within the TrinityCore framework. It takes a request identifier as input,
    which typically corresponds to a predefined configuration or template for the
    bot to be spawned. The method performs necessary validation checks and attempts
    to instantiate the bot based on the provided request. This function is commonly
    used in automated testing environments or AI-driven NPC systems where dynamic
    bot creation is required. The spawning process may involve allocating memory,
    initializing bot properties, setting up AI behavior, and integrating the new bot
    into the game world's object management system.
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: An integer identifier that specifies which bot configuration or template
      to use for spawning. This value typically maps to a predefined set of bot parameters
      stored in the system's configuration database.
  returns: Returns true if the bot was successfully spawned and integrated into the
    game world, false otherwise. Failure can occur due to invalid request identifiers,
    insufficient resources, or system constraints preventing bot creation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Spawning
    code: "BotSpawnOrchestrator orchestrator;\nint spawnRequest = 12345;\nbool success\
      \ = orchestrator.SpawnBot(spawnRequest);\nif (success) {\n    // Bot successfully\
      \ spawned\n    printf(\"Bot spawned successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Failed\
      \ to spawn bot\n    printf(\"Failed to spawn bot\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Bot Spawning with Error Handling
    code: "BotSpawnOrchestrator orchestrator;\nint request = 98765;\ntry {\n    bool\
      \ result = orchestrator.SpawnBot(request);\n    if (!result) {\n        throw\
      \ std::runtime_error(\"Bot spawning failed\");\n    }\n    // Proceed with bot\
      \ usage\n} catch (const std::exception& e) {\n    // Handle error appropriately\n\
      \    printf(\"Error spawning bot: %s\\n\", e.what());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with a configuration system
    that defines various bot types. The request parameter should correspond to valid
    entries in the bot template database. The method may block until the spawning
    process completes, depending on implementation details. Consider performance implications
    when calling this method frequently in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or unregistered request identifier
    will likely result in a failed spawn attempt without throwing exceptions. Ensure
    that all request identifiers are validated against existing bot configurations
    before calling this method. In multi-threaded environments, ensure proper synchronization
    if multiple threads attempt to spawn bots simultaneously.
