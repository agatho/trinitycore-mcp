  method: PrioritizeFlagCarriers
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::PrioritizeFlagCarriers()
documentation:
  brief: Prioritizes flag carriers in the AdvancedBehaviorManager for enhanced AI
    decision-making during capture the flag scenarios.
  description: The PrioritizeFlagCarriers method adjusts the behavior priorities within
    the AdvancedBehaviorManager to ensure that units carrying flags are given higher
    priority in AI decision-making processes. This is particularly relevant in Capture
    The Flag game modes where flag carriers need to be protected or pursued more aggressively
    than regular units. The method modifies internal AI state and behavior trees to
    elevate the importance of flag carrier targets, ensuring optimal tactical responses
    during gameplay. It typically runs during AI update cycles and may interact with
    other priority systems within the manager.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n  \
      \  m_behaviorManager->PrioritizeFlagCarriers();\n    // ... continue with normal\
      \ AI execution ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during AI update cycles to maintain
    proper flag carrier priority. It may modify internal behavior tree nodes and should
    not be called from multiple threads simultaneously without proper synchronization.
  warnings: Calling this method inappropriately or too frequently may cause performance
    degradation due to behavior tree recalculations. Ensure that flag carrier detection
    logic is properly initialized before calling this method.
