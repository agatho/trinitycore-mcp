  method: GetId
  signature: int CreatureAI::GetId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the creature AI instance.
  description: The GetId method retrieves the unique integer identifier associated
    with a CreatureAI instance. This ID is typically used to distinguish between different
    AI behaviors or instances within the game world. The returned value corresponds
    to the creature's entry ID from the database, which defines its specific AI behavior
    and properties in TrinityCore. This method is commonly used for identifying and
    managing creature AI logic, particularly when dealing with multiple creatures
    of the same type but with distinct behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique identifier (entry ID) of the creature
    AI instance. This corresponds to the creature's database entry ID that defines
    its AI behavior and properties in the TrinityCore system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void OnCreatureEnterCombat(Creature* creature)\n{\n    int creatureId =\
      \ creature->AI()->GetId();\n    if (creatureId == 12345)\n    {\n        //\
      \ Special behavior for specific creature type\n        creature->CastSpell(creature,\
      \ 98765, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: AI Instance Management
    code: "class CustomCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    explicit CustomCreatureAI(Creature*\
      \ creature) : CreatureAI(creature) {}\n    \n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override\n    {\n        int id = GetId();\n        // Use ID to determine\
      \ special AI behavior\n        switch (id)\n        {\n            case 1001:\n\
      \                // Behavior for NPC 1001\n                break;\n        \
      \    case 1002:\n                // Behavior for NPC 1002\n                break;\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned ID is derived from the creature's entry in the creature_template
    table. This method is safe to call during AI update cycles and does not involve
    any database access. The ID remains constant for the lifetime of the AI instance.
