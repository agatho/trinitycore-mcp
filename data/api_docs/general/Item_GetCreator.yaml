  method: GetCreator
  signature: int Item::GetCreator() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the item's creator.
  description: The GetCreator method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of the
    player who created the item. This is typically used in scenarios where items are
    created through professions, enchanting, or other crafting mechanics. The method
    returns an integer value representing the GUID of the creator, which can be used
    for tracking or identifying the original player who generated the item.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the GUID of the item's creator. This
    value is typically a 32-bit integer that uniquely identifies the player who created
    the item. If no creator exists, it may return zero or a negative value depending
    on the implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Item* item = new Item();\nint creatorGUID = item->GetCreator();\nif (creatorGUID\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // The item was created by a player\n}\nelse\n{\n    // The item\
      \ was not created by a player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other item-related functions
    to track item creation and ownership. It's important to note that the returned
    value may be zero or negative if no creator exists, which could indicate that
    the item was created by a non-player entity such as a game object or NPC.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in scenarios where items are created
    through different mechanics, as the GUID returned might not always correspond
    to a player. Also, ensure that the item's creation state is properly checked before
    calling this method, as some items may not have a creator.
