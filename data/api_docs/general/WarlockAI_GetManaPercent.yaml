  class: WarlockAI
  method: GetManaPercent
  signature: float WarlockAI::GetManaPercent()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current mana percentage of the warlock AI unit.
  description: The GetManaPercent method computes the ratio of the warlock's current
    mana to its maximum mana, expressed as a percentage. This value is typically used
    by AI logic to determine when to cast mana-consuming spells or to manage resource
    allocation during combat. The method performs a simple mathematical calculation
    and does not modify any internal state. It assumes that the unit has valid mana
    values and is in a state where mana can be queried.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current mana percentage of the warlock AI
    unit. This value ranges from 0.0 (no mana) to 100.0 (full mana).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (warlockAI->GetManaPercent() > 50.0f)\n{\n    // Cast a high-mana spell\n\
      \    warlockAI->CastSpell(SPELL_SEED_OF_DEATH);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Management with Mana Threshold
    code: "float manaPercent = warlockAI->GetManaPercent();\nif (manaPercent < 20.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Prioritize mana regeneration\n    warlockAI->CastSpell(SPELL_HEALTHSTONE);\n\
      }\nelse if (manaPercent > 80.0f)\n{\n    // Use mana for damage spells\n   \
      \ warlockAI->CastSpell(SPELL_SHADOW_BOLT);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other AI decision-making
    logic to optimize spell usage based on available resources. It's important to
    note that the returned value may be cached or updated at specific intervals depending
    on the implementation, so frequent calls might not reflect real-time changes.
  warnings: Ensure that the warlock AI unit is valid and has a mana bar before calling
    this method. Calling it on an invalid or non-mana-based unit may result in undefined
    behavior or incorrect calculations.
