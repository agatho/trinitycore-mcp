  method: GetActiveEchoCount
  signature: int EvokerAI::GetActiveEchoCount()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of active echo effects currently applied to the evoker.
  description: The GetActiveEchoCount method retrieves the number of active echo effects
    that are currently affecting the evoker. In World of Warcraft's Evoker class,
    echoes are a core gameplay mechanic where the player can cast spells that create
    echoes which persist and provide additional benefits or effects over time. This
    method is typically used by the AI system to determine how many echoes are currently
    active, which may influence decision-making for spell selection and timing. The
    returned value represents a non-negative integer indicating the total count of
    active echo effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of active echo effects currently applied
    to the evoker. A return value of 0 indicates no active echoes, while higher values
    indicate the presence of one or more echo effects.
  examples:

    code: "class EvokerAI\n{\npublic:\n    int GetActiveEchoCount();\n    void UpdateAI(Unit*\
      \ /*who*/)\n    {\n        int echoCount = GetActiveEchoCount();\n        if\
      \ (echoCount < 3)\n        {\n            // Cast a spell that generates an\
      \ echo\n            DoCast(SPELL_ECHO_GENERATION);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented as a simple accessor function that returns
    a cached value or directly queries the evoker's current state. It may be called
    frequently during AI updates, so performance should be considered in high-frequency
    scenarios.
