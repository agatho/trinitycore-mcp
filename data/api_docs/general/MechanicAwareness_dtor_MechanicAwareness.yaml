  method: ~MechanicAwareness
  signature: void MechanicAwareness::~MechanicAwareness()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a MechanicAwareness object and releases its associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the MechanicAwareness class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the instance. This method
    is automatically invoked when a MechanicAwareness object goes out of scope or
    is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's AI and game mechanics,
    this class likely manages awareness states related to creature or player interactions
    with various mechanical effects such as stuns, roots, or other status conditions.
    The destructor ensures proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks and maintain system
    stability.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Object Destruction
    code: 'MechanicAwareness awareness;

      // ... usage of awareness object ...

      // Destructor automatically called here when awareness goes out of scope'
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit Deletion
    code: 'MechanicAwareness* awareness = new MechanicAwareness();

      // ... usage of awareness object ...

      delete awareness; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing heap-allocated
    instances. It's important to ensure that all references to the object are cleared
    before destruction to avoid dangling pointers. In TrinityCore, this class may
    be part of a larger AI system where proper cleanup is essential for preventing
    memory leaks during server runtime.
  warnings: Avoid calling the destructor manually on stack-allocated objects as it
    will be called automatically. Be cautious when using smart pointers or manual
    memory management with MechanicAwareness instances to ensure consistent cleanup
    behavior.
