    encounterId)
documentation:
  brief: Handles encounter recovery logic for a group within an instance coordination
    system.
  description: The HandleEncounterRecovery method is responsible for managing the
    recovery process of a specific encounter within a dungeon or raid instance. This
    method is typically invoked when a group needs to resume or restart an ongoing
    encounter after a temporary interruption, such as a player disconnecting and reconnecting,
    or during a server reset. It ensures that the group's progress is properly restored,
    including any active combat state, encounter timers, and player status. The method
    operates within the InstanceCoordination framework which manages instance-specific
    logic and player coordination across multiple encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group of players involved
      in the encounter recovery. This parameter must be a valid group pointer, otherwise
      the method will likely cause undefined behavior or crash.
  - name: encounterId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific encounter that needs recovery.
      This ID corresponds to a registered encounter within the instance coordination
      system and determines how the recovery process is handled.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Encounter Recovery Usage
    code: 'Group* playerGroup = ...; // Get group reference

      uint32 currentEncounterId = 1234;

      instanceCoordination->HandleEncounterRecovery(playerGroup, currentEncounterId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recovery with Error Handling
    code: "if (playerGroup && playerGroup->GetMembersCount() > 0)\n{\n    uint32 encounterId\
      \ = GetActiveEncounterId();\n    if (encounterId != 0)\n    {\n        instanceCoordination->HandleEncounterRecovery(playerGroup,\
      \ encounterId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the instance coordination system and should only be
    called when the instance is in a valid state for recovery operations. The method
    assumes that the group has already been validated and that all players are properly
    connected to the instance. Performance-wise, this method may perform database
    operations or send network packets to synchronize player states across the group.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid group pointer or zero encounterId
    can lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Ensure that the encounterId corresponds
    to a valid and registered encounter before calling this method. The recovery process
    might interrupt ongoing combat, so it should be used carefully during active encounters.
