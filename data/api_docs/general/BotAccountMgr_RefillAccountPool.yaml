documentation:
  brief: Fills the bot account pool with new accounts when the current pool is depleted.
  description: The RefillAccountPool method is responsible for replenishing the pool
    of available bot accounts in a TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft server. When
    the number of usable bot accounts drops below a certain threshold, this method
    is invoked to create and add new accounts to the pool. This ensures that bot commands
    and automated actions can continue to function without interruption due to account
    exhaustion. The method typically operates by generating new account credentials
    and storing them in an internal data structure for future use. It may also perform
    validation checks to ensure the integrity of newly created accounts before adding
    them to the pool.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: BotAccountMgr::instance()->RefillAccountPool();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the bot management system
    when the account pool reaches a low threshold. It may involve database operations
    and should be considered during high-load scenarios where many bots are active
    simultaneously.
