documentation:
  brief: Updates combat resurrection mechanics for the instance.
  description: The UpdateCombatResurrection method handles the internal logic for
    managing combat resurrection timers and states within an instance script. This
    method is typically called during the game loop to process any pending resurrection
    events or cooldowns that occur during combat. It ensures proper timing and state
    management for players who have been resurrected during combat, preventing immediate
    re-resurrection and maintaining game balance. The method processes all active
    combat resurrection entries and updates their internal timers based on the elapsed
    time since last update.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in instance update loop
    code: "void ExampleInstanceScript::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update\
      \ logic ...\n    UpdateCombatResurrection(diff);\n    // ... rest of update\
      \ logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the instance's update loop to maintain
    proper combat resurrection state management. It typically handles internal timer
    updates and may trigger events when resurrection timers complete. The method is
    part of the core instance script functionality and should not be overridden unless
    implementing custom resurrection behavior.
