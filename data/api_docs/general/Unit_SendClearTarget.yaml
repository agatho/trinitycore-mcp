documentation:
  brief: Clears the target of the unit, removing any current target from the unit's
    selection.
  description: The SendClearTarget method is used to remove the current target from
    a Unit's selection. This method is typically called when a unit needs to reset
    its target or when a player is no longer targeting a specific creature. The method
    sends a clear target packet to the client, effectively removing any selected target
    from the unit's visual representation. It is commonly used in conjunction with
    other methods that manage unit targeting and can be triggered by various game
    mechanics such as spell effects, combat situations, or player actions.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = unit->GetTarget();\nif (target)\n{\n    unit->SendClearTarget();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it can affect the unit's visual representation
    and may cause issues if called without proper context. The method is typically
    part of a larger targeting system and should be used in conjunction with other
    target management methods to ensure proper game state handling.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking if a target exists can lead to undefined
    behavior or errors in the unit's visual representation. It should only be called
    when the unit actually has a target selected, otherwise it may cause unnecessary
    network traffic.
