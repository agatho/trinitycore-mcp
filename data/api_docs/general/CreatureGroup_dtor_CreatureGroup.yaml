documentation:
  brief: Destroys a CreatureGroup instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The CreatureGroup destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    and resources allocated to a creature group. When a CreatureGroup object is destroyed,
    it ensures that all internal references to creatures within the group are properly
    released and that any associated game state data is cleaned up. This destructor
    is automatically invoked when a CreatureGroup instance goes out of scope or is
    explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this method plays
    a crucial role in preventing memory leaks and maintaining clean game object lifecycle
    management.

  - title: Basic Destruction of CreatureGroup
    code: 'CreatureGroup* group = new CreatureGroup();

      // ... perform operations with the group ...

      delete group; // Triggers ~CreatureGroup() destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime when a CreatureGroup
    object is deleted or goes out of scope. It's important to ensure that no other
    objects hold references to creatures within this group before deletion, as dangling
    references may cause undefined behavior.
