documentation:
  brief: Performs tournament selection to choose a strategy chromosome from the population
    based on fitness.
  description: The TournamentSelection method implements a tournament selection mechanism
    used in evolutionary algorithms. It randomly selects a subset of chromosomes from
    the current population, each with a specified tournament size, and returns the
    best-performing chromosome based on fitness evaluation. This technique is commonly
    used to maintain diversity while favoring higher-performing individuals in the
    evolutionary process. The method does not modify the population but rather selects
    an individual for potential use in crossover or mutation operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a StrategyChromosome object representing the selected individual
    from the tournament. This chromosome is typically chosen based on its fitness
    score relative to other participants in the tournament.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Tournament Selection Usage
    code: 'EvolutionaryOptimizer optimizer;

      StrategyChromosome selected = optimizer.TournamentSelection(3);

      // ''selected'' now contains a chromosome chosen from a tournament of size 3'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'The tournament selection process is stochastic and may produce different
    results on each call, even with the same population. The effectiveness of this
    method depends heavily on the tournament size: larger tournaments tend to favor
    better individuals more strongly but may reduce diversity.'
