    operations. It should be called during off-peak hours or asynchronously to avoid
    performance degradation. The analysis results may be cached for efficiency.
  warnings: Ensure that the guild ID provided is valid and corresponds to an existing
    guild in the database, otherwise behavior is undefined. This method may take considerable
    time to complete depending on the amount of historical data available.
