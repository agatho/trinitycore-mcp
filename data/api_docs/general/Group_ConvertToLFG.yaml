  signature: void Group::ConvertToLFG()
documentation:
  brief: Converts a regular group into a LFG (Looking For Group) group.
  description: The ConvertToLFG method transforms an existing player group into a
    Looking For Group (LFG) type group. This conversion typically occurs when a group
    leader wishes to make their group available for dungeon finding or other LFG activities.
    The method modifies the group's internal state to indicate that it is now participating
    in the LFG system, which affects how the group appears in the LFG interface and
    how it can be matched with other players. This conversion process ensures that
    the group adheres to LFG rules and restrictions while maintaining all existing
    group members and their roles.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Convert a group to LFG
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && group->IsLeader(player->GetGUID()))\
      \ {\n    group->ConvertToLFG();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called by the group leader. The conversion process
    updates internal group flags and may trigger UI updates in the client. It's typically
    used when a player wants to make their group available for LFG matching.
  warnings: Calling this method on a group that is already in LFG mode may result
    in undefined behavior. Ensure the caller has proper permissions (group leader)
    before invoking this method.
