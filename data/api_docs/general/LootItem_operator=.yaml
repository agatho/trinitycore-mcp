  brief: Moves ownership of a LootItem's resources to another LootItem instance.
  description: The move assignment operator for the LootItem class transfers all resources
    from the source LootItem (rvalue reference) to the current LootItem instance.
    This operation is typically used in scenarios where temporary or temporary-like
    objects need to be efficiently transferred without copying expensive data structures.
    The moved-from object is left in a valid but unspecified state, suitable for immediate
    destruction or assignment. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore context, this method
    supports efficient loot management during item distribution and cleanup processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current LootItem instance after the move assignment
    has completed, enabling chained assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'LootItem item1;

      LootItem item2 = std::move(item1); // Move item1''s resources to item2

      // item1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Container
    code: 'std::vector<LootItem> lootVector;

      LootItem tempItem;

      lootVector.push_back(std::move(tempItem)); // Efficiently move item into vector

      // tempItem is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator performs a shallow move of resource pointers or handles. The
    moved-from object should not be used afterward except for destruction or reassignment.
    In TrinityCore's loot system, this optimization helps reduce memory allocations
    during item distribution and cleanup operations.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after move assignment leads to undefined behavior.
    Ensure that any references or pointers to the moved-from object are not used afterward.
    This is particularly important in multithreaded environments where concurrent
    access to the moved-from object could cause issues.
