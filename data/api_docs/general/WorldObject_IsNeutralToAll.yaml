  signature: bool WorldObject::IsNeutralToAll() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the WorldObject is neutral to all other objects in the
    world.
  description: The IsNeutralToAll method checks if the current WorldObject has a neutral
    relationship with all other objects in the game world. This typically applies
    to objects that do not have any faction or alignment that would make them hostile
    or friendly towards other entities. The method evaluates the object's faction
    settings and combat state to determine neutrality. It is commonly used in AI logic,
    combat system decisions, and interaction handling where an object should not engage
    in combat or show hostility toward any other entity.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the WorldObject is neutral to all other objects, meaning
    it will not initiate or respond to hostile actions from any faction or creature.
    Returns false if the object has a defined faction relationship that may lead to
    combat or interaction with other entities.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Neutral Status Before Interaction
    code: "if (unit->IsNeutralToAll()) {\n    // Allow peaceful interaction\n    unit->Say(\"\
      I am neutral to all.\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n} else {\n    // Handle hostile or\
      \ friendly interactions\n    unit->Attack(unit->GetVictim());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI Decision Making
    code: "class NeutralAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (me->IsNeutralToAll()) {\n            // Do not\
      \ engage in combat\n            return;\n        }\n        // Proceed with\
      \ normal AI logic\n        if (!UpdateVictim())\n            return;\n     \
      \   \n        DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method primarily relies on faction settings and object state rather
    than dynamic combat flags. It is typically used for objects that are meant to
    be non-combatant or neutral in nature, such as certain quest NPCs or environmental
    objects. The implementation may consider the object's current faction, reaction
    settings, and any temporary status effects that might alter its neutrality.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in combat situations as it may not
    account for dynamic faction changes or temporary state modifications. Objects
    that are neutral to all may still be affected by area-of-effect spells or other
    environmental factors that do not rely on faction relationships.
