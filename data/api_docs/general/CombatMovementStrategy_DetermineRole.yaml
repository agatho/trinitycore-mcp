documentation:
  brief: Determines the formation role for a player based on their current combat
    state and class.
  description: The DetermineRole method evaluates a player's current combat situation,
    including their class, equipped weapons, and active abilities, to assign them
    a specific formation role within the CombatMovementStrategy. This role dictates
    how the player should position themselves and behave during group combat scenarios.
    The method considers factors such as whether the player is a tank, healer, or
    damage dealer, and adjusts their role accordingly. It is typically invoked during
    group encounters to dynamically assign roles based on real-time player state rather
    than static class assignments.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a FormationRole enum value indicating the determined combat role
    for the player. Possible values include TANK, HEALER, DAMAGE_DEALER, or NONE if
    no specific role can be assigned.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "FormationRole role = strategy.DetermineRole(player);\nswitch (role) {\n\
      \    case TANK:\n        // Handle tank-specific behavior\n        break;\n\
      \    case HEALER:\n        // Handle healer-specific behavior\n        break;\n\
      \    case DAMAGE_DEALER:\n        // Handle damage dealer behavior\n       \
      \ break;\n    default:\n        // Handle unknown role\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the combat movement AI system and relies on accurate
    player state information. It may be called frequently during combat encounters,
    so performance should be considered when implementing custom logic. The determination
    process involves checking player equipment, talents, and current combat actions.
  warnings: The method assumes that the player pointer is valid and not null. Calling
    this method with an invalid player reference will likely result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. Additionally, the role returned may change dynamically during combat
    as player state evolves.
