  class: BloodDeathKnightRefactored
  method: GenerateRunicPower
  signature: void BloodDeathKnightRefactored::GenerateRunicPower(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates runic power for the blood death knight based on the specified amount.
  description: The GenerateRunicPower method is responsible for increasing the runic
    power of a blood death knight by a given amount. This method is typically invoked
    during gameplay events such as spell casting, ability usage, or passive effects
    that grant runic power. The implementation ensures that the runic power does not
    exceed the maximum allowed value for the player's current specialization and level.
    It may also trigger visual effects or updates to the player's UI to reflect the
    change in runic power.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of runic power to generate. Must be a non-negative integer
      value representing the base runic power increase.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BloodDeathKnightRefactored* dk = ...;

      dk->GenerateRunicPower(10);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "BloodDeathKnightRefactored* dk = ...;\nif (someCondition)\n{\n    dk->GenerateRunicPower(25);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on active death knights. The actual runic
    power gain may be modified by talents, buffs, or other game mechanics that affect
    runic power generation.
  warnings: Calling this method with a negative value will likely cause undefined
    behavior. Ensure the amount parameter is always non-negative to prevent unexpected
    results.
