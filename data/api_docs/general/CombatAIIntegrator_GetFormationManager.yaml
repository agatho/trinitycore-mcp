  signature: FormationManager * CombatAIIntegrator::GetFormationManager() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the FormationManager instance associated with the CombatAIIntegrator.
  description: The GetFormationManager method provides access to the FormationManager
    object that handles formation-related logic for AI-controlled creatures. This
    manager is responsible for coordinating group positioning, movement patterns,
    and tactical formations within combat scenarios. The method returns a pointer
    to the FormationManager instance, which may be null if no formation management
    has been initialized or assigned. This functionality is crucial for implementing
    complex AI behaviors where multiple units need to maintain specific spatial relationships
    during combat engagements.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the FormationManager object associated with this CombatAIIntegrator
    instance. Returns nullptr if no FormationManager has been initialized or assigned.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "FormationManager* manager = combatAIIntegrator->GetFormationManager();\n\
      if (manager)\n{\n    // Use the formation manager to coordinate group behavior\n\
      \    manager->UpdateFormation();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Access with Null Check
    code: "CombatAIIntegrator* aiIntegrator = creature->GetCombatAIIntegrator();\n\
      if (aiIntegrator)\n{\n    FormationManager* formationMgr = aiIntegrator->GetFormationManager();\n\
      \    if (formationMgr)\n    {\n        // Perform formation-based operations\n\
      \        formationMgr->SetFormationType(FORMATION_TYPE_CIRCLE);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned FormationManager pointer should be used with caution as it may
    be null. The CombatAIIntegrator class likely manages the lifetime of the FormationManager,
    so accessing it after the integrator has been destroyed could result in undefined
    behavior. This method is typically called during AI update cycles or when formation-related
    events occur.
  warnings: Accessing the FormationManager pointer without checking for null can lead
    to segmentation faults. Developers should always verify that the returned pointer
    is valid before dereferencing it. Additionally, modifying formation settings through
    this manager while the AI is actively processing could cause race conditions if
    not properly synchronized.
