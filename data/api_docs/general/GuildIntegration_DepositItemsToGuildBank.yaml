  class: GuildIntegration
  method: DepositItemsToGuildBank
  signature: void GuildIntegration::DepositItemsToGuildBank(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Deposits items from a player's inventory into the guild bank.
  description: The DepositItemsToGuildBank method transfers items from a player's
    personal inventory to the guild bank storage. This function typically handles
    the logic for moving items between the player's bag slots and the guild's shared
    storage space. It ensures proper item validation, checks for sufficient space
    in the guild bank, and updates both the player's inventory and the guild's item
    records accordingly. The method is usually invoked when a player attempts to deposit
    items into their guild's bank using in-game interface or commands.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) or index within the game's internal systems. This parameter identifies
      which player's inventory will be used for the deposit operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.DepositItemsToGuildBank(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the World of Warcraft TrinityCore database
    to update both player inventory and guild bank records. It may perform checks
    for item restrictions, guild permissions, or bank slot availability before proceeding
    with the deposit operation.
  warnings: The parameter 'player' must point to a valid player identifier; otherwise,
    the function may cause undefined behavior or crash. Ensure that the player is
    actually logged in and has access to the guild bank before calling this method.
