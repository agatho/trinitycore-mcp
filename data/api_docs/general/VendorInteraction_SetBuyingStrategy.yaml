  class: VendorInteraction
  method: SetBuyingStrategy
  signature: void VendorInteraction::SetBuyingStrategy(uint32 playerGuid, const BuyingStrategy
    & strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the buying strategy for a player's vendor interaction.
  description: The SetBuyingStrategy method configures the purchasing behavior of
    a player when interacting with a vendor. This method allows developers to define
    how a player should buy items from a vendor, including which items to prioritize,
    quantity thresholds, and other purchasing rules. The strategy is associated with
    a specific player identified by their GUID. This functionality is commonly used
    in custom AI or quest systems where automated purchasing decisions are required.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose buying strategy
      is being set. Must be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  - name: strategy
    description: An instance of BuyingStrategy that defines the purchasing rules and
      preferences for the specified player. This includes item priorities, buy quantities,
      and other relevant parameters.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BuyingStrategy strategy;

      strategy.AddItemToBuy(12345, 10); // Buy up to 10 of item ID 12345

      strategy.SetMaxGold(50000); // Maximum gold to spend

      vendorInteraction->SetBuyingStrategy(playerGuid, strategy);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple Items
    code: 'BuyingStrategy strategy;

      strategy.AddItemToBuy(12345, 5);

      strategy.AddItemToBuy(67890, 20);

      strategy.SetMinItemQuality(ITEM_QUALITY_RARE); // Only buy rare items or better

      vendorInteraction->SetBuyingStrategy(playerGuid, strategy);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the player's purchasing behavior in vendor interactions.
    The strategy object is copied and stored internally, so changes to the original
    object after calling this method will not affect the set strategy. Ensure that
    the player GUID corresponds to an active player in the game world.
  warnings: Incorrect or invalid player GUIDs may result in undefined behavior or
    silent failures. Always validate that the player exists before setting their buying
    strategy. Setting a strategy with conflicting rules (e.g., trying to buy more
    than available inventory space) might lead to unexpected purchasing outcomes.
