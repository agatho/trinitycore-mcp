  brief: Updates the priest's buffs and aura management for optimal gameplay performance.
  description: 'The UpdatePriestBuffs method is responsible for managing and updating
    the buff states of a priest AI character within the TrinityCore framework. This
    function typically handles the logic for applying, refreshing, or removing beneficial
    auras such as Power Word: Fortitude, Inner Fire, or other class-specific buffs.
    It ensures that the priest maintains optimal stat enhancements based on current
    game conditions and player needs. The method is usually called during the AI update
    cycle to keep the character''s buff state synchronized with the game environment.'

    code: "void PriestAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    UpdatePriestBuffs();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the regular AI update cycle and
    should be called frequently enough to maintain proper buff states. The implementation
    may vary depending on the specific priest specialization (Holy, Discipline, Shadow)
    and current combat situation.
