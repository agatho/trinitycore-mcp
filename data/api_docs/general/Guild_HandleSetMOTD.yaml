  method: HandleSetMOTD
  signature: void Guild::HandleSetMOTD(WorldSession * session, std::string_view motd)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the message of the day (MOTD) for the guild.
  description: The HandleSetMOTD method is responsible for updating the Message of
    the Day (MOTD) associated with a guild. This MOTD is displayed to guild members
    when they log in or view guild information. The method accepts a WorldSession
    pointer and a string_view containing the new MOTD content. It validates that the
    session's player has sufficient permissions to modify the guild's MOTD, typically
    requiring the player to be the guild leader or have the appropriate guild permissions.
    Once validated, it updates the guild's MOTD in the database and broadcasts the
    change to all online guild members.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession of the player attempting to set the MOTD.
      Used to verify player identity and permissions.
  - name: motd
    description: String view containing the new message of the day. Should be a valid
      UTF-8 string, typically limited in length by game client constraints.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Guild MOTD from Player Session
    code: 'WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();

      std::string_view newMOTD = "Welcome to our awesome guild!";

      player->GetGuild()->HandleSetMOTD(session, newMOTD);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from a client command or game UI interaction.
    The MOTD update is persisted in the database and synchronized across all guild
    members. It's important to validate input length and content to prevent abuse
    or database errors.
  warnings: Improper validation of the MOTD string could lead to SQL injection or
    client-side display issues. Ensure that the MOTD is properly sanitized before
    being stored.
