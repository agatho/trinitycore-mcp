  class: MonkAI
  method: ShouldConserveEnergy
  signature: bool MonkAI::ShouldConserveEnergy()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Monk AI should conserve energy during combat.
  description: The ShouldConserveEnergy method evaluates the current state of the
    Monk AI to decide if it should prioritize energy conservation over aggressive
    actions. This decision is typically based on factors such as available energy,
    incoming damage, and the presence of high-priority abilities that require energy.
    The method helps the AI make strategic choices about when to hold back on energy-consuming
    abilities to maintain sustainability in prolonged encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Monk AI should conserve energy, otherwise returns false.
    A return value of true indicates that the AI will avoid using energy-intensive
    abilities unless absolutely necessary.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Logic
    code: "if (monkAI->ShouldConserveEnergy()) {\n    // Avoid using energy-draining\
      \ abilities\n    DoNotUseEnergyAbilities();\n} else {\n    // Proceed with normal\
      \ ability usage\n    UseEnergyAbilities();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Monk's AI decision-making process and integrates
    with other energy management systems. It may be called frequently during combat
    updates, so performance should be considered in custom implementations.
