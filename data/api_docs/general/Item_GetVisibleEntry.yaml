  class: Item
  method: GetVisibleEntry
  signature: uint32 Item::GetVisibleEntry(const Player * owner) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the visible entry ID of the item, which may differ from the actual
    item entry when the item is in a player's inventory.
  description: The GetVisibleEntry method retrieves the visible entry ID of an item,
    which represents the actual item that is displayed to the player. This value can
    differ from the real item entry when the item is bound to a specific player or
    when it has been modified through enchantments, gems, or other game mechanics.
    The method takes into account the owner's perspective and returns the appropriate
    visible entry ID based on the player's view of the item. This is particularly
    important for items that are bound to players or have special properties that
    affect their visibility.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the visible entry ID of the item, which represents the actual item
    displayed to the player. This value may differ from the real item entry when the
    item is bound to a specific player or modified through game mechanics such as
    enchantments or gems.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 visibleEntry = item->GetVisibleEntry(player);\nif (visibleEntry\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Process the visible entry\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other item-related methods
    to determine how an item appears to a player. The implementation may involve checking
    the item's state and applying appropriate modifications based on player-specific
    conditions.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when dealing with items that are
    bound to players, as it may return different values than expected if the item
    has been modified through enchantments or gems.
