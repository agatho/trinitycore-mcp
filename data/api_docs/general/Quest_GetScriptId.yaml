  class: Quest
  method: GetScriptId
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetScriptId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the script identifier associated with the quest.
  description: The GetScriptId method retrieves the unique script identifier that
    is assigned to a specific quest in the TrinityCore database. This identifier is
    used to link quest events and behaviors to specific script implementations within
    the game's scripting system. The method is typically used during quest processing
    to determine which script handler should be invoked when quest-related events
    occur, such as quest completion or interaction with NPCs. It provides a way to
    identify and manage quest-specific behavior without relying on hardcoded quest
    IDs.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the uint32 script identifier associated with the quest. This value
    represents the unique identifier used by the TrinityCore scripting system to reference
    specific quest scripts, typically correlating to a script name or ID in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 scriptId = quest->GetScriptId();\nif (scriptId != 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Process the quest with the retrieved script ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Quest class and should be used in conjunction
    with other quest-related methods to properly handle quest scripting. The script
    ID returned by this method may be zero if no specific script has been assigned
    to the quest, which typically indicates that the quest uses default behavior.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in conjunction with other quest methods,
    as incorrect handling of script IDs can lead to unexpected behavior or missing
    quest events. Ensure that the quest's script ID is properly initialized before
    calling this method.
