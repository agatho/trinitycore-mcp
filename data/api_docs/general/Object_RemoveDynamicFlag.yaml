  method: RemoveDynamicFlag
  signature: void Object::RemoveDynamicFlag(uint32 flag)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a dynamic flag from the object's flags.
  description: This method removes a specified dynamic flag from the object's dynamic
    flags bitmask. Dynamic flags are used to indicate special properties or states
    of objects in World of Warcraft, such as being temporarily invisible, having a
    specific aura effect, or other transient characteristics. The method operates
    on the object's internal flag structure and is typically used during gameplay
    events where flags need to be modified or cleared. This operation directly affects
    how the object appears to other players and can influence various game mechanics
    including visibility, interaction, and state management.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: The dynamic flag value to remove from the object's flags. This is
      a uint32 value representing one or more dynamic flags that are being removed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a single dynamic flag
    code: 'Object::RemoveDynamicFlag(DYNAMIC_FLAG_NONE);

      // Removes the "none" dynamic flag from the object'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method directly modifies the object's internal flags structure. It is
    important to note that this operation may affect visibility and interaction with
    other players, especially when dealing with temporary flags such as invisibility
    or stealth. Performance considerations should be taken into account when removing
    multiple flags in rapid succession, as each removal requires updating the object's
    flag state.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without proper understanding
    of the dynamic flag system. Incorrect use can lead to unexpected behavior in game
    mechanics, such as incorrect visibility or interaction states. Care should be
    taken when removing flags that are part of a larger set of flags, as removing
    one flag may affect others if they share common bits.
