  signature: bool Unit::HasUnitMovementFlag(uint32 f) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit has a specific movement flag set.
  description: This method determines whether a given movement flag is currently active
    for the unit. It is commonly used in movement-related logic to verify if a unit
    is in a particular state such as flying, swimming, or walking. The method returns
    true if the specified flag is set, false otherwise. This functionality is essential
    for handling movement mechanics in World of Warcraft, particularly when dealing
    with unit states and movement behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified movement flag is currently set for the unit;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->HasUnitMovementFlag(MOVEMENTFLAG_FLYING)) {\n    // Unit is flying\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related
    APIs to determine unit state. Performance-wise, it's a fast operation as it simply
    checks bit flags without complex calculations.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with flags that may change dynamically
    during gameplay; ensure proper synchronization if used in multi-threaded environments.
