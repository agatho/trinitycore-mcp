documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's PvP death status to enable or disable PvP flagging.
  description: The SetPvPDeath method controls whether a player is flagged for PvP
    combat. When enabled, the player will be marked as PvP flagged and can be attacked
    by other players. This method affects the player's PvP status and is commonly
    used during PvP events or when setting up player versus player scenarios. The
    method does not directly change the player's faction or character state, but rather
    controls the PvP flagging mechanism which determines whether a player can be attacked
    by others.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetPvPDeath(true);

      // Player is now flagged for PvP combat'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nif (player->GetPvPStatus()) {\n    player->SetPvPDeath(false);\n\
      }\n// Player is no longer flagged for PvP combat"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly affects the player's
    PvP status and can lead to immediate combat with other players. The implementation
    typically involves setting internal flags within the player object that determine
    whether they are considered PvP flagged.
  warnings: Using this method without proper consideration can result in unintended
    PvP combat situations. Players should be aware that once flagged for PvP, they
    can be attacked by any player regardless of faction status.
