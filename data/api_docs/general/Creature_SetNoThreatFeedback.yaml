  class: Creature
  method: SetNoThreatFeedback
  signature: void Creature::SetNoThreatFeedback(bool noThreatFeedback)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the creature should ignore threat feedback for its current target.
  description: This method controls whether a creature will respond to threat feedback
    from its current target. When set to true, the creature will not react to threat
    changes or updates, effectively disabling threat-based behavior. This is commonly
    used in scenarios where creatures need to be controlled without triggering aggressive
    responses, such as during scripted events or when managing special encounters.
    The method affects the creature's AI behavior and can influence how it interacts
    with players or other units.
  parameters:
  - name: noThreatFeedback
    description: When true, disables threat feedback for the creature; when false,
      enables normal threat feedback behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Creature* creature = GetCreature();

      creature->SetNoThreatFeedback(true);

      // Creature will now ignore threat feedback'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Creature* creature = GetCreature();\nif (creature->GetEntry() == 12345)\n\
      {\n    creature->SetNoThreatFeedback(true);\n}\n// Creature will ignore threat\
      \ feedback only for specific entry"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the creature's AI behavior and should be used
    carefully during scripted events. It does not change the creature's actual threat
    level, but rather disables its response to threat changes.
