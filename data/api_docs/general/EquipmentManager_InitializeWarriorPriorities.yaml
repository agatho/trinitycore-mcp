  signature: void EquipmentManager::InitializeWarriorPriorities()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes equipment priorities for warrior class characters in the game.
  description: The InitializeWarriorPriorities method sets up default equipment priority
    configurations specifically tailored for warrior characters within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method establishes the order of preference for weapon and armor
    types that warriors should prioritize when equipping items, taking into account
    class-specific abilities and gameplay mechanics such as melee damage output, survivability,
    and specialization requirements. The initialization typically occurs during character
    creation or upon loading a warrior's equipment data, ensuring that the AI or player
    can make informed decisions about item selection based on predefined priority
    rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Character Load
    code: "void LoadCharacterEquipment(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->getClass()\
      \ == CLASS_WARRIOR)\n    {\n        EquipmentManager::InitializeWarriorPriorities();\n\
      \        // Proceed with equipment assignment based on initialized priorities\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal equipment management system and should
    not be called directly by external modules unless specifically required for custom
    behavior. It may interact with other systems like item caching or inventory validation,
    so calling it multiple times without proper cleanup could lead to inconsistent
    state.
  warnings: Do not call this method during active combat or while processing item
    transactions, as it may interfere with existing equipment assignments and cause
    unexpected behavior in the game's item management system.
