api:
  class: BotSpawner
  method: GetAllZonePopulations
  signature: int BotSpawner::GetAllZonePopulations() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total population count across all zones managed by the bot
    spawner.
  description: The GetAllZonePopulations method aggregates and returns the cumulative
    number of bots currently active or spawned in all zones under the control of this
    BotSpawner instance. This method is typically used for monitoring system load,
    balancing bot distribution, or enforcing zone-specific population limits. The
    returned value represents a summation of all individual zone populations and can
    be used to determine overall system utilization or to trigger spawning logic based
    on current demand.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of bots across all zones managed
    by this BotSpawner instance. A return value of zero indicates no active bots in
    any zone, while positive values indicate the cumulative population count.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int totalPopulation = botSpawner.GetAllZonePopulations();\nif (totalPopulation\
      \ < MAX_BOTS_PER_ZONE) {\n    // Spawn more bots\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring System Load
    code: "int currentPopulation = botSpawner.GetAllZonePopulations();\nif (currentPopulation\
      \ > 100) {\n    // Log high population warning\n    sLog->outString(\"High bot\
      \ population detected: %d\", currentPopulation);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a summation operation across all managed zones and may
    involve iterating through internal zone data structures. For large numbers of
    zones or high-frequency calls, performance considerations should be taken into
    account.
