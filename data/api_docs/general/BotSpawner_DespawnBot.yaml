  class: BotSpawner
  method: DespawnBot
  signature: bool BotSpawner::DespawnBot(int guid, const std::string & reason)
documentation:
  brief: Despawns a bot with the specified GUID and logs the reason for despawning.
  description: The DespawnBot method removes a bot from the game world by its unique
    identifier (GUID). It performs cleanup operations such as removing the bot's AI
    behavior, releasing associated resources, and logging the reason for the despawn.
    This method is typically used when bots need to be removed due to various conditions
    like player logout, server shutdown, or administrative commands. The method ensures
    that all references to the bot are properly cleared from memory and that the game
    state remains consistent after removal.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot to be despawned. This value
      must correspond to a valid existing bot in the system.
  - name: reason
    description: A string describing the reason for despawning the bot. This is used
      for logging purposes and can help administrators track why bots were removed
      from the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the bot was successfully despawned, or false if the bot
    with the specified GUID could not be found or if an error occurred during the
    despawn process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic DespawnBot Usage
    code: "if (botSpawner->DespawnBot(12345, \"Player logged out\")) {\n    // Bot\
      \ successfully despawned\n} else {\n    // Failed to despawn bot\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: DespawnBot with Dynamic Reason
    code: 'std::string reason = "Server maintenance at " + std::to_string(time(nullptr));

      botSpawner->DespawnBot(67890, reason);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot GUID is valid and corresponds to an existing
    bot in the system. It performs internal cleanup operations and should not be called
    on bots that are already despawned or invalid. The method may have performance
    implications if called frequently in a loop, as it involves searching through
    active bot lists and performing memory cleanup.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid GUID may result in undefined behavior
    or failed cleanup operations. Ensure that the GUID corresponds to an actual bot
    before calling this method. Also, be aware that despawning bots may affect AI
    behavior and quest progress if not handled carefully.
