  class: HolyPriestRefactored
  method: HandleDirectHealing
  signature: bool HolyPriestRefactored::HandleDirectHealing(const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Performs direct healing on a specified group member using Holy Priest abilities.
  description: The HandleDirectHealing method executes a direct healing action targeting
    a group member within the Holy Priest's range. This method is typically invoked
    during combat or when a healing opportunity arises, utilizing the priest's healing
    spells such as Flash Heal or Greater Heal. It evaluates the target's current health
    status and applies the appropriate healing effect based on the priest's current
    mana availability and spell selection logic. The method returns true if the healing
    was successfully applied, or false if the conditions for healing were not met.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The index of the group member to be healed. Valid values are typically
      between 0 and the maximum number of group members (usually 4 for a 5-person
      group). A value of -1 may indicate self-healing or no target.
  returns: Returns true if the direct healing was successfully applied to the target,
    false otherwise. This could be due to invalid target, insufficient mana, or other
    game state constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Healing Usage
    code: "if (priest->HandleDirectHealing(0)) {\n    // Healing was successful\n\
      \    SendChatMessage(\"Healed target 0!\");\n} else {\n    // Healing failed\n\
      \    SendChatMessage(\"Failed to heal target 0.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Healing Based on Health
    code: "Unit* target = GetGroupMember(2);\nif (target && target->GetHealth() <\
      \ (target->GetMaxHealth() * 0.5)) {\n    if (priest->HandleDirectHealing(2))\
      \ {\n        // Heal target if health is below 50%\n        SendChatMessage(\"\
      Healed low-health target 2.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Holy Priest AI has already validated the target's
    eligibility for healing and that sufficient mana is available. The implementation
    may include checks for line-of-sight, target validity, and spell cooldowns. Performance-wise,
    this method should be called sparingly during combat to avoid unnecessary overhead.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the group index or target
    health status can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Ensure that the group
    member exists and is within healing range before invoking this function. Also,
    be aware that repeated calls without cooldown management may cause resource exhaustion.
