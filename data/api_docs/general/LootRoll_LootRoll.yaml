documentation:
  brief: Moves the loot roll data from another LootRoll object to this instance.
  description: The LootRoll::LootRoll method performs a move operation, transferring
    all internal data and state from the provided LootRoll object to the current instance.
    This is typically used in scenarios where ownership of loot roll resources needs
    to be transferred efficiently without unnecessary copying. The method is part
    of the standard C++ move semantics implementation for the LootRoll class, allowing
    for optimized resource management during loot distribution in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework. This operation leaves the source object in a valid but
    unspecified state, as its resources have been moved.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move LootRoll to Another Instance
    code: 'LootRoll roll1;

      // ... populate roll1 with loot data ...

      LootRoll roll2 = std::move(roll1);

      // roll1 is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // roll2 contains all the data from roll1'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method implements move semantics and should be used with std::move()
    for optimal performance. The source object after the operation will be left in
    a valid but unspecified state, which is standard behavior for move operations
    in C++. Ensure that no further operations are performed on the moved-from object
    unless explicitly reset.
  warnings: Using this method without proper move semantics can lead to double-free
    errors or undefined behavior. Never use the source object after calling this method
    unless it's immediately reassigned or reset. This is a low-level API call that
    directly manipulates internal state.
