  class: SpatialGridQueryHelpers
  method: FindQuestGameObjectsInRange
  signature: int SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindQuestGameObjectsInRange(Player * bot,
    float range)
documentation:
  brief: Finds quest-related game objects within a specified range of the player.
  description: The FindQuestGameObjectsInRange method searches for all game objects
    in the player's vicinity that are associated with active or available quests.
    It scans the spatial grid around the player and returns a count of qualifying
    objects. This functionality is commonly used by AI bots and questing systems to
    locate quest items, objectives, or interactive elements. The method leverages
    the TrinityCore spatial grid system for efficient object lookup within a defined
    radius.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of quest-related game objects
    found within the specified range. A return value of zero indicates no qualifying
    objects were located in the search area.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find quest objects near player
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized\nint count = SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindQuestGameObjectsInRange(bot,\
      \ 50.0f);\nif (count > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with quest object interaction logic\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Found %d quest objects nearby.\", count);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the spatial grid system for performance optimization.
    The range parameter defines a circular area around the player's current position.
    Quest-related game objects are determined by their associated quest requirements
    and flags in the database.
