  signature: bool GossipHandler::OptionLeadsToService(const GossipMenuOption & option,
    InteractionType desiredType) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a gossip menu option leads to a service interaction type.
  description: The OptionLeadsToService method evaluates whether a given gossip menu
    option is associated with a specific type of interaction, such as a vendor, trainer,
    or other service. This method is used internally by the GossipHandler to route
    player interactions correctly based on the type of service the option represents.
    It checks the internal state and properties of the GossipMenuOption to determine
    if it corresponds to the desired interaction type. The method is essential for
    ensuring that players are directed to appropriate services when selecting options
    from gossip menus, maintaining proper game flow and interaction mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: option
    description: The GossipMenuOption object representing the menu option being evaluated.
  - name: desiredType
    description: The InteractionType enum value specifying the type of service to
      check for (e.g., VENDOR, TRAINER, etc.).
  returns: Returns true if the gossip menu option leads to a service of the specified
    interaction type; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a gossip option is a vendor
    code: "GossipMenuOption option;\n// Assume option has been initialized with valid\
      \ data\nbool isVendor = handler.OptionLeadsToService(option, InteractionType::VENDOR);\n\
      if (isVendor) {\n    // Handle vendor interaction\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validate multiple service types
    code: "GossipMenuOption option;\n// Assume option has been initialized with valid\
      \ data\nbool isTrainer = handler.OptionLeadsToService(option, InteractionType::TRAINER);\n\
      bool isGossip = handler.OptionLeadsToService(option, InteractionType::GOSSIP);\n\
      if (isTrainer || isGossip) {\n    // Handle trainer or gossip interaction\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking of gossip menu options and
    their associated service types. It should only be called after the option has
    been properly initialized with valid data. The method does not perform any validation
    on the input parameters, so callers must ensure that the provided option is valid
    before invoking this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with an uninitialized or invalid GossipMenuOption
    may result in undefined behavior. Ensure that all options passed to this method
    have been properly constructed and populated with valid data. The method assumes
    that the InteractionType enum values are correctly mapped to the internal service
    types.
