  method: GetMailSize
  signature: uint32 Player::GetMailSize() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current mail size in bytes for the player.
  description: The GetMailSize method retrieves the total size of all mails currently
    stored in the player's mailbox. This includes both read and unread mail, and represents
    the cumulative size of all mail items in bytes. The method is useful for determining
    how much storage space mail is using and can be used to enforce limits or check
    against mail size thresholds. It provides a way to monitor mailbox usage without
    having to manually iterate through individual mail entries.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the total mail size in bytes. This
    value includes all mail items, both read and unread, and can be used to determine
    if the player's mailbox is approaching capacity limits.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 mailSize = player->GetMailSize();\nif (mailSize > 500000) {\n  \
      \  // Mail size exceeds 500KB\n    // Handle accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for mailbox management and can be helpful in
    determining when to warn players about approaching mail limits. Performance considerations
    are minimal as the method simply returns a cached value rather than calculating
    it from scratch.
  warnings: The returned value may not reflect actual storage capacity if the player's
    mailbox has been modified by other means, such as through game events or custom
    modifications.
