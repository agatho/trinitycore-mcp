  class: WarlockAI
  method: WarlockAI
  signature: void WarlockAI::WarlockAI(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a WarlockAI instance for the specified player bot.
  description: The WarlockAI constructor initializes the AI behavior for a warlock
    player character (bot) within the TrinityCore framework. This method sets up the
    necessary internal state and configurations required for the bot to function as
    a warlock, including initializing spell casting routines, managing pet behavior,
    and establishing combat strategies specific to the warlock class. The method is
    typically called during the creation or activation of an AI-controlled warlock
    character in the game environment.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the warlock bot that this
      AI instance will control. Must be a valid player object with warlock class and
      proper initialization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic WarlockAI Initialization
    code: 'Player* myWarlockBot = new Player();

      // ... initialize bot ...

      WarlockAI* warlockAI = new WarlockAI(myWarlockBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the TrinityCore AI system and should only be
    called on player objects that are confirmed to be warlocks. The AI instance will
    automatically manage spell cooldowns, pet behavior, and combat decisions based
    on the bot's current state.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player object passed to this constructor is properly initialized
    and represents a valid warlock character before calling this method. Failure to
    do so may result in undefined behavior or crashes during AI operation.
