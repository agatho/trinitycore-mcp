  class: IResourceSystem
  method: ConsumePrimary
  signature: void IResourceSystem::ConsumePrimary(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes the specified amount of primary resource from the system.
  description: The ConsumePrimary method reduces the available quantity of the primary
    resource by the given amount. This method is typically used in game mechanics
    where players or systems need to spend resources such as mana, rage, energy, or
    other consumable in-game currencies. The operation modifies the internal state
    of the resource system and may trigger events or updates related to resource depletion.
    It is assumed that the system has sufficient primary resource available before
    calling this method.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of primary resource to consume. Must be a non-negative
      integer value representing the amount to deduct from the current resource pool.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Consume 50 mana points
    code: 'IResourceSystem* resourceSystem = player->GetResourceSystem();

      resourceSystem->ConsumePrimary(50);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional resource consumption
    code: "if (player->HasSufficientMana(100)) {\n    player->GetResourceSystem()->ConsumePrimary(100);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not validate whether the requested amount is available;
    it's expected that callers ensure sufficient resources exist before invoking this
    method. The implementation may be part of a larger resource management system
    and could interact with event systems or UI updates.
  warnings: Calling this method with an amount greater than the current primary resource
    balance can lead to undefined behavior or negative resource values, depending
    on the underlying implementation. Always verify available resources prior to consumption.
