documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the AI can execute a pending spell.
  description: The CanExecutePendingSpell method checks if the current AI unit is
    able to proceed with executing a previously queued spell. This method typically
    evaluates conditions such as spell readiness, target validity, and AI state to
    determine if the pending spell can be safely executed. It's commonly used within
    the AI decision-making loop to ensure proper timing and context for spell casting.
    The method returns true when all prerequisites for spell execution are met, and
    false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI unit can execute the pending spell based on current
    conditions; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void ClassAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (CanExecutePendingSpell())\n\
      \    {\n        // Execute the pending spell\n        DoCastVictim(m_pendingSpell);\n\
      \        m_pendingSpell = 0;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles to determine if a
    previously queued spell should be executed immediately. It's important to note
    that the method does not actually execute the spell, but only determines whether
    it's safe to do so.
