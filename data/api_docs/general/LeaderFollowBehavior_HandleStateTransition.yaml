  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: HandleStateTransition
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::HandleStateTransition(FollowState oldState,
    FollowState newState)
documentation:
  brief: Transitions the leader-follower behavior from one state to another, updating
    internal state and triggering appropriate actions.
  description: The HandleStateTransition method manages the state changes within a
    LeaderFollowBehavior instance. It takes an old state and a new state as parameters
    and performs necessary updates to reflect the transition. This method is typically
    invoked when a leader-follower relationship needs to be modified, such as when
    a follower starts following, stops following, or when the leader's status changes.
    The method ensures that all relevant systems are notified of the change and that
    appropriate actions are taken based on the new state. It may also handle cleanup
    or initialization tasks associated with the new state.
  parameters:
  - name: oldState
    description: The previous FollowState that the behavior was in before transition
  - name: newState
    description: The new FollowState that the behavior should transition to
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic State Transition Example
    code: 'LeaderFollowBehavior behavior;

      behavior.HandleStateTransition(FollowState::FOLLOWING, FollowState::STOPPED);'
    language: cpp
  - title: State Transition with Dynamic State Change
    code: "FollowState currentState = behavior.GetCurrentState();\nif (currentState\
      \ == FollowState::FOLLOWING) {\n    behavior.HandleStateTransition(currentState,\
      \ FollowState::PAUSED);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called only when a valid state transition is intended.
    The implementation may perform checks to ensure that the transition from oldState
    to newState is allowed according to game logic rules.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to inconsistent behavior in leader-follower
    AI systems. Ensure that all possible state transitions are properly validated
    before calling this method.
