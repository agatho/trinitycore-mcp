  class: WarriorAI
  method: IsValidTarget
  signature: bool WarriorAI::IsValidTarget(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given unit is a valid target for the warrior AI.
  description: The IsValidTarget method evaluates whether a specified Unit object
    meets the criteria to be considered a valid target for the WarriorAI's current
    behavior. This includes checking if the target is alive, within range, not immune
    to the warrior's attacks, and not in an invalid state such as being invulnerable
    or stealthed. The method is typically used internally by the AI system to filter
    potential targets before initiating combat actions or applying abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is being evaluated for validity as
      a target. Must not be null; passing a null pointer will likely result in undefined
      behavior.
  returns: Returns true if the target is valid and can be engaged by the warrior AI,
    false otherwise. A return value of false indicates that the target either does
    not meet the conditions for engagement or is currently inaccessible to the AI.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a Unit is a Valid Target
    code: "if (warriorAI->IsValidTarget(targetUnit)) {\n    // Proceed with attack\
      \ logic\n    warriorAI->AttackStart(targetUnit);\n} else {\n    // Find another\
      \ target or do nothing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI decision-making loop and should be called
    frequently during combat updates. It may internally perform checks against the
    Unit's health, faction, immunity flags, and visibility state to determine validity.
  warnings: Do not pass null pointers to this method as it will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the target unit is properly initialized and
    in a valid game state before calling IsValidTarget.
