documentation:
  brief: Finds and matches new groups for LFG (Looking For Group) queue participants
  description: The FindNewGroups method is responsible for matching players in the
    LFG queue with compatible group members based on various criteria such as level,
    role availability, and dungeon requirements. It evaluates the current state of
    the queue and attempts to form new groups that meet the requirements for dungeons
    or raids. This method plays a crucial role in the World of Warcraft's LFG system
    by ensuring efficient group formation and reducing wait times for players seeking
    to join instances. The method updates internal tracking structures and may trigger
    notifications to players when suitable matches are found.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an LfgCompatibility enum value indicating the compatibility status
    of the matching process. Possible values include LFG_COMPATIBILITY_SUCCESS, LFG_COMPATIBILITY_FAIL,
    or LFG_COMPATIBILITY_PARTIAL depending on how well the groups matched and whether
    all players were successfully paired.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in LFG queue processing
    code: "LfgCompatibility result = lfgQueue.FindNewGroups(check, all);\nif (result\
      \ == LFG_COMPATIBILITY_SUCCESS) {\n    // All players matched successfully\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"LFG groups formed successfully\");\n} else if (result\
      \ == LFG_COMPATIBILITY_FAIL) {\n    // No compatible groups found\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      No compatible groups available\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called periodically by the LFG system to process
    queued players. It may modify internal queue state and should be invoked in a
    thread-safe context within the game's main loop. The check and all parameters
    are used internally to track matching progress and may be updated during execution.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from player-facing code without proper
    synchronization. The method modifies internal LFG queue structures which could
    lead to race conditions if accessed concurrently. Ensure that any calls to this
    method respect the game's threading model.
