documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one BotPriorityManager object to another
  description: The assignment operator for BotPriorityManager performs a deep copy
    of all internal data members from the source object to the target object. This
    method ensures that both objects maintain independent copies of priority configurations
    and associated bot data. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this operation
    is crucial when transferring priority settings between different bot management
    instances or when resetting a manager's state with values from another instance.
    The operator handles memory management internally and returns a reference to the
    assigned object for chaining operations.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotPriorityManager object whose contents will be copied
      to this instance
  returns: A reference to the current BotPriorityManager object after assignment has
    completed, enabling operator chaining
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Operation
    code: 'BotPriorityManager manager1;

      BotPriorityManager manager2 = manager1; // Uses copy constructor

      // or

      manager2 = manager1; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Assignment Operations
    code: 'BotPriorityManager mgrA, mgrB, mgrC;

      // ... initialize managers ...

      mgrA = mgrB = mgrC; // Chained assignment

      // All three managers now have identical priority configurations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements a deep copy strategy to ensure that internal
    data structures such as priority lists, bot references, and configuration settings
    are properly duplicated. The implementation should handle potential memory allocation
    failures gracefully and maintain thread safety if used in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning large BotPriorityManager objects as this operation
    may involve significant memory copying and could impact performance. Ensure that
    the source object remains valid throughout the assignment process to avoid undefined
    behavior.
