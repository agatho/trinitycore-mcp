  class: VendorInteraction
  method: GetAccessibleFactionVendors
  signature: int VendorInteraction::GetAccessibleFactionVendors(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of vendor entries accessible to a player based on faction
    requirements.
  description: The GetAccessibleFactionVendors method determines how many vendor entries
    are available for a given player by evaluating their faction standing and other
    access conditions. This function is typically used in vendor interaction logic
    to filter which items or services a player can access. It considers the player's
    current faction status, reputation levels, and any faction-specific restrictions
    that may apply to vendors within the game world. The method does not directly
    return vendor data but rather provides a count of accessible vendors, which can
    then be used to iterate through or display relevant vendor information.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of vendor entries that are accessible
    to the specified player based on faction requirements and other conditions. Returns
    zero if no vendors are accessible or if an error occurs during evaluation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Vendor Interaction
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized\nint accessibleVendors\
      \ = vendorInteraction->GetAccessibleFactionVendors(player);\nif (accessibleVendors\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with displaying or iterating through vendors\n   \
      \ printf(\"%d vendors are accessible to this player.\\n\", accessibleVendors);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs faction-based filtering using internal TrinityCore
    reputation and vendor access systems. It may involve database lookups or cached
    faction data to determine accessibility. The exact implementation details depend
    on how faction vendors are defined in the game's database and core logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as it could lead to undefined behavior if not properly validated.
    Also, note that this function may be called frequently during vendor interactions,
    so performance considerations should be taken into account for large vendor databases.
