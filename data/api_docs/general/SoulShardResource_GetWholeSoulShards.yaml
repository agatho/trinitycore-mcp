  class: SoulShardResource
  method: GetWholeSoulShards
  signature: uint32 SoulShardResource::GetWholeSoulShards() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of whole soul shards available in the resource.
  description: The GetWholeSoulShards method retrieves the current number of complete
    (non-partial) soul shards stored within the SoulShardResource object. This value
    represents how many full soul shards a player or creature possesses, which is
    typically used for spell casting, particularly for warlock abilities that consume
    soul shards. The method does not account for partial soul shards and only returns
    the integer count of fully formed ones. This function is commonly called during
    gameplay logic to determine if sufficient soul shards are available before executing
    actions that require them.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of whole soul shards currently
    stored in the resource. Returns zero if no complete soul shards are present.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Available Soul Shards Before Casting
    code: "if (player->GetSoulShardResource()->GetWholeSoulShards() >= 1) {\n    //\
      \ Cast a spell that requires one soul shard\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_SOUL_SHARD_SPELL,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Displaying Soul Shard Count to Player
    code: 'uint32 wholeShards = player->GetSoulShardResource()->GetWholeSoulShards();

      ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage("You have %u whole soul shards.",
      wholeShards);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other soul shard-related
    functions such as AddSoulShards() or RemoveSoulShards(). The returned value reflects
    only complete soul shards, not fractional amounts. This function is thread-safe
    and can be called from any context where the SoulShardResource object is accessible.
  warnings: Be aware that this method does not include partial soul shards in its
    count. If your game logic requires handling fractional soul shards, you should
    use additional methods or track them separately. Also, ensure that the SoulShardResource
    object is valid before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
