api:
  class: VendorInteraction
  method: FindVendorsWithItem
  signature: int VendorInteraction::FindVendorsWithItem(uint32 itemId, uint32 playerZone)
documentation:
  brief: Finds all vendors in the specified zone that sell the given item.
  description: The FindVendorsWithItem method searches through the database for all
    vendor NPCs within a specified player zone that offer a particular item for sale.
    It returns the count of such vendors found, which can be used to determine how
    many merchants in a given area carry a specific item. This functionality is commonly
    used in quest systems, item lookup utilities, or when implementing custom vendor
    interaction logic. The method requires both an item ID and a player zone ID to
    perform the search, ensuring that only relevant vendors are returned based on
    the player's current location.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item to search for among vendors. Must
      correspond to a valid item entry in the game database.
  - name: playerZone
    description: The zone ID where the player is located, used to filter vendors within
      that specific geographic area.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of vendors found in the specified
    zone that sell the given item. A return value of zero indicates no vendors were
    found with the specified item in the zone.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: int vendorCount = vendorInteraction->FindVendorsWithItem(12345, 123); //
      Find vendors selling item ID 12345 in zone 123
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if Item is Available from Any Vendor
    code: "if (vendorInteraction->FindVendorsWithItem(67890, player->GetZoneId())\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Item is available from at least one vendor in the current zone\n\
      \    SendItemAvailabilityMessage(\"Item found at a vendor.\");\n} else {\n \
      \   // No vendors carry this item in the current zone\n    SendItemAvailabilityMessage(\"\
      Item not available from any vendor in this zone.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database queries to locate vendor entries and
    their associated item lists. It may cache results for performance optimization
    depending on the implementation details of VendorInteraction class. The method
    assumes that both itemId and playerZone are valid identifiers.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided itemId exists in the game database, otherwise
    the method might return unexpected results or errors. Also, be aware that zone
    IDs can change between different versions of TrinityCore or custom modifications.
