  class: SpatialQueryMetrics
  method: GetCurrentFrame
  signature: FrameMetrics SpatialQueryMetrics::GetCurrentFrame() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current frame's metrics from the spatial query system.
  description: The GetCurrentFrame method returns the FrameMetrics object representing
    the current frame's data within the spatial query system. This method provides
    access to timing and performance statistics for the most recently processed frame,
    which is essential for monitoring and optimizing spatial queries in TrinityCore's
    world simulation. The returned metrics typically include frame duration, number
    of processed entities, and other relevant performance indicators that help developers
    understand query efficiency.
  parameters: []
  returns: A FrameMetrics object containing timing and performance data for the current
    frame, including metrics such as frame duration, entity count, and processing
    time statistics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SpatialQueryMetrics metrics = world->GetSpatialQueryMetrics();

      FrameMetrics currentFrame = metrics.GetCurrentFrame();

      std::cout << "Frame duration: " << currentFrame.GetDuration() << " ms" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for performance monitoring and debugging spatial
    queries. The returned FrameMetrics object should not be modified directly as it
    represents read-only data from the current frame processing cycle.
