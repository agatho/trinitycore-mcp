  signature: uint32 BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::GetMaxSessionsPerUpdate() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum number of bot sessions to process per update cycle.
  description: This method retrieves the configured limit for the number of bot sessions
    that can be processed during a single update iteration. It is used to control
    resource usage and prevent excessive CPU load when managing multiple bot sessions.
    The value is typically set based on performance requirements and system capabilities,
    ensuring that bot processing does not monopolize server resources. This setting
    helps maintain stable gameplay performance while allowing bots to function effectively.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of bot sessions to process
    in one update cycle. This value determines how many bots will be ticked or updated
    during each server tick, balancing between responsiveness and system load.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve max sessions per update
    code: 'uint32 maxSessions = botWorldSessionMgr->GetMaxSessionsPerUpdate();

      TC_LOG_INFO("bot", "Max bot sessions per update: {}", maxSessions);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This value is typically configured via server settings or configuration files.
    Changing this value may impact overall server performance and bot responsiveness.
    The method is thread-safe as it only reads a cached configuration value.
