  class: SpellCastTargets
  method: GetCorpseTarget
  signature: Corpse * SpellCastTargets::GetCorpseTarget() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the corpse target associated with the spell cast targets.
  description: The GetCorpseTarget method retrieves a pointer to the Corpse object
    that represents the target of a spell cast. This is typically used in scenarios
    where a spell affects a corpse, such as resurrection spells or spells that target
    dead players. The method returns a null pointer if no corpse target has been set
    or if the target is invalid. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    this functionality supports the game mechanics related to corpse handling and
    spell targeting.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Corpse object representing the target, or nullptr if no
    valid corpse target exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell effect
    code: "void HandleResurrectionSpell(Spell* spell)\n{\n    SpellCastTargets targets\
      \ = spell->GetTargets();\n    Corpse* targetCorpse = targets.GetCorpseTarget();\n\
      \    if (targetCorpse && targetCorpse->IsInWorld())\n    {\n        // Proceed\
      \ with resurrection logic\n        DoResurrection(targetCorpse);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SpellCastTargets class and assumes that the spell
    targets have been properly initialized. The returned Corpse pointer should be
    validated before use to avoid null dereference errors.
  warnings: Ensure that the target corpse is valid and in the world before attempting
    to perform operations on it, as using an invalid corpse pointer may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes.
