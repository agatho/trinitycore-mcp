  signature: bool GameObject::IsTransport() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the GameObject is a transport vehicle.
  description: This method checks if the GameObject instance represents a transport
    vehicle, such as a ship or flight path that can carry players and objects. It
    returns true if the object is classified as a transport, false otherwise. The
    method is commonly used in game mechanics to identify which objects are capable
    of transporting players across different zones or locations. This functionality
    is essential for implementing transport-related behaviors in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the GameObject is a transport vehicle, false otherwise.
    The method does not return null or error values as it simply checks a property
    of the object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (gameobject->IsTransport()) {\n    // Handle transport logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal GameObject flags and properties that define
    transport behavior. It is typically used in conjunction with other transport-related
    methods to determine the transport's capabilities and properties.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining if a GameObject is a vehicle
    in general, as there are separate methods for that purpose. Care must be taken
    when using this method in conditional logic to avoid incorrect assumptions about
    object behavior.
