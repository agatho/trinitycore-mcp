  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: NormalizeAngle
  signature: float LeaderFollowBehavior::NormalizeAngle(float angle)
documentation:
  brief: Normalizes an angle to the range [0, 2*PI) radians.
  description: The NormalizeAngle method adjusts a given angle value to ensure it
    falls within the standard range of [0, 2*PI) radians. This is commonly used in
    AI behavior systems where angular calculations need to be consistent and avoid
    overflow or underflow issues. The method handles both positive and negative angles
    by wrapping them into the valid range using modular arithmetic. In the context
    of TrinityCore's AI framework, this ensures that orientation and movement behaviors
    are correctly interpreted regardless of how angles are initially calculated.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the normalized angle in radians, guaranteed
    to be within the range [0, 2*PI).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Angle Normalization
    code: 'float angle = -1.5f;

      float normalized = leaderFollowBehavior->NormalizeAngle(angle);

      // Result: normalized will be approximately 4.783 radians (which is -1.5 + 2*PI)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Large Positive Angles
    code: 'float angle = 7.0f;

      float normalized = leaderFollowBehavior->NormalizeAngle(angle);

      // Result: normalized will be approximately 0.717 radians (which is 7.0 - 2*PI)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses standard modular arithmetic to wrap angles, which makes
    it suitable for continuous angular calculations in AI systems. It's particularly
    useful when working with trigonometric functions or when comparing orientations
    in pathfinding and movement behaviors.
