documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the throughput rate for a specified machine learning
    operation type
  description: The GetOperationThroughput method retrieves the current throughput
    measurement for a given machine learning operation type. This value represents
    how many operations of the specified type can be processed per second, providing
    performance metrics for ML workloads within the TrinityCore environment. The method
    is typically used for monitoring and optimizing machine learning subsystem performance
    during gameplay or simulation scenarios. It requires that the MLPerformanceTracker
    instance has been properly initialized with operational data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the throughput rate in operations per second
    for the specified operation type. Returns 0.0 if the operation type is invalid
    or no performance data exists for that operation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MLPerformanceTracker tracker;

      float throughput = tracker.GetOperationThroughput(MLOperationType::ML_OP_PREDICTION);

      std::cout << "Prediction throughput: " << throughput << " ops/sec" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring
    code: "MLPerformanceTracker tracker;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {\n    float\
      \ currentThroughput = tracker.GetOperationThroughput(MLOperationType::ML_OP_TRAINING);\n\
      \    if (currentThroughput < 10.0f) {\n        // Log performance degradation\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Warning: Training throughput below threshold: %f\"\
      , currentThroughput);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not block other operations.
    The throughput values are calculated based on historical performance data collected
    by the MLPerformanceTracker instance, so results may vary depending on system
    load and available resources.
  warnings: The method assumes that the MLPerformanceTracker has been properly initialized
    with valid operation data. Calling this method before any operations have been
    tracked may return inaccurate or zero values. The returned throughput values are
    approximate and should be used for performance monitoring rather than precise
    timing measurements.
