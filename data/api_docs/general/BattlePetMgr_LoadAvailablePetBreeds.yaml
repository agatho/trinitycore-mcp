  signature: void BattlePetMgr::LoadAvailablePetBreeds()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads available battle pet breeds for the player's battle
    pet manager.
  description: The LoadAvailablePetBreeds method populates the internal data structures
    of the BattlePetMgr with information about which battle pet breeds are available
    to the player. This typically occurs during player login or when the battle pet
    system is initialized. The method ensures that the player's collection of battle
    pets and their breed information is correctly synchronized with the game's database
    or in-memory storage. It may also handle loading of breed-specific attributes,
    such as stats, abilities, and compatibility data for each breed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during player login
    code: "void Player::OnLogin()\n{\n    m_BattlePetMgr->LoadAvailablePetBreeds();\n\
      \    // Other login logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the core during player
    session initialization. It may perform database queries or load cached data, so
    it should not be called excessively in performance-critical code paths.
  warnings: Calling this method manually outside of proper initialization contexts
    might lead to inconsistent state or duplicate data loading. Ensure that it's only
    used when necessary and after the manager is properly initialized.
