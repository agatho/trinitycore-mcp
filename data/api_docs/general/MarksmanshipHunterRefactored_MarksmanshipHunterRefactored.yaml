  class: MarksmanshipHunterRefactored
  method: MarksmanshipHunterRefactored
  signature: void MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::MarksmanshipHunterRefactored(Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Marksmanship Hunter AI bot with the specified player.
  description: This constructor initializes a MarksmanshipHunterRefactored AI class
    instance for a player, setting up the necessary hunter-specific behaviors and
    mechanics for marksmanship specialization. The method configures the bot's target
    selection logic, ability usage patterns, and combat strategies tailored for marksmanship
    hunters in TrinityCore's AI framework. It establishes the foundation for the bot
    to perform intelligent hunting actions including shot management, focus generation,
    and optimal ability prioritization during combat encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Get player reference

      MarksmanshipHunterRefactored hunterAI(bot);

      // Bot is now initialized with marksmanship behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The Player
    parameter must not be null and should represent a valid hunter character with
    marksmanship specialization. The AI system relies on the player's current state,
    including health, mana, focus, and target information to make decisions.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor multiple times on the same instance as it
    may lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks. Ensure that the Player object
    remains valid throughout the bot's lifetime as the AI will reference it directly
    without copying.
