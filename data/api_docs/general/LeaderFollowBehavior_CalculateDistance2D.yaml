  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: CalculateDistance2D
  signature: float LeaderFollowBehavior::CalculateDistance2D(const int & pos1, const
    int & pos2)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the 2D Euclidean distance between two positions in the game world.
  description: The CalculateDistance2D method computes the straight-line distance
    between two points in a 2D plane, ignoring vertical (Z-axis) differences. This
    is commonly used in AI behavior systems to determine proximity of units or objects
    for pathfinding, targeting, or movement decisions. The method takes two integer
    position coordinates and returns a floating-point value representing the distance.
    It's particularly useful in leader-follow behavior logic where minions need to
    maintain a specific distance from their leader.
  parameters:
  - name: pos1
    description: The first position coordinate, typically representing an X or Y value
      in the game world. This parameter is passed by reference as an integer.
  - name: pos2
    description: The second position coordinate, typically representing an X or Y
      value in the game world. This parameter is passed by reference as an integer.
  returns: A float value representing the 2D Euclidean distance between the two provided
    coordinates. Returns zero if both positions are identical.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Distance Calculation
    code: 'int x1 = 100, y1 = 150;

      int x2 = 130, y2 = 190;

      float distance = leaderFollowBehavior.CalculateDistance2D(x1, x2); // Calculates
      horizontal distance

      // Note: This example assumes pos1 and pos2 are X coordinates; actual usage
      may vary based on implementation'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Unit Positions
    code: "Unit* leader = ...;\nUnit* follower = ...;\nfloat distance = leaderFollowBehavior.CalculateDistance2D(leader->GetPositionX(),\
      \ follower->GetPositionX());\nif (distance > 10.0f) {\n    // Move closer to\
      \ leader\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method only calculates the horizontal distance and ignores Z-axis differences.
    For full 3D distance calculations, use a different method such as CalculateDistance3D.
    This function is optimized for performance in AI systems where frequent proximity
    checks are required.
  warnings: Ensure that both parameters represent valid coordinate values; passing
    invalid or uninitialized coordinates may result in incorrect distance calculations.
    The method assumes integer inputs but returns a float, so be aware of potential
    precision loss during conversion.
