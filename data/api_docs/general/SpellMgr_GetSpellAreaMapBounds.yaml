documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell area map bounds for a given spell ID.
  description: The GetSpellAreaMapBounds method retrieves the bounding rectangle or
    area constraints associated with a specific spell in the game world. This functionality
    is used to determine where a spell can be cast or applied based on geographical
    boundaries, such as zone restrictions, instance limits, or custom spell areas
    defined in the database. The returned SpellAreaMapBounds object typically contains
    information about the map ID, area ID, and geographic coordinates that define
    the valid casting area for the spell. This method is essential for validating
    spell usage within specific regions of the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A SpellAreaMapBounds object containing the map bounds information for the
    specified spell. The structure typically includes map ID, area ID, and coordinate
    boundaries that define where the spell can be cast or applied. Returns an empty
    or default-constructed bounds object if no spell area data is found for the given
    spell ID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Spell Area Bounds
    code: "SpellAreaMapBounds bounds = sSpellMgr->GetSpellAreaMapBounds(12345);\n\
      if (!bounds.IsEmpty())\n{\n    // Process valid spell area bounds\n    uint32\
      \ mapId = bounds.GetMapId();\n    uint32 areaId = bounds.GetAreaId();\n    //\
      \ Use bounds for spell validation or positioning logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during spell validation and targeting checks.
    The returned bounds information may be cached internally by the SpellMgr for performance
    reasons. Developers should ensure that any spell area validation logic properly
    handles empty or invalid bounds returned by this method.
  warnings: The method does not validate if the spell ID actually exists in the database.
    Calling this method with an invalid spell ID may return default/empty bounds without
    error. Always verify spell existence before calling this method for critical gameplay
    logic.
