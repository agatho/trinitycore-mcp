  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: Update
  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the guild event coordinator's internal state based on elapsed time.
  description: The Update method processes and handles any pending guild events within
    the GuildEventCoordinator. It is typically called from the game loop to ensure
    that guild-related events such as member promotions, guild chat messages, or scheduled
    activities are properly handled according to their timing. This method manages
    event queuing, triggers appropriate callbacks, and updates internal timers based
    on the time difference passed in the 'diff' parameter. The method ensures that
    all guild events are processed in a timely manner without blocking the main game
    thread.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed since the last update call, measured in milliseconds.
      This value is used to determine how much time has passed and whether any scheduled
      guild events should be triggered or updated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = sWorld->GetLastDiff();\n    guildEventCoordinator->Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with World Update
    code: "class World\n{\npublic:\n    void Update(uint32 diff)\n    {\n        //\
      \ Other world updates...\n        guildEventCoordinator->Update(diff);\n   \
      \     // Continue other updates...\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called regularly from the main game loop, typically
    every tick or at fixed intervals. It's important that 'diff' accurately reflects
    the time passed since the last call to avoid incorrect event timing.
