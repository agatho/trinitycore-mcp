  brief: Initiates an attack action for the AI-controlled unit
  description: The AttackAction method is responsible for triggering the combat behavior
    of an AI-controlled unit, typically used in creature AI scripts to initiate melee
    attacks against target enemies. This method handles the core attack logic including
    target selection, weapon handling, and attack execution. It is commonly invoked
    during AI update cycles or when specific combat conditions are met. The method
    does not directly perform damage calculations but rather orchestrates the attack
    sequence within the game's combat system.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Attack Action Usage
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n \
      \       return;\n\n    if (me->getAttackTimer() == 0)\n    {\n        AttackAction();\
      \ // Initiate attack\n        me->resetAttackTimer();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within AI update loops and should only
    be invoked when the creature has a valid combat target. The actual attack animation
    and damage calculation are handled by other subsystems in TrinityCore's combat
    system.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the creature has a valid target
    may result in undefined behavior or client-side errors. Always ensure proper target
    validation before invoking AttackAction.
