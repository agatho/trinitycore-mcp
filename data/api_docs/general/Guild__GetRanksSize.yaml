  method: _GetRanksSize
  signature: uint8 Guild::_GetRanksSize() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of ranks defined in the guild.
  description: The _GetRanksSize method retrieves the total count of rank entries
    configured for a guild. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, guilds
    maintain a list of ranks that define member permissions and hierarchy levels.
    This method provides access to the size of that rank configuration array, which
    is essential for iterating through or validating rank-related operations. The
    returned value corresponds to the number of distinct rank levels available within
    the guild structure, including all predefined and custom ranks.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the total number of ranks defined in the guild.
    This count includes all rank entries from the lowest to highest permission level,
    starting with rank 0 as the lowest rank (typically 'Guild Master').
  examples:
  - title: Check Guild Rank Count
    code: "void CheckGuildRanks(Player* player)\n{\n    if (Guild* guild = player->GetGuild())\n\
      \    {\n        uint8 rankCount = guild->_GetRanksSize();\n        ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      This guild has %u ranks.\", rankCount);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore server for managing
    guild permissions and member rank assignments. It should not be called directly
    from game logic unless necessary, as it's part of the internal guild management
    system.
  warnings: Do not modify the return value or assume it reflects dynamic changes in
    real-time; the value returned is static and corresponds to the current configuration
    stored in the database.
