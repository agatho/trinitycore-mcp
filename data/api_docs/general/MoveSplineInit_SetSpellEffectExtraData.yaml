  class: MoveSplineInit
  method: SetSpellEffectExtraData
  signature: void MoveSplineInit::SetSpellEffectExtraData(const SpellEffectExtraData
    & spellEffectExtraData)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes spell effect extra data for a movement spline.
  description: The SetSpellEffectExtraData method configures additional data related
    to spell effects that influence character movement. This is typically used in
    conjunction with spell-based movement mechanics, such as teleportation or jump
    effects, where extra positional or orientation information is required to properly
    execute the movement animation. The method stores the provided spell effect data
    internally for use during spline initialization and execution.
  parameters:
  - name: spellEffectExtraData
    description: A constant reference to a SpellEffectExtraData structure containing
      supplementary information about the spell effect that affects movement, such
      as target positions or movement parameters.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting spell effect extra data for a teleport spell
    code: 'SpellEffectExtraData extraData;

      extraData.targetPosition = Position(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f);

      moveSplineInit.SetSpellEffectExtraData(extraData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initiating a movement spline that is
    influenced by spell effects. It's important to ensure the SpellEffectExtraData
    structure is properly initialized with valid values, as incorrect data may lead
    to unexpected movement behavior or client-side errors.
  warnings: Calling this method after the spline has already been initialized may
    result in undefined behavior. Always set spell effect extra data before calling
    any movement initiation methods.
