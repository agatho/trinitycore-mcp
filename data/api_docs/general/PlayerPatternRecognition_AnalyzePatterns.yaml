  class: PlayerPatternRecognition
  method: AnalyzePatterns
  signature: void PlayerPatternRecognition::AnalyzePatterns(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes player movement patterns and behavioral data for detection and profiling
    purposes.
  description: The AnalyzePatterns method processes and evaluates a player's movement
    behaviors, actions, and interaction sequences to identify potential anomalies
    or predefined pattern signatures. This functionality is typically used in anti-cheat
    systems or behavioral analytics within the TrinityCore framework. The method operates
    on a specified player identified by their GUID and performs internal analysis
    without returning explicit results. It may trigger additional system events or
    logging based on detected patterns. The analysis considers various factors such
    as movement speed, direction changes, timing of actions, and other gameplay-related
    metrics.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose movement patterns
      are to be analyzed. This value must correspond to an active player in the game
      world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pattern Analysis for Player
    code: 'PlayerPatternRecognition patternRec;

      uint32 playerId = 12345;

      patternRec.AnalyzePatterns(playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely invoked during periodic checks or triggered by specific
    game events. It may have performance implications if called excessively on many
    players simultaneously. The actual pattern recognition logic and data storage
    mechanisms are not exposed through this interface.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID parameter refers to a valid, currently logged-in
    player; otherwise, behavior is undefined. This method should not be used for real-time
    gameplay modifications as it's intended for analysis only.
