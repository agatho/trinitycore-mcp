  method: IsEmpty
  signature: bool VehicleSeat::IsEmpty() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the vehicle seat is currently unoccupied by any passenger.
  description: The IsEmpty method determines if a vehicle seat has no passenger assigned
    to it. This method is commonly used in vehicle-related game mechanics to verify
    seat availability before attempting to board a vehicle or to check if a seat can
    be occupied. The method performs a simple check against the internal passenger
    reference stored within the VehicleSeat object. It does not validate the passenger's
    state beyond checking for null presence, meaning it will return true even if a
    passenger has been removed from the seat but the seat hasn't been properly cleared
    yet.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the vehicle seat is unoccupied (no passenger assigned),
    false otherwise. The method returns false if a passenger is currently seated in
    the vehicle seat, regardless of whether that passenger is valid or active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Seat Availability Check
    code: "VehicleSeat* seat = vehicle->GetSeat(0);\nif (seat->IsEmpty()) {\n    //\
      \ Proceed with boarding logic\n    player->EnterVehicle(vehicle, 0);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Seat is occupied, handle accordingly\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      This seat is already occupied.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Preventing Multiple Boarding Attempts
    code: "VehicleSeat* seat = player->GetVehicleSeat();\nif (seat && seat->IsEmpty())\
      \ {\n    // Safe to board vehicle\n    player->EnterVehicle(vehicle, 0);\n}\
      \ else if (seat) {\n    // Seat is occupied or invalid\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      You cannot board this vehicle.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only checks for the presence of a passenger reference and does
    not perform any validation on the passenger's actual state. It's recommended to
    combine this check with additional validation when implementing boarding logic
    to ensure proper game state consistency. The method is thread-safe as it only
    reads from immutable internal state.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in scenarios where passengers might
    be removed asynchronously, as there could be a brief window where the seat appears
    empty but is still being processed for removal. This can lead to race conditions
    if not properly handled with synchronization mechanisms.
