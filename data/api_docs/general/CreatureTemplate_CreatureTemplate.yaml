documentation:
  brief: Moves a CreatureTemplate object, transferring ownership of its resources
    to the new instance.
  description: The CreatureTemplate move constructor transfers all resources from
    the source CreatureTemplate object to the newly constructed object. This operation
    is typically used when creating new CreatureTemplate instances by moving existing
    ones, avoiding expensive deep copies. The source object becomes invalid after
    the move and should not be used. This constructor is part of the C++ standard
    library's move semantics implementation for the CreatureTemplate class, enabling
    efficient resource management during object creation and assignment operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Construction Example
    code: 'CreatureTemplate template1;

      // ... initialize template1 ...

      CreatureTemplate template2 = std::move(template1); // Move constructor called

      // template1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move in Container Example
    code: 'std::vector<CreatureTemplate> templates;

      CreatureTemplate newTemplate;

      templates.push_back(std::move(newTemplate)); // Move constructor used during
      vector push_back

      // newTemplate is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This move constructor is automatically generated by the compiler if not explicitly
    defined. It's important to understand that after moving, the source object should
    not be accessed as its state becomes undefined. The move constructor enables efficient
    resource transfer in scenarios like container operations, function returns, and
    temporary object handling.
  warnings: Do not use the source object after moving it. Accessing a moved-from CreatureTemplate
    object results in undefined behavior. This constructor is typically used internally
    by the standard library containers and should not be called directly unless implementing
    move semantics for custom classes.
