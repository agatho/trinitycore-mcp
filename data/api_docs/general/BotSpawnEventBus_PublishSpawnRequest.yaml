  class: BotSpawnEventBus
  method: PublishSpawnRequest
  signature: void BotSpawnEventBus::PublishSpawnRequest(const int & request, std::function<void
    (bool, int)> callback)
documentation:
  brief: Publishes a bot spawn request with associated callback for handling the result.
  description: 'The PublishSpawnRequest method is used to initiate a bot spawn event
    within the TrinityCore framework. It accepts a request identifier and a callback
    function that will be invoked upon completion of the spawn operation. The callback
    receives two parameters: a boolean indicating success or failure of the spawn
    attempt, and an integer representing the resulting bot''s unique identifier or
    error code. This method is typically used in conjunction with the BotSpawnEventBus
    to manage asynchronous bot creation events.'
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: An integer identifier representing the specific spawn request to
      be processed. This value is used internally by the event bus to determine how
      to handle the spawn operation.
  - name: callback
    description: 'A std::function object that will be executed when the spawn request
      completes. The callback takes two parameters: a boolean indicating success (true)
      or failure (false), and an integer representing the bot''s ID on success or
      an error code on failure.'
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Spawn Request
    code: "int spawnRequest = 1001;\nBotSpawnEventBus::PublishSpawnRequest(spawnRequest,\
      \ [](bool success, int botId) {\n    if (success) {\n        std::cout << \"\
      Bot spawned with ID: \" << botId << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        std::cout\
      \ << \"Failed to spawn bot\" << std::endl;\n    }\n});"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is asynchronous in nature, meaning it returns immediately after
    queuing the request. The actual spawning logic may occur at a later time depending
    on internal event processing. Ensure that the callback function remains valid
    for the duration of the operation.
  warnings: Improper handling of the callback parameters can lead to undefined behavior.
    Always validate the success flag before using the bot ID parameter, as it may
    contain an error code if the spawn request failed.
