  class: FollowBehaviorUtils
  method: GetCombatFollowDistance
  signature: float FollowBehaviorUtils::GetCombatFollowDistance(int botClass, int
    botSpec)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal combat follow distance for a bot based
    on its class and specialization.
  description: The GetCombatFollowDistance method determines the appropriate distance
    a bot should maintain from its target during combat encounters. This distance
    is calculated based on the bot's class and specialization to ensure proper gameplay
    mechanics and AI behavior. The method considers various factors such as weapon
    range, spell casting requirements, and class-specific movement patterns to provide
    an optimal follow distance that enhances both tactical positioning and game balance.
    The returned value represents a float indicating the distance in yards.
  parameters:
  - name: botClass
    description: The class identifier of the bot (e.g., WARRIOR, MAGE, ROGUE). Valid
      values correspond to the standard TrinityCore class constants.
  - name: botSpec
    description: The specialization identifier of the bot (e.g., SPEC_ARMS, SPEC_FIRE).
      Valid values correspond to the standard TrinityCore spec constants for each
      class.
  returns: A float value representing the combat follow distance in yards. The value
    varies based on the bot's class and specialization to ensure appropriate gameplay
    mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float distance = FollowBehaviorUtils::GetCombatFollowDistance(WARRIOR,
      SPEC_FURY);

      // Returns the combat follow distance for a Fury Warrior bot'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Distance Calculation
    code: 'int playerClass = player->getClass();

      int playerSpec = player->GetSpecialization();

      float followDistance = FollowBehaviorUtils::GetCombatFollowDistance(playerClass,
      playerSpec);

      // Calculates and uses the appropriate follow distance for a player''s class
      and spec'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI behavior trees to determine optimal positioning
    during combat. The implementation likely uses predefined tables or calculations
    based on class-specific combat mechanics. Performance is generally not an issue
    as this is a simple lookup or calculation operation.
  warnings: Ensure that botClass and botSpec parameters are valid class/specialization
    identifiers to avoid unexpected behavior. Invalid parameter values may result
    in incorrect distance calculations or default values being returned.
