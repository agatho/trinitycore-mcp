  signature: int EvokerAI::GetEmpoweredSpellTargets(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the number of valid targets for a specified empowered
    spell based on current AI state and target conditions.
  description: The GetEmpoweredSpellTargets method determines how many eligible targets
    are available for a given empowered spell within the Evoker's current AI context.
    This method evaluates the evoker's current target, nearby enemies, and spell-specific
    targeting rules to compute an appropriate target count. It is typically used during
    spell selection or casting logic to ensure that empowered spells are only cast
    when sufficient targets exist. The method considers factors such as spell range,
    line of sight, and target validity according to the Evoker's AI behavior. This
    calculation directly impacts decision-making for empowered spell usage in combat
    scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of valid targets available for
    the specified empowered spell. A return value of 0 indicates no suitable targets
    exist, while positive values indicate the count of eligible targets. Negative
    values may indicate an error or invalid spell ID was provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Decision Logic
    code: "int targetCount = evokerAI->GetEmpoweredSpellTargets(SPELL_EMPOWERED_FLAME_BURST);\n\
      if (targetCount > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with casting empowered flame burst\n\
      \    evokerAI->CastSpell(SPELL_EMPOWERED_FLAME_BURST);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Target Count Validation Before Casting
    code: "int targets = evokerAI->GetEmpoweredSpellTargets(SPELL_EMPOWERED_FROST_NOVA);\n\
      if (targets >= 2)\n{\n    // Cast empowered frost nova only if 2+ targets available\n\
      \    evokerAI->CastSpell(SPELL_EMPOWERED_FROST_NOVA);\n}\nelse if (targets ==\
      \ 1)\n{\n    // Fall back to regular frost nova\n    evokerAI->CastSpell(SPELL_FROST_NOVA);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the AI's current target selection logic and may be
    affected by recent combat events or target changes. The result is cached internally
    for performance reasons, so repeated calls with the same spell ID during a single
    AI cycle will return the cached value. Ensure that the spell ID provided corresponds
    to an actual empowered spell in the Evoker's spell list.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat or AI update contexts as it
    may produce unpredictable results due to uninitialized target states. The method
    assumes valid spell IDs; invalid IDs may cause undefined behavior or incorrect
    target counts.
