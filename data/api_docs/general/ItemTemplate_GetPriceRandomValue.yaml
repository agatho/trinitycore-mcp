  signature: float ItemTemplate::GetPriceRandomValue() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the random value component used in item pricing for
    World of Warcraft items.
  description: The GetPriceRandomValue method computes a random multiplier that is
    applied to an item's base price during the item creation process. This value contributes
    to the final sell price of an item in the game, adding variation to item economics.
    The method does not take any parameters and returns a floating-point number representing
    this random component. It is typically used internally by the TrinityCore server
    when generating item prices for loot drops or vendor items.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the random multiplier applied to an item's base
    price during pricing calculations. This value is usually between 0.0 and 1.0,
    though it may vary based on internal game logic.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Item Creation
    code: 'ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);

      float randomValue = itemTemplate->GetPriceRandomValue();

      // Use randomValue to adjust final item price

      float finalPrice = basePrice * (1.0f + randomValue);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal item pricing system and may be influenced
    by various game settings such as difficulty levels, expansion content, or server
    configuration options. The exact algorithm for calculating this value may vary
    between different versions of TrinityCore or custom modifications.
