  signature: bool QuestAcceptanceManager::IsGroupQuest(const int * quest) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given quest is a group quest.
  description: The IsGroupQuest method checks if a specified quest is designated as
    a group quest within the TrinityCore framework. This functionality is essential
    for determining how quests should be handled in multiplayer scenarios, particularly
    when players are part of a group or raid. The method evaluates the quest's properties
    to ascertain whether it requires multiple players to complete, such as certain
    dungeon or raid quests. It returns true if the quest is intended for group play
    and false otherwise. This check is typically used during quest acceptance and
    completion logic to ensure proper handling of group-based objectives.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the quest ID to be checked. The
      value should correspond to a valid quest entry in the database.
  returns: Returns true if the specified quest is a group quest, false otherwise.
    A group quest is one that requires multiple players to complete, typically found
    in dungeons or raids.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a quest is a group quest
    code: "int questId = 12345;\nif (questAcceptanceManager.IsGroupQuest(&questId))\
      \ {\n    // Handle group quest logic\n    printf(\"This quest must be completed\
      \ by a group.\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle solo quest logic\n    printf(\"\
      This quest can be completed solo.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on internal quest data structures and database entries
    to determine group quest status. It is recommended to validate that the quest
    ID exists before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior. Performance-wise,
    this check should be relatively fast as it primarily involves looking up a flag
    or property in the quest template.
  warnings: Ensure that the quest pointer passed to this method points to a valid
    quest ID. Passing an invalid or uninitialized pointer may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Also, be aware that quest flags and properties can change based on
    game updates or custom modifications.
