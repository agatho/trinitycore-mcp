  class: LevelBracket
  method: GetRandomLevel
  signature: uint32 LevelBracket::GetRandomLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Generates and returns a random level value within the bounds defined by this
    LevelBracket instance.
  description: The GetRandomLevel method computes and returns a pseudo-random level
    value that falls within the valid range specified by the current LevelBracket
    object. This functionality is typically used in game systems where dynamic level
    generation is required, such as for mob spawning, loot distribution, or quest
    difficulty scaling. The method does not modify any internal state of the LevelBracket
    and is designed to be called repeatedly to generate varying results. It relies
    on the underlying random number generator provided by the TrinityCore framework
    and ensures that returned values are within the minimum and maximum level boundaries
    defined for this bracket.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing a randomly selected level within the valid
    range of this LevelBracket. The returned value will always be greater than or
    equal to the minimum level and less than or equal to the maximum level defined
    in the bracket.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LevelBracket bracket(10, 30);

      uint32 randomLevel = bracket.GetRandomLevel();

      // randomLevel will be between 10 and 30 inclusive'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Mob Spawning Logic
    code: "void SpawnMob(LevelBracket& levelBracket) {\n    uint32 mobLevel = levelBracket.GetRandomLevel();\n\
      \    // Create a mob with the randomly selected level\n    Creature* mob = me->SummonCreature(MOB_ENTRY,\
      \ position, TEMPSUMMON_TIMED_DESPAWN, 60000);\n    mob->SetLevel(mobLevel);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses the global random number generator from TrinityCore's framework.
    The randomness is seeded appropriately for game sessions but may not be suitable
    for cryptographic purposes. Each call to GetRandomLevel produces an independent
    random value and does not affect subsequent calls.
  warnings: Ensure that the LevelBracket instance has valid minimum and maximum values
    set before calling this method, otherwise the behavior is undefined. If min >
    max, the returned value will be unpredictable or may cause unexpected results
    in game logic.
