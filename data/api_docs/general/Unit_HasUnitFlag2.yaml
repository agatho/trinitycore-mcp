  signature: bool Unit::HasUnitFlag2(UnitFlags2 flags) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit has a specific UnitFlags2 flag set.
  description: This method determines whether a given UnitFlags2 flag is currently
    set on the unit. It is commonly used in World of Warcraft TrinityCore to check
    for specific unit states or behaviors, such as whether a unit is in combat, is
    a stealthed character, or has other specific flags that affect gameplay mechanics.
    The method returns true if the specified flag is present, false otherwise. This
    functionality is essential for implementing game logic and ensuring proper handling
    of unit states during various interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified UnitFlags2 flag is set on the unit; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (unit->HasUnitFlag2(UnitFlags2::UNIT_FLAG_IN_COMBAT)) {\n    // Do something\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other unit flag checking
    methods to determine the current state of a unit. Performance considerations are
    minimal as it simply checks a flag value, but care should be taken when using
    multiple flags simultaneously to avoid unnecessary overhead.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with flags that may change dynamically
    during gameplay; ensure proper synchronization or use appropriate locking mechanisms
    if needed.
