documentation:
  brief: Initializes the warlock baseline rotation with default spell priorities and
    cooldown management.
  description: The InitializeWarlockBaseline method sets up the core rotation logic
    for warlock AI behavior by configuring default spell priorities, cooldown tracking,
    and combat state management. This method establishes the foundational framework
    for the warlock's automatic spell selection and timing decisions during combat.
    It prepares the rotation manager to handle various warlock abilities including
    affliction, demonology, and destruction specializations. The initialization process
    ensures that all necessary data structures are properly set up before the AI begins
    making tactical decisions.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'BaselineRotationManager rotationManager;

      rotationManager.InitializeWarlockBaseline();

      // Warlock rotation is now ready for combat'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the AI initialization phase.
    It performs setup operations that are expensive and should not be repeated. The
    method assumes that the underlying player object has been properly initialized
    with valid warlock data.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in undefined behavior or
    memory leaks. Ensure that no active combat state exists before calling this method
    to avoid conflicts with existing rotation data.
