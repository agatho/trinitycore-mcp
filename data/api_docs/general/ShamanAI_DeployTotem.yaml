api:
  class: ShamanAI
  method: DeployTotem
  signature: bool ShamanAI::DeployTotem(int spellId, TotemType type)
documentation:
  brief: Deploys a totem for the shaman AI, returning true if successful.
  description: The DeployTotem method is responsible for summoning and placing a totem
    of the specified type for a shaman AI-controlled unit. This method handles the
    logic required to deploy totems such as Earthbind Totem, Fire Nova Totem, or other
    totem types based on the provided spell ID and totem type. It ensures that the
    totem is properly positioned in the world and linked to the shaman's summoning
    mechanics. The method checks for valid conditions such as whether the shaman has
    the required spell learned, if there are any restrictions on totem placement,
    and if the totem type is compatible with the current game state or shaman's abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell that corresponds to the totem
      being deployed. This ID determines which totem type will be summoned (e.g.,
      Earthbind Totem, Fire Nova Totem). Must be a valid spell ID associated with
      totem spells.
  - name: type
    description: The type of totem to be deployed, defined by the TotemType enum.
      This specifies what kind of totem will be summoned (e.g., TOTEM_TYPE_EARTH,
      TOTEM_TYPE_FIRE). Must match a valid totem type supported by the shaman's class.
  returns: Returns true if the totem was successfully deployed and positioned in the
    world. Returns false if deployment failed due to invalid parameters, insufficient
    resources, or other game logic constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Totem Deployment
    code: "if (shamanAI->DeployTotem(2484, TOTEM_TYPE_EARTH)) {\n    // Totem deployed\
      \ successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Earthbind Totem deployed.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Totem Deployment
    code: "if (shamanAI->DeployTotem(8187, TOTEM_TYPE_FIRE)) {\n    // Fire Nova Totem\
      \ deployed\n    sLog->outString(\"Fire Nova Totem deployed.\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle failure case\n    sLog->outString(\"Failed to deploy Fire Nova\
      \ Totem.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the shaman's current spell knowledge and totem slot
    availability. It assumes that the AI has already validated that it can cast the
    specified spell before calling this function. The actual totem placement logic
    may involve checking for valid positions in the world and ensuring no other totems
    are overlapping.
  warnings: Do not call this method without verifying that the spell ID corresponds
    to a valid totem spell. Calling with an invalid spell or totem type will likely
    result in silent failure or undefined behavior. Also, ensure that the shaman AI
    has sufficient mana or resources before attempting to deploy a totem.
