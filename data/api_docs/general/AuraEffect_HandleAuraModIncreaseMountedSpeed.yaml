  method: HandleAuraModIncreaseMountedSpeed
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleAuraModIncreaseMountedSpeed(const AuraApplication
    * aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the mounted speed of a unit when an aura is applied or removed.
  description: The HandleAuraModIncreaseMountedSpeed method adjusts the movement speed
    of a unit while mounted. This function is typically invoked by the aura system
    when a mounted speed increase effect is applied or removed from a player or creature.
    It modifies the unit's speed attribute directly, ensuring that the mounted state
    reflects the correct speed multiplier. The method takes into account whether the
    aura is being applied or removed to determine how to adjust the speed. This functionality
    is crucial for implementing effects such as mount speed buffs, debuffs, or temporary
    speed changes during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura application
      context. Contains information about the aura's state and target.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation, typically indicating whether the effect is
      being applied (1) or removed (0). Used internally by the aura system for proper
      state management.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the aura is being applied (true) or removed
      (false). Controls the direction of the speed modification.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying a Mounted Speed Aura
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication();

      effect->HandleAuraModIncreaseMountedSpeed(app, 1, true); // Apply speed increase'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing a Mounted Speed Aura
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication();

      effect->HandleAuraModIncreaseMountedSpeed(app, 0, false); // Remove speed increase'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the aura handling system and should only be called
    by the core aura application logic. It directly modifies unit movement attributes
    and must be used carefully to avoid unintended behavior in gameplay mechanics.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can result in incorrect mounted speed values
    or inconsistent movement behavior for players and creatures. Ensure that the aura
    application context is valid before calling this method.
