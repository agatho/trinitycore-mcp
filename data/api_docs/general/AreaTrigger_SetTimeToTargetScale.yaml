  class: AreaTrigger
  method: SetTimeToTargetScale
  signature: void AreaTrigger::SetTimeToTargetScale(uint32 timeToTargetScale)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the time-to-target scale factor for the area trigger.
  description: The SetTimeToTargetScale method configures the scaling factor that
    affects how quickly an area trigger moves toward its target position. This is
    commonly used in spell effects or game mechanics where the speed of movement needs
    to be adjusted based on various factors such as caster level, spell power, or
    environmental conditions. The value passed determines the rate at which the trigger
    interpolates from its initial position to the final target position over time.
  parameters:
  - name: timeToTargetScale
    description: A uint32 value representing the scale factor for time-to-target calculations.
      Higher values result in faster movement toward the target, while lower values
      slow down the transition.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Standard Scale Factor
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = player->GetAreaTrigger(12345);\nif (trigger)\n{\n\
      \    trigger->SetTimeToTargetScale(1000); // Normal speed\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting for Spell Power
    code: "uint32 spellPower = caster->GetSpellPower();\nAreaTrigger* trigger = player->GetAreaTrigger(54321);\n\
      if (trigger)\n{\n    trigger->SetTimeToTargetScale(spellPower * 10); // Scale\
      \ based on spell power\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly influences the animation and movement behavior of area
    triggers. It should be called before the trigger begins moving toward its target
    to ensure proper timing. The scale factor is typically used in conjunction with
    other time-based calculations within the TrinityCore framework.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting this value may cause visual glitches or unexpected
    behavior in area trigger animations. Ensure that the scale factor remains within
    reasonable bounds to avoid performance issues or client-side desynchronization.
