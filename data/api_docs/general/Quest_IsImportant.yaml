  signature: bool Quest::IsImportant() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a quest is marked as important within the game system.
  description: The IsImportant method checks if a quest has been flagged as important
    in the TrinityCore database. This flag typically indicates that the quest should
    be prioritized or highlighted during quest tracking, often representing quests
    that are crucial for progression or have special significance in the game world.
    The method returns true when the quest is marked as important and false otherwise,
    allowing developers to programmatically identify and handle important quests differently
    from regular ones.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest is flagged as important in the database, false
    otherwise. This indicates whether the quest should be prioritized or highlighted
    during quest tracking.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (quest->IsImportant()) {\n    // Handle important quest\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely checks a flag in the quest database
    entry that is set during server startup or when quests are loaded. Performance
    considerations: Since this method involves checking a simple flag, it should have
    minimal performance impact. Thread safety: The method is thread-safe as it only
    reads from a database flag without modifying any data.'
