documentation:
  brief: Destroys an InterruptAwareness object and releases its associated resources.
  description: The ~InterruptAwareness destructor is responsible for cleaning up the
    resources allocated by the InterruptAwareness class. This method is automatically
    invoked when an InterruptAwareness object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    It ensures proper deallocation of memory and cleanup of any internal state that
    may have been initialized during the object's lifetime. In the context of TrinityCore's
    AI and combat systems, this destructor likely handles cleanup of interrupt-related
    data structures or references used for managing spell interruption mechanics.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Object Destruction
    code: 'InterruptAwareness awareness;

      // ... use awareness object

      // Destructor called automatically when awareness goes out of scope'
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit Deletion Example
    code: 'InterruptAwareness* awareness = new InterruptAwareness();

      // ... use awareness

      delete awareness; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime when objects go
    out of scope. Developers should not manually invoke destructors unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. Performance considerations are minimal for
    this typical destructor implementation.
