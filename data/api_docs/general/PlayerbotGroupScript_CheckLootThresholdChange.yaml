  class: PlayerbotGroupScript
  method: CheckLootThresholdChange
  signature: void PlayerbotGroupScript::CheckLootThresholdChange(Group * group, GroupState
    & state)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the loot threshold settings for a group based on current player bot
    state and group dynamics.
  description: The CheckLootThresholdChange method evaluates the current state of
    a player bot group to determine if the loot threshold should be adjusted. This
    method is typically invoked during group operations such as looting, raid management,
    or when group composition changes. It analyzes the group's current loot settings
    against the players' roles and gear requirements to ensure optimal loot distribution.
    The method modifies the provided GroupState object in-place to reflect any necessary
    threshold adjustments.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player bot group being
      evaluated for loot threshold changes. Must not be null.
  - name: state
    description: Reference to a GroupState object that holds the current state information
      of the group, including loot settings and distribution preferences. This object
      is modified in-place by the method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void example() {\n    Group* myGroup = sObjectMgr->GetGroupById(12345);\n\
      \    GroupState groupState;\n    if (myGroup) {\n        PlayerbotGroupScript::CheckLootThresholdChange(myGroup,\
      \ groupState);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player bot AI system and should only be called
    in contexts where group state management is required. It assumes that the Group
    object passed has valid members and that the GroupState object is properly initialized
    before invocation.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid
    undefined behavior. The method modifies the GroupState reference directly, so
    any existing data in the state object may be overwritten.
