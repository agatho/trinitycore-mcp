  class: Player
  method: GetDifficultyID
  signature: int Player::GetDifficultyID(const MapEntry * mapEntry) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the difficulty identifier for the specified map entry.
  description: The GetDifficultyID method retrieves the difficulty ID associated with
    a given map entry, which is used to determine the appropriate difficulty level
    for player characters when accessing content within that map. This method is essential
    for handling different difficulty levels in World of Warcraft such as normal,
    heroic, and mythic modes. The returned value represents the current difficulty
    setting for the player's instance or zone, allowing developers to properly configure
    game mechanics based on player progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the difficulty ID associated with the map
    entry. This value typically corresponds to the difficulty level (normal, heroic,
    mythic) of the current instance or zone that the player is accessing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int difficulty = player->GetDifficultyID(mapEntry);\nif (difficulty ==\
      \ 1)\n    // Normal mode\nelse if (difficulty == 2)\n    // Heroic mode\nelse\
      \ if (difficulty == 3)\n    // Mythic mode"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with map entry data to determine
    the appropriate difficulty level for player progression. It may be affected by
    player's current difficulty settings and should be used carefully when handling
    instance-related game mechanics.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may not always reflect the actual
    difficulty level of the player's current zone, especially if the player has not
    yet entered an instance. Also, make sure to verify that mapEntry is valid before
    calling this method.
