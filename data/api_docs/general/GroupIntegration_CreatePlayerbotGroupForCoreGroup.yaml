  signature: uint32 GroupIntegration::CreatePlayerbotGroupForCoreGroup(Group * coreGroup)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a playerbot group associated with a core group and returns its unique
    identifier.
  description: The CreatePlayerbotGroupForCoreGroup method is responsible for establishing
    a correspondence between a standard World of Warcraft Group (coreGroup) and a
    playerbot group within the TrinityCore framework. This function facilitates integration
    between regular player groups and automated bot-controlled groups, enabling features
    such as coordinated bot behavior, shared loot distribution, or synchronized quest
    completion. The method assigns a unique identifier to the newly created playerbot
    group, which can be used for subsequent operations like managing bot members or
    retrieving group data. It is typically invoked when a core group is formed or
    modified and requires corresponding bot group functionality.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the
    newly created playerbot group. If the operation fails, it may return 0, indicating
    no valid group was created.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Group* coreGroup = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(groupId);\nuint32 botGroupId\
      \ = groupIntegration->CreatePlayerbotGroupForCoreGroup(coreGroup);\nif (botGroupId\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Successfully created playerbot group\n    // Use botGroupId\
      \ for further operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the coreGroup parameter is valid and properly initialized.
    It may internally perform checks to ensure the group has players or meets certain
    criteria before creating a corresponding bot group. The returned GUID should be
    stored for future reference as it uniquely identifies the playerbot group within
    the system.
  warnings: Calling this method on an invalid or null Group pointer will likely result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that coreGroup is verified to exist and
    be active before invoking this function. Additionally, repeated calls with the
    same coreGroup may lead to duplicate entries unless handled properly by the underlying
    implementation.
