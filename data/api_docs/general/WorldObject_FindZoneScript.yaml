documentation:
  brief: Returns the ZoneScript associated with the current WorldObject's zone
  description: The FindZoneScript method retrieves the ZoneScript object that is associated
    with the zone where the WorldObject currently resides. This method is used to
    access zone-specific scripting functionality, which can include zone-based events,
    triggers, or custom behaviors. The returned ZoneScript may be null if no zone
    script has been assigned to the current zone, or if the zone script has not yet
    been initialized. This method is particularly useful for developers working with
    zone-based content and event handling in TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the ZoneScript object associated with the current
    zone. If no zone script exists or it hasn't been initialized, this may return
    nullptr. The returned pointer should be treated as const and cannot be modified
    directly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "ZoneScript* zoneScript = object->FindZoneScript();\nif (zoneScript)\n{\n\
      \    // Zone script exists, perform operations\n    zoneScript->OnPlayerEnterZone(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with zone-based event handling.
    It's important to note that the ZoneScript object returned may not be initialized
    until the zone has been fully loaded. Performance considerations include avoiding
    frequent calls to this method during high-frequency events.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in high-frequency event loops, as it
    could potentially impact performance if used excessively. Also, ensure that the
    WorldObject is properly initialized before calling this method.
