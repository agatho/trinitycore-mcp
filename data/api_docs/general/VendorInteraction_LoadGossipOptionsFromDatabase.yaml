documentation:
  brief: Loads vendor gossip options from the database into memory for use in player
    interactions.
  description: The LoadGossipOptionsFromDatabase method retrieves all relevant gossip
    options associated with a vendor from the game's database and prepares them for
    display during player-NPC interactions. This method is typically invoked when
    initializing or refreshing vendor data, ensuring that the available items and
    actions are correctly loaded based on the vendor's configuration in the database.
    It plays a crucial role in maintaining up-to-date vendor interfaces within the
    World of Warcraft client through TrinityCore's framework.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'VendorInteraction vendor;

      vendor.LoadGossipOptionsFromDatabase();

      // Gossip options are now loaded and ready for use in player interactions'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the VendorInteraction object has
    been properly initialized with valid NPC data. It is generally not thread-safe
    and should be executed on the main game thread to prevent race conditions during
    database access.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the VendorInteraction
    instance may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Additionally, frequent calls
    to this method can cause performance degradation due to repeated database queries.
