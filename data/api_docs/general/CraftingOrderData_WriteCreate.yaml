  class: CraftingOrderData
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void CraftingOrderData::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player *
    owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Serializes crafting order data for creation packet transmission to players.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the crafting order data into a ByteBuffer
    format suitable for sending as a create packet to client players. This method
    is typically invoked when a crafting order needs to be communicated to either
    the owner or receiver player, ensuring that all relevant crafting information
    such as item details, quantity, and status are properly encoded. The serialization
    process includes handling of player-specific data and ensures compatibility with
    the World of Warcraft client's expected packet structure for crafting orders.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized crafting order data
      will be written. This buffer is used to construct the network packet sent to
      the client.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the owner of the crafting
      order. Used to determine ownership-specific data in the serialization process.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the receiver of the crafting
      order. Used to determine recipient-specific data in the serialization process.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'CraftingOrderData order;

      ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = ...; // Get owner player

      Player* receiver = ...; // Get receiver player

      order.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided player pointers are valid and not null.
    It is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework when sending crafting
    order create packets to clients. The method does not perform any validation on
    the input players, so it's important that callers ensure these are properly initialized
    before calling.
  warnings: Calling this method with null player pointers may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure both owner and receiver parameters are valid Player
    objects before invoking this method.
