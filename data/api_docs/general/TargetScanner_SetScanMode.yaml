  class: TargetScanner
  method: SetScanMode
  signature: void TargetScanner::SetScanMode(ScanMode mode)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the scan mode for the target scanner to determine how targets are evaluated
    during scanning.
  description: The SetScanMode method configures the behavior of the TargetScanner
    by specifying the scanning mode that dictates how potential targets are assessed.
    This method allows the scanner to operate in different modes such as aggressive,
    defensive, or neutral scanning strategies. The scan mode affects how the scanner
    prioritizes and evaluates targets based on various criteria like threat level,
    distance, or faction. This configuration is typically used in AI behavior systems
    where different combat scenarios require different target selection approaches.
  parameters:
  - name: mode
    description: The ScanMode enumeration value that defines the scanning behavior.
      Valid values include AGGRESSIVE, DEFENSIVE, NEUTRAL, and others depending on
      the implementation. This parameter determines how targets are prioritized and
      evaluated during the scanning process.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Aggressive Scan Mode
    code: 'TargetScanner scanner;

      scanner.SetScanMode(ScanMode::AGGRESSIVE);

      // Scanner will now prioritize high-threat targets'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Defensive Target Scanning
    code: "TargetScanner* scanner = unit->GetAI()->GetTargetScanner();\nif (scanner)\n\
      {\n    scanner->SetScanMode(ScanMode::DEFENSIVE);\n    // Scanner will focus\
      \ on protecting allies and avoiding dangerous targets\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the scanning behavior of AI units in TrinityCore.
    The scan mode is typically set during initialization or when AI state changes
    occur. Changes to scan mode may require subsequent scanning operations to take
    effect, as the scanner caches its evaluation criteria.
  warnings: Modifying scan mode while a scan operation is in progress may lead to
    inconsistent target evaluations. Ensure that scan mode changes are made before
    initiating new scanning cycles for predictable behavior.
