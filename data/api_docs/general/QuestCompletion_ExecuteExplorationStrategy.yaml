  signature: void QuestCompletion::ExecuteExplorationStrategy(Player * bot, QuestProgressData
    & progress)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the exploration strategy for a player's quest progress.
  description: The ExecuteExplorationStrategy method processes and applies exploration-related
    logic to a player's current quest progress data. This method is typically used
    in AI-driven quest completion systems where the bot needs to determine which exploration
    objectives should be prioritized or executed based on the player's current progress.
    It evaluates the state of ongoing quests and triggers appropriate exploration
    actions such as visiting specific locations, interacting with objects, or completing
    area-based objectives. The method modifies the provided QuestProgressData in-place
    to reflect updated exploration states.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will execute
      the exploration strategy. Must not be null.
  - name: progress
    description: Reference to QuestProgressData containing the current quest progress
      information for the player. This data is modified in-place by the method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecuteExplorationStrategy
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Get player reference

      QuestProgressData progress;

      // Fill progress with current quest data

      questCompletion.ExecuteExplorationStrategy(bot, progress);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using ExecuteExplorationStrategy in a quest completion AI loop
    code: "void QuestCompletionAI::Update()\n{\n    Player* bot = GetBot();\n    QuestProgressData\
      \ progress = GetQuestProgress(bot);\n    ExecuteExplorationStrategy(bot, progress);\n\
      \    // Continue with other quest completion logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the automated quest completion system and should only
    be called when the bot has active quests requiring exploration. The method modifies
    the QuestProgressData object directly, so any previous state information may be
    overwritten. It's recommended to back up quest progress data before calling this
    method if preservation of original state is required.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null player pointer will likely cause a crash.
    Ensure that the bot parameter is valid and that the progress data contains meaningful
    quest information before invocation. The method may trigger in-game actions that
    could affect player experience or game state, particularly in shared environments.
