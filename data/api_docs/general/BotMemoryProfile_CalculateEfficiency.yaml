  class: BotMemoryProfile
  method: CalculateEfficiency
  signature: double BotMemoryProfile::CalculateEfficiency() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the efficiency rating of a bot's memory profile.
  description: The CalculateEfficiency method computes a double-precision floating-point
    value representing how effectively a bot's memory usage is optimized. This metric
    typically takes into account factors such as memory allocation patterns, data
    retention strategies, and overall resource consumption within the context of the
    bot's operational behavior. The efficiency rating can be used to evaluate performance,
    identify bottlenecks, or guide optimization decisions for bot memory management
    in TrinityCore environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: A double value representing the calculated efficiency of the bot's memory
    profile. Higher values generally indicate better memory usage optimization, though
    the exact scale and interpretation may depend on internal implementation details
    and game mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotMemoryProfile profile;

      // Assume profile has been populated with data

      const double efficiency = profile.CalculateEfficiency();

      std::cout << "Bot Efficiency: " << efficiency << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely invoked during bot performance analysis or profiling
    sessions. It may involve computations that depend on internal memory metrics,
    and its results could be cached or recomputed based on the current state of the
    profile.
