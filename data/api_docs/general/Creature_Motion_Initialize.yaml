documentation:
  brief: Initializes the creature's movement and AI behavior
  description: The Motion_Initialize method sets up the initial state of a creature's
    movement system and AI behavior. This method is typically called during creature
    creation or when a creature needs to be reinitialized after being reset. It configures
    the creature's current motion master, initializes movement generators, and prepares
    the creature for normal gameplay behavior including pathfinding, waypoint following,
    and AI decision making. The method ensures that all movement-related systems are
    properly initialized before the creature begins interacting with players or other
    game objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Creature Initialization
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->Motion_Initialize();

      // Creature is now ready for normal movement and AI behavior'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reinitializing Creature After Reset
    code: "void ResetCreature(Creature* creature)\n{\n    // Reset creature state\n\
      \    creature->ClearUnitState(UNIT_STATE_ALL);\n    \n    // Reinitialize motion\
      \ and AI\n    creature->Motion_Initialize();\n    \n    // Resume normal behavior\n\
      \    creature->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the creature is in a valid state for
    initialization. It internally calls various subsystems including movement generator
    initialization, AI state setup, and motion master configuration. The method is
    typically invoked automatically during creature creation but can also be manually
    called to reset movement behavior.
  warnings: Calling Motion_Initialize on an uninitialized or destroyed creature may
    cause undefined behavior. This method should not be called from within movement
    callbacks as it might lead to recursion issues or inconsistent state.
