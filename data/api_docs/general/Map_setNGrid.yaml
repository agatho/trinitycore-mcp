  method: setNGrid
  signature: void Map::setNGrid(int * grid, uint32 x, uint32 y)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a grid cell in the map to the specified value at the given coordinates.
  description: The setNGrid method is used to assign a specific integer value to a
    grid cell within the Map's internal grid structure. This method operates on a
    two-dimensional grid system where each cell is identified by X and Y coordinates.
    The grid is typically used for spatial partitioning, collision detection, or other
    game mechanics that require efficient location-based data storage. The method
    directly modifies the internal state of the map's grid without any validation
    of the input values, so care must be taken to ensure valid indices are passed.
  parameters:
  - name: grid
    description: Pointer to an integer value that will be stored in the specified
      grid cell. This represents the data to be set at the given coordinates.
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the grid cell to modify. Must be a valid index
      within the map's grid dimensions.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the grid cell to modify. Must be a valid index
      within the map's grid dimensions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Grid Cell Value
    code: 'int value = 42;

      map->setNGrid(&value, 10, 15);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Multiple Grid Cells
    code: "for (uint32 x = 0; x < mapWidth; ++x)\n{\n    for (uint32 y = 0; y < mapHeight;\
      \ ++y)\n    {\n        int gridValue = x + y;\n        map->setNGrid(&gridValue,\
      \ x, y);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly accesses internal memory of the Map class and should
    only be used when the caller has proper knowledge of the grid structure. The grid
    coordinates must be within valid bounds or undefined behavior may occur. This
    method is typically used internally by TrinityCore for managing map data structures.
  warnings: Passing invalid x or y coordinates can lead to memory corruption or segmentation
    faults. Ensure that the grid pointer is valid and that the coordinates are within
    the allocated grid dimensions before calling this method.
