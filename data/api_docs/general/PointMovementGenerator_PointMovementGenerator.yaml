  brief: Moves a unit to a specified point using the PointMovementGenerator.
  description: The PointMovementGenerator is responsible for moving a unit (such as
    a creature or player) to a specific location in the game world. This constructor
    initializes the movement generator with another PointMovementGenerator instance,
    effectively transferring ownership of its internal state and resources. The method
    is typically used internally by the TrinityCore AI system when managing unit movement
    behaviors. It's important to note that this is a move constructor, not a regular
    constructor, and it should only be called during object initialization or assignment
    operations where an rvalue reference is available.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Move Constructor Usage
    code: 'PointMovementGenerator generator1(targetPosition);

      PointMovementGenerator generator2 = std::move(generator1); // Uses move constructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, which means it transfers resources from the source
    object to the target object. After calling this constructor, the source object
    should not be used as its state will have been moved.
  warnings: Using this constructor directly with an lvalue reference instead of an
    rvalue reference (std::move) may lead to unexpected behavior or resource leaks.
    Always ensure proper use of std::move when invoking move constructors.
