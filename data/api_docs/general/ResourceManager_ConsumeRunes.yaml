  class: ResourceManager
  method: ConsumeRunes
  signature: void ResourceManager::ConsumeRunes(uint32 bloodRunes, uint32 frostRunes,
    uint32 unholyRunes)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes specified amounts of blood, frost, and unholy runes for player abilities.
  description: "The ConsumeRunes method reduces the available count of specified rune\
    \ types for a player character. This method is typically used in conjunction with\
    \ Death Knight abilities that require\u6D88\u8017 runes from the player's resource\
    \ pool. The method directly modifies the internal rune counts without any validation\
    \ checks on the input values, so it's expected that callers provide valid rune\
    \ amounts that do not exceed the current available runes. This function is part\
    \ of the ResourceManager class which manages character resources in the TrinityCore\
    \ framework."
  parameters:
  - name: bloodRunes
    description: The number of blood runes to consume from the player's resource pool.
  - name: frostRunes
    description: The number of frost runes to consume from the player's resource pool.
  - name: unholyRunes
    description: The number of unholy runes to consume from the player's resource
      pool.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic rune consumption for a Death Knight ability
    code: player->GetResourceManager()->ConsumeRunes(1, 1, 0); // Consume one blood
      and one frost rune
    language: cpp
  - title: Consuming all three rune types for a powerful ability
    code: player->GetResourceManager()->ConsumeRunes(1, 1, 1); // Consume one of each
      rune type
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the ResourceManager and should
    only be called when the player actually has sufficient runes available. The actual
    rune regeneration and cooldown handling is managed separately by the game engine.
  warnings: Calling this method with values that exceed the current rune count may
    result in negative rune values, which can cause undefined behavior or visual glitches
    in the UI. Always verify rune availability before calling this function.
