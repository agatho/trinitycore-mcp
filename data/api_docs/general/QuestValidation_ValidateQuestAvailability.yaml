  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateQuestAvailability
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateQuestAvailability(uint32 questId, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates if a quest is available for the specified player character.
  description: The ValidateQuestAvailability method checks whether a given quest ID
    is accessible to the specified player character. It evaluates various conditions
    such as quest prerequisites, level requirements, quest completion status, and
    player state to determine if the quest can be accepted or interacted with. This
    method is commonly used in questing scripts, bot logic, and quest validation systems
    within TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft servers. The function returns true
    if the quest is available for interaction, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to validate. Must be a valid quest
      ID present in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character for whom
      the quest availability is being checked. Cannot be null.
  returns: Returns true if the quest is available for the player to accept or interact
    with, false otherwise. This includes cases where the quest has been completed,
    the player does not meet level requirements, prerequisites are unmet, or the quest
    is not in the correct state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Availability Check
    code: "if (QuestValidation::ValidateQuestAvailability(12345, player)) {\n    //\
      \ Quest is available for the player\n    player->SendQuestUpdateAddItem(12345,\
      \ 0, 1);\n} else {\n    // Quest not available\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Quest not available.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Bot Logic
    code: "class QuestBot {\npublic:\n    bool IsQuestAvailable(uint32 questId, Player*\
      \ bot) {\n        return QuestValidation::ValidateQuestAvailability(questId,\
      \ bot);\n    }\n};\n\n// Usage\nQuestBot bot;\nif (bot.IsQuestAvailable(1001,\
      \ player)) {\n    // Proceed with quest acceptance logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally performs checks against the player's quest log, level,
    completed quests, and other game state variables. It may involve database queries
    to verify quest data. Ensure that the Player pointer is valid before calling this
    function to avoid crashes.
  warnings: Do not call this method with a null Player pointer as it will likely result
    in a crash or undefined behavior. Also, note that quest availability can change
    dynamically based on player progress and server-side logic.
