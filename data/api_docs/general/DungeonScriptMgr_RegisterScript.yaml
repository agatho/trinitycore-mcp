  class: DungeonScriptMgr
  method: RegisterScript
  signature: void DungeonScriptMgr::RegisterScript(DungeonScript * script)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a dungeon script with the dungeon script manager for execution
    during dungeon events.
  description: The RegisterScript method is used to register a DungeonScript instance
    with the DungeonScriptMgr, allowing the script to be executed when specific dungeon-related
    events occur. This method typically called during server initialization or when
    loading dungeon content, it ensures that the provided script is properly linked
    and managed by the manager. The registration process involves storing the script
    in an internal collection or registry, making it available for invocation during
    dungeon lifecycle events such as instance creation, player entry, or completion.
    This mechanism supports the dynamic loading and execution of custom dungeon logic
    without requiring hard-coded event handlers.
  parameters:
  - name: script
    description: A pointer to a DungeonScript object that should be registered with
      the manager. The script must be properly initialized and contain valid event
      handlers for dungeon-related callbacks.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Script Registration
    code: "class MyDungeonScript : public DungeonScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyDungeonScript()\
      \ : DungeonScript(\"MyDungeon\") {}\n    void OnPlayerEnter(Player* player)\
      \ override {\n        // Custom logic when player enters dungeon\n    }\n};\n\
      \n// Register the script\nDungeonScriptMgr::Instance()->RegisterScript(new MyDungeonScript());"
    language: cpp
  notes: The DungeonScriptMgr maintains a registry of all registered scripts, and
    this method should typically be called during server startup or when loading dungeon
    data. Scripts must be properly derived from the DungeonScript base class and implement
    required virtual methods to ensure correct behavior.
  warnings: Registering multiple scripts with the same name may lead to conflicts
    or unexpected behavior. Ensure that each script has a unique identifier to prevent
    overwriting existing registrations.
