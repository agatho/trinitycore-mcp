api:
  class: GuildIntegration
  method: SetGuildChatFrequency
  signature: void GuildIntegration::SetGuildChatFrequency(uint32 playerGuid, float
    frequency)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the guild chat frequency for a specified player.
  description: The SetGuildChatFrequency method configures how often a player receives
    guild chat messages. This frequency setting controls the rate at which guild-related
    communications are delivered to the player's client, potentially reducing chat
    spam or allowing for more frequent updates depending on the value provided. The
    method operates on a per-player basis and modifies internal game state related
    to guild communication filtering. It is typically used in conjunction with other
    guild integration features to customize player experience within guild contexts.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose guild chat frequency
      will be modified. Must correspond to a valid online player in the game world.
  - name: frequency
    description: The desired frequency value for guild chat messages, expressed as
      a floating-point number. Higher values may indicate more frequent delivery,
      while lower values could reduce message rate or introduce delays.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Guild Chat Frequency for Player
    code: 'uint32 playerId = 12345;

      float chatFrequency = 2.0f;

      GuildIntegration::SetGuildChatFrequency(playerId, chatFrequency);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal player state tracking and may
    require the player to be online for changes to take effect immediately. The exact
    behavior of frequency values (e.g., seconds, message count) is implementation-dependent
    and should be verified against TrinityCore source code or documentation.
