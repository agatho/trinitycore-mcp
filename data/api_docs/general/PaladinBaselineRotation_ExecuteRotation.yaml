  class: PaladinBaselineRotation
  method: ExecuteRotation
  signature: bool PaladinBaselineRotation::ExecuteRotation(int * bot, int * target,
    BaselineRotationManager & manager)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the baseline rotation logic for a paladin bot, returning true if
    the rotation was successfully completed.
  description: The ExecuteRotation method implements the core decision-making logic
    for a paladin AI bot's combat behavior. It evaluates the current state of the
    bot and its target, then determines and executes the appropriate spell or ability
    based on baseline rotation rules. The method interacts with the BaselineRotationManager
    to manage rotation state and timing. This function is typically called during
    combat situations where the paladin needs to make tactical decisions about which
    abilities to use next. It returns true when the rotation completes successfully,
    or false if the rotation cannot be executed due to invalid conditions or resource
    constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot's player data structure containing current health,
      mana, and spell availability information
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target's player data structure containing health,
      threat level, and status effect information
  - name: manager
    description: Reference to the BaselineRotationManager that tracks rotation state,
      timing, and cooldowns for the bot
  returns: True if the rotation was successfully executed with valid actions, false
    if execution failed due to invalid conditions, resource constraints, or inability
    to perform any valid action
  examples:
  - title: Basic rotation execution
    code: "bool result = rotation.ExecuteRotation(&botData, &targetData, rotationManager);\n\
      if (result) {\n    // Rotation completed successfully\n    printf(\"Paladin\
      \ rotation executed\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Rotation failed or could not execute\n\
      \    printf(\"Failed to execute paladin rotation\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat loop
    code: "void PaladinCombatAI::Update() {\n    if (IsInCombat()) {\n        int\
      \ bot = GetBotData();\n        int target = GetTargetData();\n        bool success\
      \ = rotation.ExecuteRotation(&bot, &target, rotationManager);\n        if (!success)\
      \ {\n            // Handle rotation failure\n            HandleRotationFailure();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot and target data structures are properly
    initialized before calling. The BaselineRotationManager must be updated with current
    combat state information for optimal rotation decisions. Performance is optimized
    for frequent calls during combat, but may be impacted by complex rotation logic
    or resource checks.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat situations where the bot has
    a valid target. Passing null pointers for bot or target parameters will likely
    cause undefined behavior. The method modifies internal state through the manager
    reference, so ensure thread safety if called from multiple contexts.
