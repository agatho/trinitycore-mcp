documentation:
  brief: Caches guild bank data for the specified guild ID.
  description: The CacheBankData method retrieves and stores guild bank information
    for a given guild in memory. This caching mechanism improves performance by reducing
    database queries when accessing frequently requested guild bank data such as item
    counts, slots, and tab permissions. The method typically executes during guild
    initialization or when explicit cache refresh is required. It ensures that subsequent
    accesses to the guild's bank data are fast and efficient.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: GuildBankManager::CacheBankData(12345);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    a guild's bank data needs to be made available for operations. It may also be
    called manually during specific game events or updates where fresh data is required.
