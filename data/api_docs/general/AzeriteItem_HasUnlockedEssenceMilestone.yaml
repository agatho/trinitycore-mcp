  class: AzeriteItem

  signature: bool AzeriteItem::HasUnlockedEssenceMilestone(int azeriteItemMilestonePowerId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specific Azerite essence milestone has been unlocked for
    this item.
  description: The HasUnlockedEssenceMilestone method determines if a given Azerite
    item milestone power ID has been unlocked by the player's Azerite item. This functionality
    is used in the context of Azerite armor progression, where players unlock various
    milestones that grant bonuses or abilities. The method evaluates the internal
    state of the AzeriteItem object to determine if the specified milestone has been
    activated. It does not modify any state and is purely a query operation. This
    check is typically performed during gameplay logic such as UI updates, ability
    activation checks, or progression validation.
  parameters:
  - name: azeriteItemMilestonePowerId
    description: The unique identifier for the Azerite item milestone power. This
      ID corresponds to a specific milestone in the Azerite system that grants bonuses
      when unlocked.
  returns: Returns true if the specified Azerite item milestone power has been unlocked,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a milestone is unlocked
    code: "AzeriteItem* item = player->GetAzeriteItem();\nif (item && item->HasUnlockedEssenceMilestone(12345))\
      \ {\n    // The milestone with ID 12345 is unlocked\n    SendChatMessage(\"\
      Milestone unlocked!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in ability activation logic
    code: "if (playerItem->HasUnlockedEssenceMilestone(98765)) {\n    // Grant bonus\
      \ effect\n    player->AddAura(SPELL_AZERITE_MILESTONE_BONUS, player);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Fallback behavior\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"Milestone not\
      \ yet unlocked.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal Azerite milestone tracking data that is typically
    populated during item initialization or when the player interacts with the Azerite
    interface. The method assumes that the AzeriteItem object has been properly initialized
    and contains valid milestone data.
  warnings: Ensure that the AzeriteItem pointer is not null before calling this method,
    as it may lead to undefined behavior if accessed on an uninitialized or invalid
    item. Also, be aware that milestone IDs are game-specific and may vary between
    different patches or expansions.
