documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the list of item IDs associated with a specified quest package
    ID.
  description: The GetQuestPackageItems method fetches an array of item identifiers
    linked to a given quest package ID from the database. This functionality is used
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to determine which items are part of a specific
    quest package, typically for quest reward distribution or UI display purposes.
    The returned pointer points to an internal static array that contains the item
    IDs; it should not be modified or freed by the caller. The method assumes that
    the quest package ID exists in the database and returns a null-terminated array
    of integers representing the associated items.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to an integer array containing the item IDs associated
    with the specified quest package ID. The array is null-terminated. Returns nullptr
    if no items are found for the given quest package ID or if the quest package ID
    does not exist in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and iterate through quest package items
    code: "const int* items = sDB2Manager->GetQuestPackageItems(12345);\nif (items)\n\
      {\n    for (int i = 0; items[i] != 0; ++i)\n    {\n        printf(\"Item ID:\
      \ %d\\n\", items[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned array is managed internally by the DB2Manager and should not
    be freed or modified. The method uses cached data from loaded DB2 files, so performance
    is generally good after initial load. Ensure that the quest package ID exists
    in the database to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify or free the returned array as it points to internal
    static memory. If a quest package ID has no associated items, this method returns
    nullptr, which must be checked before dereferencing.
