  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::DetectPerformanceAnomalies()
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes AI decision-making performance metrics to identify potential anomalies
    or bottlenecks in NPC behavior.
  description: The DetectPerformanceAnomalies method evaluates collected AI decision
    profiling data to detect unusual patterns or performance issues within the AI
    decision-making process. It examines timing data, decision frequency, and resource
    usage to flag potential inefficiencies or abnormal behaviors that could impact
    game performance or NPC responsiveness. This method is typically invoked during
    profiling sessions or performance monitoring to maintain optimal AI behavior in
    World of Warcraft environments.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Profiling Context
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      profiler.DetectPerformanceAnomalies();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed for internal profiling use and should be called during
    development or performance testing phases. It relies on previously collected timing
    data from AI decision processes to make its analysis.
