documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the dynamic object associated with this object.
  description: This method provides a way to access the dynamic object that is linked
    to the current object instance. It serves as a type conversion mechanism, allowing
    developers to retrieve a const pointer to a DynamicObject from an Object instance.
    The method is typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework where objects may be associated with dynamic effects such as area of
    effect spells or other game mechanics involving dynamic object creation and management.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const pointer to the DynamicObject associated with this Object
    instance. If no dynamic object is associated, it returns nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "const DynamicObject* dynObj = obj->ToDynObject();\nif (dynObj)\n{\n   \
      \ // Use the dynamic object\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in game mechanics where objects are associated
    with dynamic effects. It requires careful handling to ensure proper memory management
    and type safety. The returned pointer should be checked for null before use.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may lead to dangling pointers
    if the object's lifetime is not properly managed. Also, ensure that the object
    being converted is actually a dynamic object or derived from one.
