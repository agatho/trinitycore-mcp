documentation:
  brief: Attempts to teach the player a profession, returning true on success or false
    if the operation fails.
  description: The LearnProfession method is used within the TrinityCore framework
    to grant a player access to a specific profession. This method typically checks
    if the player meets prerequisites such as having sufficient gold, meeting level
    requirements, or not already knowing the profession. It modifies the player's
    skill database and may trigger in-game events like quest completion or skill gain
    notifications. The operation is generally synchronous and affects only the calling
    player's data.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the profession was successfully learned by the player,
    false otherwise. Failure can occur due to insufficient resources, invalid profession
    ID, or already knowing the profession.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (EconomyManager::LearnProfession(PROFESSION_BLACKSMITHING)) {\n    //\
      \ Profession learned successfully\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(\"You have learned\
      \ Blacksmithing!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's database records and may require
    a valid session context. It is assumed to be part of a larger economy or skill
    management system within TrinityCore.
  warnings: Ensure that the profession ID passed is valid, as invalid IDs may cause
    undefined behavior or database corruption. This function should not be called
    outside of appropriate game logic contexts such as quest rewards or NPC interactions.
