documentation:
  brief: Activates the Shield Block ability for a Protection Warrior, reducing incoming
    physical damage.
  description: The UseShieldBlock method initiates the Shield Block ability for a
    Protection Warrior class character. This ability provides a temporary shield that
    reduces incoming physical damage by a percentage. The method typically handles
    the activation logic including cooldown management, resource consumption (such
    as rage), and applying the defensive buff to the warrior. It is part of the warrior's
    core defensive toolkit in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore emulation. The method
    does not return any value but modifies the character's state and combat behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: 'ProtectionWarriorRefactored* warrior = GetPlayer()->GetWarrior();

      warrior->UseShieldBlock();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the warrior is in combat and has sufficient
    resources (rage) to activate Shield Block. The actual damage reduction effect
    is implemented through a separate aura or buff system within TrinityCore.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of combat may result in no effect or unexpected
    behavior. Ensure that the warrior object is valid and not null before invoking
    this method.
