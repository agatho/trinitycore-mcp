  class: EchoController
  method: GetBestEchoTarget
  signature: int * EchoController::GetBestEchoTarget() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the integer identifier of the optimal echo target for
    the controller.
  description: The GetBestEchoTarget method determines and returns the most suitable
    target for an echo effect or mechanic within the context of the EchoController.
    This typically involves evaluating available targets based on factors such as
    proximity, threat level, or other game-specific criteria. The returned pointer
    points to an integer value representing the target's unique identifier (GUID).
    If no valid target is found, the method may return a null pointer or a default
    value depending on implementation details.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the best echo target.
    Returns nullptr if no suitable target exists or if the controller has no targets
    available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int* targetGuid = echoController.GetBestEchoTarget();\nif (targetGuid !=\
      \ nullptr) {\n    std::cout << \"Best echo target GUID: \" << *targetGuid <<\
      \ std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"No valid echo target found.\" <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned pointer should be checked for null before dereferencing to avoid
    undefined behavior. The method may perform internal calculations or lookups that
    could impact performance in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the memory pointed to by the return value remains valid for
    the duration of its use. Dereferencing a null pointer will result in a crash.
