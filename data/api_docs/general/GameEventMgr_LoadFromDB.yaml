documentation:
  brief: Loads all active game events from the database into memory for processing.
  description: The LoadFromDB method retrieves all currently active game events from
    the database and initializes them in memory. This method is typically called during
    server startup or when reloading game event data. It populates internal data structures
    with event definitions, start/end times, and associated triggers. The method ensures
    that all game events are properly registered and ready to be evaluated for activation
    or deactivation based on current time and conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: GameEventMgr::instance()->LoadFromDB();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    explicitly reloading game events. It performs database queries and populates internal
    caches, so calling it multiple times may result in duplicate entries or performance
    issues. The method is typically invoked by the core server startup sequence.
  warnings: Do not call this method from within event handlers or time-critical code
    paths as it may block execution while performing database operations. Avoid calling
    this method during high-traffic periods to prevent potential performance degradation.
