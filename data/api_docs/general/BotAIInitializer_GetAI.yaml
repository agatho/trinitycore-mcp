  class: BotAIInitializer
  method: GetAI
  signature: BotAI * BotAIInitializer::GetAI() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the BotAI instance associated with this initializer.
  description: The GetAI method returns a pointer to the BotAI object that has been
    initialized and configured by this BotAIInitializer. This method is typically
    used to obtain access to the AI behavior implementation for a specific bot, allowing
    developers or systems to interact with or control the bot's actions. The returned
    pointer is valid only as long as the initializer and its associated AI instance
    remain alive in memory. It is important to ensure that the initializer has been
    properly initialized before calling this method, otherwise the returned pointer
    may be null or invalid.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the BotAI instance managed by this initializer. Returns nullptr
    if the initializer has not yet been initialized or if initialization failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BotAI* ai = initializer->GetAI();\nif (ai != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the\
      \ AI instance\n    ai->UpdateAI();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BotAIInitializer has already been initialized
    with a valid AI configuration. The returned BotAI pointer should not be deleted
    directly, as it is managed by the initializer object.
  warnings: Calling this method before the initializer's initialization process completes
    may result in a null return value. Always check for null before using the returned
    pointer to avoid undefined behavior.
