  class: FollowerAI
  method: IsEscorted
  signature: bool FollowerAI::IsEscorted() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the follower is currently being escorted by a player.
  description: The IsEscorted method determines if the current creature controlled
    by FollowerAI is currently under the escort of a player. This method is typically
    used in AI logic to control behavior during escort quests, where the NPC follows
    a player and performs specific actions based on the escort state. The method returns
    true when the creature is actively escorted and false otherwise. It's commonly
    used in conjunction with escort quest mechanics in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    server implementation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the follower is currently being escorted by a player, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "class MyEscortAI : public FollowerAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override\n    {\n        if (IsEscorted())\n        {\n            //\
      \ Perform escort-specific actions\n            DoCast(SPELL_ESCORT_SPELL);\n\
      \        }\n        else\n        {\n            // Handle non-escort state\n\
      \            MoveToPlayer();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking within the FollowerAI class.
    The escort state is typically managed by the quest system and may be modified
    through player interaction or quest events. Developers should ensure that the
    creature's AI logic properly handles transitions between escorted and non-escorted
    states.
