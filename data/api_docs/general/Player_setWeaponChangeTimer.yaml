  class: Player
  method: setWeaponChangeTimer
  signature: void Player::setWeaponChangeTimer(uint32 time)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the weapon change timer for the player, preventing weapon swaps until
    the timer expires.
  description: The setWeaponChangeTimer method is used to control the timing of weapon
    swaps for a player character. It prevents the player from changing weapons until
    the specified time has elapsed, which is useful for managing cooldowns and ensuring
    proper gameplay mechanics during combat. This method typically relates to the
    player's ability to switch between different weapon types or to enforce a cooldown
    period after certain actions. The timer is usually measured in milliseconds and
    affects the player's weapon swap functionality.
  parameters:
  - name: time
    description: The time in milliseconds that the weapon change timer should be set
      for. This value determines how long the player must wait before being able to
      swap weapons again.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->setWeaponChangeTimer(5000); // Set weapon change timer for 5 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 cooldownTime = 3000;

      player->setWeaponChangeTimer(cooldownTime);

      // This ensures the player cannot swap weapons until after 3 seconds have passed'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other weapon-related methods
    to manage player behavior during combat. It's important to note that this timer
    is not related to the player's auto-attack timer but rather to weapon swap cooldowns.
    Implementation details include ensuring proper synchronization of time values
    and handling potential race conditions if multiple timers are set.
  warnings: This method should not be used in situations where the player needs to
    immediately swap weapons, as it will prevent such actions until the timer expires.
    Additionally, setting a very large time value may cause performance issues or
    unexpected behavior in game mechanics.
