  class: AuctionHouse
  method: SetAuctionHouseEnabled
  signature: void AuctionHouse::SetAuctionHouseEnabled(uint32 playerGuid, bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the auction house functionality for a specific player.
  description: The SetAuctionHouseEnabled method controls whether a player can access
    and use the auction house system in World of Warcraft. This method is typically
    used to manage player permissions or to temporarily restrict auction house access
    during maintenance or special events. The change takes effect immediately for
    the specified player, affecting their ability to list items, bid on auctions,
    or interact with the auction house interface. This functionality is crucial for
    server administrators who need fine-grained control over game features based on
    player status or server conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique global identifier (GUID) of the player whose auction house
      access will be modified. This value must correspond to a valid player in the
      database.
  - name: enabled
    description: A boolean flag that determines the state of the auction house for
      the specified player. When true, the player gains access to the auction house;
      when false, access is revoked.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Auction House for a Player
    code: AuctionHouse::SetAuctionHouseEnabled(123456, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Auction House for a Player
    code: AuctionHouse::SetAuctionHouseEnabled(789012, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal player state flags or database records
    to reflect the auction house access status. It may also trigger UI updates in
    the client to show/hide auction house interface elements. The operation is assumed
    to be thread-safe as it's part of a core game system.
  warnings: Ensure that the playerGuid corresponds to an actual logged-in player,
    as enabling/disabling auction house for non-existent players could lead to undefined
    behavior. This method should not be called excessively in performance-critical
    code paths.
