  signature: void BotGearFactory::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot gear factory by setting up internal data structures and
    loading required configurations.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the BotGearFactory for use by constructing
    necessary internal data structures, loading configuration files, and initializing
    any dependent systems. This method should be called once during the system startup
    or when the factory needs to be reset with fresh data. It ensures that all bot
    gear generation logic has access to the required resources and settings before
    any gear creation operations are performed. The initialization process may involve
    reading from database tables, caching item templates, and preparing lookup tables
    for efficient gear assignment.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'BotGearFactory factory;

      factory.Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or when a new bot instance
    is created. It's important to ensure that all required database connections and
    configuration files are available before calling this method. The initialization
    process may block briefly while loading data from persistent storage.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times without proper cleanup may lead to memory
    leaks or inconsistent internal state. This method should not be called concurrently
    from multiple threads without external synchronization.
