documentation:
  brief: Initializes internal state for executing a spell script hook of the specified
    type.
  description: The _PrepareScriptCall method prepares the SpellScript instance for
    execution of a specific spell hook type. This internal method sets up necessary
    context and state variables required for the script to properly execute within
    the TrinityCore spell system. It is typically called internally by the core spell
    handling mechanism before invoking any script hooks. The method ensures that all
    relevant spell data, target information, and execution context are correctly initialized
    for the upcoming hook invocation. This preparation step is crucial for maintaining
    consistency and preventing runtime errors during spell script execution.

    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void _PrepareScriptCall(SpellScriptHookType\
      \ hookType) override\n    {\n        // Base preparation logic\n        SpellScript::_PrepareScriptCall(hookType);\n\
      \        \n        // Additional custom setup based on hook type\n        switch\
      \ (hookType)\n        {\n            case SPELL_SCRIPT_HOOK_EFFECT_HIT:\n  \
      \              // Setup for effect hit hook\n                break;\n      \
      \      default:\n                break;\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended for internal use within the TrinityCore spell system
    and should not typically be called directly by custom spell scripts. It's part
    of the internal hook execution framework that manages script lifecycle during
    spell processing.
  warnings: Direct invocation of this method may lead to undefined behavior if not
    properly coordinated with the core spell execution flow. Developers should avoid
    calling this method outside of the expected internal execution context.
