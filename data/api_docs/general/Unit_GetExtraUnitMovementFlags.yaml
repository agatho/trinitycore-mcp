  class: Unit
  method: GetExtraUnitMovementFlags
  signature: uint32 Unit::GetExtraUnitMovementFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the extra movement flags set for the unit.
  description: This method retrieves the additional movement flags that are applied
    to a Unit object, which can include various game mechanics such as flight paths,
    swimming, or other special movement states. These flags are used internally by
    the TrinityCore engine to determine how the unit moves and interacts with the
    world environment. The returned value represents a bitmask of all extra movement
    flags currently set for the unit.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 representing the extra movement flags set for this unit, where
    each bit corresponds to a specific movement state or condition such as flight,
    swimming, or other special movement behaviors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 flags = unit->GetExtraUnitMovementFlags();\nif (flags & MOVEFLAG_FLYING)\n\
      {\n    // Unit is currently flying\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related
    methods to determine the complete movement state of a unit. It's important to
    note that this value may change dynamically during gameplay based on various conditions
    such as spell effects, environmental interactions, or player actions.
  warnings: Care should be taken when interpreting these flags, as they represent
    a bitmask and can combine multiple movement states. Incorrect handling of bitwise
    operations could lead to unexpected behavior in unit movement.
