  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: IsInteracting
  signature: bool NPCInteractionManager::IsInteracting() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player is currently engaged in an NPC interaction.
  description: The IsInteracting method determines whether the player character is
    currently involved in an active NPC interaction, such as talking to a quest giver,
    vendor, or other interactive NPC. This method typically checks internal state
    flags or tracking variables within the NPCInteractionManager class to verify if
    an interaction session is ongoing. The result of this check is essential for preventing
    multiple simultaneous interactions and ensuring proper game flow during player-NPC
    engagements.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently interacting with an NPC, false
    otherwise. This indicates that an active interaction session exists and further
    interaction commands may be blocked or handled differently.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interaction Check
    code: "if (player->GetNPCInteractionManager()->IsInteracting()) {\n    // Prevent\
      \ additional interactions\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"You are already interacting\
      \ with an NPC.\");\n    return;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Interaction Handling
    code: "if (!player->GetNPCInteractionManager()->IsInteracting()) {\n    // Start\
      \ new interaction\n    player->GetNPCInteractionManager()->StartInteraction(npc);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle ongoing interaction\n    player->GetNPCInteractionManager()->HandleOngoingInteraction();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the game engine to manage state
    transitions during NPC interactions. It may rely on internal flags or a state
    machine that tracks interaction progress. The method should be called frequently
    during interaction loops to maintain proper synchronization of player and NPC
    states.
  warnings: Calling this method during critical interaction sequences (like quest
    completion) without proper checks can lead to unexpected behavior or state corruption.
    Always ensure that interactions are properly initialized before checking this
    flag.
