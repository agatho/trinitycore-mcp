  method: SetupGroupMember
  signature: void LFGMgr::SetupGroupMember(int guid, int gguid)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes or updates a group member's LFG (Looking For Group) data using
    the player and group GUIDs.
  description: 'The SetupGroupMember method is responsible for configuring the LFG
    (Looking For Group) data associated with a specific player within a group context.
    It takes two GUID parameters: the first representing the player''s unique identifier,
    and the second representing the group''s unique identifier. This method ensures
    that the player''s LFG state is properly linked to their group membership, which
    is essential for coordinating group activities such as dungeons, raids, or other
    instances. The method likely performs internal setup operations to synchronize
    LFG status, roles, and preferences with the group''s LFG framework. It is typically
    invoked during group creation, member addition, or when a player''s LFG status
    changes within a group context.'
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose LFG data needs to
      be set up or updated.
  - name: gguid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group that the player belongs
      to, used to associate the player's LFG data with the group context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting up a group member's LFG data
    code: LFGMgr::instance()->SetupGroupMember(12345, 67890);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the internal LFG system and may be called automatically
    by the core when group membership changes. It's important to ensure that both
    GUIDs are valid and correspond to existing entities in the game world before calling
    this method.
