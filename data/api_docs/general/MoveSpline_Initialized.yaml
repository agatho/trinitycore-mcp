  class: MoveSpline
  method: Initialized
  signature: bool MoveSpline::Initialized() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the movement spline has been initialized and is ready for
    use.
  description: The Initialized method determines if a MoveSpline object has completed
    its initialization process and is prepared to handle movement operations. This
    flag is typically set after the spline has been configured with start and end
    positions, as well as any intermediate waypoints or movement parameters. The method
    serves as a safety check to ensure that movement-related operations are only performed
    on properly initialized splines, preventing undefined behavior or crashes during
    pathfinding and character movement in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the MoveSpline has been successfully initialized and is
    ready for movement operations; returns false otherwise. This indicates whether
    all necessary configuration parameters have been set and validated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Check
    code: "MoveSpline spline;\nif (spline.Initialized()) {\n    // Spline is ready\
      \ for movement\n    spline.Update(1000); // Update movement\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Handle uninitialized spline\n    LogError(\"Spline not initialized\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Movement Handler
    code: "void HandlePlayerMovement(Player* player) {\n    MoveSpline& spline = player->GetMoveSpline();\n\
      \    if (!spline.Initialized()) {\n        // Initialize the spline with destination\n\
      \        spline.SetDestination(player->GetPositionX(), player->GetPositionY(),\
      \ player->GetPositionZ());\n        spline.Initialize();\n    }\n    // Proceed\
      \ with movement update\n    spline.Update(GetMSTime());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with movement-related systems
    to ensure proper state management. The initialization typically occurs after setting
    waypoints, destination points, or other movement parameters. It's important to
    note that a spline may be initialized but not necessarily active for movement
    if additional conditions are not met.
  warnings: Calling movement methods on an uninitialized spline can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always check the return value of Initialized() before performing
    any movement operations. Be aware that this method only checks initialization
    state, not whether the spline is currently executing a movement path.
