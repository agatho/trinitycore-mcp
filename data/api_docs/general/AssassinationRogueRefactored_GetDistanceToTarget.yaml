  class: AssassinationRogueRefactored
  method: GetDistanceToTarget
  signature: float AssassinationRogueRefactored::GetDistanceToTarget(int * target)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the rogue and the specified
    target unit.
  description: The GetDistanceToTarget method computes the straight-line distance
    from the current Assassination Rogue instance to a provided target unit. This
    calculation is typically used for determining whether the rogue is within melee
    range or to decide when to apply certain abilities that have distance-based requirements.
    The method relies on the internal positioning data of both the rogue and the target
    to perform the distance computation. It's important to note that this method may
    return an invalid value if the target unit pointer is null or if the target is
    not in the same map instance as the rogue.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the target Unit object for which the distance will be
      calculated. This parameter must point to a valid Unit instance; otherwise, the
      behavior is undefined.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the Euclidean distance between the rogue
    and the target unit in yards. If the target is null or invalid, the return value
    may be negative or unpredictable.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if target is within melee range
    code: "if (rogue->GetDistanceToTarget(target) <= 5.0f)\n{\n    // Execute melee\
      \ ability\n    rogue->CastSpell(target, SPELL_DEADLY_THROW);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using distance to determine ability eligibility
    code: "float distance = rogue->GetDistanceToTarget(target);\nif (distance > 10.0f\
      \ && distance < 25.0f)\n{\n    // Use ranged ability\n    rogue->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_KNIFE_THROW);\n}\nelse if (distance <= 5.0f)\n{\n    // Use melee ability\n\
      \    rogue->CastSpell(target, SPELL_BACKSTAB);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct distance calculation using the unit's current
    position coordinates and does not account for obstacles or terrain. It assumes
    both units are in the same map instance. For performance-critical code paths,
    consider caching the result if multiple distance checks are needed.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the target parameter will likely result in undefined
    behavior or an incorrect distance calculation. Always validate that the target
    unit is valid before calling this method.
