documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum health value for the unit.
  description: This method allows developers to set the maximum health value of a
    Unit object, which is essential for controlling creature or player health behavior
    in World of Warcraft. The method updates the internal health data structure and
    ensures that the unit's health remains within valid bounds. It is commonly used
    during creature spawning, player initialization, or when modifying game mechanics
    such as boss fights or player progression.
  parameters:
  - name: val
    description: The maximum health value to set for the unit. This must be a positive
      integer representing the total health points available to the unit.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Health for a Player
    code: 'Unit* player = new Unit();

      player->SetMaxHealth(1000);

      // Sets player''s maximum health to 1000 points'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Maximum Health for a Creature
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetMaxHealth(5000);

      // Sets creature''s maximum health to 5000 points'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it affects the unit's internal health
    state. It is recommended to call this method before any health-related operations
    to ensure proper initialization. The method does not validate whether the value
    is within reasonable bounds for game balance, so developers must ensure that values
    are appropriate for their use case.
  warnings: Setting maximum health too high may cause performance issues or unexpected
    behavior in game mechanics. Ensure that the value is appropriate for the unit
    type (player vs creature) and consider using appropriate health scaling factors
    for different difficulty levels.
