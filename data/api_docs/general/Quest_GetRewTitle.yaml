  class: Quest
  method: GetRewTitle
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetRewTitle() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the title associated with the quest reward.
  description: The GetRewTitle method retrieves the title that is awarded to players
    upon completing a specific quest. This title represents the honor or reputation
    title that the player will receive as part of the quest rewards. The method is
    commonly used in quest scripts and reward calculations to determine what title
    the player should receive after quest completion. It typically corresponds to
    a specific title ID defined in the game database, which may vary depending on
    the quest's reward type and level.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the title ID associated with the quest reward.
    This value corresponds to a title defined in the game database, typically related
    to the player's reputation or honor title upon completing the quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'uint32 titleId = quest->GetRewTitle();

      // titleId now contains the title ID for the quest reward'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Quest class and operates on a quest object instance.
    It should be used in conjunction with other quest-related methods to determine
    full reward behavior. The returned value may be zero if no title is associated
    with the quest reward, which typically occurs when the quest has no title reward
    or when the quest's reward type does not include title rewards.
  warnings: This method does not validate whether the returned title ID actually exists
    in the game database. Developers should ensure that the title ID returned by this
    method corresponds to a valid title in the database, especially when implementing
    custom reward logic. Also note that this method is typically used during quest
    completion processing and may not reflect the actual title received if the quest
    has been completed already.
