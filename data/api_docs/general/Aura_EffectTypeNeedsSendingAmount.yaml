  class: Aura
  method: EffectTypeNeedsSendingAmount
  signature: bool Aura::EffectTypeNeedsSendingAmount(AuraType type)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified aura type requires sending amount information
    to clients.
  description: This method checks if a given aura type needs to transmit its amount
    value to the client for proper visualization and gameplay mechanics. It is used
    internally by the TrinityCore server to optimize network traffic by only sending
    necessary aura data. The method evaluates the aura type against predefined criteria
    to determine if the amount field should be included in the aura update packets
    sent to players.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified aura type requires sending amount information
    to clients, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a DamageOverTime aura needs amount sending
    code: "AuraType auraType = AURA_TYPE_PERIODIC_DAMAGE;\nbool needsSending = aura->EffectTypeNeedsSendingAmount(auraType);\n\
      if (needsSending)\n{\n    // Send amount information to client\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during aura application and update processes.
    It helps reduce network overhead by avoiding unnecessary data transmission for
    aura types that do not require amount information to be sent to clients.
