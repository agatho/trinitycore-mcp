  signature: void LootStrategy::InitializeTriggers()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the loot strategy triggers for the associated object.
  description: The InitializeTriggers method sets up and configures all necessary
    trigger conditions and behaviors for loot distribution within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method is typically called during object initialization or when
    a new loot strategy needs to be activated. It establishes the rules that determine
    how and when items are distributed among players, including conditions based on
    player proximity, loot quality, and group composition. The method ensures that
    all required trigger callbacks are registered and ready for execution when loot
    events occur.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Loot Strategy Initialization
    code: 'LootStrategy strategy;

      strategy.InitializeTriggers();

      // Triggers are now active and ready to handle loot events'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the object's lifecycle. Reinitializing
    triggers may cause unexpected behavior or memory leaks. The method assumes that
    all required dependencies for loot distribution are already configured in the
    system.
  warnings: Calling InitializeTriggers multiple times on the same object may lead
    to duplicate trigger registrations and undefined behavior. Ensure that this method
    is called only after all necessary configuration parameters have been set.
