  signature: bool ShamanAI::HasFlameShockOnTarget(int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the shaman has Flame Shock applied to the current target.
  description: The HasFlameShockOnTarget method determines whether the shaman's current
    target is affected by the Flame Shock spell. This utility function is typically
    used in AI decision-making logic to avoid unnecessary spell casting or to prioritize
    other abilities. The method internally evaluates the target's aura state and checks
    for the presence of the Flame Shock debuff. It does not modify any game state
    but provides a boolean result based on the current combat conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current target has the Flame Shock debuff applied;
    otherwise returns false. The method will return false if there is no current target
    or if the target does not have the specific Flame Shock effect active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (shamanAI->HasFlameShockOnTarget()) {\n    // Target already has Flame\
      \ Shock, skip casting\n    DoNotCastFlameShock();\n} else {\n    // Cast Flame\
      \ Shock on target\n    CastFlameShock();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Decision Making
    code: "void ShamanAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (HasFlameShockOnTarget())\
      \ {\n        // Flame Shock is active, consider other spells\n        ChooseNextSpell();\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Apply Flame Shock if possible\n        CastFlameShock();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal aura tracking system of TrinityCore. It
    assumes that the shaman AI has a valid target set and that the target is within
    range for spell application. The implementation may cache results or use optimized
    lookup methods for performance in high-frequency AI updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the shaman AI's target is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as calling it without a valid target could lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect results. This method should not be used as a standalone check for
    spell availability but rather as part of broader combat decision logic.
