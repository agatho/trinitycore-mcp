  signature: void MapObject::SetNewCellPosition(float x, float y, float z, float o)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the object's cell position and orientation within the map
  description: The SetNewCellPosition method updates the spatial coordinates and orientation
    of a MapObject within the game world. This method is typically used when an object
    needs to be moved to a new location, such as during teleportation, movement updates,
    or respawn events. The method handles internal cell management and ensures the
    object is properly registered in the new cell. It's important to note that this
    method doesn't perform any collision detection or validation of the new position
    - it simply updates the object's internal state and spatial registration.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the new position in world space
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the new position in world space
  - name: z
    description: The Z coordinate of the new position in world space
  - name: o
    description: The orientation angle (in radians) of the object
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Position Update
    code: 'MapObject* obj = ...;

      obj->SetNewCellPosition(100.0f, 200.0f, 50.0f, 1.57f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Teleportation Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      float newX = player->GetPositionX() + 10.0f;

      float newY = player->GetPositionY() + 10.0f;

      player->SetNewCellPosition(newX, newY, player->GetPositionZ(), player->GetOrientation());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method updates the object's internal cell reference and should be called
    whenever an object's position changes significantly enough to require a new cell
    registration. The method is typically called by movement handlers or teleportation
    systems within TrinityCore. It's important to ensure that coordinates passed are
    valid and within reasonable bounds for the map.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid coordinates may result in undefined behavior
    or object desynchronization. This method does not validate whether the new position
    is walkable or within map boundaries - additional checks should be performed before
    calling this method. Always ensure proper synchronization when calling from different
    threads.
