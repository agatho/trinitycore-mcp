documentation:
  brief: Returns the corpses in a specific cell of the map.
  description: The GetCorpsesInCell method retrieves the list of corpses located within
    a specified cell on the map. This method is used to access corpse data for a given
    cell ID, which is essential for managing player corpse placement and retrieval
    during gameplay mechanics such as resurrection and graveyard systems. The method
    returns a pointer to an array of integers representing the corpse IDs in that
    cell, allowing developers to iterate through or query specific corpses based on
    their location.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to an array of integers representing the corpse IDs located
    in the specified cell. If no corpses exist in the cell, it returns nullptr. The
    returned array may contain zero or more elements depending on how many corpses
    are present in that specific cell.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int const* corpses = map->GetCorpsesInCell(1234);\nif (corpses != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)\n    {\n        if (corpses[i] != 0)\n  \
      \          std::cout << \"Corpse ID: \" << corpses[i] << std::endl;\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other map-related functions
    to manage player corpse locations. Performance considerations include checking
    for null pointers before dereferencing the returned pointer, as it may be nullptr
    if no corpses exist in the cell.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method because accessing invalid memory can
    lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Always ensure that the cell ID passed is
    valid and within bounds of the map's grid system.
