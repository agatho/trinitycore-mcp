  class: SpellCastTargets
  method: GetObjectTargetGUID
  signature: int SpellCastTargets::GetObjectTargetGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the GUID of the target object for a spell cast.
  description: The GetObjectTargetGUID method returns the unique identifier (GUID)
    of the target object associated with a spell cast. This method is typically used
    in the context of spell targeting mechanics within TrinityCore's spell system.
    The returned GUID can be used to identify and reference the specific target entity,
    such as a player, creature, or game object, that the spell is being cast upon.
    It is important to note that this method may return 0 if no valid target exists
    or if the target has been destroyed. This function is part of the SpellCastTargets
    class which manages all targeting information for spell casts.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the GUID of the target object. A value
    of 0 indicates either no target exists or the target is invalid/destroyed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Handler
    code: "void HandleSpellCast(Spell* spell)\n{\n    SpellCastTargets targets = spell->GetSpellCastTargets();\n\
      \    int targetGUID = targets.GetObjectTargetGUID();\n    if (targetGUID !=\
      \ 0)\n    {\n        // Process the target\n        Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*spell->GetCaster(),\
      \ targetGUID);\n        if (target)\n        {\n            // Perform action\
      \ on target\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in spell processing logic to determine which
    object a spell is targeting. The returned GUID should be validated before use,
    as it may be zero if no valid target exists. Performance-wise, this is a simple
    getter operation and should not cause significant overhead.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned GUID without verifying that it's not
    zero, as attempting to access an object with a zero GUID will likely result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate the GUID before performing operations
    on the target object.
