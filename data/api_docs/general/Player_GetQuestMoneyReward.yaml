documentation:
  brief: Returns the monetary reward amount for a given quest
  description: This method retrieves the monetary reward that a player should receive
    upon completing a specific quest. It calculates and returns the gold amount based
    on the quest's requirements and the player's level. The method is typically used
    in conjunction with quest completion handling to determine how much gold the player
    should receive as part of their reward. This function does not modify any state;
    it simply reads and computes the reward value.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the amount of gold (in copper units) that the player should receive
    for completing the specified quest, or 0 if no monetary reward is defined for
    the quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 reward = player->GetQuestMoneyReward(quest);\nif (reward > 0)\n\
      {\n    player->ModifyMoney(reward);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method internally uses the quest's reward data to compute the gold amount.
    It may involve calculations based on player's level, quest level difference, and
    other factors. Performance-wise, this method is lightweight as it only performs
    simple computations without any database calls.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a player has completed
    a quest; instead, use GetQuestRewardMoney() which handles the actual reward distribution
    logic.
