  method: IsCacheValid
  signature: bool GroupCombatTrigger::IsCacheValid(Group * group) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the cached group combat state is still valid for the specified
    group.
  description: The IsCacheValid method determines if the cached combat status of a
    group has become stale and requires an update. This method is typically used within
    the GroupCombatTrigger system to ensure that combat-related triggers are only
    activated when the group's combat state is current. The cache validity check may
    consider factors such as time elapsed since last update, group member changes,
    or combat state transitions. When the cache is invalid, the system will refresh
    the group's combat status before proceeding with any trigger evaluations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the cached combat state for the group is still valid and
    can be used without refreshing; returns false if the cache has expired or become
    invalid and needs to be updated before use.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cache Validation Check
    code: "if (groupCombatTrigger->IsCacheValid(group)) {\n    // Proceed with combat\
      \ trigger logic using cached data\n    groupCombatTrigger->ExecuteTriggers(group);\n\
      } else {\n    // Refresh cache before proceeding\n    groupCombatTrigger->UpdateCache(group);\n\
      \    groupCombatTrigger->ExecuteTriggers(group);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely implements a time-based or event-driven cache invalidation
    strategy. Developers should be aware that frequent calls to this method may impact
    performance if cache refreshes are expensive. The validity period of the cache
    is implementation-dependent and may vary based on game mechanics.
