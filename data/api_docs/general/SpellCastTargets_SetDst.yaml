documentation:
  brief: Copies destination target data from another SpellCastTargets object
  description: The SetDst method copies the destination target information from one
    SpellCastTargets object to another. This is typically used when transferring targeting
    data between different spell cast instances or when preparing a spell cast with
    specific target parameters. The method updates internal destination coordinates,
    orientation, and target entity references. It's commonly called during spell preparation
    phases where target data needs to be duplicated or reassigned without creating
    new objects.
  parameters:
  - name: spellTargets
    description: The source SpellCastTargets object containing the destination target
      data to copy
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Copying target data between spell cast instances
    code: 'SpellCastTargets originalTargets;

      // ... set up originalTargets with destination data ...

      SpellCastTargets newTargets;

      newTargets.SetDst(originalTargets);

      // newTargets now contains the same destination target data as originalTargets'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reusing target data for multiple spell casts
    code: 'SpellCastTargets baseTargets;

      baseTargets.setDst(...); // Set up initial target


      // Create several spell casts with same target

      SpellCastTargets spell1Targets = baseTargets;

      SpellCastTargets spell2Targets = baseTargets;

      spell1Targets.SetDst(baseTargets);

      spell2Targets.SetDst(baseTargets);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a shallow copy of destination target data. The implementation
    likely copies internal coordinate values, orientation data, and entity references
    rather than deep-copying complex target structures. It's important to ensure that
    the source SpellCastTargets object remains valid while this operation is in progress.
  warnings: Be cautious when using SetDst with SpellCastTargets objects that may be
    modified concurrently, as this could lead to race conditions if not properly synchronized.
    Also, ensure that the source object has valid destination data before calling
    this method to avoid copying invalid target information.
