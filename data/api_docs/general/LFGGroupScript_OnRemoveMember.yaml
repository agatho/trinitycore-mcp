  class: LFGGroupScript
  method: OnRemoveMember
  signature: void LFGGroupScript::OnRemoveMember(Group * group, int guid, int method,
    int kicker, const char * reason)
documentation:
  brief: Called when a member is removed from a LFG group, providing context about
    the removal method and reason.
  description: The OnRemoveMember method is invoked whenever a player is removed from
    a Looking for Group (LFG) group. This callback allows scripts to react to group
    member removals, which can occur due to various reasons such as leaving the group
    voluntarily, being kicked by a leader, or automatic removal due to timeout or
    disconnection. The method provides detailed information about how and why the
    player was removed, enabling custom logic for handling group dynamics, loot distribution,
    or player experience adjustments. This method is part of the LFGGroupScript interface
    and is typically used in custom scripts or addons that modify standard LFG behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object from which the member was removed. This
      represents the LFG group context.
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player who was removed
      from the group.
  - name: method
    description: Integer representing the method used to remove the member. Common
      values include 0 for leaving, 1 for being kicked, and 2 for timeout or disconnection.
  - name: kicker
    description: The GUID of the player who initiated the removal, if applicable (e.g.,
      a kick). Zero if not applicable.
  - name: reason
    description: Null-terminated string describing the reason for removal. May be
      NULL or empty in some cases.
  returns: null

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during the group removal process, so any modifications
    to the group or player state within this function must be carefully considered
    to avoid race conditions or inconsistent states. The 'reason' parameter may be
    NULL in some cases, so always check for null before using it.
  warnings: Modifying group members or player state directly from this callback can
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes if not handled properly. Ensure that all
    operations are safe and do not interfere with the ongoing removal process.
