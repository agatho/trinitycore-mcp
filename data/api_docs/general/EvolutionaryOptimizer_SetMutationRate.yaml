  brief: Sets the mutation rate for the evolutionary optimization algorithm
  description: Configures the probability of mutation occurring during the evolutionary
    optimization process. This parameter controls how frequently random changes are
    introduced to individuals in the population, affecting the exploration vs exploitation
    balance of the algorithm. The mutation rate is typically a value between 0.0 and
    1.0, where 0.0 means no mutations occur and 1.0 means all individuals undergo
    mutation. In the context of TrinityCore's AI systems, this method would influence
    how genetic algorithms evolve NPC behaviors or player skill trees.
  parameters:
  - name: rate
    description: The mutation rate as a floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0.
      A value of 0.0 disables mutations entirely, while 1.0 causes all individuals
      to mutate. Typical values range from 0.01 to 0.1 for most evolutionary systems.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a standard mutation rate
    code: 'EvolutionaryOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.SetMutationRate(0.05f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disabling mutations for controlled experiments
    code: 'EvolutionaryOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.SetMutationRate(0.0f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The mutation rate directly impacts the convergence speed and diversity of
    the evolutionary algorithm. Higher rates increase exploration but may slow convergence,
    while lower rates improve convergence but risk premature convergence to local
    optima.
  warnings: "Setting the mutation rate too high (\u63A5\u8FD11.0) can prevent the\
    \ algorithm from converging to optimal solutions, while setting it too low (\u63A5\
    \u8FD10.0) may cause the algorithm to get stuck in local minima. Values outside\
    \ the [0.0, 1.0] range are undefined behavior."
