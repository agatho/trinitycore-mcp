  signature: void Creature::SetNoCallAssistance(bool val)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the creature should not call for assistance when it is attacked.
  description: This method controls whether a creature will automatically call for
    help from nearby friendly creatures when it is attacked. When set to true, the
    creature will not summon any assistants, effectively disabling the call-assistance
    behavior. This is commonly used in scenarios where specific NPC behavior needs
    to be controlled, such as boss encounters or scripted events. The method affects
    the creature's AI behavior and can be used to prevent unintended assistance calls
    during combat.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetNoCallAssistance(true);

      // Creature will not call for assistance when attacked'
    language: cpp
  - title: Boss Encounter Example
    code: 'Creature* boss = GetCreature(12345);

      boss->SetNoCallAssistance(true);

      // Prevents boss from calling assistants during fight

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely modifies internal AI flags or
    behavior settings within the creature''s AI system. It may be used in conjunction
    with other AI control methods to fully customize NPC behavior during encounters.'
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it can affect game balance and
    encounter difficulty. Setting this to true may prevent normal gameplay mechanics
    from functioning properly if not intended.
