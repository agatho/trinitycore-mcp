  class: BotWorldEntry
  method: HandleWorldEntryFailure
  signature: void BotWorldEntry::HandleWorldEntryFailure(const std::string & reason)
documentation:
  brief: Handles and logs a world entry failure with the provided reason.
  description: The HandleWorldEntryFailure method is responsible for processing and
    logging failures that occur during the world entry process in the TrinityCore
    framework. This method typically gets invoked when a bot or player fails to successfully
    enter the game world due to various reasons such as invalid credentials, server
    restrictions, or connection issues. It ensures proper error handling and reporting
    within the bot management system, allowing developers to diagnose and resolve
    entry-related problems effectively. The method does not return any value but performs
    necessary cleanup and logging operations.
  parameters:
  - name: reason
    description: A string describing the specific reason for the world entry failure.
      This parameter contains human-readable information about what went wrong during
      the world entry attempt.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleWorldEntryFailure
    code: 'BotWorldEntry* entry = new BotWorldEntry();

      entry->HandleWorldEntryFailure("Invalid username or password");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging failure in a bot manager context
    code: "void BotManager::OnWorldEntryFailed(const std::string& reason) {\n    if\
      \ (currentBotEntry) {\n        currentBotEntry->HandleWorldEntryFailure(reason);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically part of a larger bot management system and may be
    called from multiple threads. It's important to ensure thread safety when implementing
    logging or state changes within this method. The implementation should avoid blocking
    operations to maintain performance.
  warnings: Ensure that the reason string passed to this method does not contain sensitive
    information, as it might be logged or exposed in debug output. This method is
    designed for error reporting and should not be used for normal control flow.
