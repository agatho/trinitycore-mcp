  class: CharmInfo
  method: IsReturning
  signature: bool CharmInfo::IsReturning()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the charmed unit is currently returning to its original
    position after being commanded to move.
  description: The IsReturning method checks the internal state of a CharmInfo object
    to determine if the charmed creature (such as a pet) is in the process of returning
    to its owner's location. This typically occurs when a pet has been commanded to
    follow or stay near its owner but has moved away, and the system is now guiding
    it back. The method returns true if the pet is actively returning, false otherwise.
    This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper pet behavior and positioning
    in World of Warcraft's AI system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the charmed unit is currently in the process of returning
    to its original position; returns false if it is not returning or has reached
    its destination.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a pet is returning
    code: "if (player->GetPet()->GetCharmInfo()->IsReturning()) {\n    // Handle the\
      \ case where pet is returning to owner\n    sLog->outString(\"Pet is returning\
      \ to owner.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking within the CharmInfo class.
    It should only be called on valid CharmInfo objects that are associated with a
    charmed unit. The return value may change dynamically as the pet's movement state
    updates.
