  class: EscortAI
  method: SetActiveAttacker
  signature: void EscortAI::SetActiveAttacker(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the active attacker state for the EscortAI instance.
  description: The SetActiveAttacker method controls whether the EscortAI instance
    will actively engage and respond to attackers. When enabled, the AI will prioritize
    attacking enemies and maintain aggro; when disabled, it will not initiate combat
    or respond to hostile actions. This method is typically used during escort quests
    to control the behavior of NPCs that are being escorted. The state change affects
    the AI's internal attack logic and can be used to temporarily disable combat behavior
    during specific quest events.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean flag that determines whether to enable (true) or disable
      (false) active attacker behavior for the EscortAI instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Active Attacker
    code: 'escortAI->SetActiveAttacker(true);

      // Enables combat behavior for the escorted NPC'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Active Attacker
    code: 'escortAI->SetActiveAttacker(false);

      // Disables combat behavior during a safe zone or cutscene'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly influences the AI's combat state and should be used
    carefully during quest progression. The change takes effect immediately, affecting
    all subsequent combat-related decisions made by the EscortAI instance.
