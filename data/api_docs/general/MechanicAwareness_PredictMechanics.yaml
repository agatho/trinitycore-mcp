documentation:
  brief: Predicts upcoming mechanical effects on a target unit within a specified
    time frame
  description: The PredictMechanics method analyzes the current state and behavior
    of a target unit to forecast potential mechanical effects or abilities that will
    occur within the given time window. This functionality is commonly used in AI
    decision-making processes for determining optimal actions, such as when to apply
    defensive measures or prepare for incoming mechanics. The method evaluates various
    factors including unit status, active buffs/debuffs, and known ability patterns
    to estimate future events. It returns an integer value representing the predicted
    number of mechanics or a related metric indicating the severity or likelihood
    of mechanical interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object for which mechanics are being predicted.
      Must be a valid unit instance, typically a player or NPC in the game world.
  - name: timeAhead
    description: Time interval (in milliseconds) to look ahead when predicting mechanics.
      Specifies how far into the future the prediction should extend.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the predicted number of mechanics
    or a related metric indicating mechanical activity level. A positive value typically
    indicates expected mechanical effects, while zero may suggest no significant mechanics
    are anticipated within the time frame.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for predicting mechanics on a target
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetVictim();\nint predictedMechanics = mechanicAwareness->PredictMechanics(target,\
      \ 5000);\nif (predictedMechanics > 0)\n{\n    // Prepare for incoming mechanics\n\
      \    DoDefensiveAction();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using PredictMechanics to evaluate threat level
    code: "Unit* target = GetTarget();\nuint32 timeWindow = 3000;\nint mechanicsCount\
      \ = mechanicAwareness->PredictMechanics(target, timeWindow);\n\nif (mechanicsCount\
      \ >= 3)\n{\n    // High threat level - consider switching targets\n    SwitchTarget();\n\
      }\nelse if (mechanicsCount > 0)\n{\n    // Moderate threat - prepare accordingly\n\
      \    PrepareForMechanics();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in AI behavior scripting and requires a valid
    target unit pointer. The prediction accuracy depends on the completeness of the
    unit's state information and available mechanics data. Performance impact is minimal
    but can increase with complex targets or large time windows.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is not null before calling this method,
    as it will likely cause undefined behavior. The returned integer value should
    be interpreted in context of your specific AI logic since its exact meaning may
    vary based on implementation details.
