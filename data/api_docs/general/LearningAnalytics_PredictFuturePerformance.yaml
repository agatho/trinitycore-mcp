  signature: float LearningAnalytics::PredictFuturePerformance(uint32_t botGuid, uint32_t
    futureEpisodes) const
documentation:
  brief: Predicts the future performance of a bot based on historical learning data
    and episode count.
  description: The PredictFuturePerformance method estimates how well a specific bot,
    identified by its GUID, will perform in the future given a certain number of additional
    training episodes. This method utilizes machine learning models or statistical
    analysis techniques to forecast performance metrics such as win rate, efficiency,
    or task completion rates. It is typically used in automated gameplay systems where
    bots are trained and their expected future behavior needs to be estimated without
    running full simulations. The prediction is based on historical data collected
    from previous training sessions and may incorporate factors like learning curve
    trends, performance saturation points, and environmental variables.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose future performance is to
      be predicted. Must correspond to a valid bot in the system.
  - name: futureEpisodes
    description: Number of additional training episodes to consider when making the
      prediction. Should be a non-negative integer representing expected future training
      iterations.
  returns: A float value representing the predicted performance metric (e.g., win
    rate, efficiency score) for the specified bot after the given number of future
    episodes. The value typically ranges between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 indicates
    poor performance and 1.0 indicates optimal performance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Prediction Usage
    code: 'float predictedPerformance = analytics.PredictFuturePerformance(12345,
      100);

      std::cout << "Predicted performance after 100 episodes: " << predictedPerformance
      << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Trend Analysis
    code: "uint32_t botId = 67890;\nfor (int i = 10; i <= 100; i += 10) {\n    float\
      \ pred = analytics.PredictFuturePerformance(botId, i);\n    std::cout << \"\
      Episodes: \" << i << \", Predicted Performance: \" << pred << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot's learning behavior follows predictable
    patterns and that historical data is representative of future performance trends.
    The accuracy of predictions may degrade significantly if there are sudden changes
    in training environment or bot configuration. The method should be called only
    when sufficient training data has been collected to make meaningful predictions.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid botGuid values may result in undefined
    behavior or incorrect predictions. Ensure that the futureEpisodes parameter is
    non-negative and reasonable for your application context. Do not rely solely on
    these predictions for critical decisions without validating against actual performance
    data.
