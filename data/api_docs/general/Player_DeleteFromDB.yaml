  brief: Deletes a player character from the database
  description: This method removes a player character's data from the database, including
    all associated records such as character data, inventory items, and quest log
    information. The method handles both immediate deletion and final cleanup operations
    depending on the parameters provided. It is typically used during character deletion
    or when a player character is being removed from the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: playerguid
    description: The unique identifier of the player character to delete, typically
      obtained from the character's GUID
  - name: accountId
    description: The account ID associated with the player character, used for validation
      and cleanup purposes
  - name: updateRealmChars
    description: When true, updates realm character tracking information; when false,
      skips this step
  - name: deleteFinally
    description: When true, performs final cleanup operations including removing from
      realm characters table; when false, only removes basic data
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic deletion example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->DeleteFromDB(123456789, 987654321, true, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced deletion example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->DeleteFromDB(123456789, 987654321, false, true);

      // This removes character data but skips realm character updates'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs database operations in a transactional manner to ensure
    consistency. It is designed to handle both immediate deletion and final cleanup
    processes. The method should be used carefully as it permanently removes player
    data from the database.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without proper validation of
    the player GUID and account ID. Incorrect usage can lead to database inconsistencies
    or data loss. Also, calling this method with incorrect parameters may result in
    incomplete cleanup operations.
