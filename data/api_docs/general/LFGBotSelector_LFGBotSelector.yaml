  brief: Moves a LFGBotSelector object to another LFGBotSelector object using move
    semantics.
  description: The LFGBotSelector constructor is a move constructor that transfers
    ownership of resources from one LFGBotSelector instance to another. This constructor
    is typically used when an existing LFGBotSelector object needs to be efficiently
    transferred to a new location in memory, such as during container reallocation
    or function returns. The source object becomes invalid after the move operation
    and should not be used. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework,
    this method likely manages internal data structures related to LFG (Looking for
    Group) bot selection logic, potentially handling player group matching or queue
    management.

  examples:
  - title: Move LFGBotSelector object
    code: 'LFGBotSelector selector1;

      // ... initialize selector1 ...

      LFGBotSelector selector2 = std::move(selector1); // Move constructor called

      // selector1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, so it should only be called with an rvalue (temporary
    object or explicitly moved lvalue). After calling this constructor, the source
    object should not be accessed. The implementation likely involves transferring
    pointers or references to internal data structures rather than deep copying.
  warnings: Using this constructor on an already moved-from object results in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the source object is not used after a move operation. This
    constructor is typically not called directly but rather through move semantics
    like std::move().
