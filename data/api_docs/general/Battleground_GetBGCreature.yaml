  method: GetBGCreature
  signature: Creature * Battleground::GetBGCreature(int type, bool logError)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a specific battleground creature by type.
  description: The GetBGCreature method retrieves a Creature object associated with
    a specific type within the battleground. This method is typically used to access
    special battleground NPCs such as guards, flags, or other interactive objects
    that are part of the battleground's mechanics. The method may optionally log an
    error if the creature is not found, depending on the logError parameter. It is
    commonly used during battleground initialization and gameplay logic to interact
    with specific battlefield entities.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type identifier of the battleground creature to retrieve. This
      value typically corresponds to predefined constants or enumerations that define
      different types of battleground NPCs such as guards, flags, or control points.
  - name: logError
    description: If set to true, the method will log an error message if the requested
      creature type is not found. If false, no error will be logged and the method
      will simply return nullptr in case of a missing creature.
  returns: A pointer to the Creature object corresponding to the specified type, or
    nullptr if no such creature exists and logError is set to false.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve a battleground guard creature
    code: "Creature* guard = bg->GetBGCreature(BG_CREATURE_TYPE_GUARD, true);\nif\
      \ (guard)\n{\n    // Use the guard creature\n    guard->AI()->DoAction(ACTION_START_BATTLE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check for a specific battleground flag without logging errors
    code: "Creature* flag = bg->GetBGCreature(BG_CREATURE_TYPE_FLAG, false);\nif (flag)\n\
      {\n    // Process the flag\n    flag->SetFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS, UNIT_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle missing flag case\n    sLog->outError(\"Battleground:\
      \ Missing flag creature\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal battleground creature storage and should only
    be called during active battleground sessions. The type parameter must correspond
    to valid battleground creature types defined in the battleground implementation.
    Performance is generally good as it uses a lookup table internally, but frequent
    calls during high-frequency events should be monitored.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid type value may result in undefined
    behavior or return nullptr without logging an error if logError is false. Always
    validate the returned pointer before using it to avoid null pointer dereferences.
