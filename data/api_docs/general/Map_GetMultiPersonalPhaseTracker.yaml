  class: Map
  method: GetMultiPersonalPhaseTracker
  signature: int & Map::GetMultiPersonalPhaseTracker()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the multi-personal phase tracker identifier for the map.
  description: This method retrieves the current multi-personal phase tracker value
    associated with the map, which is used to track phase information for multiple
    players in a shared environment. The phase tracker allows for coordination of
    player phases across different instances and zones, ensuring proper synchronization
    of game mechanics such as quest progression, event triggers, and world state updates.
    This value is typically used by the TrinityCore framework to manage phase-based
    interactions within maps.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a reference to an integer representing the current multi-personal
    phase tracker value. This value can be used to identify or modify the phase tracking
    for the map, and may be zero or negative depending on the current phase state
    of the map.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int& phaseTracker = map->GetMultiPersonalPhaseTracker();\nint currentPhase\
      \ = phaseTracker;\n// Use currentPhase to determine if players are in same phase\n\
      if (currentPhase == 0) {\n    // No active phase tracking\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used internally by TrinityCore for managing phase-related
    events. It should be handled carefully as the value may change during gameplay,
    especially when players enter or exit different zones or instances.
  warnings: Care must be taken when modifying this value, as incorrect handling can
    lead to synchronization issues between players in shared environments. This method
    is not thread-safe and should only be accessed from within a single thread context.
