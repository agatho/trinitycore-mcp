documentation:
  brief: Initializes cooldown tracking for elemental shaman abilities.
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up internal cooldown tracking structures
    for all elemental shaman abilities. This method is typically called during character
    initialization or when switching to the elemental shaman specialization. It ensures
    that all relevant spells and abilities have their cooldown states properly initialized,
    preventing incorrect behavior during gameplay. The method does not take any parameters
    and performs no direct game state modifications beyond setting up internal tracking
    mechanisms.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'ElementalShamanRefactored shaman;

      shaman.InitializeCooldowns();

      // Cooldowns are now initialized for the elemental shaman'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization phase of
    an elemental shaman character. Repeated calls may result in undefined behavior
    or redundant initialization. The method does not interact with the game server
    directly but prepares internal data structures for cooldown management.
