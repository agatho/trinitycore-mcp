  signature: uint32 BotScheduler::GetRandomSessionDuration(const ActivityPattern &
    pattern) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a random session duration based on the provided activity
    pattern.
  description: The GetRandomSessionDuration method generates a pseudo-random session
    duration value by utilizing the specified ActivityPattern. This function is typically
    used in bot scheduling systems to determine how long a bot should remain active
    during a given session. The calculation takes into account the pattern's configured
    minimum and maximum values, applying a random distribution within those bounds.
    The method is designed to simulate natural user behavior patterns, ensuring that
    bot sessions vary in length for realism. It does not modify any internal state
    and is safe for concurrent access.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the calculated session duration in seconds.
    The returned value will always be within the range defined by the ActivityPattern's
    minimum and maximum values, inclusive.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ActivityPattern pattern;

      pattern.min = 300; // 5 minutes

      pattern.max = 1800; // 30 minutes

      uint32 duration = scheduler.GetRandomSessionDuration(pattern);

      // duration will be a random value between 300 and 1800 seconds'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on a pseudo-random number generator, so results may vary
    between runs unless seeded consistently. The implementation assumes that the ActivityPattern's
    min and max values are properly initialized with valid ranges.
