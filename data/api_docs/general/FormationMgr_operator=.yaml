documentation:
  brief: Moves ownership of a FormationMgr object to another FormationMgr object
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment operation on a FormationMgr
    object, transferring all resources and state from the source object to the target
    object. This is typically used when assigning one FormationMgr instance to another,
    allowing for efficient resource management by moving rather than copying internal
    data structures. The method is part of the standard C++ move semantics implementation
    and ensures that the source object is left in a valid but unspecified state after
    the operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the target FormationMgr object after the move assignment
    has been completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'FormationMgr manager1;

      FormationMgr manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Uses move constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Uses move assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Function Context
    code: "FormationMgr createManager() {\n    FormationMgr mgr;\n    // ... initialize\
      \ manager ...\n    return mgr; // Move semantics used for return\n}\n\nvoid\
      \ useManager() {\n    FormationMgr mgr1 = createManager(); // Move assignment\n\
      \    FormationMgr mgr2;\n    mgr2 = createManager(); // Move assignment\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically auto-generated by the compiler when a class implements
    move semantics. It's important to note that after move assignment, the source
    object should not be used in a meaningful way as its state becomes unspecified
    but valid. The FormationMgr class likely manages formation data for creatures
    or players in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework.
  warnings: After calling this operator, the source FormationMgr object should not
    be accessed or used, as it may contain invalid or undefined state. This is a fundamental
    rule of move semantics - the source object is left in a valid but unspecified
    state.
