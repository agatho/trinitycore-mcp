documentation:
  brief: Processes a batch of bot actions up to the specified maximum per frame
  description: The ProcessActions method executes a set of queued bot actions within
    the current game frame, limiting the number of actions processed based on the
    provided maxActionsPerFrame parameter. This method is typically called during
    the AI update cycle to handle bot decision-making and behavior execution. It ensures
    that bot processing does not consume excessive CPU resources by capping the number
    of actions executed per frame. The method returns the actual number of actions
    processed, which may be less than the maximum if fewer actions are queued or if
    processing limits are reached.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the actual number of bot actions that were successfully processed
    during this call. This value will be equal to or less than the maxActionsPerFrame
    parameter, depending on how many actions were queued and whether processing was
    completed within the frame limit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    // Process up to 10 bot actions per frame\n\
      \    uint32 processed = m_actionProcessor->ProcessActions(10);\n    if (processed\
      \ == 0)\n    {\n        // No actions were processed, possibly due to no queued\
      \ actions\n        return;\n    }\n    // Continue with other AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Action Limit Based on Frame Time
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    // Calculate dynamic limit based on frame\
      \ time to maintain performance\n    uint32 maxActions = std::min(50u, (uint32)(m_frameTime\
      \ * 100));\n    uint32 processed = m_actionProcessor->ProcessActions(maxActions);\n\
      \    // Log or track the number of actions processed\n    sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_AI,\
      \ \"Processed %u bot actions this frame\", processed);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from within the main game loop or AI
    update thread. It's important that the maxActionsPerFrame parameter is chosen
    carefully to balance responsiveness with performance. The method may return immediately
    if no actions are queued, and it's recommended to check the return value to determine
    if any processing occurred.
  warnings: Do not call this method from multiple threads simultaneously without proper
    synchronization. Excessive calls to this method without appropriate frame limiting
    can cause performance degradation. Be aware that some bot actions might fail or
    be skipped due to game state constraints, which is reflected in the returned count.
