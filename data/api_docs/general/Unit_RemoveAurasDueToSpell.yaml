    reqEffMask, int removeMode)
documentation:
  brief: Removes all aura effects caused by a specific spell from the unit.
  description: This method removes all aura applications that are caused by a specified
    spell on the target unit. It allows for precise control over which aura effects
    are removed based on caster GUID and required effect mask. The method is commonly
    used in spell handling logic to remove temporary effects or when a spell is cast
    with specific conditions. It supports removal of multiple aura effects simultaneously,
    making it useful for managing complex spell interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The ID of the spell whose aura effects are to be removed. This must
      match an existing spell in the game database.
  - name: casterGUID
    description: The GUID of the caster who applied the aura, or -1 if any caster
      is acceptable. This allows filtering of auras based on who applied them.
  - name: reqEffMask
    description: The required effect mask that determines which effects should be
      removed. If 0, all effects are removed; otherwise, only matching effects are
      removed.
  - name: removeMode
    description: The removal mode specifies how the aura should be removed. This can
      be used to control whether the aura is removed completely or partially.
  returns: null

  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with spell handling logic to
    ensure correct removal of aura effects. It may be called from various contexts
    including spell effect handlers, periodic tick handlers, or when a spell is cast
    on a target.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect removal of aura effects,
    potentially causing game balance issues or unexpected behavior in spell mechanics.
    Ensure that the spell ID and caster GUID are valid before calling this method.
