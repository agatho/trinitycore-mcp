  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: InitializeTurnInData
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::InitializeTurnInData(Player * bot, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes turn-in data for a quest with the specified quest ID for the
    given player bot.
  description: The InitializeTurnInData method prepares internal data structures required
    for handling quest turn-ins in the TrinityCore framework. It sets up necessary
    state information for a player bot to properly interact with a specific quest,
    including caching relevant quest data and preparing any required resources for
    quest completion processing. This method is typically invoked when a bot needs
    to initiate or validate a quest turn-in process. The method does not perform actual
    quest completion but rather initializes the data needed for such operations.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will be performing
      the quest turn-in. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest for which turn-in data is being
      initialized. Must correspond to a valid quest in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Turn-In Data Initialization
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Assume valid player instance

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      questTurnIn->InitializeTurnInData(bot, questId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before attempting to perform any quest turn-in
    operations. It is part of the internal quest handling system and may not be directly
    exposed in public APIs for general use.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided player object is valid and the quest ID exists
    in the database, otherwise behavior is undefined. This method does not validate
    these conditions internally.
