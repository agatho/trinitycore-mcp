documentation:
  brief: Checks if the threat response action is ready to be executed
  description: The IsReady method determines whether a ThreatResponseAction object
    is in a state where it can be safely executed. This typically involves checking
    if all prerequisites for the action have been met, such as sufficient mana, proper
    target conditions, or cooldown expiration. The method returns true when the action
    is ready for execution and false otherwise. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore AI system, this method helps control when NPC agents should respond
    to threat changes in combat situations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the threat response action is ready for execution, false
    otherwise. The action may be unready due to cooldowns, resource requirements not
    being met, or invalid target conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Context
    code: "if (threatAction.IsReady()) {\n    threatAction.Execute();\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle action not ready case\n    ai->SetNextAction(\"wait\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Logic
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override {\n        if (me->GetVictim() && threatAction.IsReady()) {\n   \
      \         threatAction.Execute();\n        } else {\n            // Continue\
      \ with other AI logic\n            DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n        }\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during AI update cycles, so performance
    should be considered. The implementation likely involves checking internal state
    flags and resource availability without heavy computations.
  warnings: Do not assume that an action being ready means it will succeed when executed
    - additional validation may still be required in the Execute() method. Also, calling
    IsReady() on a destroyed or invalid ThreatResponseAction object could lead to
    undefined behavior.
