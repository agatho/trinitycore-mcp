  signature: void TradeStatistics::TradeStatistics()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the TradeStatistics class for tracking player
    trading activity.
  description: The TradeStatistics constructor initializes a new instance of the TradeStatistics
    class, setting up internal data structures to track and record player trading
    behavior within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically called when
    a player object is created or when trade statistics need to be initialized for
    monitoring purposes. The constructor prepares the necessary memory allocations
    and default values required for maintaining accurate trade records, including
    transaction counts, gold exchanged, and item types traded. It ensures that all
    statistical tracking mechanisms are properly configured before any trading activity
    begins.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new TradeStatistics instance
    code: 'TradeStatistics* stats = new TradeStatistics();

      // The constructor automatically initializes all internal tracking mechanisms

      // for monitoring player trading behavior in the game world'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when player objects are instantiated. Developers should not need to manually call
    this constructor unless implementing custom trade tracking systems. The initialization
    process may involve memory allocation and setting up internal data structures
    that persist throughout a player's session.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly in most cases as it is intended
    for internal use by the TrinityCore framework. Manual instantiation could lead
    to improper initialization of tracking systems or memory leaks if not handled
    correctly with proper cleanup routines.
