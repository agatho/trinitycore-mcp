  class: World
  method: RemoveSession
  signature: bool World::RemoveSession(uint32 id)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a session from the world manager by its unique identifier
  description: The RemoveSession method removes a player session from the World's
    internal session management system using the provided session ID. This method
    is typically called when a player disconnects from the server or when a session
    needs to be explicitly terminated. The method performs cleanup operations on the
    session and ensures that all associated resources are properly released. It returns
    true if the session was successfully removed, or false if no session with the
    given ID exists. This operation is crucial for maintaining memory efficiency and
    preventing resource leaks in the game server.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier of the session to be removed. This corresponds
      to the session's ID which is typically assigned when the player connects to
      the server.
  returns: Returns true if the session with the specified ID was successfully found
    and removed, false if no session exists with that ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Session Removal
    code: "uint32 sessionId = 12345;\nif (sWorld->RemoveSession(sessionId)) {\n  \
      \  printf(\"Session %u successfully removed\\n\", sessionId);\n} else {\n  \
      \  printf(\"No session found with ID %u\\n\", sessionId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Session on Player Logout
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogout(Player* player) {\n    uint32 sessionId = player->GetSession()->GetId();\n\
      \    if (sWorld->RemoveSession(sessionId)) {\n        // Session successfully\
      \ removed\n        player->SetSession(nullptr);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the server's session management
    system. It's important to note that removing a session does not automatically
    destroy the associated Player object - that must be handled separately. The method
    performs thread-safe operations and can be safely called from any thread context.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent session ID will return
    false but will not cause any errors. Always verify that the session exists before
    attempting removal if you need to ensure success. Be cautious when removing sessions
    during active gameplay as it may lead to unexpected behavior if not handled properly.
