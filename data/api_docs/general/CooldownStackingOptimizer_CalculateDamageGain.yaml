    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the damage gain from cooldown stacking optimization for a given
    spell.
  description: The CalculateDamageGain method determines the additional damage output
    that can be achieved by optimizing the cooldown usage of a specific spell within
    the CooldownStackingOptimizer framework. This method evaluates the spell's current
    cooldown state, potential stacking effects, and damage multipliers to compute
    an optimized damage gain value. It is typically used in performance analysis or
    simulation scenarios where maximizing damage output under cooldown constraints
    is required. The calculation considers factors such as spell duration, cooldown
    reduction, and stacking mechanics relevant to the game's combat system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated damage gain from optimizing the
    cooldown stacking of the specified spell. This value typically indicates a percentage
    increase or absolute damage boost that can be achieved through optimal cooldown
    management.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float damageGain = optimizer.CalculateDamageGain(12345);

      // Returns the optimized damage gain for spell ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Damage Calculation Context
    code: 'uint32 spellId = 98765;

      float baseDamage = 1000.0f;

      float gain = optimizer.CalculateDamageGain(spellId);

      float totalDamage = baseDamage * (1.0f + gain);

      // Calculates total damage with cooldown stacking optimization applied'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the CooldownStackingOptimizer instance has been
    properly initialized with relevant spell data and cooldown information. The calculation
    may vary based on the current game state, player buffs, and other contextual factors
    that affect cooldown management.
  warnings: The returned damage gain value is dependent on internal spell configurations
    and cooldown states. Using this method without proper initialization of the optimizer
    may result in inaccurate calculations or undefined behavior.
