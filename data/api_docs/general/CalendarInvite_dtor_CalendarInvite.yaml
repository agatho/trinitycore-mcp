documentation:
  brief: Destroys a CalendarInvite object and releases its allocated resources.
  description: The destructor for the CalendarInvite class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources associated with the calendar
    invite instance. This method is automatically invoked when a CalendarInvite object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's World
    of Warcraft emulation, this class likely represents an invitation to a calendar
    event and may manage references to players, events, or other related data structures
    that need proper cleanup upon destruction. The destructor ensures that no memory
    leaks occur and that any internal state is properly reset.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of CalendarInvite object
    code: "void exampleFunction() {\n    CalendarInvite invite;\n    // ... use invite\
      \ ...\n    // invite is automatically destroyed here when going out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing memory
    through pointers. It is typically invoked by the C++ runtime during object lifecycle
    management. Developers working with calendar-related systems in TrinityCore should
    understand that this destructor handles cleanup of internal data structures related
    to calendar invites.
