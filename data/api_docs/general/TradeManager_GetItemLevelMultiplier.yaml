  method: GetItemLevelMultiplier
  signature: float TradeManager::GetItemLevelMultiplier(uint32 itemLevel) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the item level multiplier used in trade evaluations.
  description: The GetItemLevelMultiplier method computes a floating-point multiplier
    based on the provided item level, which is typically used in trade calculations
    within the TrinityCore framework. This multiplier affects how item values are
    assessed during trades, particularly in scenarios such as vendor pricing or auction
    house mechanics. The method likely implements a scaling algorithm that increases
    the multiplier with higher item levels to reflect increased item value. It is
    designed to be a const method, ensuring no state changes occur during execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float representing the calculated item level multiplier. The value typically
    increases as itemLevel increases, reflecting higher item quality or rarity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float multiplier = tradeManager.GetItemLevelMultiplier(80);

      // Returns a multiplier for an item at level 80'
    language: cpp
  - title: Trade Value Calculation
    code: 'uint32 baseValue = 1000;

      uint32 itemLevel = 120;

      float multiplier = tradeManager.GetItemLevelMultiplier(itemLevel);

      uint32 finalValue = static_cast<uint32>(baseValue * multiplier);

      // Calculates adjusted trade value based on item level'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger trade evaluation system and may be
    used in conjunction with other methods like GetItemValue or CalculateTradeAmount.
    The exact formula for the multiplier calculation is not specified but is probably
    based on a logarithmic or exponential scaling to simulate increasing value as
    item levels rise.
  warnings: Ensure that the itemLevel parameter is within valid game bounds; extremely
    high values may cause unexpected behavior or overflow in calculations. This method
    should only be called with valid item levels from the game's item database.
