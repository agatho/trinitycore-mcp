  class: CombatStateAnalyzer
  method: GetMainHealer
  signature: Player * CombatStateAnalyzer::GetMainHealer() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the primary healer player within the combat state
    analyzer's context.
  description: The GetMainHealer method identifies and returns the Player object that
    is considered the main healer in the current combat scenario. This determination
    is typically based on factors such as healing contribution, role assignment, or
    proximity to the group's primary targets. The method operates within the CombatStateAnalyzer
    class, which tracks and evaluates player behavior during combat encounters. It
    is commonly used in raid environments where identifying the designated healer
    is crucial for coordination and strategy. The returned Player pointer may be null
    if no valid healer is identified or if the combat state analyzer has not yet processed
    sufficient data to make a determination.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Player object representing the main healer, or nullptr
    if no main healer can be determined within the current combat context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Analysis
    code: "CombatStateAnalyzer analyzer;\nPlayer* mainHealer = analyzer.GetMainHealer();\n\
      if (mainHealer != nullptr)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Main healer: \" << mainHealer->GetName()\
      \ << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n    std::cout << \"No main healer identified.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on internal tracking of player actions and may not immediately
    reflect real-time changes in healer status. It is recommended to call this method
    after the combat state has been sufficiently updated to ensure accurate results.
  warnings: Ensure that the CombatStateAnalyzer instance is properly initialized and
    has processed relevant combat data before calling this method. Calling it too
    early may result in a nullptr return value even when healers are present.
