  class: Bag
  method: BuildCreateUpdateBlockForPlayer
  signature: void Bag::BuildCreateUpdateBlockForPlayer(int * data, int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Populates an update block with create data for the bag object.
  description: The BuildCreateUpdateBlockForPlayer method constructs and fills an
    update block containing the creation data for a Bag object, intended for transmission
    to a specific player's client. This method is part of the TrinityCore's object
    update system, which ensures that players receive accurate representations of
    game objects they interact with. It typically gets called during initial object
    visibility or when a player gains access to a bag. The method uses internal data
    structures and update masks to efficiently serialize the object's state into a
    format suitable for network transmission.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array that will be filled with the serialized
      update block data representing the bag's creation state.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer array that specifies the target player or entity
      for whom the update block is being constructed. Used internally to determine
      visibility and update flags.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Update Context
    code: "void SendBagUpdate(Player* player, Bag* bag)\n{\n    int data[256];\n \
      \   int target[256];\n    bag->BuildCreateUpdateBlockForPlayer(data, target);\n\
      \    // Send data to player's client\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the core update system and should not
    be called directly unless implementing custom object creation logic. The internal
    structure of 'data' and 'target' arrays depends on TrinityCore's update mask implementation,
    which may vary between versions.
  warnings: Incorrectly using or modifying the contents of 'data' or 'target' can
    lead to client-side display issues or synchronization problems. This method assumes
    that the player has proper access rights to view the bag object.
