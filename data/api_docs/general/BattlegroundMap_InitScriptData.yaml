  class: BattlegroundMap
  method: InitScriptData
  signature: void BattlegroundMap::InitScriptData()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes script data for the battleground map, setting up required game
    objects and configurations.
  description: The InitScriptData method is responsible for initializing all necessary
    script-related data structures and configurations for a battleground map. This
    includes loading and setting up game object templates, creature templates, and
    other scripting components that are specific to the battleground environment.
    The method ensures that all required scripts and data are properly initialized
    before the battleground becomes active. It typically runs during the map initialization
    phase and prepares the battleground for player engagement by ensuring all scripted
    elements are ready for use.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'BattlegroundMap* bgMap = new BattlegroundMap();

      bgMap->InitScriptData();

      // Script data is now initialized for the battleground map'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the map's initialization process.
    It's typically invoked automatically by the game engine when a battleground map
    is created and ready to be activated. The method may perform heavy operations
    related to loading script data, so it should not be called frequently during gameplay.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times on the same map instance may lead to
    undefined behavior or memory leaks. Ensure that InitScriptData is only invoked
    once per battleground map instance before any players enter the battleground.
