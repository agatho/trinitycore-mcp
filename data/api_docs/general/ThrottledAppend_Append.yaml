  class: ThrottledAppend
  method: Append
  signature: void ThrottledAppend::Append(WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify & param0)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Appends a channel notification packet to the throttled append buffer for
    delayed transmission.
  description: The Append method of the ThrottledAppend class adds a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet to an internal buffer, which is used to manage and throttle the rate at
    which channel-related notifications are sent to players. This mechanism helps
    prevent network flooding and ensures that clients receive channel updates in a
    controlled manner, respecting bandwidth and performance constraints. The method
    does not immediately send the packet; instead, it queues it for later processing
    based on the throttling logic implemented within the class.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A constant reference to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify object
      containing the channel notification data to be appended to the buffer.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Appending a Channel Notification
    code: 'ThrottledAppend throttledAppend;

      WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      // ... populate notifyPacket with data ...

      throttledAppend.Append(notifyPacket);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with a periodic update mechanism
    that flushes the buffered packets according to throttling rules. The internal
    buffer may be subject to size limits or timeouts depending on implementation details.
