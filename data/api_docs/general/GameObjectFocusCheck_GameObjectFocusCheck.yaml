  class: GameObjectFocusCheck
  method: GameObjectFocusCheck
  signature: void GameObjectFocusCheck::GameObjectFocusCheck(const int * caster, int
    focusId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a GameObjectFocusCheck instance with caster and focus ID parameters.
  description: The GameObjectFocusCheck constructor initializes an instance of the
    GameObjectFocusCheck class, setting up internal state based on the provided caster
    identifier and focus object ID. This class is typically used in TrinityCore's
    game logic to manage focus-related checks for game objects, particularly in spell
    or ability targeting mechanics. The method sets up the necessary data structures
    to perform validation or targeting operations against specific game objects. It
    does not perform any direct game object operations itself but prepares the instance
    for subsequent method calls that may involve focus checking.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the caster's identifier (typically
      a GUID). This parameter defines which entity is performing the focus check operation.
  - name: focusId
    description: Integer representing the ID of the focus object to be checked. This
      typically corresponds to a GameObject's entry ID or GUID used in targeting mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'GameObjectFocusCheck check(&casterGuid, focusEntryId);

      // Initializes a focus check for the specified caster and focus object'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Spell Targeting Context
    code: 'uint64 playerGuid = player->GetGUID();

      uint32 focusEntry = 12345;

      GameObjectFocusCheck focusCheck(&playerGuid, focusEntry);

      // Sets up focus checking for a spell targeting a specific game object'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any validation of the input parameters.
    The caster pointer should be valid and point to a valid GUID value. The focusId
    parameter is typically used to reference GameObject entries or instances within
    the TrinityCore database system.
  warnings: Ensure that the caster pointer is valid and points to an initialized GUID
    before passing it to this constructor. Passing null or invalid pointers may lead
    to undefined behavior during subsequent operations.
