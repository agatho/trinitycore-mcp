documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the research history object, resetting its modified
    state.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask of a ResearchHistory
    object, effectively marking all previously modified fields as clean. This is typically
    used after saving or synchronizing changes to ensure that subsequent modifications
    are properly tracked. The method does not take any parameters and has no return
    value. It is commonly called during data persistence operations to prevent redundant
    updates or to prepare the object for new modification tracking.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ResearchHistory* history = player->GetResearchHistory();

      history->ClearChangesMask();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after successfully persisting research data
    to prevent unnecessary re-sync operations. The changes mask is used internally
    by the TrinityCore framework to track which fields have been modified since last
    save.
