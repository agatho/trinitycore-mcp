  class: Player
  method: SetVersatilityBonus
  signature: void Player::SetVersatilityBonus(float value)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's versatility bonus to a specified float value.
  description: This method allows developers to directly set the versatility bonus
    value for a player character, which affects their damage output and healing effectiveness.
    The versatility bonus is a key stat that influences how much additional damage
    or healing a player receives based on their versatility rating. This method is
    typically used in custom scripts or game master commands to modify player stats
    during development or testing phases. It should be used carefully as it bypasses
    normal game mechanics and can affect balance if not properly implemented.
  parameters:
  - name: value
    description: The float value to set the versatility bonus to. This represents
      the amount of versatility rating that will be applied to the player's stats.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting versatility bonus to 100.0f
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetVersatilityBonus(100.0f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's stat system without going through
    normal game mechanics, which may cause issues if used in production code. It should
    only be used for testing or development purposes.
  warnings: Using this method can disrupt game balance and may cause unexpected behavior
    if not properly handled. It should not be used in regular gameplay scripts as
    it bypasses normal stat calculations.
