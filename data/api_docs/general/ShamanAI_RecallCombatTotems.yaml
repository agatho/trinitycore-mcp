  method: RecallCombatTotems
  signature: void ShamanAI::RecallCombatTotems()
documentation:
  brief: Recalls all combat totems currently active in the shaman's control.
  description: The RecallCombatTotems method is responsible for dismissing and recalling
    all combat totems that are currently active and under the control of a shaman
    AI. This function ensures that any summoned totems, such as those from spells
    like Totem of Wrath or other combat-related totems, are properly removed from
    the game world. It typically involves iterating through the shaman's totem list
    and invoking the appropriate removal or despawn logic for each totem. This method
    is commonly called during specific AI behaviors, such as when switching targets,
    entering combat, or when the shaman needs to reposition or reset its totem placement
    strategy.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in Shaman AI logic
    code: "void CustomShamanAI::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    // Recall all combat totems\
      \ before starting new combat\n    RecallCombatTotems();\n    // Proceed with\
      \ new totem placement or other combat logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core Shaman AI behavior and is expected to be
    called in contexts where totem management is required, such as during combat transitions
    or repositioning. The implementation likely involves checking for active totems
    and triggering their removal via the game's totem system.
