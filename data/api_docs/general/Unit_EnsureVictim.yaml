  method: EnsureVictim
  signature: Unit * Unit::EnsureVictim() const
documentation:
  brief: Ensures that the unit has a valid victim target by checking and setting the
    current target if none exists.
  description: The EnsureVictim method is used to verify that a Unit object has an
    active target (victim) in the game context. It checks whether the unit currently
    has a target set, and if not, it attempts to establish one based on the unit's
    behavior or state. This method is commonly used in AI-based systems where units
    need to maintain a valid target for combat actions or spell casting. The method
    typically ensures that the unit's current target is valid and active, preventing
    potential null pointer exceptions during combat operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Unit object that represents the current victim
    target. If no valid victim exists, it returns nullptr or may return the unit itself
    if it was already set as the victim.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* victim = unit->EnsureVictim();\nif (victim != nullptr)\n{\n    //\
      \ Proceed with combat actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other combat-related methods
    to ensure that units maintain valid targets during gameplay. It may involve checking
    the unit's current target state and setting a new one if none exists.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it can lead to unexpected
    behavior if not properly handled, especially in complex AI systems where multiple
    targets or states are involved. Avoid calling this method without proper context.
