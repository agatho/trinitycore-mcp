  signature: void GroupCombatTrigger::~GroupCombatTrigger()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a GroupCombatTrigger instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~GroupCombatTrigger destructor is responsible for cleaning up all
    memory and resources allocated to a GroupCombatTrigger object. This method ensures
    proper deallocation of internal data structures and prevents memory leaks when
    the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's
    AI system, this destructor may handle cleanup of combat-related state information,
    event handlers, or references to group members that were tracked during combat
    scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of GroupCombatTrigger
    code: 'GroupCombatTrigger* trigger = new GroupCombatTrigger();

      // ... use the trigger ...

      delete trigger; // This calls ~GroupCombatTrigger()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically invoked when a GroupCombatTrigger object
    is destroyed. Developers should not manually call this method unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. The destruction process may involve cleanup
    of internal event subscriptions or references to player/group data that could
    otherwise lead to dangling pointers if not properly handled.
