  class: QuestPickup
  method: GenerateQuestGiverRoute
  signature: int QuestPickup::GenerateQuestGiverRoute(Player * bot, const int & questGivers)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a quest giver route for the specified bot player based on available
    quest givers.
  description: The GenerateQuestGiverRoute method calculates and sets up an optimal
    path or sequence of quest givers for a given bot player within the World of Warcraft
    environment. This method is typically used in automated questing systems or AI-driven
    bots to determine the most efficient order in which to visit quest givers. It
    takes into account various factors such as proximity, quest requirements, and
    player level to construct a logical route. The method modifies internal state
    related to the bot's current questing path and returns an integer status code
    indicating success or failure of the operation.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will follow
      the generated quest giver route.
  - name: questGivers
    description: Reference to an integer value indicating how many quest givers should
      be included in the generated route.
  returns: 'Returns an integer status code: 0 for success, negative values for specific
    error conditions such as invalid input parameters or failure to generate a valid
    route.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: int result = questPickup->GenerateQuestGiverRoute(playerBot, 5);
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling Example
    code: "int status = questPickup->GenerateQuestGiverRoute(botPlayer, -1);\nif (status\
      \ < 0) {\n    // Handle error\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to generate quest\
      \ giver route\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player bot is already initialized and has access
    to a valid quest database. The generated route may be cached or updated dynamically
    depending on the implementation details of QuestPickup class. Ensure that the
    quest giver count does not exceed available quest givers in the current zone.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the bot player can
    lead to undefined behavior. Also, if the number of quest givers requested is zero
    or negative, it may result in an error condition.
