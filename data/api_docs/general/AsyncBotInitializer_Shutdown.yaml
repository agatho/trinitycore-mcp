documentation:
  brief: Stops and cleans up all asynchronous bot initialization processes
  description: The Shutdown method terminates all ongoing asynchronous bot initialization
    tasks and performs necessary cleanup operations. It ensures that no bot initialization
    threads are running and releases any allocated resources. This method is typically
    called during server shutdown or when disabling bot functionality to prevent memory
    leaks and ensure proper resource deallocation. The method is designed to be thread-safe
    and should only be called when the system is in a state where it's safe to terminate
    all active bot initialization processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: AsyncBotInitializer::instance()->Shutdown();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the server is in a stable state and
    no bot initialization processes are actively in progress. Calling this method
    while bots are being initialized may result in incomplete cleanup or resource
    leaks.
