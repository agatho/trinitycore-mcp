documentation:
  brief: Destroys a WorldSessionFilter object and releases its associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the WorldSessionFilter class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the lifetime of the filter object. This method ensures proper resource deallocation
    when a WorldSessionFilter instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    In the context of TrinityCore's WorldSession management, this destructor may handle
    cleanup of session-related data structures or filters that are applied to network
    traffic or player sessions. The destructor does not take any parameters and performs
    no return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of WorldSessionFilter
    code: "void exampleFunction() {\n    WorldSessionFilter filter;\n    // ... use\
      \ filter ...\n    // filter is automatically destroyed here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called when a WorldSessionFilter object goes
    out of scope or is deleted. It's important to ensure that no other objects hold
    references to the filter after its destruction to prevent dangling pointer issues.
    Since this is a destructor, it should not be called directly unless explicitly
    managing memory.
