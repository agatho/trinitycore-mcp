documentation:
  brief: Checks if the Monk AI has sufficient energy to perform an action
  description: The HasEnoughEnergy method evaluates whether the current Monk AI instance
    possesses enough energy resources to execute a specified ability or skill. This
    method is typically used within the AI decision-making process to determine if
    a monk should proceed with energy-intensive abilities such as Tiger Palm, Blackout
    Kick, or other combat moves. The check considers the monk's current energy level
    against the required amount for the action being evaluated. This method does not
    modify any state and is purely a predictive query for resource availability.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Monk AI has equal to or greater than the required energy
    amount, false otherwise. The method evaluates against the internal energy state
    of the AI instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Energy Check
    code: "if (monkAI->HasEnoughEnergy(25)) {\n    // Perform an ability that costs\
      \ 25 energy\n    DoTigerPalm();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ability Casting
    code: "if (monkAI->HasEnoughEnergy(40) && target->IsInFront(me)) {\n    // Cast\
      \ Spinning Crane Kick if enough energy and target is in front\n    DoSpinningCraneKick();\n\
      } else {\n    // Fallback to a lower-cost ability\n    DoJab();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal energy tracking system of the Monk AI.
    It should be called before attempting to use energy-consuming abilities to prevent
    invalid actions. The method is const, meaning it does not alter any member variables
    of the MonkAI instance.
  warnings: Ensure that the energy cost value passed to this method matches the actual
    energy requirement of the intended ability. Using incorrect values may lead to
    incorrect AI behavior or failed ability casts.
