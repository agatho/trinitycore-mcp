documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the bot level management system, cleaning up resources and stopping
    all active bot leveling operations.
  description: The Shutdown method terminates the bot level management system by performing
    necessary cleanup operations. It ensures that all active bot leveling processes
    are properly stopped, resources are released, and any pending tasks are handled
    gracefully. This method is typically called during server shutdown or when the
    bot system needs to be disabled temporarily. The method does not accept any parameters
    and performs no return operations, making it a simple but critical cleanup function
    for maintaining system stability.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: BotLevelManager::Shutdown();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the server is in a safe state to prevent
    data corruption or resource leaks. It's recommended to ensure all bots are properly
    logged out before invoking this function.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown while bots are actively leveling may result in incomplete
    leveling progress and potential data loss for those bots. Always verify that no
    bot operations are in progress before calling this method.
