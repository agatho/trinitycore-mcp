  method: RequiresCoordinatedInterrupts
  signature: bool MythicPlusInterruptScaling::RequiresCoordinatedInterrupts(uint8
    level)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specific mythic plus level requires coordinated interrupts
    for successful completion.
  description: The RequiresCoordinatedInterrupts method evaluates if a given mythic
    plus dungeon level demands that players coordinate their interrupt abilities to
    successfully defeat enemies or complete objectives. This is typically used in
    the context of difficulty scaling where certain levels introduce mechanics that
    require group coordination, such as interrupting specific boss abilities or managing
    timed events. The method likely checks against internal configuration data or
    dungeon-specific rules defined by Blizzard's design for mythic plus content.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified mythic plus level requires coordinated interrupts
    to complete successfully; otherwise returns false. A return value of true indicates
    that players must synchronize their interrupt usage, potentially involving specific
    timing or positioning requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Level 10 Requires Coordinated Interrupts
    code: "MythicPlusInterruptScaling scaling;\nbool result = scaling.RequiresCoordinatedInterrupts(10);\n\
      if (result)\n{\n    // Logic for handling coordinated interrupt requirement\n\
      \    printf(\"Level 10 requires coordinated interrupts.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal dungeon scaling configurations
    and may be used during dungeon generation or difficulty calculation phases. It's
    important to note that the behavior might vary depending on the specific dungeon
    type and current season's rules.
  warnings: Ensure that any logic relying on this method accounts for all possible
    mythic plus levels, as some levels might not have explicit interrupt coordination
    requirements but could be subject to future updates or expansions.
