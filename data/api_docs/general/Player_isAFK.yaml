  method: isAFK
  signature: bool Player::isAFK() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns whether the player is away from keyboard.
  description: The isAFK method checks if a player is currently marked as away from
    keyboard (AFK). This status is typically set when a player has been idle for an
    extended period or manually marked as AFK by the player. The method returns true
    if the player is in AFK state, false otherwise. In World of Warcraft, AFK status
    affects various game mechanics including automatic logout, quest tracking, and
    player interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is AFK, false otherwise. This indicates whether
    the player's AFK status has been set either manually or automatically due to inactivity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic AFK Check
    code: "if (player->isAFK()) {\n    // Do something\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other player status checks.
    The AFK state can be set by the player manually or automatically based on inactivity.
    Performance-wise, this method is lightweight and does not involve any database
    queries.
  warnings: Be aware that AFK status may be automatically cleared when a player interacts
    with NPCs or performs actions, so checking this status should be done carefully
    in contexts where continuous AFK status is required.
