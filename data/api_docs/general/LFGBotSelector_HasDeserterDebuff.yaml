  class: LFGBotSelector
  method: HasDeserterDebuff
  signature: bool LFGBotSelector::HasDeserterDebuff(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the specified bot player has the deserter debuff applied.
  description: The HasDeserterDebuff method determines whether a given player bot
    currently possesses the deserter debuff, which is applied when a player leaves
    a group or instance prematurely. This debuff typically prevents the player from
    joining certain groups or instances for a specified duration. The method evaluates
    the player's current state and returns true if the debuff is active, false otherwise.
    This functionality is commonly used in LFG (Looking for Group) systems to prevent
    players with recent disconnections from rejoining groups immediately.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose deserter
      debuff status needs to be checked. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the specified bot player has the deserter debuff applied;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in LFG context
    code: "if (lfgBotSelector->HasDeserterDebuff(playerBot)) {\n    // Handle case\
      \ where bot cannot join group due to deserter debuff\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"lfg\"\
      , \"Player {} has deserter debuff and cannot join group.\", playerBot->GetName());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with LFG queue logic
    code: "void LFGQueue::AddBotToQueue(LFGBotSelector* selector, Player* bot) {\n\
      \    if (!selector->HasDeserterDebuff(bot)) {\n        // Proceed with adding\
      \ bot to queue\n        AddToLFGQueue(bot);\n    } else {\n        // Skip bot\
      \ or delay processing\n        LOG_DEBUG(\"lfg\", \"Skipping bot {} due to active\
      \ deserter debuff.\", bot->GetName());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal game state tracking of player debuffs. It
    is important that the Player object passed is valid and represents an actual in-game
    character. The method may be called frequently during LFG operations, so performance
    should be considered for high-frequency usage.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is not null before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. The debuff status can change dynamically, so results
    from this method may become invalid immediately after the call if other game systems
    modify the player state.
