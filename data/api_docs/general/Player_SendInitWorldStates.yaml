api:
  class: Player
  method: SendInitWorldStates
  signature: void Player::SendInitWorldStates(uint32 zoneId, uint32 areaId)
documentation:
  brief: SendInitWorldStates initiates the world state UI for a player, displaying
    zone and area information.
  description: This method sends the initial world state UI to the player, showing
    zone and area information relevant to their current location. It is used to display
    the current world state information in the game client, including zone and area
    IDs that are relevant to the player's position. The method typically triggers
    when a player enters a new zone or area, and it ensures that the client displays
    the appropriate world state information for the current context. This method is
    part of the World of Warcraft client-server communication protocol and is essential
    for proper game state management.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The zone ID representing the current zone where the player is located.
      This value determines which zone information is displayed in the UI.
  - name: areaId
    description: The area ID representing the current area where the player is located.
      This value determines which area information is displayed in the UI.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SendInitWorldStates(1234, 5678);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 zoneId = player->GetZoneId();

      uint32 areaId = player->GetAreaId();

      player->SendInitWorldStates(zoneId, areaId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during player initialization or when entering
    a new zone/area. It's important to note that the method does not directly send
    any data to the client; instead, it triggers the client to display world state
    information based on the provided zone and area IDs. Performance considerations
    include ensuring that zoneId and areaId are valid values before calling this method.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player is in a valid zone/area
    context. Calling it outside of proper game context may result in incorrect UI
    display or client errors. Also, this method does not handle any error conditions
    for invalid zoneId or areaId values.
