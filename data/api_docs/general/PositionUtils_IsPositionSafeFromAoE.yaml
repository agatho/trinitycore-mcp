  class: PositionUtils
  method: IsPositionSafeFromAoE
  signature: bool PositionUtils::IsPositionSafeFromAoE(const int & pos, const int
    & zones)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given position is safe from area-of-effect spells or
    abilities within specified zones.
  description: The IsPositionSafeFromAoE method evaluates if a particular position
    in the game world is free from harmful area-of-effect (AoE) effects. It takes
    into account the player's current location and checks against defined zones to
    determine if any AoE threats are present. This function is typically used for
    pathfinding, spell targeting, or positioning decisions where avoiding dangerous
    areas is critical. The method considers various factors such as proximity to enemy
    AoE spells, environmental hazards, and player safety zones.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position to evaluate for safety from AoE effects. This parameter
      likely represents coordinates or a reference to a specific location in the game
      world.
  - name: zones
    description: Defines the zones or areas to check for potential AoE threats. This
      could be a bitmask, list of zone IDs, or spatial boundaries used to scope the
      safety evaluation.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is considered safe from area-of-effect
    spells or abilities within the given zones; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: bool isSafe = PositionUtils::IsPositionSafeFromAoE(playerPosition, currentZones);
    language: cpp
  - title: Safety Check Before Movement
    code: "if (PositionUtils::IsPositionSafeFromAoE(targetLocation, playerZones))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with movement\n    MoveToTarget(targetLocation);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Find alternative path or wait\n    FindSafePath();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs complex spatial calculations and may involve
    checking multiple AoE sources, their ranges, and overlap with the target position.
    Performance can be impacted by the number of zones and AoE effects active in the
    area.
  warnings: The method assumes valid inputs for both 'pos' and 'zones'. Invalid or
    uninitialized parameters could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect safety
    assessments.
