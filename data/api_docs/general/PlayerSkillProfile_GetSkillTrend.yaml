  class: PlayerSkillProfile
  method: GetSkillTrend
  signature: float PlayerSkillProfile::GetSkillTrend() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the trend value of a player's skill progression over
    time.
  description: The GetSkillTrend method computes the rate of change for a player's
    skill level, typically used to determine how quickly a player is advancing in
    a particular skill. This value can be utilized for various game mechanics such
    as determining skill bonuses, progression tracking, or calculating skill-based
    rewards. The method returns a floating-point value that represents the trend;
    positive values indicate increasing skill levels, while negative values suggest
    decreasing progress. This function does not modify any internal state and is purely
    informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the skill trend. Positive values indicate upward
    progression, negative values indicate downward progression, and zero typically
    means no change in skill level over the observed period.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float trend = playerSkillProfile->GetSkillTrend();\nif (trend > 0.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Player is improving their skills\n    printf(\"Player skill trend:\
      \ %.2f (Improving)\\n\", trend);\n}\nelse if (trend < 0.0f)\n{\n    // Player's\
      \ skill is declining\n    printf(\"Player skill trend: %.2f (Declining)\\n\"\
      , trend);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No change in skill level\n    printf(\"Player\
      \ skill trend: %.2f (No Change)\\n\", trend);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely based on recent skill updates or changes recorded within
    the player's profile. It may internally use timestamps or a history of skill modifications
    to compute the trend. The accuracy of the returned value depends on how frequently
    skill data is updated in the profile.
  warnings: Ensure that the PlayerSkillProfile object is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as accessing an uninitialized or corrupted profile could
    lead to unpredictable results. The returned value should not be used directly
    for critical game logic without validation.
