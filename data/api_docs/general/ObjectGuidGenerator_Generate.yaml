  class: ObjectGuidGenerator
  method: Generate
  signature: ObjectGuid::LowType ObjectGuidGenerator::Generate()
documentation:
  brief: Generates and returns a unique low-type identifier for an ObjectGuid within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The Generate method of the ObjectGuidGenerator class produces a unique
    32-bit low-type identifier that is used as part of a full ObjectGuid. This identifier
    is typically used to distinguish individual game objects, players, creatures,
    or items within the World of Warcraft emulation environment. The generated value
    is guaranteed to be unique within the context of the current server instance and
    is managed by an internal counter or generator mechanism. It's commonly used when
    creating new entities that need a globally unique identifier across the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a 32-bit unsigned integer (ObjectGuid::LowType) representing the
    unique low portion of an ObjectGuid. This value is guaranteed to be unique among
    generated identifiers for the lifetime of the server instance, and it forms part
    of a larger 64-bit ObjectGuid when combined with a high-type identifier.
  examples:
  - title: Generating a Unique Identifier
    code: 'ObjectGuidGenerator guidGen;

      ObjectGuid::LowType lowGuid = guidGen.Generate();

      // lowGuid now contains a unique identifier for use in creating new game objects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically thread-safe when used with proper synchronization
    mechanisms. The generated identifiers are sequential and monotonically increasing,
    which can be useful for debugging or tracking object creation order.
