  class: InteractionData
  method: IsInteractingWith
  signature: bool InteractionData::IsInteractingWith(int target, PlayerInteractionType
    type) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player is currently interacting with a specified target of a
    given interaction type.
  description: The IsInteractingWith method determines whether the player associated
    with this InteractionData instance is currently engaged in an interaction with
    a specific target entity using a particular interaction type. This method is typically
    used within the context of player interactions such as gossip options, quest acceptance,
    item usage, or other interactive game mechanics in TrinityCore. It evaluates internal
    state tracking to return a boolean result indicating the presence or absence of
    an active interaction. The method does not modify any state but rather provides
    read-only access to interaction status.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The identifier (GUID) of the target entity with which the player
      might be interacting.
  - name: type
    description: The PlayerInteractionType enum value specifying the type of interaction
      being checked (e.g., gossip, quest, item use).
  returns: True if the player is currently interacting with the specified target using
    the given interaction type; otherwise false.
  examples:
  - title: Check for Gossip Interaction
    code: "if (interactionData.IsInteractingWith(npcGuid, PlayerInteractionType::GOSSIP))\
      \ {\n    // Player is currently talking to an NPC via gossip\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Verify Quest Acceptance State
    code: "if (interactionData.IsInteractingWith(questId, PlayerInteractionType::QUEST_ACCEPT))\
      \ {\n    // Player is in the process of accepting a quest\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of active interactions and should
    only be called when interaction state is expected to be valid. It's commonly used
    in conjunction with event handlers or during game logic flow where interaction
    status must be verified before proceeding.
  warnings: Ensure that the target GUID and PlayerInteractionType values are valid
    before calling this method, as invalid parameters may lead to unexpected behavior
    or incorrect results. This method does not perform validation on input parameters.
