  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: OptimizeZoneQuests
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::OptimizeZoneQuests(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes quest data for a player's current zone by filtering and organizing
    active quests.
  description: The OptimizeZoneQuests method processes and organizes quest data specific
    to a player's current zone, ensuring that only relevant and active quests are
    considered for further processing. This optimization helps reduce computational
    overhead when handling quest-related logic, such as quest gating, objective tracking,
    or reward distribution. The method likely updates internal quest caches or filters
    out inactive or irrelevant quests based on the player's progress, level, and zone
    constraints. It is typically invoked during zone transitions or periodic quest
    refreshes to maintain efficient quest state management.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which quest optimization is performed.
      This parameter specifies the target player whose quest data will be optimized.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Quest System
    code: "void MyQuestHandler::HandlePlayerZoneChange(Player* player)\n{\n    DynamicQuestSystem::OptimizeZoneQuests(player);\n\
      \    // Proceed with quest-related logic after optimization\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger dynamic quest management system that
    adapts quest availability based on player state. It may interact with the database
    or internal quest cache to ensure efficient retrieval and processing of zone-specific
    quests.
