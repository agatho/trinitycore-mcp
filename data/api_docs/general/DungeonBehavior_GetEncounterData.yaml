  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: GetEncounterData
  signature: DungeonEncounter DungeonBehavior::GetEncounterData(uint32 encounterId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves encounter data for a specified dungeon encounter ID.
  description: The GetEncounterData method retrieves detailed information about a
    specific dungeon encounter based on its unique identifier. This method is typically
    used within the context of dungeon behavior logic to access encounter-specific
    properties such as health, state, or other relevant metadata. The returned DungeonEncounter
    object contains all necessary data to manage and interact with the encounter during
    gameplay. This method assumes that the encounter ID corresponds to a valid encounter
    within the current dungeon instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A DungeonEncounter object containing the data for the specified encounter
    ID. If the encounter ID is invalid or not found, the returned object may be in
    an uninitialized or invalid state, which should be checked by the caller before
    use.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "DungeonEncounter encounter = dungeonBehavior->GetEncounterData(12345);\n\
      if (encounter.IsValid()) {\n    // Process encounter data\n    uint32 health\
      \ = encounter.GetHealth();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active dungeon instances where encounters
    are valid. The returned DungeonEncounter object must be validated before accessing
    its members to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid encounter ID may result in a corrupted
    or uninitialized DungeonEncounter object. Always verify the validity of the returned
    object before using it.
