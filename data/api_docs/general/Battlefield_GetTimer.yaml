documentation:
  brief: Returns the current timer value of the battlefield in seconds
  description: The GetTimer method retrieves the remaining time in seconds for the
    current battlefield event. This timer typically represents the duration of a battleground
    or battlefield match, such as the time remaining until capture points are reset
    or the battle concludes. The returned value is usually updated regularly by the
    game's internal systems and reflects the active state of the battlefield. This
    method is commonly used to display countdown timers to players and to determine
    when battlefield events should end or transition to a new phase.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of seconds remaining in the current
    battlefield timer. Returns 0 when the timer has expired or when no active battlefield
    event is running.
  examples:
  - title: Display Remaining Time
    code: "void ShowBattlefieldTime(Battlefield* bf)\n{\n    int timeLeft = bf->GetTimer();\n\
      \    if (timeLeft > 0)\n        printf(\"Time remaining: %d seconds\\n\", timeLeft);\n\
      \    else\n        printf(\"Battlefield timer expired\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Timer for Event End
    code: "void UpdateBattlefield(Battlefield* bf)\n{\n    int timer = bf->GetTimer();\n\
      \    if (timer <= 0)\n    {\n        // Handle battlefield end logic\n     \
      \   bf->EndBattlefield();\n    }\n    else if (timer <= 60)\n    {\n       \
      \ // Send warning message to players\n        bf->SendWarning(\"Battlefield\
      \ ending in %d seconds!\\n\", timer);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The timer value is typically managed by the battlefield's internal state
    machine and may be updated at regular intervals. This method does not modify any
    battlefield state; it only retrieves the current timer value. The returned value
    represents real-time seconds, not game time units.
  warnings: Be aware that calling this method on a non-active battlefield instance
    may return unexpected values or zero. Always validate that the battlefield is
    currently active before relying on the timer value for critical gameplay logic.
