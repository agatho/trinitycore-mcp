  method: GetNearbyEnemies
  signature: uint32 ArcaneMageRefactored::GetNearbyEnemies(float range) const
documentation:
  brief: Counts the number of nearby enemy units within a specified range.
  description: The GetNearbyEnemies method calculates and returns the total count
    of hostile units (enemies) that are currently within the defined range around
    the arcane mage. This method is typically used in AI decision-making processes
    to determine combat engagement or spell targeting. The range parameter defines
    the maximum distance from the mage's position at which enemies will be considered.
    This method does not differentiate between enemy types, but rather counts all
    hostile units present in the specified area.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of nearby enemy units found
    within the specified range. A return value of zero indicates no enemies are present
    within range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 enemyCount = arcaneMage->GetNearbyEnemies(10.0f);\nif (enemyCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Cast a spell targeting nearby enemies\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spell Casting
    code: "uint32 nearbyEnemies = arcaneMage->GetNearbyEnemies(8.0f);\nif (nearbyEnemies\
      \ >= 3)\n{\n    // Cast area-of-effect spell\n    arcaneMage->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_BLIZZARD);\n}\nelse if (nearbyEnemies == 1)\n{\n    // Cast single-target\
      \ spell\n    arcaneMage->CastSpell(target, SPELL_FROSTBOLT);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a radius-based search using the TrinityCore's AI system
    and may be optimized for performance by caching results or limiting updates. The
    range parameter is typically measured in yards. This method should only be called
    on valid instances of ArcaneMageRefactored that are properly initialized within
    the game world.
  warnings: This method returns a count of enemies, not their positions or other details.
    It may not account for line-of-sight restrictions or other environmental factors.
    Calling this method during combat processing might introduce performance overhead
    if called too frequently without caching results.
