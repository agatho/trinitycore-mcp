  method: HandlePlayerResurrects
  signature: void OutdoorPvP::HandlePlayerResurrects(Player * player, int zone)
documentation:
  brief: Handles player resurrection events within outdoor PvP zones.
  description: The HandlePlayerResurrects method processes resurrection events for
    players within outdoor PvP zones. This method is typically invoked when a player
    dies and is about to be resurrected, allowing the OutdoorPvP system to manage
    zone-specific resurrection mechanics such as teleportation to appropriate locations,
    updating player states, or triggering zone-based rewards. The method ensures that
    resurrection behavior aligns with the outdoor PvP zone's rules and objectives.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object that is being resurrected. This parameter
      represents the specific player instance involved in the resurrection event.
  - name: zone
    description: Integer identifier representing the zone where the resurrection occurs.
      This value corresponds to the zone ID and helps determine zone-specific resurrection
      behavior or location.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a custom OutdoorPvP implementation
    code: "void MyOutdoorPvP::HandlePlayerResurrects(Player* player, int zone)\n{\n\
      \    // Custom logic for handling resurrection\n    if (player && zone == 1234)\
      \ // Example zone ID\n    {\n        player->TeleportTo(0, 100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f);\
      \ // Teleport to specific location\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the OutdoorPvP system's event handling and should
    be called during player death or resurrection events. It is typically invoked
    by the core game engine when a player dies in an outdoor PvP zone, but can also
    be manually triggered for custom behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before dereferencing it to avoid
    crashes. The zone parameter must correspond to a valid outdoor PvP zone ID; otherwise,
    unexpected behavior may occur.
