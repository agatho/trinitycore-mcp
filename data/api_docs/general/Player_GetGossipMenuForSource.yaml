  class: Player
  method: GetGossipMenuForSource
  signature: uint32 Player::GetGossipMenuForSource(const int * source) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the gossip menu identifier for a specific source.
  description: The GetGossipMenuForSource method retrieves the unique gossip menu
    identifier associated with a particular source, such as a quest or NPC, within
    the World of Warcraft client. This method is commonly used in conjunction with
    other gossip-related functions to determine which menu should be displayed when
    interacting with a specific source. It plays a crucial role in managing player
    interactions with non-player characters and quests, ensuring proper dialogue handling
    during quest progression and NPC conversations.
  parameters:
  - name: source
    description: A pointer to an integer representing the source identifier (e.g.,
      quest ID or NPC ID) for which the gossip menu is being retrieved.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value that represents the unique gossip menu identifier
    associated with the specified source. This identifier typically corresponds to
    a specific menu in the game's gossip system, allowing players to access different
    dialogue options based on their interaction with various sources.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 menuId = player->GetGossipMenuForSource(&questId);\nif (menuId !=\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with displaying the appropriate gossip menu\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other gossip-related functions
    like GetGossipMenuForSource or AddGossipMenuOption to manage player interactions.
    Performance considerations are minimal since this is a simple lookup operation,
    but it should be used carefully during active interaction handling to avoid conflicts
    with existing gossip menus.
  warnings: This method may return 0 if no valid gossip menu exists for the specified
    source, which could lead to incorrect behavior or missing dialogue options if
    not handled properly. Always verify that the source parameter is valid before
    calling this method.
