  signature: void Unit::NearTeleportTo(float x, float y, float z, float orientation,
    bool casting)
documentation:
  brief: Teleports a unit to a nearby location with specified coordinates and orientation
  description: The NearTeleportTo method performs a local teleportation of a Unit
    object to a specific location defined by X, Y, Z coordinates and orientation.
    This method is commonly used for moving units within the same zone or instance
    without triggering full map transitions. It allows precise control over position
    and facing direction while maintaining unit's current state. The method supports
    optional casting behavior which can influence how the teleportation is handled
    in terms of animation or effect execution.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: X coordinate of destination location
  - name: y
    description: Y coordinate of destination location
  - name: z
    description: Z coordinate of destination location
  - name: orientation
    description: Facing direction (angle) for the unit to orient towards
  - name: casting
    description: Whether to perform casting animation during teleportation, defaults
      to false
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = GetUnit();

      unit->NearTeleportTo(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f, 4.7f, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: With casting animation
    code: 'Unit* unit = GetUnit();

      unit->NearTeleportTo(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f, 4.7f, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include handling of coordinate systems and orientation
    calculations. Performance considerations involve avoiding frequent teleportations
    in quick succession which may cause client-side issues. Thread safety is not an
    issue as this method operates within the context of a single unit object.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method in combat situations as it can
    potentially disrupt gameplay mechanics if used improperly. Avoid using near teleportation
    during critical moments like spell casting or movement to prevent unexpected behavior.
