  brief: Handles movement failure events within the kiting manager system
  description: The HandleMovementFailure method is responsible for processing and
    responding to movement-related failures that occur during kiting behavior in World
    of Warcraft. This method typically gets invoked when a player's movement is interrupted
    or fails due to various conditions such as terrain obstacles, collision detection,
    or server-side validation issues. It manages the cleanup and state restoration
    necessary to maintain proper kiting behavior after a failure event occurs. The
    method ensures that the kiting manager properly resets its internal state and
    may trigger appropriate notifications or actions to the player or game system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in kiting logic
    code: "void SomeKitingLogic::OnMovementFailure()\n{\n    kitingManager.HandleMovementFailure();\n\
      \    // Additional logic to resume or adjust kiting\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the kiting manager's movement
    handling system. It may be invoked during combat situations where player movement
    is critical for maintaining kiting patterns. The implementation likely involves
    resetting internal timers, clearing movement flags, and potentially notifying
    the client of movement state changes.
  warnings: Care should be taken when calling this method directly as it may have
    side effects on the kiting manager's internal state. Ensure that movement failures
    are properly detected before invoking this handler to avoid unnecessary state
    resets.
