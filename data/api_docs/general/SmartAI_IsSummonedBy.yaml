api:
  class: SmartAI
  method: IsSummonedBy
  signature: void SmartAI::IsSummonedBy(WorldObject * summoner)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the summoner object for the SmartAI instance, typically used in creature
    or game object AI scripts to track who summoned this unit.
  description: The IsSummonedBy method is used within the SmartAI framework to record
    and store a reference to the WorldObject that summoned the current AI-controlled
    entity. This method is commonly invoked during the initialization or activation
    of summoned creatures, such as pets, guardians, or temporary summons. It allows
    the AI system to maintain awareness of the summoner for purposes like targeting
    logic, quest progression, or scripted behavior. The method does not perform any
    direct action on the summoner but rather establishes a relationship between the
    summoned unit and its summoner within the AI context. This is particularly useful
    in scenarios where summoned units need to behave differently based on their summoner's
    status or actions.
  parameters:
  - name: summoner
    description: A pointer to the WorldObject that summoned this AI-controlled entity.
      This can be a Player, Creature, or GameObject depending on the summoning context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in SmartAI Script
    code: "void OnSummoned(WorldObject* summoner)\n{\n    IsSummonedBy(summoner);\n\
      \    // AI logic can now reference the summoner\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Summoner Reference in AI Behavior
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) override\n{\n    if (summoner)\n    {\n    \
      \    // Perform actions based on summoner's state\n        if (summoner->IsInCombat())\n\
      \            DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the SmartAI system when a creature
    or game object is summoned. Developers should be aware that the summoner reference
    may be null if the entity was not summoned by another object, or if the summoner
    has been destroyed. The method itself does not perform any validation of the summoner
    object and assumes it's a valid pointer.
  warnings: Ensure that the summoner parameter is a valid WorldObject pointer before
    calling this method, as passing a null pointer may lead to undefined behavior
    in AI scripts. Also note that if the summoner is destroyed or removed from the
    world, references to it should be handled carefully to prevent dangling pointers.
