  signature: PathResult PathCache::GetPath(const int & src, const int & dest, const
    int * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and retrieves a navigation path between two points in the game
    world for use by AI or movement systems.
  description: The GetPath method computes a navigational path from a source point
    to a destination point within the TrinityCore game world. It is typically used
    by AI-controlled creatures or NPCs to determine how to move from one location
    to another while avoiding obstacles and following valid terrain paths. The method
    utilizes internal pathfinding algorithms and caches results for performance. The
    owner parameter allows associating the path with a specific entity, which can
    be useful for path invalidation or ownership tracking. This method does not directly
    modify game state but provides data that can be used to control movement behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: src
    description: The starting point identifier (typically a waypoint index or position
      reference) from which the path calculation begins.
  - name: dest
    description: The destination point identifier (typically a waypoint index or position
      reference) to which the path is calculated.
  - name: owner
    description: Optional pointer to an entity that owns this path. Used for tracking
      and invalidation purposes, such as when the owner moves or becomes invalid.
  returns: Returns a PathResult object containing the computed path data. The result
    includes information about whether the path was successfully calculated, along
    with the actual waypoints forming the path. A failed path calculation may return
    an empty or invalid path structure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Retrieval
    code: "PathResult result = pathCache.GetPath(100, 200, nullptr);\nif (result.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Process the calculated path\n    for (auto& point : result.GetWaypoints())\
      \ {\n        printf(\"Waypoint: (%f, %f, %f)\\n\", point.x, point.y, point.z);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Path Retrieval with Owner Tracking
    code: "Unit* npc = ...; // Some NPC\nPathResult result = pathCache.GetPath(100,\
      \ 200, &npc->GetGUID());\nif (result.IsValid()) {\n    // Use the path for movement\
      \ logic\n    npc->SetPath(result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on precomputed navigation meshes and cached path data.
    Performance can be affected by complex terrain or large numbers of concurrent
    path requests. The PathResult object returned should be checked for validity before
    use, as pathfinding may fail due to unreachable destinations or invalid input
    parameters.
  warnings: Do not assume that a valid PathResult will always contain usable waypoints;
    always validate the result before attempting to use it. Passing an invalid owner
    pointer can lead to undefined behavior if the system attempts to invalidate or
    update paths associated with that entity.
