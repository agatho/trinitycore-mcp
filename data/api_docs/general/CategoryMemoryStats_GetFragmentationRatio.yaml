  signature: double CategoryMemoryStats::GetFragmentationRatio() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the memory fragmentation ratio for the category.
  description: The GetFragmentationRatio method computes the ratio of fragmented memory
    within a specific memory category. This value represents how much of the allocated
    memory is not contiguous, which can impact performance and memory efficiency.
    The fragmentation ratio is typically expressed as a decimal between 0 and 1, where
    0 indicates no fragmentation and 1 indicates maximum fragmentation. In the context
    of TrinityCore, this method is used to monitor memory health and optimize allocation
    strategies for various subsystems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A double value representing the memory fragmentation ratio. A value of
    0.0 indicates no fragmentation, while a value approaching 1.0 indicates high fragmentation.
    The returned value is always between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CategoryMemoryStats stats;

      // Assume stats has been populated with memory data

      const double fragmentation = stats.GetFragmentationRatio();

      printf("Fragmentation Ratio: %.2f\n", fragmentation);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Memory Health
    code: "CategoryMemoryStats categoryStats;\nconst double ratio = categoryStats.GetFragmentationRatio();\n\
      if (ratio > 0.5) {\n    printf(\"Warning: High memory fragmentation detected\
      \ (%.2f)\\n\", ratio);\n} else if (ratio > 0.2) {\n    printf(\"Notice: Moderate\
      \ memory fragmentation (%.2f)\\n\", ratio);\n} else {\n    printf(\"Memory fragmentation\
      \ is low (%.2f)\\n\", ratio);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a calculation based on internal memory tracking data
    and may involve overhead during execution. It's recommended to cache the result
    if the value is accessed frequently. The fragmentation ratio is calculated using
    internal memory allocation metadata maintained by the TrinityCore memory management
    system.
  warnings: The returned fragmentation ratio should not be used as an absolute measure
    of performance impact, as different memory categories may have varying tolerance
    levels for fragmentation. Additionally, this method assumes that memory tracking
    information is up-to-date and accurate.
