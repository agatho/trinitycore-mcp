documentation:
  brief: Removes inactive bot entries from the spawner system
  description: The CleanupInactiveBots method iterates through all registered bots
    within the BotSpawnerOptimized system and removes those that have been inactive
    for a specified duration. This process helps maintain optimal performance by preventing
    the accumulation of stale bot data in memory. The method typically checks bot
    activity status, such as last interaction time or player connection state, to
    determine if a bot should be removed from active management. It is designed to
    run periodically as part of routine system maintenance to ensure efficient resource
    utilization.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotSpawnerOptimized spawner;

      spawner.CleanupInactiveBots();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during periodic maintenance tasks or system
    cleanup routines. It may temporarily lock internal data structures to ensure thread
    safety during the removal process. The exact inactivity threshold and removal
    criteria are configurable within the BotSpawnerOptimized class settings.
  warnings: Calling this method while bots are actively being spawned or managed might
    lead to inconsistent state if not properly synchronized with other system components.
    Ensure that no bot operations are in progress before invoking this cleanup routine.
