  signature: int ItemTemplate::GetHolidayID() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the holiday ID associated with the item template.
  description: The GetHolidayID method returns the holiday identifier linked to this
    item template. In World of Warcraft, certain items are tied to specific holidays
    or events, such as Halloween or Winter Veil. This method allows developers to
    query whether an item is associated with a particular holiday event. The returned
    value corresponds to the ID found in the `holiday` table within the game's database.
    If no holiday is associated with the item, this method typically returns 0 or
    a negative value indicating no holiday binding.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the holiday ID associated with the item template.
    A return value of 0 or negative values usually indicates that the item is not
    bound to any holiday event.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an item is holiday-bound
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nif (itemTemplate->GetHolidayID()\
      \ > 0) {\n    printf(\"This item is associated with holiday ID: %d\\n\", itemTemplate->GetHolidayID());\n\
      } else {\n    printf(\"This item is not bound to any holiday.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal data structures within the ItemTemplate class
    that are populated during server startup from the database. It's safe for use
    in game logic and event handling routines.
