  class: BotProfiler
  method: DetectPerformanceAnomalies
  signature: void BotProfiler::DetectPerformanceAnomalies(ProfilingSession * session)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes profiling session data to identify potential performance bottlenecks
    or anomalies in bot behavior.
  description: The DetectPerformanceAnomalies method evaluates the provided ProfilingSession
    data to detect unusual patterns or performance issues within bot operations. It
    examines various metrics such as execution times, resource usage, and behavioral
    deviations from expected norms. This method is typically used during post-processing
    of profiling sessions to highlight areas where bots may be performing inefficiently
    or unexpectedly. The analysis can help developers identify problematic scripts,
    optimize bot behavior, or detect potential bugs in the AI logic. The method does
    not modify the session data but rather processes it to generate anomaly reports
    that can be accessed through other methods.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to a ProfilingSession object containing collected performance
      data for analysis. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of performance anomaly detection
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      ProfilingSession* session = new ProfilingSession();

      // ... populate session with profiling data ...

      profiler.DetectPerformanceAnomalies(session);

      // Anomaly reports are now available for inspection'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ProfilingSession has been properly populated
    with valid data before calling. The detection algorithm may use statistical thresholds
    or machine learning models to determine what constitutes an anomaly. Performance
    impact of this method depends on the amount of profiling data and complexity of
    analysis performed.
  warnings: Ensure that the session parameter is not null before calling this method,
    as it will likely cause a crash. The method does not perform any automatic reporting;
    results must be retrieved through other means after calling this function.
