  brief: Collects treasures from the current behavior context
  description: The CollectTreasures method is responsible for gathering and processing
    treasure items within the advanced behavior system. This method typically iterates
    through available loot sources, evaluates item criteria, and applies appropriate
    collection logic based on the current AI state and player conditions. It may interact
    with inventory management systems to ensure proper item distribution and update
    quest progress where applicable. The method operates within the broader context
    of behavior-driven NPC interactions and is commonly invoked during quest completion
    or event triggers.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Treasure Collection
    code: 'AdvancedBehaviorManager behaviorManager;

      behaviorManager.CollectTreasures();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system during behavior
    execution and may trigger additional events such as quest updates or loot distribution
    notifications. The implementation assumes that treasure sources are properly initialized
    and accessible within the current behavior context.
