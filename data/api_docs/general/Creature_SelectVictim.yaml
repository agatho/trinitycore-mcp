documentation:
  brief: Selects the most dangerous target from the creature's threat list.
  description: The SelectVictim method determines and returns the target with the
    highest threat level from a creature's current threat list. This method is commonly
    used in AI scripts to identify which player or creature should be targeted next
    for attack. The returned value represents the GUID of the selected victim, allowing
    the creature to properly engage with the chosen target.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the GUID of the selected victim, or NULL if no valid target exists
    in the threat list.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Creature* creature = GetCreature();\nint* victim = creature->SelectVictim();\n\
      if (victim != NULL)\n{\n    // Proceed with attack\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other AI-related functions
    and may be called multiple times per tick. It's important to note that the method
    returns a pointer to the GUID, not an integer value directly.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it can lead to unexpected behavior
    if the creature's threat list is empty or improperly maintained. Always check
    for NULL before proceeding with actions.
