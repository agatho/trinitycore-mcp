    const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two TrinityCorePriority objects for equality.
  description: The operator== method performs a comparison between this TrinityCorePriority
    instance and another TrinityCorePriority object to determine if they are equal.
    This comparison is typically based on the underlying priority values or identifiers
    stored within each object. In the context of TrinityCore, priority levels are
    often used to manage execution order for various game systems such as AI behaviors,
    event handling, or object updates. The method returns true if both objects represent
    the same priority level, and false otherwise. This operator is commonly used in
    sorting algorithms, container comparisons, and conditional logic where priority-based
    decisions are required.
  parameters:
  - name: other
    description: A const reference to another TrinityCorePriority object that this
      instance will be compared against for equality.
  returns: Returns true if the priority values of both objects are identical; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Equality Check
    code: 'TrinityCorePriority prio1(5);

      TrinityCorePriority prio2(5);

      bool result = (prio1 == prio2); // Returns true

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Conditional Logic
    code: "TrinityCorePriority currentPrio(10);\nTrinityCorePriority targetPrio(10);\n\
      if (currentPrio == targetPrio) {\n    // Execute priority-based logic\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Priorities match!\" << std::endl;\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: The implementation likely compares internal fields such as numeric priority
    values or unique identifiers. This operator should be consistent with the operator!=
    for proper logical behavior in containers and comparisons.
