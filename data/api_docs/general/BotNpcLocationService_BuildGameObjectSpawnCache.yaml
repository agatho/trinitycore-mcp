  class: BotNpcLocationService
  method: BuildGameObjectSpawnCache
  signature: void BotNpcLocationService::BuildGameObjectSpawnCache()
documentation:
  brief: Populates the internal cache with all game object spawn locations for bot
    NPC navigation.
  description: The BuildGameObjectSpawnCache method initializes and fills an internal
    data structure with the spawn coordinates and associated metadata of all game
    objects within the active map. This cache is essential for bot NPCs to accurately
    navigate the world, avoid collisions, and interact with environment objects. The
    method typically executes during server initialization or map loading phases to
    ensure that bot behavior remains consistent and responsive. It processes all currently
    loaded game objects in the map and stores their positions, types, and other relevant
    properties needed for pathfinding and spatial awareness.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotNpcLocationService locationService;

      locationService.BuildGameObjectSpawnCache();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the bot system during map
    loading or server startup. It may cause a temporary performance hit when executed
    on large maps with many game objects due to the intensive processing required
    to gather and store all spawn data.
