  class: BotAI
  method: UpdatePerformanceMetrics
  signature: void BotAI::UpdatePerformanceMetrics(uint32 updateTimeMs)
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal performance metrics for the bot AI with the provided update
    time in milliseconds.
  description: The UpdatePerformanceMetrics method is responsible for collecting and
    recording timing data related to the bot AI's update cycle. It accepts a single
    parameter representing the elapsed time in milliseconds since the last update,
    which is used to calculate average execution times, detect performance bottlenecks,
    and maintain statistics for profiling purposes. This method is typically called
    during the AI update loop to monitor how long various bot behaviors take to execute,
    helping developers identify inefficient code paths or resource-heavy operations
    within the bot's decision-making process. The collected metrics can be used for
    debugging, optimization, and ensuring that bots do not cause excessive CPU load
    on the server.
  parameters:
  - name: updateTimeMs
    description: The time in milliseconds taken to complete the last AI update cycle.
      This value is used to track performance trends and identify potential slowdowns
      in bot behavior execution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void BotAI::Update()\n{\n    // ... bot logic ...\n    uint32 startTime\
      \ = getMSTime();\n    // ... perform AI actions ...\n    uint32 updateTime =\
      \ getMSTime() - startTime;\n    UpdatePerformanceMetrics(updateTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently during the bot's update cycle.
    It maintains rolling averages of execution times and may store historical data
    for performance analysis. The implementation likely uses atomic operations or
    locks to ensure thread safety when updating shared metrics across multiple threads.
  warnings: Calling this method with incorrect timing values (e.g., negative numbers
    or extremely large values) could skew the performance statistics. Ensure that
    the updateTimeMs parameter accurately reflects the actual time spent in the AI
    update cycle for meaningful metric collection.
