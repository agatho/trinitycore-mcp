documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the remaining money balance for a guild member based
    on their contribution and guild funds.
  description: This method computes the monetary balance that remains for a specified
    guild member, typically used to determine how much a member can spend or withdraw
    from the guild's treasury. It takes into account the member's current contributions,
    the guild's overall financial status, and possibly other game mechanics such as
    weekly loot distribution limits or guild bank usage restrictions. The returned
    value represents the available funds allocated specifically to this member for
    spending within the guild context.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int64 value representing the remaining money balance available for the
    specified guild member. A negative value may indicate an overdraft or error condition,
    while zero means no funds are currently available. Positive values represent the
    actual amount of money the member can utilize from the guild resources.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve a Guild Member's Remaining Money
    code: "Guild* guild = ...; // Assume valid guild pointer\nMember member = guild->GetMember(\"\
      PlayerName\");\nint64 remainingMoney = guild->_GetMemberRemainingMoney(member);\n\
      if (remainingMoney > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Member has \" << remainingMoney\
      \ << \" copper available.\\n\";\n}\nelse\n{\n    std::cout << \"Member has no\
      \ funds or is in debt.\\n\";\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild finance tracking systems,
    including guild bank transactions, member contributions, and possibly time-based
    resets for spending limits. It may be called frequently during guild operations
    such as loot distribution or bank withdrawals.
  warnings: Ensure that the member parameter is valid and exists within the guild
    before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior. The returned value should
    not be directly used for monetary transactions without validation, especially
    if negative balances are possible.
