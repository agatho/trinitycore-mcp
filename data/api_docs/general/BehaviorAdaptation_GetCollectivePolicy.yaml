  class: BehaviorAdaptation
  method: GetCollectivePolicy
  signature: int BehaviorAdaptation::GetCollectivePolicy(const int & state)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the collective policy value associated with a given state for behavior
    adaptation.
  description: The GetCollectivePolicy method retrieves the collective policy identifier
    or value that corresponds to a specified state within the BehaviorAdaptation system.
    This method is typically used in AI-driven behavior systems where different states
    trigger specific collective policies that dictate how a group of entities should
    behave. The returned integer represents a policy code or index that can be used
    to determine appropriate actions or responses based on the current behavioral
    context.
  parameters:
  - name: state
    description: An integer representing the current behavioral state for which the
      collective policy is requested. Valid values are typically defined by the behavior
      system and may represent different stages, conditions, or contexts within the
      AI decision-making process.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the collective policy associated
    with the provided state. The specific meaning of this integer depends on the implementation
    but generally corresponds to a policy identifier, action code, or behavioral directive
    that should be applied when the system is in the specified state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int currentPolicy = behaviorAdaptation.GetCollectivePolicy(3);\n// Returns\
      \ the collective policy for state 3\nif (currentPolicy == 1) {\n    // Execute\
      \ defensive behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Behavior State Machine
    code: "enum BehaviorState {\n    STATE_IDLE = 0,\n    STATE_COMBAT = 1,\n    STATE_FLEE\
      \ = 2\n};\n\nint policy = behaviorAdaptation.GetCollectivePolicy(STATE_COMBAT);\n\
      switch (policy) {\n    case 1: // Aggressive stance\n        break;\n    case\
      \ 2: // Defensive stance\n        break;\n    default:\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger behavior adaptation framework that
    dynamically adjusts group behaviors based on environmental or internal states.
    The state parameter should be validated against known valid values to prevent
    undefined behavior. Implementation may involve lookups in policy tables or decision
    trees.
  warnings: Ensure the state parameter is within expected bounds, as invalid states
    could lead to unexpected return values or system instability. This method may
    not be thread-safe if used concurrently without proper synchronization mechanisms.
