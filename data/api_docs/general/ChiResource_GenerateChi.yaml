  signature: void ChiResource::GenerateChi(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates chi resources for the player character.
  description: The GenerateChi method is responsible for increasing the chi resource
    amount of a player character within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically
    corresponds to game mechanics where players accumulate chi through various actions
    such as performing certain abilities, taking damage, or completing specific quests.
    The method accepts a uint32 parameter representing the amount of chi to be added
    to the current resource pool. It is commonly used in conjunction with player class-specific
    systems like Monk's chi management system.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of chi resources to generate and add to the player's
      current chi pool. Must be a positive integer value representing the amount of
      chi to be added.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chi Generation
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      ChiResource* chiResource = player->GetChiResource();

      chiResource->GenerateChi(5); // Generate 5 units of chi'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Chi Generation Based on Ability Usage
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nif (player->HasAura(SPELL_MONK_CHI_BURST)) {\n \
      \   ChiResource* chiResource = player->GetChiResource();\n    chiResource->GenerateChi(3);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal chi tracking variables and may trigger
    UI updates or event notifications. It should be called within the context of a
    valid player session to ensure proper resource management.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the player object is valid
    can lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Ensure that the ChiResource instance
    exists before invoking this method.
