  brief: Loads quest data required for the quest hub system.
  description: This method initializes and loads all necessary quest data from the
    database that is used by the quest hub functionality. It retrieves information
    about quests, their relationships, prerequisites, and associated rewards to support
    the quest hub's operation within the game world. The method typically executes
    during server startup or when the quest hub system is initialized, ensuring that
    all relevant quest data is available for processing and display to players.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'QuestHubDatabase database;

      database.LoadQuestDataForHubs();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during system initialization to avoid
    redundant database queries. It may block execution until all data is loaded, so
    it's recommended to call it during server startup rather than runtime.
