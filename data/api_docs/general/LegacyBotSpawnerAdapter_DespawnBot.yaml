  class: LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter
  method: DespawnBot
  signature: void LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter::DespawnBot(int guid, bool forced)
documentation:
  brief: Despawns a bot with the specified GUID from the game world.
  description: The DespawnBot method removes a bot entity from the game world using
    its unique identifier (GUID). This function is typically used in legacy bot systems
    to cleanly remove inactive or terminated bots. The method may optionally force
    the despawn operation even if normal conditions would prevent it. The bot's associated
    data structures are cleaned up, and any references to the bot are removed from
    active game systems. This ensures that resources are properly freed and prevents
    memory leaks or dangling references in the server's bot management system.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot to be despawned. This value
      must correspond to an existing bot in the system.
  - name: forced
    description: If true, forces the bot to be despawned regardless of its current
      state or normal conditions. If false, the bot is only despawned under normal
      circumstances.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Despawn Usage
    code: 'LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter adapter;

      adapter.DespawnBot(12345, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Forced Despawn
    code: 'LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter adapter;

      adapter.DespawnBot(67890, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GUID provided corresponds to a valid bot entity.
    It is recommended to verify the existence of the bot before calling this method
    to avoid potential errors or undefined behavior.
