  brief: Updates the player's corruption values and related stats
  description: The UpdateCorruption method is responsible for recalculating and applying
    any changes to a player's corruption state. This includes updating corruption-based
    stats, modifying player attributes, and ensuring that all corruption-related effects
    are properly synchronized with the player's current state. The method typically
    gets invoked when corruption levels change, items are equipped/removed, or when
    corruption-based abilities are activated. It handles internal consistency checks
    and ensures that the player's visual and gameplay representations accurately reflect
    their current corruption status.

    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateCorruption();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core system when corruption-related
    events occur. Developers should not normally need to call this directly unless
    implementing custom corruption mechanics or debugging corruption states.
