  class: Group
  method: _setMembersGroup
  signature: bool Group::_setMembersGroup(int guid, int group)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the group ID for a specified member in the group.
  description: The _setMembersGroup method assigns a specific group ID to a player
    member within a group. This internal method is typically used by the Group system
    to manage member assignments during group creation, member addition, or group
    reorganization. The method operates on the internal data structures of the group
    and updates the member's group affiliation. It is not intended for direct external
    use but rather serves as part of the internal group management logic.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player member whose group assignment
      is to be changed.
  - name: group
    description: The new group ID to assign to the specified member. A value of 0
      typically indicates the player is not in any group.
  returns: Returns true if the member's group assignment was successfully updated,
    false otherwise. The method may return false if the specified GUID does not correspond
    to a valid group member.
  examples:
  - title: Assigning a Player to a New Group
    code: "Group* group = ...; // Assume group is already initialized\nuint32 playerGuid\
      \ = 12345;\nuint32 newGroupId = 67890;\nbool success = group->_setMembersGroup(playerGuid,\
      \ newGroupId);\nif (success) {\n    // Player successfully assigned to new group\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is an internal method and should not be called directly from outside
    the Group class. It modifies internal state and may have side effects on group
    synchronization. The method assumes that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid
    member of the group.
  warnings: Direct usage of this method can lead to inconsistent group state if not
    properly coordinated with other group management operations. It should only be
    used in specific scenarios where internal consistency is guaranteed by the calling
    code.
