  method: GetKicksLeft
  signature: uint8 LfgGroupData::GetKicksLeft() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of kicks remaining for the group before being automatically
    removed from LFG.
  description: The GetKicksLeft method retrieves the count of how many times a group
    can be kicked from a Looking for Group (LFG) queue before it is automatically
    removed. This mechanism prevents groups from repeatedly joining and leaving queues
    without serious intent to participate. The value typically starts at a predefined
    limit (e.g., 3 kicks) and decreases with each kick event. Once the count reaches
    zero, the group is removed from the LFG system entirely. This method is used internally
    by the LFG system to enforce queue discipline and maintain fair play.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the number of remaining kicks allowed for this
    group. A value of 0 indicates that no more kicks are permitted, and the group
    will be removed from the LFG queue upon the next kick attempt.
  examples:
  - title: Check kicks left before attempting to kick a player
    code: "uint8 kicksLeft = groupData->GetKicksLeft();\nif (kicksLeft > 0)\n{\n \
      \   // Proceed with kicking logic\n    groupData->KickPlayer(playerGuid);\n\
      \    // The kick count is decremented automatically by the system\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Group cannot be kicked anymore, handle accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal LFG group management system and should
    not be called directly for user-facing interactions. The kick count is managed
    automatically by the LFG system upon each kick operation.
  warnings: Do not modify the kick count manually; doing so may result in inconsistent
    LFG behavior or unexpected removal of groups from queues.
