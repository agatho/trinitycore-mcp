  class: FlightMasterManager
  method: FindNearestFlightMasterToPosition
  signature: uint32 FlightMasterManager::FindNearestFlightMasterToPosition(float targetX,
    float targetY, float targetZ, uint32 mapId) const
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the unique identifier of the nearest flight master to a
    given position on a specific map.
  description: The FindNearestFlightMasterToPosition method searches for the closest
    flight master (NPC that provides flight paths) to the specified coordinates within
    the given map. It performs spatial calculations to determine proximity and returns
    the GUID of the nearest flight master. This method is commonly used in game logic
    to provide players with nearby flight point options or to assist in pathfinding
    for NPC movement. The method requires valid coordinate values and a valid map
    identifier to function correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: targetX
    description: The X coordinate of the target position in world space.
  - name: targetY
    description: The Y coordinate of the target position in world space.
  - name: targetZ
    description: The Z coordinate of the target position in world space.
  - name: mapId
    description: The unique identifier of the map where the search should be performed.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the GUID (Global Unique Identifier)
    of the nearest flight master NPC. If no flight master is found within the search
    area, it returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: uint32 flightMasterGUID = flightMasterManager->FindNearestFlightMasterToPosition(100.0f,
      200.0f, 50.0f, 0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Error Handling
    code: "uint32 guid = flightMasterManager->FindNearestFlightMasterToPosition(playerX,\
      \ playerY, playerZ, playerMapId);\nif (guid != 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with flight\
      \ master interaction\n    // Example: Show flight paths to player\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // No flight master found nearby\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses spatial indexing or distance calculations internally
    for performance. It assumes that flight masters are properly registered in the
    game world and have valid position data. The search may be limited to a certain
    radius depending on implementation.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided coordinates are valid world coordinates and that
    the mapId corresponds to an active map in the game world. Passing invalid or out-of-bounds
    coordinates may lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect results.
