  method: PredictReactionTime
  signature: float PlayerProfile::PredictReactionTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Predicts the reaction time of the player based on their profile data and
    game state.
  description: The PredictReactionTime method estimates the time it takes for a player
    to respond to in-game events or stimuli. This prediction is typically used for
    AI behavior, combat timing, or performance optimization within the TrinityCore
    framework. The method analyzes various player characteristics such as latency,
    input responsiveness, and historical reaction patterns to compute an estimated
    reaction time in seconds. It does not require any parameters and returns a floating-point
    value representing this predicted time. The implementation may consider factors
    like network conditions, client settings, and player activity history.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the predicted reaction time in seconds. This
    value typically ranges from 0.1 to 2.0 seconds depending on player profile characteristics
    and game state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float reactionTime = playerProfile->PredictReactionTime();

      printf("Predicted reaction time: %.2f seconds\n", reactionTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Reaction Time for AI Decision Making
    code: "PlayerProfile* profile = player->GetPlayerProfile();\nfloat reactionTime\
      \ = profile->PredictReactionTime();\n// Adjust AI behavior based on predicted\
      \ reaction time\nif (reactionTime > 1.0f) {\n    // Player has slower reactions,\
      \ adjust difficulty accordingly\n    ai->SetDifficultyLevel(DIFFICULTY_HARD);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely cached or computed periodically to avoid performance
    overhead during frequent calls. The accuracy of the prediction may vary based
    on the completeness and recency of player profile data. It's recommended to cache
    the result if used multiple times within a short timeframe.
  warnings: The predicted reaction time should not be used as a definitive measure
    for critical game mechanics that require precise timing. The method may return
    inconsistent results under varying network conditions or when player data is incomplete.
