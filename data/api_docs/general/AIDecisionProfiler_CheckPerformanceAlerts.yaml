  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::CheckPerformanceAlerts()
documentation:
  brief: Checks for performance alerts in AI decision-making processes and logs warnings
    if thresholds are exceeded.
  description: The CheckPerformanceAlerts method evaluates the performance of AI decision-making
    within the TrinityCore framework. It monitors key metrics such as execution time,
    resource usage, or decision frequency to detect potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies
    in AI behavior. When performance thresholds are breached, this method logs appropriate
    warnings to aid developers in identifying and resolving performance issues. This
    method is typically invoked during AI update cycles or at regular intervals to
    maintain system health and responsiveness. The functionality is crucial for maintaining
    optimal game performance, especially in scenarios with high AI activity such as
    large-scale battles or complex NPC interactions.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void AIUpdate()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    m_aiDecisionProfiler.CheckPerformanceAlerts();\n\
      \    // ... continue with AI updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and non-blocking. It should not
    significantly impact the performance of the AI update cycle. The actual threshold
    values for triggering alerts are configurable through TrinityCore's configuration
    system.
