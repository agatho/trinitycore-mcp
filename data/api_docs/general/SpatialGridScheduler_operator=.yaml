documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one SpatialGridScheduler object to another, performing
    a deep copy of all internal grid data and scheduling information.
  description: The operator= method implements the assignment operator for the SpatialGridScheduler
    class. This method performs a deep copy of all internal grid data structures and
    scheduling information from the source SpatialGridScheduler object to the target
    object. It ensures that both objects maintain independent copies of their data
    while preserving the complete state of the spatial grid scheduler. The operation
    is typically used when reassigning one scheduler instance to another, such as
    in container assignments or when updating a scheduler with new configuration data.
    This method handles memory management internally and properly manages any dynamically
    allocated resources within the scheduler's internal structures.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source SpatialGridScheduler object whose contents will be copied
      to this instance
  returns: A reference to the current SpatialGridScheduler object (this) after the
    assignment has been completed, enabling chained assignment operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment
    code: 'SpatialGridScheduler scheduler1;

      SpatialGridScheduler scheduler2;

      // ... initialize scheduler1 with data

      scheduler2 = scheduler1; // Assigns all contents from scheduler1 to scheduler2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment
    code: 'SpatialGridScheduler sched1, sched2, sched3;

      // ... initialize sched1 with data

      sched3 = sched2 = sched1; // Chained assignment of multiple schedulers'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a deep copy operation, meaning that all internal data
    structures are duplicated rather than shared. The implementation should handle
    self-assignment correctly (when param0 is the same object as *this). Memory management
    is handled internally by the class, but developers should be aware of potential
    performance implications when dealing with large spatial grid configurations.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning very large SpatialGridScheduler objects as
    this operation may involve significant memory allocation and copying. Ensure that
    both objects are properly initialized before assignment to avoid undefined behavior.
    Self-assignment must be handled correctly in custom implementations, though the
    standard operator= typically handles this automatically.
