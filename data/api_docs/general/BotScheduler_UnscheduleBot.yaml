  class: BotScheduler
  method: UnscheduleBot
  signature: void BotScheduler::UnscheduleBot(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a bot from the scheduling queue by its unique identifier.
  description: The UnscheduleBot method removes a specific bot from the internal scheduling
    system using its unique global identifier (GUID). This function is typically used
    when a bot needs to be stopped or deactivated before its scheduled execution time.
    The method ensures that the bot will no longer be processed by the scheduler and
    removes it from any pending tasks. It's important to note that this operation
    does not destroy the bot object itself, but simply removes it from active scheduling.
    The GUID parameter should correspond to a valid bot that is currently scheduled
    for execution.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique global identifier (GUID) of the bot to be unscheduled.
      This must be a valid GUID that corresponds to an existing bot in the system's
      scheduling queue.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of UnscheduleBot
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler;

      uint32 botGuid = 12345;

      scheduler.UnscheduleBot(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Unscheduling multiple bots
    code: "BotScheduler scheduler;\nstd::vector<uint32> botGuids = {1001, 1002, 1003};\n\
      for (uint32 guid : botGuids) {\n    scheduler.UnscheduleBot(guid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the internal scheduling queue and does not affect
    the actual bot object's lifecycle. The GUID parameter must be valid and correspond
    to a bot that is currently scheduled, otherwise the operation may have no effect
    or could potentially cause undefined behavior if not properly validated.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in
    undefined behavior. Always ensure that the bot exists in the scheduler before
    attempting to unschedule it. This function should be used carefully in multi-threaded
    environments where concurrent access to the scheduler might occur.
