  method: SetDataFlagAccount
  signature: void Player::SetDataFlagAccount(uint32 dataFlagId, bool on)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a data flag for the account associated with the player.
  description: This method allows setting or unsetting a specific data flag for the
    account linked to the player. The data flag is typically used to track various
    account-specific settings or states within the game system, such as achievements,
    quest completion flags, or other account-wide data. It's commonly used in conjunction
    with the GetDataFlagAccount method to manage account-level data. This method operates
    on a uint32 value representing the data flag ID and a boolean indicating whether
    to set or unset that flag.
  parameters:
  - name: dataFlagId
    description: The identifier of the data flag to be set or unset. This is typically
      a numeric value representing a specific account-level setting or state within
      the game system.
  - name: 'on'
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to set (true) or unset (false)
      the specified data flag. When true, the flag is set; when false, it's cleared.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a data flag
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetDataFlagAccount(1001, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Unsetting a data flag
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetDataFlagAccount(1001, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the account-level data management system and should
    be used carefully as it affects account-wide settings. The implementation likely
    involves updating internal flags within the player's account data structure.
