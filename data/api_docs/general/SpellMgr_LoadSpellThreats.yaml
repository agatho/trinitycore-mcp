  method: LoadSpellThreats
  signature: void SpellMgr::LoadSpellThreats()
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes spell threat data from database entries for use in
    combat threat calculations.
  description: The LoadSpellThreats method populates internal data structures with
    threat values associated with spells from the database. This method is typically
    called during server startup or reload operations to ensure that all spell threat
    configurations are properly loaded and available for use during combat. It reads
    threat information from the 'spell_threat' table in the database, which defines
    how much threat each spell generates when cast. The loaded data is used by the
    threat system to determine aggro generation and mob targeting behavior in World
    of Warcraft-style encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: SpellMgr::Instance()->LoadSpellThreats();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the database connection is established
    and the 'spell_threat' table has been properly populated. The method performs
    no locking internally, so it's recommended to call this during server initialization
    or in a synchronized context to avoid race conditions.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate entries in internal threat data structures. Ensure that
    the database contains valid spell IDs and threat values before invoking this method.
