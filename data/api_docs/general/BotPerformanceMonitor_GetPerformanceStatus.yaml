  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: GetPerformanceStatus
  signature: std::string BotPerformanceMonitor::GetPerformanceStatus() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a formatted string containing current performance statistics for
    bot operations.
  description: The GetPerformanceStatus method returns a human-readable string that
    summarizes the current performance metrics of bot activities within the TrinityCore
    environment. This includes information such as CPU usage, memory consumption,
    active bot count, and processing latency. The returned string is typically used
    for monitoring purposes, debugging, or displaying status information in-game or
    through administrative tools. The method does not modify any internal state and
    is safe to call from any thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing formatted performance statistics including bot
    count, CPU usage, memory usage, and processing times. The format is designed for
    readability and may include timestamps or other contextual data depending on implementation
    details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      std::string status = monitor.GetPerformanceStatus();

      printf("Bot Performance: %s\n", status.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Admin Command
    code: "void HandleBotStatusCommand(ChatHandler* handler)\n{\n    BotPerformanceMonitor\
      \ monitor;\n    std::string status = monitor.GetPerformanceStatus();\n    handler->PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Current Bot Performance:\\n%s\", status.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method aggregates data from multiple subsystems and may include timing
    measurements that could introduce minor overhead. It is recommended to call this
    method sparingly in performance-critical sections of code. The exact format of
    the returned string may vary between different versions or configurations of TrinityCore.
