  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::CheckAchievementProgress(uint32 achievementId)
documentation:
  brief: Checks and updates the progress of a specified achievement for the player
  description: The CheckAchievementProgress method evaluates whether a player has
    met the criteria required to earn a specific achievement. It is typically invoked
    by the behavior manager when certain in-game events occur, such as killing a mob
    or completing a quest. This method internally verifies if the player's current
    progress satisfies the achievement requirements and triggers the appropriate updates
    or notifications if the criteria are met. The method does not directly award the
    achievement but ensures that progress tracking is accurate and up-to-date within
    the game state.
  parameters:
  - name: achievementId
    description: The unique identifier of the achievement to check progress for. This
      ID corresponds to a specific achievement defined in the game's database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Check Achievement Progress for Player
    code: "void CheckAchievementProgress(uint32 achievementId)\n{\n    // Example\
      \ usage within a behavior manager context\n    if (Player* player = GetPlayer())\n\
      \    {\n        // Simulate checking progress for an achievement with ID 12345\n\
      \        sAdvancedBehaviorManager->CheckAchievementProgress(12345);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the behavior manager's internal logic and should not
    be called directly from external modules unless necessary. It is designed to integrate
    with other game systems like quest tracking, combat events, or player actions.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without proper context may lead to incorrect
    achievement progression or inconsistent player data. Ensure that the achievement
    ID passed is valid and corresponds to an existing achievement in the database.
