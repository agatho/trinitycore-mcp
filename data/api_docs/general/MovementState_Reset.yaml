  class: MovementState
  method: Reset
  signature: void MovementState::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the movement state to its default initial conditions.
  description: The Reset method initializes or reinitializes the MovementState object
    to its default values, clearing any previously set movement data or flags. This
    method is typically used when a unit's movement needs to be completely restarted
    or when transitioning between different movement states in the game engine. It
    ensures that all internal movement parameters are reset to their baseline values,
    effectively 'cleaning' the state before new movement logic is applied.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'MovementState state;

      state.Reset(); // Resets movement state to default

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset Before Applying New Movement
    code: 'MovementState state;

      // ... some movement logic ...

      state.Reset();

      // Now apply new movement configuration

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before applying any new movement behavior to
    ensure clean state initialization. It's commonly used in conjunction with movement
    update loops or when handling unit state transitions.
