documentation:
  brief: Validates the bot level distribution configuration for correctness and consistency.
  description: The ValidateConfig method checks whether the current bot level distribution
    settings are valid and consistent within the TrinityCore framework. It ensures
    that all configured levels, probabilities, and distribution ranges adhere to expected
    constraints and do not contain conflicting or out-of-bounds values. This method
    is typically called during initialization or configuration updates to prevent
    runtime errors caused by malformed data. The validation includes checking for
    proper level ranges, non-negative probability values, and that the sum of probabilities
    across all levels is within acceptable bounds.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the configuration passes all validation checks, indicating
    that the bot level distribution settings are valid and can be safely used. Returns
    false if any validation rule is violated, signaling that the configuration contains
    invalid or inconsistent data that needs to be corrected before it can be applied.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Configuration Validation
    code: "BotLevelDistribution botDist;\nbool isValid = botDist.ValidateConfig();\n\
      if (isValid)\n{\n    // Proceed with using the configuration\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Configuration is valid.\" << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid\
      \ configuration\n    std::cout << \"Configuration validation failed.\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a comprehensive check of the internal state of the BotLevelDistribution
    class. It is designed to be lightweight and should not cause significant performance
    impact during normal operation. The validation logic assumes that all required
    configuration parameters have been initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or partially initialized BotLevelDistribution
    object may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect validation results. Ensure
    that all configuration values are properly set before invoking ValidateConfig().
