api:
  class: AuctionEventBus
  method: SubscribeAll
  signature: void AuctionEventBus::SubscribeAll(BotAI * subscriber)
documentation:
  brief: Subscribes a BotAI instance to all auction events in the AuctionEventBus.
  description: The SubscribeAll method registers a given BotAI instance to receive
    notifications for all auction-related events managed by the AuctionEventBus. This
    allows the bot to react to various auction activities such as item listings, bids,
    and sales without needing to manually subscribe to each individual event type.
    The method typically integrates with the broader AI framework of TrinityCore's
    auction system, enabling automated bidding strategies or monitoring behaviors
    for bot characters. It is expected that this method be called during initialization
    or activation of a bot AI component.
  parameters:
  - name: subscriber
    description: A pointer to the BotAI instance that will receive all auction events
      from the AuctionEventBus. This parameter must not be null and should reference
      a valid, initialized BotAI object.
  returns: None. This method does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Subscription of a BotAI
    code: 'BotAI* myBot = new BotAI();

      AuctionEventBus::instance()->SubscribeAll(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely maintains an internal list or map of subscribers and may
    involve thread synchronization if auction events are dispatched asynchronously.
    The subscription is typically persistent until explicitly unsubscribed via a corresponding
    method like UnsubscribeAll.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI instance passed to this method remains valid for
    the duration of its subscription, as dangling pointers could lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes when events are fired.
