documentation:
  brief: Initializes and prepares spell triggers that are executed on hit for the
    current spell.
  description: The PrepareTriggersExecutedOnHit method initializes and sets up all
    spell triggers that are meant to be executed when a spell successfully hits its
    target. This includes preparing any additional effects, procs, or triggered abilities
    that should occur as a result of the spell's successful hit. The method is typically
    called during the spell's execution phase to ensure that all related triggers
    are properly configured and ready for activation. It handles the setup of trigger
    conditions and ensures proper linkage between the main spell effect and its associated
    triggered effects.

      \    // ... continue with spell execution ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the spell system during spell
    processing and should not be called directly from external code unless specifically
    required for custom spell behavior. The method may perform internal setup operations
    that are critical for proper trigger execution.
