  signature: uint32 CooldownManager::GetChannelRemaining(uint32 spellId) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the remaining time in milliseconds for a channel spell's cooldown.
  description: The GetChannelRemaining method retrieves the time remaining on a channel
    spell's cooldown timer. This is used to determine how much longer a player must
    wait before they can cast the same channel spell again. The method operates on
    the internal cooldown tracking system of the CooldownManager, which manages all
    active spell cooldowns for a given unit. It returns 0 if no cooldown is active
    or if the specified spell is not a channel spell. This functionality is essential
    for enforcing game balance and preventing spamming of channel spells such as those
    used in healing or damage-over-time effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the remaining cooldown time in milliseconds for the specified channel
    spell. If no cooldown is active, or if the spell ID does not correspond to a channel
    spell, it returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Check Channel Cooldown Before Casting
    code: "if (player->GetCooldownManager()->GetChannelRemaining(12345) == 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Spell is ready to be cast\n    player->CastSpell(target, 12345, true);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Spell is on cooldown\n    player->SendCastResult(12345, SPELL_FAILED_NOT_READY);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the spell ID passed corresponds to a valid channel
    spell. The internal cooldown system tracks all spells cast by the unit and updates
    their remaining times accordingly. Performance is generally low as it only accesses
    stored data without complex calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell ID provided is indeed a channel spell; otherwise,
    the method may return unexpected results or zero even if there's an active cooldown
    for another type of spell. Misuse can lead to incorrect cooldown enforcement.
