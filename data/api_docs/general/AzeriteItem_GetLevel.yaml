  class: AzeriteItem
  method: GetLevel
  signature: int AzeriteItem::GetLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current level of the Azerite item.
  description: The GetLevel method returns the level of the Azerite item associated
    with this AzeriteItem instance. In World of Warcraft, Azerite items are characterized
    by their level, which determines their power and capabilities. This level can
    be used to assess the item's strength, compare it against other items, or determine
    if it meets certain requirements for progression or enchantment. The method does
    not modify any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the current level of the Azerite item. This value
    typically corresponds to the item's Azerite level, which ranges from 1 up to the
    maximum level allowed by the game's progression system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AzeriteItem* item = player->GetAzeriteItem();

      int level = item->GetLevel();

      TC_LOG_INFO("custom", "Azerite item level: %d", level);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Item Level for Progression
    code: "AzeriteItem* item = player->GetAzeriteItem();\nif (item && item->GetLevel()\
      \ >= 100)\n{\n    // Player's Azerite item is at or above level 100\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      custom\", \"Item meets progression requirements.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AzeriteItem instance is valid and properly initialized.
    If called on a null or uninitialized AzeriteItem pointer, it may result in undefined
    behavior or a crash. The returned level value reflects the item's current state
    and can change as the player progresses through content or applies Azerite powers.
  warnings: Do not assume that all Azerite items have a meaningful level; some may
    return zero or invalid values if they are not properly initialized. Always validate
    the pointer before calling this method to avoid crashes.
