    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the training cost for a bot to learn skills from a trainer creature.
  description: The GetTrainingCost method computes the gold cost required for a player
    bot to train skills at a given creature trainer. This function typically evaluates
    the bot's current skill levels, the trainer's available skills, and any applicable
    discounts or modifiers based on the bot's reputation, faction, or other factors.
    It is used internally by the interaction manager to determine whether a bot can
    afford training and to update the UI with cost information before initiating the
    training process.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that wishes to
      train skills.
  - name: trainer
    description: Pointer to the Creature object acting as the trainer, which must
      be a valid trainer NPC with trainable skills.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the total gold cost required for the
    bot to train all available skills at the specified trainer. A return value of
    0 indicates no training is needed or that the cost cannot be calculated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 cost = interactionManager.GetTrainingCost(botPlayer, npcTrainer);\n\
      if (cost > 0)\n{\n    // Bot can afford training\n    botPlayer->ModifyMoney(-static_cast<int32>(cost));\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Skill Validation
    code: "uint32 cost = interactionManager.GetTrainingCost(botPlayer, npcTrainer);\n\
      if (cost > 0 && botPlayer->GetMoney() >= cost)\n{\n    // Proceed with training\
      \ logic\n    botPlayer->TrainSkills(npcTrainer);\n}\nelse if (cost == 0)\n{\n\
      \    // No skills to train or already maxed out\n    sLog->outString(\"No training\
      \ required for this bot.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may internally query the database or cached skill data structures
    to compute costs. It should be called before attempting to perform actual training
    to avoid unnecessary operations and potential error states.
  warnings: Ensure that both the bot and trainer parameters are valid pointers; passing
    null values will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. Also, this method
    does not account for temporary discounts or quest-based reductions in cost.
