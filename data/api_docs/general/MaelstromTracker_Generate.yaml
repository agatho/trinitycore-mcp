  class: MaelstromTracker
  method: Generate
  signature: void MaelstromTracker::Generate(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates maelstrom energy for the player based on the specified amount.
  description: The Generate method is used to add a specified amount of maelstrom
    energy to the MaelstromTracker instance. This typically occurs during gameplay
    when a player performs actions that generate maelstrom, such as using certain
    abilities or dealing damage with specific weapon types. The method updates internal
    tracking variables to reflect the new energy level and may trigger events or visual
    effects depending on the implementation. It is commonly used in conjunction with
    other maelstrom-related systems within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of maelstrom energy to generate. This value must be
      a non-negative integer representing the amount of energy units to be added to
      the tracker.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MaelstromTracker tracker;

      tracker.Generate(50); // Adds 50 units of maelstrom energy'
    language: cpp
  - title: Generating Energy from Combat
    code: "void Player::OnDamageDealt(Unit* target, uint32 damage)\n{\n    if (target->GetTypeId()\
      \ == TYPEID_UNIT && target->ToCreature()->GetCreatureTemplate()->Entry == 12345)\n\
      \    {\n        maelstromTracker.Generate(10); // Generate 10 maelstrom energy\
      \ on dealing damage to specific mob\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal counters and may notify other subsystems
    about changes in maelstrom levels. It's important to ensure that the amount parameter
    is validated to prevent negative values which could cause unexpected behavior
    in energy calculations.
  warnings: Calling this method with very large values might overflow internal tracking
    variables or cause performance issues if not properly bounded by game logic. Ensure
    that the amount parameter is within reasonable limits for gameplay balance.
