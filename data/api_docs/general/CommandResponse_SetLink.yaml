api:
  class: CommandResponse
  method: SetLink
  signature: CommandResponse & CommandResponse::SetLink(std::string link)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the link text for a command response, typically used to create clickable
    links in game chat or UI elements.
  description: The SetLink method assigns a hyperlink string to a CommandResponse
    object, enabling the response to contain clickable links that can be displayed
    in-game. This is commonly used in command handlers to provide players with direct
    access to web resources, documentation, or other relevant content. The method
    returns a reference to the same CommandResponse object, allowing for method chaining.
    This functionality is particularly useful in TrinityCore's command system where
    responses need to be formatted for display in the game client.
  parameters:
  - name: link
    description: A string containing the URL or link identifier to be set as the response
      link. Must be a valid URI format for proper functionality in-game.
  returns: Returns a reference to the CommandResponse object, enabling method chaining
    for fluent interface usage.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CommandResponse response;

      response.SetLink("https://trinitycore.org/documentation");

      // The response now contains a link that can be displayed in-game'
    language: cpp
  - title: Method Chaining
    code: "CommandResponse response;\nresponse.SetLink(\"https://trinitycore.org/support\"\
      )\n    .SetMessage(\"Visit our support page for help.\");\n// Both link and\
      \ message are set on the same response object"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other CommandResponse setters
    like SetMessage() to create rich, interactive command responses. The link string
    should be properly formatted as a URI to ensure it functions correctly when displayed
    in the game client.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided link string is a valid URI format; malformed
    links may not render properly in-game or could cause display issues. Avoid using
    links that point to untrusted domains without proper validation.
