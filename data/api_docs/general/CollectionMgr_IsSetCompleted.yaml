  brief: Checks whether a player has completed all items in a specified transmog set
  description: The IsSetCompleted method determines if a player has acquired and applied
    all required items to complete a specific transmog set. This functionality is
    used primarily in the context of World of Warcraft's transmogrification system,
    where players can collect and apply cosmetic appearances to their characters.
    The method evaluates the current state of the player's collection against the
    requirements defined for the given transmog set ID. It returns true if all items
    in the set are present and applied, or false otherwise. This check is typically
    performed when displaying set completion status in UI elements such as the Transmogrification
    interface.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all items in the specified transmog set have been collected
    and applied by the player; returns false if any item is missing or unapplied.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a player has completed a specific transmog set
    code: "if (player->GetCollectionMgr()->IsSetCompleted(12345)) {\n    // Player\
      \ has completed the set with ID 12345\n    SendSystemMessage(\"You have completed\
      \ this transmog set!\");\n} else {\n    // Player is still missing items from\
      \ the set\n    SendSystemMessage(\"This transmog set is not yet complete.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal collection tracking within the CollectionMgr
    class. It may involve database queries to verify item ownership and application
    status. The method does not account for temporary or conditional requirements
    that might affect set completion in some game mechanics.
