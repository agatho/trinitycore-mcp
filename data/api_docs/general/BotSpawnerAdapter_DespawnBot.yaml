  method: DespawnBot
  signature: void BotSpawnerAdapter::DespawnBot(int guid, bool forced)
documentation:
  brief: Despawns a bot with the specified GUID from the game world, optionally forcing
    its removal.
  description: The DespawnBot method removes a bot character from the game world based
    on its unique identifier (GUID). This function is typically used in bot management
    systems to cleanly remove bots that are no longer needed or have completed their
    assigned tasks. The method supports an optional 'forced' parameter that determines
    whether the bot should be removed immediately without any cleanup routines, or
    if it should go through normal despawn procedures. When forced is false, the bot
    may perform cleanup operations such as dropping items, updating player statistics,
    or triggering quest events before being removed. If forced is true, the bot is
    removed instantly from memory and the game world without these additional steps.
    This method is part of the BotSpawnerAdapter class which manages the lifecycle
    of AI-controlled characters in TrinityCore environments.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character to be despawned.
      This value must correspond to a valid bot entry in the game world's database
      or active entities.
  - name: forced
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to force the immediate removal of
      the bot. When true, bypasses normal cleanup procedures; when false, performs
      standard despawn operations including potential quest updates and item drops.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Despawning
    code: 'BotSpawnerAdapter adapter;

      adapter.DespawnBot(12345, false); // Normal despawn with cleanup'
    language: cpp
  - title: Forced Bot Removal
    code: 'BotSpawnerAdapter adapter;

      adapter.DespawnBot(67890, true); // Immediate removal without cleanup'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the bot with the given GUID exists in the game world.
    If called on a non-existent bot, it may result in undefined behavior or silent
    failure. The forced parameter should be used cautiously as it can leave the game
    state inconsistent if cleanup operations are required for proper quest progression
    or item management.
  warnings: Calling this method with forced=true on bots that have active quests or
    items that need to be properly dropped or tracked may cause quest data corruption
    or item loss in the player's inventory. Always verify bot state before forcing
    removal.
