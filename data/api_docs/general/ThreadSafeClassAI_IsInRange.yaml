  method: IsInRange
  signature: bool ThreadSafeClassAI::IsInRange(Unit * target, float range) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a target unit is within a specified range of the AI-controlled
    unit.
  description: The IsInRange method determines whether a given Unit target is within
    a specified distance from the AI-controlled unit. This method is commonly used
    in AI behavior logic to make decisions based on proximity, such as determining
    when to cast spells, initiate melee attacks, or move towards a target. The range
    check considers the 3D spatial distance between the two units and accounts for
    their respective positions in the game world. This function is thread-safe and
    can be called from different threads without causing race conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that represents the target to check for
      range. Must not be null.
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance in yards within which the target must be located
      to return true. Must be a positive value.
  returns: Returns true if the target unit is within the specified range, false otherwise.
    If either the target or the AI-controlled unit is invalid, the method may return
    false or cause undefined behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Range Check
    code: "if (ai->IsInRange(target, 10.0f)) {\n    // Target is within 10 yards\n\
      \    ai->CastSpell(target, SPELL_SHOOT);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Attack Logic
    code: "if (!ai->IsInRange(target, 5.0f)) {\n    // Move closer if target is out\
      \ of melee range\n    ai->MoveTo(target, 5.0f);\n} else {\n    // Attack if\
      \ in melee range\n    ai->AttackStart(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple Euclidean distance check and does not account
    for obstacles or line of sight. It is primarily used for AI decision-making rather
    than precise movement calculations. The method assumes that both the AI-controlled
    unit and the target are valid and exist in the same map instance.
  warnings: Passing null pointers as target may lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the range parameter is positive and reasonable for your use case.
    Be cautious when using this method in performance-critical code paths due to potential
    overhead from position lookups.
