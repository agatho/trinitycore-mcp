  class: WarriorAI
  method: OptimizeWeaponChoice
  signature: void WarriorAI::OptimizeWeaponChoice()
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the weapon choice for a warrior AI based on current combat conditions
    and available weapons.
  description: The OptimizeWeaponChoice method evaluates the warrior's current equipment,
    combat state, and target characteristics to determine the most effective weapon
    to use. This method is typically invoked during combat decision-making processes
    to ensure the AI selects the optimal weapon for maximum damage output or specific
    tactical advantages. It considers factors such as weapon type (melee vs. ranged),
    damage statistics, enchantments, and the warrior's current stance or specialization.
    The method modifies internal AI state variables to reflect the chosen weapon preference,
    which may influence subsequent attack behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    OptimizeWeaponChoice();\n    // Proceed with attack\
      \ logic using optimized weapon\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the warrior AI's decision-making framework and should
    be called regularly during combat updates. It may affect performance if invoked
    too frequently without proper throttling, especially in high-density combat scenarios
    with multiple AIs.
  warnings: Ensure that the warrior has valid weapon equipment before calling this
    method; otherwise, it may result in undefined behavior or incorrect weapon selection
    logic.
