  class: BotWorldPositioner
  method: IsReady
  signature: bool BotWorldPositioner::IsReady() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the bot world positioner is ready for use.
  description: The IsReady method determines whether the BotWorldPositioner instance
    has completed its initialization process and is prepared to perform world positioning
    operations. This typically involves verifying that all required resources, configurations,
    and dependencies are properly loaded and available. The method returns true when
    the positioner is fully initialized and capable of executing positioning logic,
    and false otherwise. In the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this check ensures
    that bots do not attempt to calculate or apply world positions before the necessary
    subsystems are ready.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the BotWorldPositioner is fully initialized and ready to
    perform positioning operations; returns false if initialization is incomplete
    or failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (botWorldPositioner.IsReady()) {\n    // Proceed with positioning logic\n\
      \    botWorldPositioner.PositionBot();\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization\
      \ failure\n    LOG_ERROR(\"world\", \"Bot world positioner not ready\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before performing any positioning operations
    to prevent runtime errors. It may involve checking internal flags, resource availability,
    or configuration states within the BotWorldPositioner class.
