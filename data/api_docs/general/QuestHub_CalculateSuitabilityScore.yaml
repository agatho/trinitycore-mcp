documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a suitability score for a player based on their quest
    eligibility and progression.
  description: The CalculateSuitabilityScore method evaluates how well a given player
    is suited for accepting or progressing through quests within the QuestHub system.
    This score takes into account various factors such as player level, quest prerequisites,
    completed quests, available quest items, and other relevant game state variables.
    The method is typically used to determine which quests should be presented to
    a player based on their current suitability, helping to maintain a balanced and
    engaging quest experience. It does not modify any internal state and is designed
    to be called frequently during quest interaction flows.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the suitability score for the player. Higher
    scores indicate better suitability for quest acceptance or progression. Scores
    typically range from 0.0 (not suitable) to 1.0 (fully suitable), though values
    may exceed 1.0 in certain exceptional cases.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float score = questHub->CalculateSuitabilityScore(player);\nif (score >\
      \ 0.5f) {\n    // Player is suitable for accepting quests\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Acceptance Logic
    code: "void QuestHub::HandlePlayerQuestAccept(Player* player) {\n    float suitability\
      \ = CalculateSuitabilityScore(player);\n    if (suitability >= 0.8f) {\n   \
      \     // Proceed with quest acceptance logic\n        AcceptQuest(player, GetBestAvailableQuest(player));\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Inform player they are not suitable for any quests\n\
      \        SendNoQuestsAvailableMessage(player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the QuestHub system to prioritize
    quest selection and filtering. It may involve complex logic including checks against
    player stats, quest flags, faction standings, and quest completion history. The
    implementation should be efficient as it might be called multiple times per player
    interaction.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as dereferencing an invalid pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Also note that the suitability score may vary between calls due to changing game
    state variables such as quest completion or item acquisition.
