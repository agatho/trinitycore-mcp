  class: ObjectGuidFactory
  method: CreateGuild
  signature: ObjectGuid ObjectGuidFactory::CreateGuild(HighGuid type, uint32 realmId,
    uint64 dbId)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a unique ObjectGuid for a guild with specified high GUID type, realm
    ID, and database identifier.
  description: The CreateGuild method generates a unique ObjectGuid specifically for
    guild entities within the TrinityCore framework. It constructs the GUID using
    a combination of a HighGuid type to identify the entity category, a realm ID to
    distinguish between different realms or instances, and a database ID that uniquely
    identifies the guild within that realm. This method is essential for maintaining
    consistent and unique identification of guilds across the game world, ensuring
    proper synchronization between server memory and database records. The generated
    GUID follows the standard TrinityCore ObjectGuid format which includes a 32-bit
    realm ID, a 28-bit low GUID (dbId), and a 4-bit high GUID type to categorize entity
    types.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: HighGuid enum value specifying the type of object being created.
      For guilds, this should be a valid HighGuid value such as HIGHGUID_GUILD or
      similar, indicating that the resulting ObjectGuid represents a guild entity.
  - name: realmId
    description: 32-bit unsigned integer representing the realm ID where the guild
      exists. This ensures that guilds from different realms have distinct GUIDs even
      if they share the same database ID.
  - name: dbId
    description: 64-bit unsigned integer representing the unique identifier of the
      guild in the database. This value is used as the low portion of the ObjectGuid
      to ensure uniqueness within a realm.
  returns: Returns an ObjectGuid object that uniquely identifies a guild entity. The
    returned GUID contains the specified realm ID, dbId, and type information encoded
    according to TrinityCore's ObjectGuid format.
  examples:
  - title: Creating a Guild GUID
    code: 'ObjectGuid guildGuid = sObjectGuidFactory->CreateGuild(HIGHGUID_GUILD,
      1, 12345);

      // Creates a guild GUID for realm ID 1 with database ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Guild GUID in Guild Creation
    code: 'uint32 realmId = sWorld->GetRealmId();

      ObjectGuid guildGuid = sObjectGuidFactory->CreateGuild(HIGHGUID_GUILD, realmId,
      newGuildDbId);

      guild->SetGUID(guildGuid);

      // Sets the generated GUID on a newly created guild object'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during guild creation or loading from database.
    The HighGuid type must be valid for guild entities, and the realmId should match
    the current realm context. The dbId parameter should correspond to a valid entry
    in the guild table of the database.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided realmId matches the actual realm context where
    the guild will exist. Using an incorrect realmId can lead to GUID conflicts or
    incorrect entity identification. The dbId must be unique within the realm to maintain
    proper GUID uniqueness.
