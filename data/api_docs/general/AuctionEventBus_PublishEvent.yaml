  class: AuctionEventBus
  method: PublishEvent
  signature: bool AuctionEventBus::PublishEvent(const AuctionEvent & event)
documentation:
  brief: Publishes an auction event to all registered subscribers in the auction event
    bus.
  description: The PublishEvent method dispatches a given AuctionEvent to all currently
    registered listeners within the AuctionEventBus. This method is typically used
    in the context of World of Warcraft's auction house system to notify interested
    parties about events such as new auctions being listed, bids being placed, or
    auctions expiring. The method returns true if the event was successfully published
    to at least one subscriber, and false if no subscribers were registered or if
    the publishing process failed for some reason. This is a core part of the event-driven
    architecture used in TrinityCore's auction system.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The AuctionEvent object containing the details of the auction event
      to be published. This includes information such as the auction ID, item details,
      bid amount, bidder information, and event type (e.g., listing, bid, expiration).
  returns: Returns true if the event was successfully published to at least one subscriber;
    returns false if no subscribers are registered or if the publishing operation
    failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Publishing
    code: "AuctionEvent event;\nevent.auctionId = 12345;\nevent.eventType = AUCTION_EVENT_LISTING;\n\
      event.itemId = 45678;\nbool success = auctionEventBus.PublishEvent(event);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Event was published successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Publishing Bid Event
    code: "AuctionEvent bidEvent;\nbidEvent.auctionId = 12345;\nbidEvent.eventType\
      \ = AUCTION_EVENT_BID;\nbidEvent.bidAmount = 100000;\nbidEvent.bidderName =\
      \ \"Player123\";\nbool success = auctionEventBus.PublishEvent(bidEvent);\nif\
      \ (!success) {\n    // Handle case where no listeners were registered\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and can be called from any thread
    context. It uses a standard observer pattern implementation, where subscribers
    register themselves with the event bus using a corresponding Subscribe method.
    The event bus maintains a list of registered listeners and iterates through them
    when PublishEvent is invoked.
  warnings: Ensure that all AuctionEvent objects passed to this method are properly
    initialized before publishing, as malformed events may cause issues in subscriber
    handling. Also, be aware that if no subscribers are registered, the method will
    return false even though the call itself succeeded.
