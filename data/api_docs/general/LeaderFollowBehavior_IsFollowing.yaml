  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: IsFollowing
  signature: bool LeaderFollowBehavior::IsFollowing() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit is currently following a leader in the LeaderFollowBehavior.
  description: The IsFollowing method determines whether the current unit controlled
    by this behavior is actively following a designated leader. This method is typically
    used within AI systems to manage group movement and coordination. It evaluates
    the internal state of the behavior to return true if a valid leader is set and
    the unit is in a following state, or false otherwise. The method does not modify
    any internal state but provides a read-only check on the current follow status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is currently following a leader; returns false
    if no leader is set or the unit is not in a following state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (leaderFollowBehavior.IsFollowing()) {\n    // Unit is following a leader\n\
      \    // Perform actions specific to following state\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Movement Logic
    code: "if (!leaderFollowBehavior.IsFollowing()) {\n    // Start following the\
      \ leader\n    leaderFollowBehavior.SetLeader(leaderUnit);\n    leaderFollowBehavior.StartFollowing();\n\
      } else {\n    // Already following, maybe adjust distance or formation\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state tracking of the LeaderFollowBehavior.
    It should be called frequently in AI update loops to ensure accurate status reporting.
    The behavior does not automatically update its follow status; it must be managed
    through explicit calls to StartFollowing(), StopFollowing(), or similar methods.
