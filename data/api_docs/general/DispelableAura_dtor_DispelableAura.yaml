documentation:
  brief: Destroys a DispelableAura instance and cleans up its resources.
  description: The destructor for the DispelableAura class is responsible for cleaning
    up any allocated memory or resources associated with the aura instance. In the
    context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this typically involves
    removing references to the aura from internal tracking systems, ensuring proper
    cleanup of any effects or callbacks that were registered during the aura's lifetime.
    This method is automatically invoked when a DispelableAura object goes out of
    scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of DispelableAura
    code: 'DispelableAura* aura = new DispelableAura();

      // ... use the aura ...

      delete aura; // Triggers ~DispelableAura()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is typically not called directly by user code but rather
    through object lifetime management (e.g., stack allocation, smart pointers, or
    explicit deletion). It's important to ensure that all references to the aura are
    properly removed before destruction to avoid dangling pointers.
