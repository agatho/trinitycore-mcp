  class: LootAnalysis
  method: GetItemLevelWeight
  signature: float LootAnalysis::GetItemLevelWeight(Player * player, uint32 itemLevel)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a weight value based on item level for loot analysis
    purposes.
  description: The GetItemLevelWeight method computes a normalized weight factor for
    a given item level within the context of loot analysis. This weight is typically
    used to evaluate the relative value or desirability of an item compared to others
    in a loot distribution system. The calculation may consider factors such as item
    rarity, player class, and progression state. The method takes into account the
    player's current context and the item's level to determine its significance in
    loot decisions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the item level weight is being
      calculated. This parameter determines the contextual factors such as class,
      progression, and gear level that influence the weight calculation.
  - name: itemLevel
    description: The item level of the item being evaluated. This numeric value represents
      the quality or power level of the item within the game's progression system.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated weight for the given item level.
    Higher values indicate higher relative importance or desirability of the item
    in loot analysis.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      uint32 itemLevel = 450;

      float weight = LootAnalysis::GetItemLevelWeight(player, itemLevel);

      // weight now contains the normalized loot value for item level 450'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Loot Distribution Logic
    code: "void EvaluateLootForPlayer(Player* player, std::vector<uint32>& itemLevels)\
      \ {\n    for (uint32 level : itemLevels) {\n        float weight = LootAnalysis::GetItemLevelWeight(player,\
      \ level);\n        // Use weight to prioritize loot distribution\n        if\
      \ (weight > 0.8f) {\n            // High-value item logic\n        }\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely uses internal scaling factors and player-specific modifiers
    to compute weights. It's designed for use in loot optimization systems where items
    need to be ranked or prioritized based on their value relative to the player's
    current gear and progression state.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior. The itemLevel
    parameter should represent a valid item level within the game's range.
