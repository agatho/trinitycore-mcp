documentation:
  brief: Destroys a RuneManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The RuneManager destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up
    all internal resources and data structures when a RuneManager object is destroyed.
    This includes releasing any allocated memory, resetting internal state, and ensuring
    no dangling references remain. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    this method would typically be invoked when a player character's rune management
    system needs to be torn down, such as during player logout or character deletion.
    The destructor ensures that all rune-related data is properly cleared without
    causing memory leaks or undefined behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of RuneManager
    code: "void CleanupPlayerRuneManager()\n{\n    RuneManager* manager = new RuneManager();\n\
      \    // ... use the manager ...\n    delete manager; // Destructor is automatically\
      \ called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should be called only through proper object lifetime management.
    Since this is a destructor, it's automatically invoked during object destruction
    and should not be called manually. Developers should ensure that all references
    to the RuneManager are cleared before it goes out of scope.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke the destructor; let the C++ runtime handle its
    invocation during object destruction. Improper manual calling can lead to undefined
    behavior or memory corruption.
