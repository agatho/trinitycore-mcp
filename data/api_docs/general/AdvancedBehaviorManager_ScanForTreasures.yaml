  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: ScanForTreasures
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::ScanForTreasures()
documentation:
  brief: Scans the current area for treasure objects and processes them according
    to behavior rules.
  description: The ScanForTreasures method performs a comprehensive search of the
    game world within the manager's defined scope to identify and handle treasure-related
    objects. It typically iterates through nearby game entities, evaluates their type
    and state, and triggers appropriate actions such as loot distribution or quest
    progression. This method is commonly used in AI behavior systems where NPCs or
    game mechanics need to dynamically discover and interact with treasure items in
    the environment.

  - title: Basic Usage in Behavior Update
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_scanTimer <= diff)\n   \
      \ {\n        m_behaviorManager.ScanForTreasures();\n        m_scanTimer = 5000;\
      \ // Scan every 5 seconds\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        m_scanTimer -= diff;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform multiple database queries and object evaluations,
    so frequent calls could impact performance. It is recommended to throttle execution
    using timers or event-based triggers rather than calling it every frame.
  warnings: The method assumes that the manager's context (such as current position
    or target area) has been properly initialized. Calling this method without proper
    setup may result in scanning incorrect areas or missing valid treasures.
