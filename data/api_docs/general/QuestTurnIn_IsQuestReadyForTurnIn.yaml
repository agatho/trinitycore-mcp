  class: QuestTurnIn

  signature: bool QuestTurnIn::IsQuestReadyForTurnIn(uint32 questId, Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a player is ready to turn in a specified quest
  description: The IsQuestReadyForTurnIn method evaluates if a given player has met
    all the requirements necessary to complete and turn in a specific quest. This
    includes verifying that the player has the required items, meets level requirements,
    and satisfies any other conditions set by the quest. The method is typically used
    in quest completion logic to determine if a quest can be turned in at a quest
    giver or NPC. It does not modify the player's quest state but rather serves as
    a validation check before proceeding with quest completion.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to check for turn-in readiness
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player whose quest
      readiness is being evaluated
  returns: Returns true if the player has all required items and meets all conditions
    to turn in the specified quest, otherwise returns false
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Turn-In Readiness Check
    code: "if (questTurnIn->IsQuestReadyForTurnIn(12345, player)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with quest completion logic\n    player->CompleteQuest(12345);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Inform player they cannot turn in the quest yet\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You are not ready to turn in this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal quest validation logic within TrinityCore
    and may consider factors such as item counts, quest flags, and player state. It
    is recommended to call this method before attempting to complete a quest to avoid
    errors or unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is valid and not null, as passing
    an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also note that
    this check does not account for quest timers or time-based restrictions beyond
    standard completion requirements.
