documentation:
  brief: Returns the addon data associated with the GameObject template.
  description: This method retrieves the GameObjectTemplateAddon structure which contains
    additional data related to the GameObject's template, such as spawn parameters,
    visibility settings, and other template-specific configurations. The returned
    pointer provides access to the addon information that is used during the GameObject's
    initialization and spawning process. This data is crucial for understanding how
    the GameObject behaves in different game contexts and can influence its appearance,
    interaction, and spawning behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the GameObjectTemplateAddon structure which contains
    additional template data. If no addon data exists, this may return nullptr, indicating
    that the GameObject has no additional template configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing addon data for a GameObject
    code: "const GameObjectTemplateAddon* addon = go->GetTemplateAddon();\nif (addon)\n\
      {\n    // Use addon data\n    // Example: visibility settings, spawn parameters\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during the initialization phase of GameObjects.
    The returned pointer should be treated as const and not modified directly to avoid
    unexpected behavior or crashes. It's important to note that this data may be nullptr
    if no addon information exists for a particular GameObject template.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in scenarios where the GameObject might
    not have valid addon data, as dereferencing a null pointer could lead to crashes.
    Always check for nullptr before accessing fields of the returned structure.
