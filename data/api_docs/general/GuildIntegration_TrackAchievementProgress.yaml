documentation:
  brief: Tracks achievement progress for a player within the guild integration system.
  description: The TrackAchievementProgress method is responsible for monitoring and
    recording the progression of achievements for a specific player within the guild
    context. This method likely updates internal tracking structures or logs to maintain
    up-to-date information about player accomplishments. It may be invoked automatically
    when players earn achievements or manually during synchronization processes. The
    method operates on a player reference passed as an integer pointer, which typically
    represents the player's unique identifier or index within the system.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier or index
      for whom achievement progress is being tracked.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.TrackAchievementProgress(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal achievement tracking systems and
    may require the player to be active in the guild. It's designed to maintain consistency
    between player achievements and guild-related statistics.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and points to a currently active
    player; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. The method does not validate
    input parameters beyond basic pointer existence.
