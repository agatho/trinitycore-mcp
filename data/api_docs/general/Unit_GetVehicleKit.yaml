documentation:
  brief: Returns the vehicle object associated with this unit, if any.
  description: This method retrieves the Vehicle object that is currently associated
    with the unit. It is used to access vehicle-related functionality and data for
    units that are mounted on vehicles. The method returns a pointer to the Vehicle
    object, which can be null if the unit is not currently mounted on a vehicle or
    if no vehicle has been assigned to it. This is particularly useful in game mechanics
    involving player and NPC vehicle interactions, where vehicle data needs to be
    accessed for various operations such as controlling vehicle movement, accessing
    passenger information, or handling vehicle-specific actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Vehicle object associated with this unit. If the
    unit is not currently mounted on a vehicle, or if no vehicle has been assigned,
    the method returns nullptr. This indicates that there is no vehicle data available
    for the unit at that moment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Vehicle* vehicle = unit->GetVehicleKit();\nif (vehicle)\n{\n    // Vehicle\
      \ exists, perform actions\n    std::cout << \"Vehicle ID: \" << vehicle->GetGUID()\
      \ << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No vehicle assigned\n    std::cout << \"\
      No vehicle found.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other vehicle-related methods
    like GetVehicle() or GetGUID() to access vehicle data. The returned Vehicle object
    may be nullptr if the unit is not currently mounted on a vehicle, which is common
    for NPCs that are not currently using vehicles. Performance considerations include
    checking if the vehicle exists before accessing its data, as accessing vehicle
    data can be expensive.
  warnings: This method should not be used to access vehicle data when the unit is
    not mounted on a vehicle, as it will return nullptr. Care must be taken to avoid
    dereferencing null pointers when using this method in code. Also, this method
    may return nullptr even if the unit has been assigned a vehicle but is not currently
    mounted on it.
