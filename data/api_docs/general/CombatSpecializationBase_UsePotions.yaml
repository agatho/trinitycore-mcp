  brief: Determines and executes the use of potions based on combat specialization
    rules.
  description: The UsePotions method evaluates the current combat specialization state
    and determines whether any applicable potions should be consumed. This method
    is typically invoked during combat scenarios to ensure optimal resource usage
    according to the player's specialization build. It checks for potion availability,
    cooldowns, and situational requirements before executing the potion use. The behavior
    of this method may vary depending on the specific subclass implementation of CombatSpecializationBase.

    code: "void MyCombatSpecialization::Update()\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n\
      \    UsePotions();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called within the context of an active combat
    state. It assumes that the player object has valid potion inventory and relevant
    combat state information. The actual potion selection logic may be overridden
    in derived classes.
