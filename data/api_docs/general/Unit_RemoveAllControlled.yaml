  brief: Removes all controlled units from the current unit's control.
  description: This method removes all units that are currently under the control
    of the calling unit. It is typically used in scenarios where a player or creature
    needs to release control over their summoned creatures or pets. The method ensures
    that any controlled units are properly unlinked from the current unit, effectively
    ending the control relationship. This operation is commonly used during combat
    or when changing states of the unit to prevent unintended control of summoned
    creatures.

  notes: This method should be used carefully as it may affect the control state of
    summoned creatures or pets. It is recommended to check if any units are under
    control before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method may result in loss of control over summoned units,
    which can lead to unintended consequences during combat or when managing player
    characters.
