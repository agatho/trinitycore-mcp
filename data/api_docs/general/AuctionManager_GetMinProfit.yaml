  class: AuctionManager
  method: GetMinProfit
  signature: uint64 AuctionManager::GetMinProfit() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the minimum profit percentage required for auction items.
  description: The GetMinProfit method retrieves the minimum profit percentage that
    must be earned from selling an item through the auction house system. This value
    is used by the auction manager to determine whether a sale meets the minimum profitability
    threshold before allowing the auction to complete. The returned value represents
    a percentage expressed as a whole number (e.g., 10 for 10%). This setting is typically
    configured via server configuration files or game master commands and affects
    all auctions across the realm.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the minimum profit percentage required for
    auction sales. For example, a return value of 15 means that auctions must yield
    at least 15% profit above the initial bid amount to be considered valid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint64 minProfit = sAuctionMgr->GetMinProfit();

      printf("Minimum auction profit required: %llu%%\n", minProfit);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Profit Threshold
    code: "uint64 minProfit = sAuctionMgr->GetMinProfit();\nuint64 bidAmount = 1000;\n\
      uint64 sellPrice = 1150;\nuint64 profit = sellPrice - bidAmount;\nuint64 profitPercent\
      \ = (profit * 100) / bidAmount;\nif (profitPercent >= minProfit)\n{\n    printf(\"\
      Auction meets minimum profit requirement.\\n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"\
      Auction does not meet minimum profit requirement.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during auction validation processes to ensure
    that the server's economic balance is maintained. The value returned should be
    interpreted as a percentage and may vary depending on server configuration or
    game expansion settings.
  warnings: Ensure that this value is properly configured in server settings, as setting
    it too high could prevent profitable auctions from completing, while setting it
    too low might lead to exploitation of the auction system for minimal gains.
