  signature: bool GroupModel::writeToFile(int * wf)
documentation:
  brief: Writes group model data to a file using the provided write function pointer.
  description: The GroupModel::writeToFile method serializes the internal data of
    a group model and writes it to an output file. It takes a pointer to a write function
    (wf) which is responsible for performing the actual writing operation. This method
    is typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server to
    persist group-related data such as player positions, group composition, or other
    group-specific information to disk. The method returns true if the write operation
    was successful, and false otherwise. It may be used during server shutdown, group
    updates, or when saving group state for later restoration.
  parameters:
  - name: wf
    description: Pointer to a function that performs the actual writing operation.
      The function should accept an int parameter representing the number of bytes
      written and return a boolean indicating success or failure.
  returns: True if the group model data was successfully written to the file, false
    otherwise. A return value of false may indicate issues such as invalid file handles,
    insufficient disk space, or errors in the write function itself.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with a custom write function
    code: "int customWriteFunction(int bytesWritten) {\n    // Simulate writing to\
      \ a file\n    return (bytesWritten > 0) ? 1 : 0;\n}\n\nGroupModel model;\nbool\
      \ success = model.writeToFile(&customWriteFunction);\nif (success) {\n    printf(\"\
      Group model written successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"Failed to write\
      \ group model\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on an external write function pointer, which must be properly
    implemented and compatible with the expected interface. The actual file path or
    destination is not specified within this method, implying that the write function
    itself manages the file I/O details.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided write function pointer is valid and does not
    cause undefined behavior. Improper handling of the write function can lead to
    crashes or data corruption. This method should not be called with a null pointer
    for the 'wf' parameter.
