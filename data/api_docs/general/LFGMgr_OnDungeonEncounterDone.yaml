documentation:
  brief: Handles completion of a dungeon encounter for a given group in the LFG system
  description: The OnDungeonEncounterDone method is invoked when a player group completes
    a dungeon encounter within the Looking For Group (LFG) framework. This method
    updates internal LFG state tracking, potentially marking the group's progress
    and notifying relevant subsystems about the completion event. It integrates with
    the broader LFG matchmaking and reward systems to ensure proper progression tracking
    for players participating in dungeons through the LFG interface.
  parameters:
  - name: gguid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the group that completed the
      dungeon encounter
  - name: dungeonEncounters
    description: An integer representing the number or type of dungeon encounters
      completed by the group
  - name: currMap
    description: Pointer to the current Map object where the dungeon encounter took
      place, used for context and validation
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in LFG completion handler
    code: "void HandleDungeonCompletion(int groupId, int encounters, const Map* map)\n\
      {\n    LFGMgr::instance().OnDungeonEncounterDone(groupId, encounters, map);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the LFG subsystem upon successful
    dungeon completion. Developers should ensure that all parameters are valid before
    calling this function to avoid unexpected behavior or crashes.
