  method: EvaluateTradeFairness
  signature: bool TradeManager::EvaluateTradeFairness() const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether a trade between two players is fair based on item values
    and player levels.
  description: The EvaluateTradeFairness method determines if the current trade state
    between two players meets fairness criteria within the World of Warcraft trading
    system. It considers factors such as item worth, player levels, and any applicable
    trade modifiers to ensure that neither party gains an unfair advantage. This method
    is typically invoked during trade negotiations to validate the balance of items
    being exchanged. The evaluation may involve comparing the total value of items
    offered by each player, checking for level restrictions, and ensuring no prohibited
    trades occur. It's designed to maintain game economy integrity and prevent exploitation
    through imbalanced trades.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the trade is considered fair according to the game's rules
    and balance criteria; otherwise returns false if the trade is deemed unfair or
    unbalanced.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trade Fairness Check
    code: "if (tradeManager.EvaluateTradeFairness()) {\n    // Proceed with trade\n\
      \    tradeManager.AcceptTrade();\n} else {\n    // Cancel trade due to unfairness\n\
      \    tradeManager.CancelTrade();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs calculations involving item quality, level requirements,
    and monetary values. It may be called automatically during trade updates or manually
    by the game logic when fairness is in question. The implementation might cache
    previous evaluations for performance optimization.
  warnings: Do not assume that a fair trade will always proceed without additional
    validation. Other systems may still reject trades based on different criteria
    such as inventory limits or item restrictions.
