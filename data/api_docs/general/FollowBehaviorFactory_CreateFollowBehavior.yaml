  class: FollowBehaviorFactory
  method: CreateFollowBehavior
  signature: int FollowBehaviorFactory::CreateFollowBehavior(FollowMode mode)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a new follow behavior instance with the specified
    mode.
  description: The CreateFollowBehavior method is responsible for instantiating a
    new follow behavior object within the TrinityCore AI system. This method takes
    a FollowMode parameter that determines how the behavior should function, such
    as whether to follow a target unit or path. It returns an integer identifier that
    can be used to reference the created behavior instance. The method is typically
    invoked during NPC AI initialization or when dynamically assigning follow behaviors
    to creatures. The returned ID allows for subsequent manipulation or removal of
    the behavior through other API methods.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer identifier representing the newly created follow behavior instance.
    A positive value indicates successful creation, while a negative value may indicate
    an error or invalid mode parameter was provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int behaviorId = factory.CreateFollowBehavior(FOLLOW_MODE_FOLLOW);\nif\
      \ (behaviorId >= 0)\n{\n    // Successfully created follow behavior\n    //\
      \ Use behaviorId to manage the behavior later\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the FollowBehaviorFactory has been properly initialized
    and that the FollowMode parameter is valid. The returned behavior ID should be
    stored for future reference as it's required for managing the behavior lifecycle.
