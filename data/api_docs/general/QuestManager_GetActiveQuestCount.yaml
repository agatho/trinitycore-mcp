  signature: uint32 QuestManager::GetActiveQuestCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of active quests assigned to the player
  description: The GetActiveQuestCount method retrieves the number of quests currently
    active for the player character. Active quests are those that have been accepted
    but not yet completed or turned in. This count includes all quest states such
    as in-progress, available, and rewarded quests that haven't been fully concluded.
    The method provides a quick way to determine how many ongoing quest objectives
    the player has without needing to iterate through individual quest entries.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of active quests assigned
    to the player character. Returns 0 if no active quests are present.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Active Quests
    code: "uint32 activeQuestCount = player->GetQuestManager()->GetActiveQuestCount();\n\
      if (activeQuestCount > 0)\n{\n    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      You have %u active quests.\", activeQuestCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Active Quest Count for UI Display
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      uint32 count = player->GetQuestManager()->GetActiveQuestCount();

      // Update UI element showing active quest count

      questCounterLabel->SetText("Active Quests: " + std::to_string(count));'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for UI display purposes, quest tracking, and
    game logic that requires knowledge of the player's current quest load. The implementation
    likely uses internal quest tracking structures to efficiently compute this count
    without iterating through all possible quests.
  warnings: The returned count may not include quests that are in a 'failed' or 'abandoned'
    state, depending on how TrinityCore defines active quests. Ensure proper handling
    of edge cases where the player might be in a state where quest data is not fully
    initialized.
