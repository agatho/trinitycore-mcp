  class: EscortAI
  method: SetPauseTimer
  signature: void EscortAI::SetPauseTimer(int timer)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the pause timer for the EscortAI to control movement timing during escort
    quests.
  description: The SetPauseTimer method configures the internal pause timer used by
    the EscortAI class to manage delays in NPC movement during escort quests. This
    timer controls how long an escorted creature will pause before continuing its
    path, which is essential for creating realistic quest experiences where NPCs might
    stop to interact with environment objects or wait for player input. The timer
    value is specified in milliseconds and affects subsequent movement behavior until
    explicitly reset or overridden by another call.
  parameters:
  - name: timer
    description: The pause duration in milliseconds to set for the escort AI. A value
      of 0 disables the pause, while positive values create a delay before continuing
      movement.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pause Timer Usage
    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    if (quest->GetQuestId()\
      \ == 12345)\n    {\n        // Pause for 2 seconds before continuing\n     \
      \   me->GetAI()->SetPauseTimer(2000);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Pause Timer Based on Quest State
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (HasEscortState(STATE_ESCORT_PAUSED))\n\
      \    {\n        // Resume movement after 1.5 seconds\n        if (m_pauseTimer\
      \ <= diff)\n        {\n            StartNextWaypoint();\n            SetPauseTimer(0);\
      \ // Reset pause timer\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            m_pauseTimer\
      \ -= diff;\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly influences the EscortAI's internal state machine and
    should be called when transitioning between different phases of an escort quest.
    The pause timer is typically used in conjunction with other EscortAI methods like
    StartWaypointMovement() and SetEscortPaused(). It's recommended to use this method
    sparingly to avoid disrupting the natural flow of quest progression.
  warnings: Setting a very large timer value may cause noticeable delays in quest
    progression, potentially frustrating players. Additionally, calling this method
    during active movement without proper state management can lead to unexpected
    behavior or movement glitches. Always ensure that any pause timer is properly
    reset when the escort completes or is interrupted.
