  method: IsBusy
  signature: bool BotLifecycle::IsBusy() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the bot is currently engaged in any active operations or tasks.
  description: The IsBusy method determines whether the bot is currently performing
    any active operations, such as moving, casting spells, attacking, or executing
    other gameplay actions. This method is essential for determining the bot's availability
    for new commands or interactions. The return value indicates the bot's current
    state of activity, which helps in managing bot behavior and preventing conflicts
    during concurrent operations. This check is typically used before initiating new
    actions to ensure the bot is not already occupied.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot is currently engaged in an active operation or
    task; otherwise, returns false if the bot is idle and available for new commands.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Bot Status
    code: "if (!botLifecycle.IsBusy()) {\n    // Bot is idle, safe to assign new task\n\
      \    botLifecycle.AssignNewTask();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsBusy in a Loop for Task Management
    code: "while (true) {\n    if (!botLifecycle.IsBusy()) {\n        // Bot is free,\
      \ perform next action\n        botLifecycle.PerformNextAction();\n    } else\
      \ {\n        // Wait briefly before checking again\n        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically checks internal bot state flags or active action queues
    to determine if any operations are currently in progress. It's recommended to
    cache the result of this check when multiple operations depend on the same state
    to avoid redundant calls.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method in high-frequency loops without proper throttling,
    as it may impact performance. Also, be aware that a bot might appear busy even
    if it's not actively performing actions but is waiting for external conditions
    (e.g., cooldowns or pathfinding).
