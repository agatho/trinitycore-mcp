documentation:
  brief: Registers a battleground instance with the battleground manager for processing
    and tracking.
  description: The AddBattleground method is responsible for registering a Battleground
    instance with the BattlegroundMgr, making it available for handling player entries,
    matchmaking, and game state management. This method is typically called during
    battleground initialization or when a new battleground is created and needs to
    be managed by the system. The battleground instance becomes part of the manager's
    internal collection of active battlegrounds, allowing it to participate in the
    overall battleground lifecycle including start, end, and cleanup operations. This
    registration is essential for the battleground to be properly integrated into
    the game's matchmaking and player assignment systems.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Battleground Registration
    code: 'Battleground* bg = new BattlegroundAV();

      bg->SetBattlegroundId(BG_ID_AV);

      bg->Initialize();

      battlegroundMgr->AddBattleground(bg);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation of the battleground instance
    before adding it. It is assumed that the battleground has been properly initialized
    and configured before being added to the manager. The BattlegroundMgr maintains
    a collection of all active battlegrounds, so repeated calls with the same battleground
    pointer may result in duplicate entries unless handled appropriately.
  warnings: Calling this method with an uninitialized or improperly configured battleground
    instance can lead to undefined behavior during gameplay operations. Ensure that
    the battleground is fully initialized and valid before calling AddBattleground.
