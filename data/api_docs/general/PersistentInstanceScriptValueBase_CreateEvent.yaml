documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns an UpdateAdditionalSaveDataEvent object for persistent
    instance script values.
  description: The CreateEvent method is used to generate a new UpdateAdditionalSaveDataEvent
    instance that can be utilized within the context of persistent instance scripts
    in TrinityCore. This event type is typically employed to manage additional save
    data related to instances, such as custom variables or state information that
    needs to be persisted across server restarts or player logouts. The returned event
    object can then be used to trigger updates or notifications regarding changes
    in the persistent data. This method is part of the PersistentInstanceScriptValueBase
    class and serves as a factory for creating event objects that are integral to
    the instance's save/load mechanism.
  parameters: []
  returns: An UpdateAdditionalSaveDataEvent object representing a new event instance
    that can be used to update or notify about changes in persistent instance data.
    The returned event is initialized with default values and should be populated
    with relevant data before being processed by the system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PersistentInstanceScriptValueBase* script = ...;

      UpdateAdditionalSaveDataEvent event = script->CreateEvent();

      // Use event to update persistent data

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during instance initialization or when new
    persistent data needs to be registered. The returned event object should be properly
    configured with relevant data before being used in any save/load operations. Ensure
    that the event is not used after the instance has been destroyed.
  warnings: Do not call this method on a null pointer; ensure the PersistentInstanceScriptValueBase
    instance exists before invoking CreateEvent. Improper handling of the returned
    event object may lead to data corruption or unexpected behavior in persistent
    instance systems.
