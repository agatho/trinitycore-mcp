documentation:
  brief: Performs emergency healing on a target within the player's group
  description: The HandleEmergencyHealing method is designed to execute an emergency
    healing spell or ability for a targeted group member in the context of a Holy
    Paladin class AI. This method typically activates when the AI detects that a group
    member is critically low on health and requires immediate healing. It evaluates
    the current state of the group, identifies a suitable target based on health percentage
    or threat level, and applies the appropriate healing mechanism. The method returns
    true if the healing action was successfully initiated, and false otherwise. This
    functionality is crucial for maintaining group survivability during high-intensity
    encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if emergency healing was successfully applied to a target;
    returns false if no valid target was found or if the healing could not be executed
    due to game state constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleEmergencyHealing
    code: "if (paladin->HandleEmergencyHealing(nullptr)) {\n    // Emergency healing\
      \ was applied\n    LOG_INFO(\"player\", \"Emergency healing cast successfully\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // No target found or healing failed\n    LOG_WARNING(\"player\"\
      , \"Failed to apply emergency healing\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AI has already determined that emergency healing
    is necessary and should be invoked. It does not perform health checks itself but
    relies on external logic to determine when healing is required. The method may
    interact with internal cooldowns or resource management systems specific to the
    Holy Paladin's healing abilities.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called in appropriate contexts where emergency
    healing is warranted, as excessive use can lead to inefficient resource consumption
    and poor gameplay experience. Avoid calling this method without proper group state
    validation to prevent unnecessary spell casting.
