  signature: void WarlockAI::UpdateWarlockBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the warlock's buffs and aura states based on current spell effects
    and pet status.
  description: The UpdateWarlockBuffs method is responsible for managing and updating
    all active buff-related states for a warlock class AI. This includes checking
    and applying various aura effects such as Demonic Pact, Soul Link, and other warlock-specific
    buffs that depend on the presence of a summoned pet or active spell effects. The
    method evaluates the current state of the warlock's pet, active spells, and aura
    stacks to ensure proper buff application and removal. It typically runs during
    each AI update cycle to maintain accurate buff states for gameplay mechanics like
    damage output, survivability, and resource management.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void WarlockAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    UpdateWarlockBuffs();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the main AI update loop and should
    not be invoked manually outside of AI context. The implementation relies on internal
    state tracking of pet status, spell effects, and aura stacks. Performance is generally
    low as it only processes conditional checks rather than heavy computations.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you understand the internal state
    dependencies. Incorrect invocation may cause buff states to become inconsistent
    with actual spell effects or pet status.
