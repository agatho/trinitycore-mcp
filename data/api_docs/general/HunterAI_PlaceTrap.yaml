  class: HunterAI
  method: PlaceTrap
  signature: void HunterAI::PlaceTrap(int trapSpell, const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Places a trap using the specified spell at the given position.
  description: The PlaceTrap method is used by the HunterAI class to deploy a trap
    in the game world. It takes a trap spell ID and a position coordinate, then attempts
    to place the trap at that location. This method is typically called during AI
    decision-making processes when the hunter needs to set up environmental obstacles
    or control areas. The method does not return any value as it directly modifies
    the game state by creating the trap object.
  parameters:
  - name: trapSpell
    description: The spell ID representing the type of trap to be placed. This should
      correspond to a valid trap spell in the game's spell database.
  - name: pos
    description: A reference to an integer array or coordinate structure that defines
      the position where the trap will be placed. The exact format depends on the
      implementation but typically contains X, Y, Z coordinates.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trap Placement
    code: "void PlaceTrapExample() {\n    int trapPosition[3] = {100, 200, 300};\n\
      \    PlaceTrap(12345, trapPosition);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with AI Decision Logic
    code: "void HunterAI::UpdateAI() {\n    if (CanPlaceTrap()) {\n        int targetPos[3]\
      \ = {enemy->GetPositionX(), enemy->GetPositionY(), enemy->GetPositionZ()};\n\
      \        PlaceTrap(67890, targetPos);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the game's spell system and object placement
    mechanics. It may have internal checks for valid positions and spell availability.
    The position parameter might be validated against terrain or collision detection
    before actual placement occurs.
  warnings: Ensure that the trapSpell ID is valid and corresponds to an actual trap
    spell in the database, otherwise the method may fail silently or cause unexpected
    behavior. The position coordinates must be within valid game world boundaries.
