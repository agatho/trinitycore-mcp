  class: DependencyValidator
  method: LogDependencyReport
  signature: void DependencyValidator::LogDependencyReport()
documentation:
  brief: Logs a detailed report of all dependency validations performed by the DependencyValidator.
  description: The LogDependencyReport method outputs a comprehensive summary of all
    dependency checks that have been executed within the DependencyValidator instance.
    This includes information about validated dependencies, their status (success
    or failure), and any relevant error messages or warnings. The method is typically
    invoked during system startup, configuration changes, or diagnostic operations
    to ensure that all required dependencies are properly resolved and functioning
    as expected. It serves as a debugging and monitoring tool for developers and administrators
    to verify the integrity of system dependencies.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Server Startup
    code: 'DependencyValidator validator;

      // ... perform dependency checks ...

      validator.LogDependencyReport();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Logging Configuration
    code: 'DependencyValidator validator;

      // ... setup and run validations ...

      TC_LOG_INFO("server", "Starting dependency validation report");

      validator.LogDependencyReport();

      TC_LOG_INFO("server", "Dependency validation complete");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from the main thread and may block during
    execution if extensive logging or validation operations are pending. It relies
    on the TrinityCore logging system, so proper log levels must be configured for
    visibility of the output.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently during runtime may impact performance due
    to potential I/O operations involved in generating detailed reports. Avoid calling
    it in high-frequency loops or performance-critical code paths.
