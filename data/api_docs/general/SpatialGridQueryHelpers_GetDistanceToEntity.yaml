  class: SpatialGridQueryHelpers
  method: GetDistanceToEntity
  signature: float SpatialGridQueryHelpers::GetDistanceToEntity(Player * bot, int
    guid)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between a player bot and an
    entity specified by its GUID.
  description: 'The GetDistanceToEntity method computes the straight-line distance
    in world coordinates between the position of the provided Player bot and another
    game entity identified by its global unique identifier (GUID). This utility is
    commonly used in AI behavior scripting, pathfinding, or proximity-based decision
    making within TrinityCore''s game environment. The method assumes that both the
    bot and the target entity are located within the same map instance. It performs
    a direct distance calculation using 3D coordinates without considering obstacles
    or terrain height differences. Precondition: The Player bot must be valid and
    active in the world; the GUID must correspond to an existing entity on the same
    map. Postcondition: Returns a positive floating-point value representing the distance
    in yards.'
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose position
      is used as the starting point for distance calculation.
  - name: guid
    description: Integer value representing the global unique identifier (GUID) of
      the target entity for which the distance is calculated.
  returns: A float value indicating the Euclidean distance in yards between the bot's
    position and the entity specified by the GUID. Returns zero if the bot and entity
    are at the same location, or a negative value if an error occurs during lookup.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: float distance = SpatialGridQueryHelpers::GetDistanceToEntity(playerBot,
      targetGuid);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Distance for AI Decision Making
    code: "if (SpatialGridQueryHelpers::GetDistanceToEntity(bot, targetGuid) < 10.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Perform close-range action\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate positioning data from the TrinityCore server.
    Performance may degrade if called excessively in tight loops due to internal grid
    lookups. The method does not account for movement speed or pathfinding obstacles;
    it only computes straight-line distance.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID corresponds to an entity currently loaded in the
    same map as the bot, otherwise the result will be undefined or may cause errors.
    Avoid calling this method with invalid or uninitialized player pointers.
