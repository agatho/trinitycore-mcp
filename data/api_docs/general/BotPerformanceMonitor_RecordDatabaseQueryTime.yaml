  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: RecordDatabaseQueryTime
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::RecordDatabaseQueryTime(uint32_t botGuid,
    uint64_t microseconds, const std::string & query)
documentation:
  brief: Records the execution time of a database query for a specific bot, including
    the query text and duration in microseconds.
  description: The RecordDatabaseQueryTime method logs performance data for database
    queries executed by a specific bot. It captures the unique identifier (GUID) of
    the bot, the time taken to execute the query in microseconds, and the actual SQL
    query string. This information is typically used for monitoring and optimizing
    bot performance within the TrinityCore framework. The method does not return any
    value but contributes to internal performance tracking mechanisms that help identify
    slow or problematic database operations affecting bot behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which the database query
      was executed. This value identifies the specific bot instance in the game world.
  - name: microseconds
    description: The execution time of the database query, measured in microseconds.
      This value represents how long the query took to complete.
  - name: query
    description: The SQL query string that was executed. This includes the full text
      of the database operation performed by the bot.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      uint64_t queryTime = 1500;

      std::string sqlQuery = "SELECT * FROM bot_inventory WHERE owner_id = 12345";

      monitor.RecordDatabaseQueryTime(botGuid, queryTime, sqlQuery);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with performance monitoring systems
    to track database query efficiency across all bots. It may store data in an internal
    buffer or log file for later analysis. The method should be called immediately
    after a database query completes to ensure accurate timing.
