  class: AllGameObjectsWithEntryInRange
  method: AllGameObjectsWithEntryInRange
  signature: void AllGameObjectsWithEntryInRange::AllGameObjectsWithEntryInRange(const
    int * object, int entry, float maxRange)
documentation:
  brief: Finds all game objects within a specified range that match a given entry
    ID.
  description: The AllGameObjectsWithEntryInRange method searches for all game objects
    in the world that have a specific entry ID and are within a defined maximum range
    from a reference point. This method is typically used by AI scripts, quest systems,
    or other game logic to locate nearby objects of interest. It operates on a per-map
    basis and does not consider object visibility or line-of-sight restrictions. The
    method modifies the provided object pointer to point to the first matching object
    found, or leaves it unchanged if no matches are found within range.
  parameters:
  - name: object
    description: Pointer to an integer that will be updated to reference the first
      game object with the specified entry ID within range. If no objects are found,
      this pointer remains unchanged.
  - name: entry
    description: The unique identifier (entry) of the game object type to search for.
      This corresponds to the 'entry' field in the game object template database.
  - name: maxRange
    description: Maximum distance (in yards) from the reference point within which
      to search for matching game objects. Objects beyond this range will be ignored.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Find nearest treasure chest
    code: "int* treasureChest = nullptr;\nAllGameObjectsWithEntryInRange(&treasureChest,\
      \ 176205, 5.0f); // Find chests within 5 yards\nif (treasureChest != nullptr)\
      \ {\n    // Process the found treasure chest\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Locate nearby quest givers
    code: "int* questGiver = nullptr;\nAllGameObjectsWithEntryInRange(&questGiver,\
      \ 176205, 10.0f); // Find quest givers within 10 yards\nif (questGiver != nullptr)\
      \ {\n    // Trigger quest interaction\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for use in AI scripts and quest logic where
    precise object location is required. It does not perform any filtering based on
    object state or visibility, so it may return objects that are invisible or otherwise
    inaccessible to players. The method is optimized for performance but should be
    used judiciously in frequently called code paths.
  warnings: This method modifies the input pointer directly and does not provide a
    list of all matching objects. If multiple objects match the criteria, only the
    first one found will be returned. Ensure that the object pointer is properly initialized
    before calling to avoid undefined behavior.
