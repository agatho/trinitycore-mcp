documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell is the first rank of a primary profession.
  description: This method checks if the current spell represents the first rank in
    a primary profession skill tree. It returns true when the spell is the initial
    skill point allocation for a primary profession, indicating that it's the starting
    point for that profession's progression. This is commonly used in game mechanics
    to identify the beginning of profession skill trees and to distinguish between
    different levels of skill advancement within the same profession. The method is
    particularly useful for determining whether a player's skill is at its initial
    state when learning a primary profession.

  notes: This method likely relies on internal spell data structures to determine
    if the spell is the first rank in a profession tree. It may be used in conjunction
    with other methods that check for specific spell properties or skill levels.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with other similar methods that check
    for secondary professions or different skill types. The method only applies to
    primary professions and may not work correctly with secondary profession spells.
