documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific aura effect is active on the aura script.
  description: The HasEffect method determines whether a particular aura effect, identified
    by its index, is currently active on the aura script. This method is commonly
    used within AuraScript implementations to conditionally execute logic based on
    the presence or absence of specific effects. The effect index typically corresponds
    to the order in which effects are defined in the spell definition. This check
    is essential for implementing complex aura behaviors where certain actions should
    only occur if a specific effect is active.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified aura effect (identified by effIndex) is currently
    active on the aura script; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AuraScript
    code: "class MyAuraScript : public AuraScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnUpdate(int32\
      \ diff) override\n    {\n        if (HasEffect(0))\n        {\n            //\
      \ Perform action only if effect 0 is active\n            DoSomething();\n  \
      \      }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic Based on Effect Presence
    code: "class AdvancedAuraScript : public AuraScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnPeriodicTick()\
      \ override\n    {\n        if (HasEffect(1) && HasEffect(2))\n        {\n  \
      \          // Both effects 1 and 2 are active\n            DoComplexEffect();\n\
      \        }\n        else if (HasEffect(0))\n        {\n            // Only effect\
      \ 0 is active\n            DoSimpleEffect();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within the context of an AuraScript's
    event handlers or update functions. The effect index must correspond to a valid
    effect defined in the spell that created this aura. It is recommended to cache
    the result of HasEffect if it will be checked multiple times in the same function
    for performance reasons.
  warnings: Calling HasEffect with an invalid effIndex (e.g., one that exceeds the
    number of effects defined in the spell) may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    results. Always ensure that the effect index is valid before calling this method.
