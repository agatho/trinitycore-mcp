  signature: bool ClassAI::HasCombatBehaviors() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the AI instance has any combat behaviors configured.
  description: The HasCombatBehaviors method checks if the ClassAI instance currently
    has any defined combat behaviors assigned to it. This is typically used to determine
    if the AI should engage in combat-related actions or if it's operating in a passive
    state. The method returns true when combat behaviors are present and false otherwise.
    This check is often performed before executing combat-specific logic to avoid
    unnecessary processing or potential errors when no behaviors are defined.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI instance has combat behaviors configured, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (ai->HasCombatBehaviors()) {\n    // Execute combat logic\n    ai->DoCombatAction();\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle non-combat state\n    ai->Idle();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Behavior Execution
    code: "void Unit::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (HasCombatBehaviors()) {\n \
      \       // Perform combat-related updates\n        UpdateCombatBehaviors(diff);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Perform idle or movement updates\n        UpdateIdleBehavior(diff);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in the AI update loop to conditionally execute
    combat logic. It's important to note that the presence of combat behaviors does
    not necessarily mean the unit is currently in combat, but rather that it has been
    configured with behaviors that could be activated during combat.
