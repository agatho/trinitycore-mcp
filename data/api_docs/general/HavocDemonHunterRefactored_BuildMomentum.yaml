documentation:
  brief: Builds momentum for the Havoc Demon Hunter by consuming energy and increasing
    damage output.
  description: The BuildMomentum method is a core mechanic for Havoc Demon Hunters
    that consumes a specified amount of energy to generate momentum, which enhances
    their damage capabilities. This method typically activates when the player performs
    certain abilities or actions that are designed to build up momentum for subsequent
    high-damage attacks. The method checks if sufficient energy is available before
    proceeding with momentum generation. It may also interact with other systems such
    as cooldowns or resource management to ensure balanced gameplay. The momentum
    built through this method often translates into increased critical strike chance,
    damage multipliers, or temporary stat boosts that are crucial for maximizing the
    Demon Hunter's combat effectiveness.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if momentum was successfully built by consuming energy; returns
    false if there was insufficient energy or if the build momentum condition was
    not met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Momentum Building
    code: "if (player->BuildMomentum(nullptr)) {\n    // Momentum successfully built,\
      \ apply effects\n    player->AddAura(MOMENTUM_AURA);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Momentum Build
    code: "if (player->GetPower(POWER_ENERGY) >= MINIMUM_ENERGY_TO_BUILD_MOMENTUM)\
      \ {\n    if (player->BuildMomentum(nullptr)) {\n        // Apply momentum-based\
      \ damage boost\n        player->ModifyDamageDone(1.2f); // 20% damage increase\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during ability execution or resource consumption
    phases. It's important to note that momentum generation may be subject to global
    cooldowns and energy thresholds. The method should not be invoked repeatedly in
    rapid succession without proper resource management.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking energy availability may result in
    unexpected behavior or failed momentum builds. Ensure that energy costs are properly
    validated before invoking the method to avoid game balance issues.
