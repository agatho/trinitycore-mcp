documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes player values for a target player
  description: The BuildValuesCreate method initializes and sets up the player's data
    fields for a specific target player, typically used in player-to-player communication
    or when creating player data structures. This method handles the internal setup
    of player values including flags and data arrays, ensuring proper initialization
    before use. It is commonly employed in scenarios where player data needs to be
    prepared for display or interaction with other players.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array containing player data fields that will
      be initialized by this method
  - name: flags
    description: Integer flags indicating the type of player data being created, such
      as visibility or interaction settings
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to a const Player object representing the target player for
      which values are being created
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      int data[20];

      int flags = 0;

      Player* target = new Player();

      player->BuildValuesCreate(data, flags, target);

  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore's player system and
    may involve memory allocation or initialization of player data fields. Performance
    considerations should be taken into account when handling large arrays of data
    fields.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to memory corruption or incorrect
    player data display. Ensure that the target player object is valid and properly
    initialized before calling this method.
