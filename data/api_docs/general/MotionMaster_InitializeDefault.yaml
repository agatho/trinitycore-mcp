documentation:
  brief: Initializes the default movement behavior for a creature or player.
  description: The InitializeDefault method sets up the standard movement patterns
    for a creature or player within the TrinityCore framework. This method establishes
    the base movement state that will be used when no specific movement is active,
    ensuring that entities have proper default behavior for navigation and pathfinding.
    It typically initializes the movement manager with a default idle state, allowing
    the entity to perform basic movement operations such as walking, running, or standing
    without any special movement commands.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void exampleFunction() {\n    MotionMaster* mm = new MotionMaster();\n\
      \    mm->InitializeDefault();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during initialization of creature or player
    movement systems. It should be invoked only once per entity to avoid conflicts
    with existing movement states.
