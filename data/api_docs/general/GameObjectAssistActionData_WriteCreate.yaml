  class: GameObjectAssistActionData
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void GameObjectAssistActionData::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const
    GameObject * owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes GameObject assist action data to a ByteBuffer for client synchronization.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the GameObjectAssistActionData object
    into a ByteBuffer format suitable for network transmission to a specific player
    client. This method is typically invoked during the creation or update of GameObjects
    in the game world, ensuring that relevant assist action data is properly communicated
    to players who interact with the object. The serialization process includes all
    necessary fields required by the client to correctly interpret and display the
    GameObject's assist-related behavior, such as quest objectives, interaction triggers,
    or other dynamic properties. This method operates under the assumption that the
    provided owner GameObject and receiver Player are valid and properly initialized
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where serialized data will be written.
      This buffer is used for constructing the network packet sent to the client.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the GameObject instance that owns this assist action data.
      Must not be null and should represent a valid GameObject in the game world.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player who will receive this data. Must not be null
      and should be a valid player object connected to the server.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in GameObject creation
    code: 'GameObjectAssistActionData assistData;

      // ... populate assistData with relevant information ...

      ByteBuffer buffer;

      Player* player = ...; // valid player reference

      GameObject* go = ...;   // valid game object reference

      assistData.WriteCreate(buffer, go, player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's packet serialization system and
    should only be called when preparing data for network transmission. Ensure that
    all referenced GameObject and Player objects remain valid throughout the execution
    of this method to prevent undefined behavior.
