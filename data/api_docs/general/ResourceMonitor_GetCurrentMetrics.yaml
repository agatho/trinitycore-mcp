  method: GetCurrentMetrics
  signature: ResourceMetrics ResourceMonitor::GetCurrentMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current system resource metrics including CPU, memory, and
    network usage.
  description: The GetCurrentMetrics method collects and returns a snapshot of the
    current system resource utilization within the TrinityCore server. This includes
    information such as CPU load percentage, memory consumption, and network I/O statistics.
    The returned ResourceMetrics object encapsulates these values in a structured
    format that can be used for monitoring, debugging, or performance optimization
    purposes. This method is typically invoked by administrative tools or internal
    monitoring systems to assess server health and resource allocation. It provides
    real-time data points that reflect the instantaneous state of system resources
    at the moment of invocation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ResourceMetrics object containing current system resource statistics
    including CPU usage percentage, memory usage in bytes, network input/output rates,
    and other relevant performance indicators. The structure of this object allows
    for easy access to individual metrics for analysis or display purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ResourceMetrics metrics = sResourceMonitor->GetCurrentMetrics();

      std::cout << "CPU Usage: " << metrics.cpuUsage << "%" << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Memory Usage: " << metrics.memoryUsage << " bytes" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Resource Usage Over Time
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)\n{\n    ResourceMetrics metrics = sResourceMonitor->GetCurrentMetrics();\n\
      \    LOG_INFO(\"server\", \"CPU: {}% | Memory: {} MB\", \n             metrics.cpuUsage,\
      \ \n             metrics.memoryUsage / (1024 * 1024));\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(5));\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lightweight snapshot of current resource usage and
    should not significantly impact server performance. The ResourceMetrics structure
    is designed to be thread-safe for reading operations, though concurrent modifications
    may occur during active monitoring. It's recommended to cache results when frequent
    polling is required to avoid unnecessary overhead.
  warnings: The returned metrics are snapshots at a specific point in time and may
    not reflect long-term trends or sustained usage patterns. For accurate performance
    analysis over extended periods, consider implementing periodic sampling rather
    than relying on single readings.
