    & setBackpackAutosortDisabled)
documentation:
  brief: Toggles the backpack autosort disabled setting for the player's session.
  description: This method handles the client packet that informs the server whether
    the player has disabled the automatic sorting of items in their backpack. When
    enabled, the client will not automatically sort inventory items when they are
    added or modified. The setting is stored per session and affects only the current
    player's session behavior. This functionality allows players to disable auto-sorting
    if they prefer manual organization of their inventory.
  parameters:
  - name: setBackpackAutosortDisabled
    description: A packet containing the state of the backpack autosort disabled flag
      sent from the client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSetBackpackAutosortDisabled(const WorldPackets::Item::SetBackpackAutosortDisabled\
      \ & setBackpackAutosortDisabled)\n{\n    // Store the setting in session data\n\
      \    SetBackpackAutosortDisabled(setBackpackAutosortDisabled.Disabled);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the packet handling system when
    a client sends an update about their inventory sorting preferences. The setting
    may be persisted in the player's database record or session data to maintain consistency
    across sessions.
