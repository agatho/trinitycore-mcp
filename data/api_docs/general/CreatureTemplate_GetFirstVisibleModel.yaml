  method: GetFirstVisibleModel
  signature: const CreatureModel * CreatureTemplate::GetFirstVisibleModel() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the first visible creature model associated with this creature template.
  description: The GetFirstVisibleModel method retrieves the initial visible model
    definition for a creature template. This model is typically used when the creature
    spawns and determines its default visual appearance. The returned CreatureModel
    object contains information about the model's ID, gender, and other display-related
    properties. In TrinityCore, creature templates can have multiple models defined,
    but this method specifically returns the first one that should be visible to players.
    This is commonly used during creature creation and model selection processes in
    the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a const CreatureModel object representing the first visible
    model for this creature template, or nullptr if no visible model is defined.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "CreatureTemplate* creatureTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetCreatureTemplate(12345);\n\
      const CreatureModel* model = creatureTemplate->GetFirstVisibleModel();\nif (model)\n\
      {\n    // Use model data\n    uint32 modelId = model->modelid;\n    uint8 gender\
      \ = model->gender;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Model Validity
    code: "CreatureTemplate* creatureTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetCreatureTemplate(54321);\n\
      const CreatureModel* firstModel = creatureTemplate->GetFirstVisibleModel();\n\
      if (firstModel != nullptr)\n{\n    // Safe to access model properties\n    uint32\
      \ displayId = firstModel->modelid;\n    uint8 displayGender = firstModel->gender;\n\
      \    // Proceed with logic using these values\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case\
      \ where no visible model exists\n    sLog->outError(\"Creature template %u has\
      \ no visible models defined.\", creatureTemplate->Entry);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used during creature spawning and model assignment.
    The returned CreatureModel pointer should not be modified as it's part of the
    static template data. If a creature template has multiple models defined, this
    method returns the first one in the list that is marked as visible. Performance-wise,
    this is a fast lookup operation since it's typically cached or directly indexed
    from the template data structure.
  warnings: Be sure to check for null return values before accessing model properties,
    as some creature templates might not have any visible models defined. Modifying
    the returned CreatureModel pointer directly could lead to unexpected behavior
    since these are part of static template data structures.
