  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: CoordinateResourceUsage
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::CoordinateResourceUsage(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates resource usage for a group within an instance.
  description: The CoordinateResourceUsage method manages and synchronizes resource
    allocation among group members during instance encounters. It ensures that shared
    resources, such as loot, quest items, or instance-specific mechanics, are properly
    distributed according to group composition and instance rules. This method typically
    handles the logic for determining which group members can access certain resources
    and when those resources become available. The method operates within the context
    of TrinityCore's instance management system and is crucial for maintaining game
    balance and preventing resource conflicts during group activities.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group whose resource
      usage needs coordination. Must be a valid group pointer with at least one member,
      otherwise the method may have undefined behavior or no effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (playerGroup)\n{\n    instanceCoordination->CoordinateResourceUsage(playerGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Instance Encounter Resource Management
    code: "void InstanceScript::OnPlayerEnter(Player* player)\n{\n    Group* group\
      \ = player->GetGroup();\n    if (group && group->isRaidGroup())\n    {\n   \
      \     instanceCoordination->CoordinateResourceUsage(group);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during instance entry or when significant
    resource changes occur. It may perform synchronization operations that could impact
    performance if called excessively in rapid succession. The method assumes proper
    group membership validation and should not be called with null or invalid group
    pointers.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer will likely cause a crash.
    Ensure the group is valid and has members before calling. This method may modify
    internal state that affects other systems, so it should only be called at appropriate
    times during instance progression.
