  brief: Returns the portrait giver's name for a quest.
  description: This method retrieves the name of the NPC who provides the quest portrait,
    typically used in quest-related UI elements and dialogues. The returned string
    represents the display name of the quest giver as it appears in-game, which may
    differ from the actual NPC name depending on how the quest is configured. This
    method is commonly used when displaying quest information in the quest log or
    during quest dialogue interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const reference to a std::string containing the portrait giver's
    name for the quest. If no portrait giver is set, it returns an empty string.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Quest class and relies on internal quest data
    structures. It's typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to build complete quest information for display purposes.
  warnings: Be aware that this method may return an empty string if no portrait giver
    is defined for the quest, which could happen in certain edge cases or custom quest
    configurations.
