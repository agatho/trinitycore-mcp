  class: AdaptiveSpawnThrottler
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool AdaptiveSpawnThrottler::Initialize(ResourceMonitor * resourceMonitor,
    SpawnCircuitBreaker * circuitBreaker)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the adaptive spawn throttler with resource monitoring and circuit
    breaker components.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the AdaptiveSpawnThrottler by associating
    it with a ResourceMonitor instance for tracking system resources and a SpawnCircuitBreaker
    for managing spawn limits. This method prepares the throttler to dynamically adjust
    spawn rates based on current system load and configured thresholds. It must be
    called before any other operations on the throttler can take effect, as it establishes
    the necessary dependencies for adaptive behavior. The initialization process validates
    that both required components are properly configured and ready for use.
  parameters:
  - name: resourceMonitor
    description: Pointer to a ResourceMonitor instance that tracks system resource
      usage including CPU, memory, and other performance metrics. Must not be null.
  - name: circuitBreaker
    description: Pointer to a SpawnCircuitBreaker instance that manages spawn rate
      limits and prevents system overload. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if initialization was successful and both components were
    properly attached; returns false if either parameter is null or initialization
    fails due to component misconfiguration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: "AdaptiveSpawnThrottler throttler;\nResourceMonitor* monitor = new ResourceMonitor();\n\
      SpawnCircuitBreaker* breaker = new SpawnCircuitBreaker();\n\nbool success =\
      \ throttler.Initialize(monitor, breaker);\nif (success) {\n    // Throttler\
      \ is ready for use\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization with Error Handling
    code: "AdaptiveSpawnThrottler throttler;\nResourceMonitor* monitor = GetResourceMonitor();\n\
      SpawnCircuitBreaker* breaker = GetSpawnCircuitBreaker();\n\nif (!monitor ||\
      \ !breaker) {\n    // Handle missing components\n    return false;\n}\n\nbool\
      \ initialized = throttler.Initialize(monitor, breaker);\nif (!initialized) {\n\
      \    // Log error and potentially fall back to default behavior\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to initialize AdaptiveSpawnThrottler\");\n    return false;\n}\n\n//\
      \ Proceed with normal operation"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a one-time setup and should only be called once during
    the object's lifecycle. The ResourceMonitor and SpawnCircuitBreaker instances
    must remain valid for the duration of the throttler's usage. The initialization
    process does not start monitoring automatically; it merely configures the components
    for later use.
  warnings: Calling Initialize with null pointers will result in a failed initialization
    and potentially undefined behavior if subsequent methods are invoked without proper
    setup. Ensure that both ResourceMonitor and SpawnCircuitBreaker are fully constructed
    and configured before calling this method.
