documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the object is a game object.
  description: The IsGameObject method checks if the current Object instance represents
    a Game Object within the TrinityCore framework. This method is essential for distinguishing
    between different types of objects in the game world, particularly when dealing
    with object hierarchies and type-specific operations. It returns true if the object
    is a Game Object, false otherwise. The method is commonly used in conditional
    statements to validate object types before performing Game Object-specific operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the object is a Game Object, false otherwise. This boolean
    value indicates the type of object being examined.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (obj->IsGameObject())\n{\n    // Perform Game Object specific operations\n\
      \    GameObject* go = obj->ToGameObject();\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Object hierarchy and relies on dynamic casting
    to determine object type. It should be used carefully in performance-critical
    code sections as it involves type checking operations. The method is thread-safe
    when used properly.
  warnings: Avoid using this method in scenarios where performance is critical without
    proper optimization, as it may involve multiple type checks. Also, ensure that
    the object has been properly initialized before calling this method.
