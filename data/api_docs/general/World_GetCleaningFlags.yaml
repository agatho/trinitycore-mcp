api:
  class: World
  method: GetCleaningFlags
  signature: uint32 World::GetCleaningFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current cleaning flags used by the world system to determine
    which data should be cleaned up during server maintenance.
  description: The GetCleaningFlags method retrieves a bitmask representing the active
    cleaning flags within the World object. These flags control various aspects of
    server cleanup operations, such as removing expired game objects, cleaning up
    temporary data structures, or handling database cleanup routines. The returned
    value is typically used internally by the TrinityCore server to make decisions
    about what resources can be safely removed during periodic maintenance cycles.
    This method does not modify any state and is read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 bitmask where each bit represents a specific cleaning operation
    flag. Common flags may include values like CLEANING_FLAG_GAMEOBJECTS, CLEANING_FLAG_UNITS,
    CLEANING_FLAG_ITEMS, etc., depending on the implementation details of the TrinityCore
    codebase.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 cleaningFlags = sWorld->GetCleaningFlags();\nif (cleaningFlags &\
      \ CLEANING_FLAG_GAMEOBJECTS)\n{\n    // Handle GameObject cleanup logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Debugging Cleaning Flags
    code: 'uint32 flags = sWorld->GetCleaningFlags();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("world", "Current cleaning flags: 0x%08X", flags);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or maintenance
    routines. The exact meaning of each bit in the returned bitmask depends on the
    specific implementation within TrinityCore's World class and may vary between
    different versions of the core.
  warnings: Be cautious when interpreting individual bits of the returned value as
    their meanings are not standardized across all TrinityCore versions. Always refer
    to the current source code for accurate flag definitions.
