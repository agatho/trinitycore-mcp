  class: PlayerChoiceData
  method: PlayerChoiceData
  signature: void PlayerChoiceData::PlayerChoiceData(uint32 choiceId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a PlayerChoiceData object with the specified choice identifier.
  description: The PlayerChoiceData constructor initializes a new instance of the
    PlayerChoiceData class using the provided choiceId parameter. This class is typically
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to manage player choices within interactive
    quest systems or dialogue options. The choiceId parameter uniquely identifies
    which specific choice or option is being initialized. This method sets up internal
    data structures required for handling player interactions with choice-based content,
    such as quest rewards, NPC dialogues, or other interactive elements that present
    players with multiple options. The initialization process ensures that all necessary
    metadata and state information are properly configured for subsequent operations
    on the choice.
  parameters:
  - name: choiceId
    description: A unique identifier for the player choice option. This value typically
      corresponds to an entry in the player_choice table within the TrinityCore database,
      representing a specific dialogue option or quest reward choice available to
      players.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic PlayerChoiceData Initialization
    code: 'PlayerChoiceData choice(12345);

      // Initializes a new PlayerChoiceData object for choice ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using PlayerChoiceData in Quest Handling
    code: "void HandlePlayerChoice(Player* player, uint32 choiceId)\n{\n    PlayerChoiceData\
      \ choice(choiceId);\n    // Process the player's choice selection\n    if (choice.IsValid())\n\
      \    {\n        // Apply choice effects\n        player->AddItem(12345, 1);\
      \ // Example reward\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by TrinityCore's quest and
    dialogue systems. Developers should ensure that the choiceId parameter corresponds
    to a valid entry in the database before calling this constructor. The PlayerChoiceData
    class may perform validation checks during initialization to verify that the provided
    choiceId exists in the system.
  warnings: Incorrect choiceId values may lead to undefined behavior or failed operations
    when attempting to process player choices. Always validate choice IDs against
    existing database entries before constructing PlayerChoiceData objects. This constructor
    does not perform any automatic database lookups; it simply initializes the object
    with the provided ID.
