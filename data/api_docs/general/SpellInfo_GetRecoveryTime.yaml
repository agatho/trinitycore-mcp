  class: SpellInfo
  method: GetRecoveryTime
  signature: uint32 SpellInfo::GetRecoveryTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the recovery time of the spell in milliseconds.
  description: The GetRecoveryTime method retrieves the cooldown period associated
    with a spell, which determines how long it takes for the spell to become available
    again after being used. This value is crucial for game mechanics involving spell
    cooldowns, mana costs, and player resource management. The recovery time is typically
    defined in the spell's data and represents the time interval in milliseconds that
    must pass before the spell can be used again.
  parameters: []
  returns: Represents the recovery time of the spell in milliseconds, indicating how
    long the spell must wait before it can be used again after activation. A value
    of 0 means the spell has no cooldown or recovery time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 recoveryTime = spellInfo->GetRecoveryTime();\nif (recoveryTime >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Spell is on cooldown\n    // Do something with the cooldown\
      \ period\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SpellInfo class and is typically used in conjunction
    with other spell-related methods to manage game mechanics such as spell cooldowns,
    resource consumption, and player behavior. Performance-wise, this method is lightweight
    and does not involve any complex calculations or database queries.
  warnings: Be aware that some spells may have zero recovery time due to their nature
    or special effects, which could lead to misinterpretation if not handled properly
    in code logic. Also, the recovery time might be affected by various factors like
    talent bonuses or buffs effects.
