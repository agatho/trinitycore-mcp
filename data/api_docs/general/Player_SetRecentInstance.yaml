  class: Player
  method: SetRecentInstance
  signature: void Player::SetRecentInstance(uint32 mapId, uint32 instanceId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the recent instance ID for the player's current map.
  description: This method updates the player's recent instance information by storing
    the instance ID associated with a specific map. It is used to track which instance
    the player last entered, allowing the game to properly handle instance-related
    mechanics such as dungeon tracking, loot distribution, and quest completion. The
    method does not directly affect gameplay but rather maintains internal state for
    instance-based systems.
  parameters:
  - name: mapId
    description: The map ID of the instance being set. This represents the unique
      identifier for a specific map or zone within the game world.
  - name: instanceId
    description: The instance ID of the current instance being set. This is the unique
      identifier for the instance that the player has recently entered.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetRecentInstance(123, 456);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework to
    maintain instance tracking state. It should be called when a player enters an
    instance, such as in dungeon or raid encounters. Performance considerations are
    minimal as this is a simple assignment operation.
  warnings: This method should not be called without proper context of instance entry.
    Incorrect usage may lead to incorrect tracking of instance completion status and
    potentially affect quest progression or loot distribution.
