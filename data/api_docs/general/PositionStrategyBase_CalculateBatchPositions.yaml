  class: PositionStrategyBase
  method: CalculateBatchPositions
  signature: int PositionStrategyBase::CalculateBatchPositions(int requests, FormationType
    formation)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the number of positions for a given formation type
    based on the number of requests.
  description: The CalculateBatchPositions method determines how many individual positions
    are required to fulfill a specified number of formation requests. This method
    is typically used in AI and positioning systems within TrinityCore to manage group
    formations, such as those used by NPCs or player groups. It takes into account
    the formation type (e.g., line, circle, wedge) and the number of entities involved
    to compute an appropriate batch size for positioning calculations. The result
    represents the total count of positions needed for the specified formation configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: requests
    description: The number of formation requests or entities that need to be positioned.
      Must be a non-negative integer.
  - name: formation
    description: The type of formation to calculate positions for. Should be one of
      the predefined FormationType values such as LINE, CIRCLE, WEDGE, etc.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the calculated number of positions required
    for the given formation and request count. A negative value may indicate an error
    or invalid input.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int positions = positionStrategy->CalculateBatchPositions(5, FormationType::LINE);
      // Calculates positions for 5 entities in a line formation
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling Example
    code: int result = positionStrategy->CalculateBatchPositions(-1, FormationType::CIRCLE);
      // Returns negative value indicating invalid input
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PositionStrategyBase class and is intended for
    internal use in AI positioning logic. The actual implementation may vary depending
    on the specific formation type and game context. It's recommended to validate
    inputs before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid formation types or negative request counts
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. Ensure that FormationType
    values are properly defined and that requests is a valid non-negative integer.
