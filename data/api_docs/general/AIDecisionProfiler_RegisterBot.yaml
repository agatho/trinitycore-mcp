  class: AIDecisionProfiler
  method: RegisterBot
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::RegisterBot(uint32_t botGuid, uint8_t botClass,
    uint8_t botLevel, uint8_t specialization)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a bot with the AI decision profiler, associating it with class,
    level, and specialization data.
  description: The RegisterBot method is used to register a bot within the AI decision
    profiling system. It associates a unique bot identifier (GUID) with specific game
    attributes such as class, level, and specialization. This registration allows
    the profiler to track and analyze AI decisions made by the bot during gameplay.
    The method is typically called when a bot is created or initialized in the game
    world. It does not return any value but updates internal tracking structures for
    profiling purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot being registered. This value
      must be a valid 32-bit unsigned integer representing the bot's identity in the
      game world.
  - name: botClass
    description: The class of the bot, represented as an 8-bit unsigned integer. Valid
      values correspond to the standard WoW class IDs (e.g., 1 for Warrior, 2 for
      Paladin, etc.).
  - name: botLevel
    description: The level of the bot, represented as an 8-bit unsigned integer. Must
      be a valid player level within the game's supported range.
  - name: specialization
    description: The specialization or role of the bot, represented as an 8-bit unsigned
      integer. This typically corresponds to class-specific roles (e.g., Tank, Healer,
      DPS) and may vary by class.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Registration
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      profiler.RegisterBot(123456, 3, 80, 1); // Register a Mage bot at level 80 with
      specialization 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering Multiple Bots
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      profiler.RegisterBot(1001, 1, 60, 2); // Warrior bot

      profiler.RegisterBot(1002, 2, 60, 3); // Paladin bot

      profiler.RegisterBot(1003, 4, 60, 1); // Rogue bot'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with AI decision profiling systems
    to monitor and analyze bot behavior. The profiler maintains internal data structures
    for each registered bot, which may consume memory proportional to the number of
    bots being tracked. Ensure that bot GUIDs are unique to avoid conflicts in tracking.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or out-of-range values for botClass,
    botLevel, or specialization may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect profiling
    data. Always validate input parameters before calling this function.
