  brief: Updates the mana cost modifier for arcane charge resource usage.
  description: The UpdateManaCostModifier method recalculates and applies any changes
    to the mana cost modifier associated with arcane charge resources. This typically
    occurs when a player's spell power, buffs, or other game state factors affect
    how much mana is consumed when using arcane-based abilities. The method ensures
    that the current mana cost modifier is synchronized with the player's active effects
    and class-specific modifiers.

    code: 'ArcaneChargeResource* resource = player->GetArcaneChargeResource();

  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when spell
    modifiers or player state changes occur. It may be invoked during combat state
    updates, buff application, or spell casting events.
