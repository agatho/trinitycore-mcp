  class: ObjectMgr
  method: IsValidCharterName
  signature: bool ObjectMgr::IsValidCharterName(std::string_view name)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a given string is a valid charter name according to World
    of Warcraft naming rules.
  description: The IsValidCharterName method checks if a provided string conforms
    to the naming restrictions enforced by the TrinityCore server for guild charters.
    This validation ensures that charter names do not contain invalid characters,
    exceed length limits, or violate reserved naming patterns. The method performs
    case-insensitive checks and considers Unicode-aware character validation. It is
    typically used during guild creation or charter modification processes to prevent
    invalid names from being accepted into the game database.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The string to validate as a potential charter name. Must be a valid
      UTF-8 encoded string view.
  returns: Returns true if the provided name is valid according to the server's charter
    naming rules; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "if (sObjectMgr->IsValidCharterName(\"MyGuild\")) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ guild creation\n}\nelse {\n    // Handle invalid name\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in Guild Creation Context
    code: "std::string charterName = \"AlphaBetaGamma\";\nif (!sObjectMgr->IsValidCharterName(charterName))\
      \ {\n    SendSystemMessage(\"Invalid guild charter name.\");\n    return false;\n\
      }\n// Continue with valid charter name processing"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal character set validation tables and may
    enforce length limits (e.g., maximum 24 characters). It is designed to be fast
    and thread-safe for use in high-frequency operations such as player interactions
    with guild systems.
  warnings: Do not rely on this method alone for complete sanitization; additional
    checks should be performed before storing names in the database. Names that pass
    validation may still conflict with existing guilds or be filtered by other subsystems.
