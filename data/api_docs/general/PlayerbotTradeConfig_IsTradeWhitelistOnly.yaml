  class: PlayerbotTradeConfig
  method: IsTradeWhitelistOnly
  signature: bool PlayerbotTradeConfig::IsTradeWhitelistOnly()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player bot's trading behavior is restricted to a whitelist-only
    mode.
  description: The IsTradeWhitelistOnly method checks if the player bot is configured
    to only trade with entries that are explicitly allowed in the trade whitelist.
    When enabled, the bot will refuse to trade with any NPC or player not present
    in the predefined whitelist, regardless of other trading conditions or rules.
    This setting is typically used in automated bot configurations to enforce strict
    trading policies and prevent unintended trades. The method returns a boolean value
    indicating the current state of this restriction.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player bot is configured to trade exclusively with
    whitelisted entries; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check Trade Whitelist Mode
    code: "if (playerbot->GetTradeConfig()->IsTradeWhitelistOnly()) {\n    // Bot\
      \ will only trade with whitelisted entries\n    sLog->outString(\"Player bot\
      \ is in whitelist-only trading mode.\");\n} else {\n    // Bot may trade with\
      \ any valid trader\n    sLog->outString(\"Player bot allows trading with all\
      \ valid traders.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal configuration settings or data
    structures that define the whitelist. It is important to note that this setting
    may be overridden by other bot behavior configurations or global server settings
    in TrinityCore.
