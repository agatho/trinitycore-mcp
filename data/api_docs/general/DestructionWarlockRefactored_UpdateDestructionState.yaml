documentation:
  brief: Updates the destruction state of the warlock based on current spell effects
    and combat conditions.
  description: The UpdateDestructionState method is responsible for managing and updating
    the internal state of a destruction warlock class instance. This includes tracking
    active spell effects, cooldowns, damage over time (DoT) applications, and other
    destruction-specific mechanics. The method evaluates the current combat situation
    and adjusts the warlock's destruction abilities accordingly, ensuring proper resource
    management and spell prioritization. It typically runs during each update cycle
    of the AI behavior system, synchronizing the warlock's state with the game world's
    evolving conditions.

  - title: Basic State Update Call
    code: 'DestructionWarlockRefactored warlock;

      warlock.UpdateDestructionState();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the AI update loop and should
    not be invoked manually unless implementing custom behavior. The method may perform
    internal checks for spell availability, target validity, and resource requirements
    before updating state.
  warnings: Invoking this method outside of the proper AI update context may lead
    to inconsistent state management or unexpected behavior. Ensure that all prerequisites
    for destruction abilities are met before calling this method.
