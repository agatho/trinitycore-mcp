documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of a specified game object type within
    the instance.
  description: The GetObjectGuid method retrieves the globally unique identifier (GUID)
    associated with a specific game object type defined by the instance script. This
    method is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to access and manage
    object references within dungeon or raid instances. The returned GUID can be used
    for various purposes such as tracking, interaction, or reference management. The
    method operates on a predefined set of object types that are registered with the
    instance script, and it returns an invalid GUID if no matching object is found
    or if the type is not supported.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the GUID of the specified game object type, or an invalid GUID
    (typically 0) if no object exists for the given type. The GUID uniquely identifies
    the game object within the server's context.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve the GUID of a specific door in a dungeon instance
    code: "class ExampleInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    void\
      \ Initialize() override\n    {\n        uint32 doorGuid = GetObjectGuid(TYPE_DOOR);\n\
      \        if (doorGuid)\n        {\n            // Use the door GUID for further\
      \ operations\n            // For example, opening or closing the door\n    \
      \    }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in instance scripts to manage object references
    and ensure proper interaction with game objects. The method assumes that object
    types are properly registered with the instance script during initialization.
    It's important to note that the returned GUID should be validated before use,
    as it may be zero if no object exists for the specified type.
  warnings: Using an invalid or uninitialized GUID can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Always validate the return value before using it in operations that
    require a valid object reference. The method might not work correctly if called
    before the instance script has been properly initialized with all required object
    types.
