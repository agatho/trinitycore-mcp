  class: BotSpawnerOptimized
  method: SpawnBot
  signature: bool BotSpawnerOptimized::SpawnBot(int targetGuid, uint32 level, uint32
    classId)
documentation:
  brief: Spawns a bot with the specified target GUID, level, and class ID.
  description: The SpawnBot method is responsible for creating and initializing a
    new bot character within the World of Warcraft environment using TrinityCore's
    framework. It takes a target GUID which identifies the player or entity the bot
    will be associated with, a level value that determines the bot's power and stats,
    and a class ID that defines the bot's role and abilities. The method ensures proper
    initialization of the bot's attributes, inventory, and behavior patterns before
    adding it to the game world. This function is typically used in automated testing
    scenarios, bot management systems, or custom game mechanics where dynamic NPC
    generation is required.
  parameters:
  - name: targetGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target player or entity that
      the bot will be associated with. This GUID must correspond to an existing object
      in the game world.
  - name: level
    description: The level of the bot character to be spawned. Valid values are typically
      between 1 and 80, though may vary based on server configuration and expansion
      support.
  - name: classId
    description: The class identifier that determines the bot's role and abilities.
      Valid values correspond to standard WoW class IDs (e.g., 1 for Warrior, 2 for
      Paladin, etc.).
  returns: Returns true if the bot was successfully spawned and initialized within
    the game world; returns false if the spawning process failed due to invalid parameters,
    resource constraints, or other initialization errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Spawn
    code: "BotSpawnerOptimized spawner;\nbool success = spawner.SpawnBot(12345, 60,\
      \ 3);\nif (success) {\n    // Bot successfully spawned\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Spawn Multiple Bots
    code: "BotSpawnerOptimized spawner;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {\n    uint32\
      \ guid = 10000 + i;\n    bool result = spawner.SpawnBot(guid, 70, 4);\n    if\
      \ (!result) {\n        // Handle failure case\n        break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may have performance implications when called frequently due
    to the overhead of creating new game objects and initializing their components.
    The method assumes that the target GUID exists in the database and that the specified
    level and class ID are valid for the current expansion. Consider batching multiple
    spawn operations if performance is critical.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid parameters such as an invalid GUID, out-of-range
    level values, or non-existent class IDs may result in undefined behavior or crashes.
    Always validate input parameters before invoking this method. Additionally, ensure
    that sufficient server resources are available to handle bot spawning requests.
