    This function typically handles the cleanup of scenario-related data, distribution
    of rewards, and updating player progress or achievements. It ensures that all

  notes: This method should only be called when a scenario has been successfully completed
    by all group members. It assumes that all necessary validation and checks have
    already been performed before invocation.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the scenario is actually complete
    may result in incorrect reward distribution or data corruption. Ensure proper
    synchronization if used in multi-threaded contexts.
