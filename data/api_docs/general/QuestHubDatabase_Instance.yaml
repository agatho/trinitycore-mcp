documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the QuestHubDatabase class
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the QuestHubDatabase
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the database manager exists throughout
    the application lifecycle. This method provides global access to the quest hub
    database functionality, allowing various subsystems to interact with the shared
    database without requiring explicit instantiation. The returned reference is guaranteed
    to be valid and initialized, making it safe to use immediately after calling.
    This pattern is commonly used in TrinityCore for managing persistent data stores
    that need to be accessed from multiple components.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the single global instance of QuestHubDatabase. The returned
    reference is always valid and should not be null or destroyed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'QuestHubDatabase& db = QuestHubDatabase::Instance();

      // Use the database instance for operations

      bool result = db.ExecuteQuery("SELECT * FROM quest_data");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Database Methods
    code: "QuestHubDatabase& db = QuestHubDatabase::Instance();\nstd::string query\
      \ = \"INSERT INTO quest_log (player_id, quest_id) VALUES (12345, 67890)\";\n\
      if (db.ExecuteQuery(query)) {\n    // Handle successful insertion\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it's designed for use in a multi-threaded environment.
    The singleton instance is typically initialized during server startup and remains
    valid throughout the application lifetime. Developers should avoid creating additional
    instances of QuestHubDatabase, as this would violate the singleton pattern.
  warnings: Do not attempt to manually destroy or delete the returned reference, as
    it's managed by the singleton pattern. Calling this method in a multithreaded
    environment is safe, but ensure that database operations themselves are properly
    synchronized if needed.
