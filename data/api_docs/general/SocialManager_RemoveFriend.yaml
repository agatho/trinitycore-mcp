  signature: bool SocialManager::RemoveFriend(int playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a friend from the player's social list by GUID.
  description: The RemoveFriend method removes a specified player from the calling
    player's friend list within the TrinityCore social system. This operation updates
    both the in-memory social data and persists the change to the database. The method
    returns true if the friend was successfully removed, or false if the friend was
    not found in the player's social list. This functionality is part of the game's
    social mechanics that allow players to manage their friend relationships.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player to be removed from
      the friend list. Must correspond to a valid online or offline player in the
      database.
  returns: Returns true if the friend was successfully removed from the social list,
    false if the specified player GUID was not found in the current player's friend
    list.
  examples:
  - title: Remove a Friend by GUID
    code: "if (socialMgr->RemoveFriend(12345)) {\n    // Friend successfully removed\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Friend removed successfully.\");\n} else {\n    // Friend\
      \ not found in list\n    sLog->outString(\"Friend was not found in the friend\
      \ list.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player's social data has already been loaded
    into memory. The actual removal involves database operations and may have performance
    implications if called frequently in a loop. It is recommended to validate the
    GUID before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent player GUID may result
    in a false return value without any error messages. Ensure that the player GUID
    corresponds to a valid friend before attempting removal.
