  brief: Moves ownership of a SharedInstanceLockData object to another instance.
  description: The SharedInstanceLockData constructor that accepts an rvalue reference
    serves as a move constructor. It transfers the internal state and resources from
    the source object to the newly created object, leaving the source object in a
    valid but unspecified state. This is commonly used in scenarios where temporary
    objects or moved-from instances need to be efficiently transferred without deep
    copying. In the context of TrinityCore's shared instance locking system, this
    constructor allows for efficient resource management when handling lock data objects
    during instance creation or destruction processes.

  examples:
  - title: Move construction of SharedInstanceLockData
    code: 'SharedInstanceLockData lockData1;

      // ... populate lockData1 ...

      SharedInstanceLockData lockData2 = std::move(lockData1); // Move constructor
      invoked'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, so after calling it, the source object should
    not be used in any way that would access its data. The implementation typically
    involves transferring pointers or handles rather than copying large amounts of
    data.
