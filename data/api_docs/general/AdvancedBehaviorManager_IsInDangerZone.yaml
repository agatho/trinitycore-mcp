documentation:
  brief: Checks if a given position is within a dangerous area or threat zone
  description: The IsInDangerZone method evaluates whether a specified position, represented
    by an integer identifier, lies within a predefined danger zone. This functionality
    is commonly used in AI behavior systems to determine if a unit's current location
    poses a risk, such as being near hostile entities, environmental hazards, or restricted
    areas. The method performs a lookup against internal threat maps or zone definitions
    to make this determination. It is typically invoked during pathfinding or behavior
    decision-making processes to avoid placing units in harmful locations.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer identifier representing a position in the game world.
      This value is usually derived from a coordinate system, grid reference, or unique
      node identifier used internally by the AI system to represent spatial locations.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position 'pos' is located within any defined
    danger zone; otherwise returns false. The method does not distinguish between
    different types of dangers but simply indicates presence in a threat area.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (behaviorManager.IsInDangerZone(currentPosition)) {\n    // Avoid current\
      \ path or seek safe zone\n    behaviorManager.FindSafePath();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Behavior Tree Nodes
    code: "class AvoidDangerNode : public BehaviorNode {\npublic:\n    bool Execute(AIContext&\
      \ context) override {\n        int playerPos = context.GetPlayerPosition();\n\
      \        if (context.GetBehaviorManager().IsInDangerZone(playerPos)) {\n   \
      \         return context.GetBehaviorManager().MoveToSafeLocation();\n      \
      \  }\n        return true;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal zone definitions and may be affected by dynamic
    updates to the threat map. It is recommended to cache results when performing
    frequent checks in tight loops to avoid performance degradation.
  warnings: The parameter 'pos' must be a valid identifier that corresponds to an
    existing position within the AI system's spatial indexing. Invalid or uninitialized
    values could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
