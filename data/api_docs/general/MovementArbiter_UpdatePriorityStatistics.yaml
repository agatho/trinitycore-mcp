documentation:
  brief: Updates internal statistics tracking player bot movement priorities.
  description: The UpdatePriorityStatistics method is responsible for maintaining
    and updating statistical data related to the priority levels of movement commands
    issued by player bots. This method likely records how often certain movement priorities
    are applied, which helps in optimizing bot behavior and decision-making processes
    within the TrinityCore framework. It plays a crucial role in the MovementArbiter's
    ability to manage and prioritize various movement actions based on historical
    usage patterns and current game state conditions.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void SomeBotAI::OnUpdate()\n{\n    // Update movement priority statistics\
      \ after processing a movement command\n    m_movementArbiter->UpdatePriorityStatistics(PlayerBotMovementPriority::LOW);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the MovementArbiter class when
    it processes or evaluates movement commands. Developers should be aware that this
    method may involve internal data structures that track priority usage over time,
    potentially affecting performance if called excessively without proper batching.
