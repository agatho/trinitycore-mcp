documentation:
  brief: Destroys a GuildBankManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the GuildBankManager class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This includes
    cleaning up internal data structures that manage guild bank transactions, item
    storage, and access permissions. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft
    emulation, this method ensures proper cleanup when a guild bank manager instance
    is no longer needed, preventing memory leaks and maintaining system stability.
    The destructor is automatically invoked when the object goes out of scope or is
    explicitly deleted.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of GuildBankManager
    code: "void CleanupGuildBank() {\n    GuildBankManager* bankManager = new GuildBankManager();\n\
      \    // ... use bankManager ...\n    delete bankManager; // Triggers ~GuildBankManager()\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless the object was allocated
    on the heap. It is typically invoked automatically by the C++ runtime when an
    object's scope ends or when delete is called on a pointer to the object. Ensure
    that all dependent objects are properly cleaned up before this destructor runs.
