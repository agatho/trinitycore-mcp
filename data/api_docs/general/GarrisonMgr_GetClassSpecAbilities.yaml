  class: GarrisonMgr
  method: GetClassSpecAbilities
  signature: int GarrisonMgr::GetClassSpecAbilities(const GarrFollowerEntry * follower,
    uint32 faction) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the class specializations abilities for a given garrison follower
    and faction.
  description: The GetClassSpecAbilities method retrieves the class specialization
    abilities associated with a specific garrison follower entry and faction. This
    method is used within the Garrison system to determine what abilities a follower
    can provide based on their class and specialization. The returned value typically
    represents an identifier or index that maps to the follower's class specialization
    data in the game's internal databases. The method likely performs lookups against
    internal tables containing follower data, class information, and faction-specific
    configurations. It is commonly used during garrison operations, such as when determining
    what abilities are available for a follower to contribute to garrison missions
    or upgrades.
  parameters:
  - name: follower
    description: Pointer to the GarrFollowerEntry structure that defines the follower's
      properties including class and specialization information. This parameter must
      not be null.
  - name: faction
    description: The faction identifier (Alliance or Horde) used to determine faction-specific
      abilities for the follower. Valid values are typically 0 for Alliance and 1
      for Horde.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the class specialization ability
    index or identifier. A negative value may indicate an error or invalid lookup,
    while a positive value corresponds to a valid ability entry in the game's internal
    data structures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve class spec abilities
    code: "GarrFollowerEntry* follower = sGarrisonMgr->GetFollowerEntry(12345);\n\
      int abilityId = sGarrisonMgr->GetClassSpecAbilities(follower, 0);\nif (abilityId\
      \ >= 0)\n{\n    // Process valid ability ID\n    printf(\"Follower has class\
      \ spec ability: %d\\n\", abilityId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with faction-specific logic
    code: "GarrFollowerEntry* follower = sGarrisonMgr->GetFollowerEntry(67890);\n\
      int allianceAbility = sGarrisonMgr->GetClassSpecAbilities(follower, 0); // Alliance\n\
      int hordeAbility = sGarrisonMgr->GetClassSpecAbilities(follower, 1);   // Horde\n\
      \nif (allianceAbility >= 0 && hordeAbility >= 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Follower has\
      \ abilities for both factions: %d, %d\\n\", allianceAbility, hordeAbility);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the garrison management system and relies on internal
    game data structures. The returned integer value typically indexes into ability
    tables that define what specializations are available for each class within the
    garrison system. Performance is generally not a concern as this method is called
    infrequently during garrison operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided follower entry pointer is valid and not null
    before calling this method, as dereferencing a null pointer will cause a crash.
    The faction parameter should be validated to ensure it's either 0 (Alliance) or
    1 (Horde), as other values may result in undefined behavior.
