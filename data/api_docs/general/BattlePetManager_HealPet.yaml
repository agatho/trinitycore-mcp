  class: BattlePetManager
  method: HealPet
  signature: bool BattlePetManager::HealPet(int * player, uint32 speciesId)
documentation:
  brief: Heals a specified battle pet for the given player.
  description: The HealPet method attempts to restore health to a battle pet owned
    by the specified player. This method operates within the context of World of Warcraft's
    Battle Pet system, where pets can be healed using various in-game mechanics or
    commands. The function takes a pointer to a player object and a species ID that
    identifies which pet to heal. It ensures that the pet exists and is valid before
    attempting to restore its health. The healing process may be subject to cooldowns
    or resource limitations depending on the game's implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the player object whose battle pet will be healed. Must
      not be null and must represent a valid player with active battle pets.
  - name: speciesId
    description: The unique identifier for the species of the battle pet to be healed.
      This ID corresponds to a specific type of battle pet in the game's database.
  returns: Returns true if the pet was successfully healed, false otherwise. Failure
    may occur if the player does not own a pet with the specified speciesId or if
    the healing operation is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player object\nuint32 petSpeciesId\
      \ = 12345;\nbool result = sBattlePetManager->HealPet(&player, petSpeciesId);\n\
      if (result) {\n    // Pet healed successfully\n} else {\n    // Healing failed\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 petSpeciesId = 12345;\nif (!player) {\n \
      \   // Handle invalid player\n    return false;\n}\nbool healed = sBattlePetManager->HealPet(&player,\
      \ petSpeciesId);\nif (healed) {\n    // Notify player that pet was healed\n\
      \    player->SendNotification(\"Your battle pet has been healed.\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Log or notify about healing failure\n    sLog->outError(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL,\
      \ \"Failed to heal pet with species ID %u for player %s\", petSpeciesId, player->GetName().c_str());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BattlePetManager instance is properly initialized
    and accessible. The healing operation might be constrained by in-game rules such
    as maximum health limits or cooldowns. Ensure that the provided player object
    and speciesId are valid before calling this function to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Do not pass null pointers for the player parameter, as this will likely
    cause a crash or unexpected behavior. Also, ensure that the speciesId corresponds
    to an actual battle pet in the game's database; otherwise, the method may silently
    fail.
