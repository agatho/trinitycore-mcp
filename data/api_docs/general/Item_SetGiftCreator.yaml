  method: SetGiftCreator
  signature: void Item::SetGiftCreator(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the gift creator GUID for an item.
  description: This method assigns a specific GUID to an item as its gift creator,
    which is used to track the original owner of a gift or to determine who created
    the item. It typically applies to items that are created through enchanting or
    other game mechanics where a player's GUID needs to be stored in the item's data.
    This method is commonly used when creating items that have been gifted by another
    player, ensuring proper tracking of ownership and preventing issues with item
    stacking or identification.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who created the gift.
      This value must be valid and represent a real player in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Gift Creator for a Player-Owned Item
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SetGiftCreator(12345);

      // The item now has its gift creator set to player GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the item is in a state where it can
    accept a gift creator, typically during item creation or modification. It's important
    to ensure that the GUID passed is valid and corresponds to an actual player in
    the game world.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to incorrect tracking of item ownership,
    which could cause issues with item stacking, identification, or game mechanics
    related to gift handling. Avoid calling this method on items that are already
    assigned to a different player or that have been modified by other systems.
