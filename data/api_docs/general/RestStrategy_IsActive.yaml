  brief: Determines whether the rest strategy is currently active for the specified
    bot AI instance
  description: The IsActive method checks if the current rest strategy is actively
    engaged for a given BotAI instance. This method evaluates various conditions such
    as player health, mana levels, and environmental factors to determine if the bot
    should be following the rest behavior pattern. The implementation typically considers
    whether the bot is in a safe location, has sufficient resources, or meets other
    criteria necessary for resting. This method is crucial for AI decision-making
    processes in TrinityCore's bot system, particularly when managing bot behavior
    during combat and non-combat states.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the rest strategy is currently active and applicable for
    the bot AI instance; returns false otherwise. The method may return false if the
    bot is not in a suitable resting environment, if the bot's health/mana levels
    don't warrant rest, or if other strategic conditions prevent resting.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if rest strategy is active
    code: "if (restStrategy->IsActive(ai)) {\n    // Bot is currently following rest\
      \ strategy\n    ai->TellMaster(\"I'm resting now.\");\n} else {\n    // Bot\
      \ is not in rest mode\n    ai->TellMaster(\"I'm not resting.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsActive within a bot AI decision loop
    code: "class MyBotAI : public BotAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override {\n        if (restStrategy->IsActive(this)) {\n            // Perform\
      \ rest-related actions\n            DoRestBehavior();\n        } else {\n  \
      \          // Continue with normal bot behavior\n            DoNormalBehavior();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during AI update cycles. It's
    important to note that the IsActive check might involve multiple internal evaluations
    and could potentially impact performance if used excessively in tight loops. The
    implementation likely caches certain state information to avoid redundant calculations.
  warnings: The method assumes that the BotAI parameter is valid and properly initialized.
    Calling IsActive with a null or uninitialized BotAI pointer may result in undefined
    behavior. Additionally, the method's behavior might change based on game state,
    server configuration, or bot-specific settings.
