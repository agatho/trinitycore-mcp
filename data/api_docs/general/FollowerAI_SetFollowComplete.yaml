  class: FollowerAI
  method: SetFollowComplete
  signature: void FollowerAI::SetFollowComplete(bool withEndEvent)
documentation:
  brief: Marks the follower AI as complete and optionally triggers the end event.
  description: The SetFollowComplete method is used to signal that a follower AI has
    finished its follow behavior. It updates internal state to indicate completion
    and can optionally trigger an end event if specified. This method is typically
    called when a creature or NPC finishes following a player, such as during quest
    progression or scripted events. The withEndEvent parameter determines whether
    the associated end event should be fired, which may include sending messages,
    updating quest status, or triggering further actions in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: withEndEvent
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to trigger the end event after completing
      the follow behavior. If true, the end event is fired; if false, only the completion
      state is set.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with end event
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterCombat(Player* player)\n{\n    if (m_followAI)\n    \
      \    m_followAI->SetFollowComplete(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage without triggering end event
    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    if (m_followAI)\n\
      \        m_followAI->SetFollowComplete(false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the core AI system when a
    follow sequence concludes naturally. It's important to ensure that any necessary
    cleanup or state changes are handled properly before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context may result in unexpected behavior,
    especially if it's called during an active follow sequence or when the follower
    is not actually following a player.
