  method: SelectSupportTarget
  signature: Unit * TargetSelector::SelectSupportTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns a suitable target for support actions within the AI's
    targeting logic.
  description: The SelectSupportTarget method is used by AI-controlled units to identify
    and return an appropriate target that is suitable for performing support-related
    actions, such as healing or buffing. This method typically evaluates the current
    state of nearby targets, their health status, distance, and other relevant factors
    to determine which unit would benefit most from support. It is commonly invoked
    during AI decision-making processes where a support action needs to be prioritized.
    The method does not perform any actions itself but rather provides a reference
    to the target that should be acted upon. This functionality is integral to maintaining
    balanced and effective AI behavior in combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a Unit object representing the selected support target, or
    nullptr if no suitable target could be found within the defined criteria.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SelectSupportTarget
    code: "Unit* target = selector->SelectSupportTarget();\nif (target && target->IsAlive())\
      \ {\n    // Perform support action on target\n    DoHeal(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically part of a larger AI system and relies on internal
    targeting criteria that may vary depending on the specific AI implementation.
    It should be called only when necessary to avoid performance overhead, especially
    in high-frequency AI decision loops.
