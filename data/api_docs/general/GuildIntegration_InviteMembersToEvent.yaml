  class: GuildIntegration
  method: InviteMembersToEvent
  signature: void GuildIntegration::InviteMembersToEvent(int * player, const std::string
    & eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Invites specified guild members to a designated event using their player
    IDs and event identifier.
  description: The InviteMembersToEvent method facilitates the process of inviting
    players from a guild to a specific event within the World of Warcraft environment.
    It takes an array of player identifiers and a unique event ID, then sends invitations
    to those players. This function is typically used in conjunction with guild management
    systems or event coordination tools to automate the invitation process for guild-based
    activities such as raids, dungeons, or community events. The method does not return
    any value but performs the necessary operations to send out the invitations.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer array containing the unique identifiers (GUIDs)
      of players to be invited to the event. Each element in the array represents
      a single player's ID.
  - name: eventId
    description: A string identifier that uniquely defines the target event. This
      should correspond to a valid event entry within the game's event system and
      is used to associate the invitations with the correct activity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerIds[] = {1001, 1002, 1003};

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.InviteMembersToEvent(playerIds, "raid_event_001");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Player List Example
    code: 'std::vector<int> playerList = {1004, 1005, 1006, 1007};

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.InviteMembersToEvent(playerList.data(), "dungeon_event_002");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided player IDs are valid and that the players
    are members of the same guild. It also requires that the event ID corresponds
    to an existing event in the game's database. The actual invitation process may
    involve sending in-game messages or notifications, which could be subject to rate
    limiting or cooldowns depending on server configuration.
  warnings: Ensure that player IDs passed to this method are valid and belong to active
    guild members; otherwise, invitations might fail silently or cause unexpected
    behavior. Also, verify that the event ID exists in the game's event system before
    calling this function to avoid potential runtime errors.
