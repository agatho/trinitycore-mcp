  class: AdaptiveDifficulty
  method: SetTargetWinRate
  signature: void AdaptiveDifficulty::SetTargetWinRate(float rate)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the target win rate for adaptive difficulty calculations.
  description: The SetTargetWinRate method configures the desired win rate that the
    adaptive difficulty system aims to achieve for player encounters. This value is
    typically expressed as a decimal between 0 and 1, where 0.5 represents a 50% win
    rate. The adaptive difficulty system uses this target to dynamically adjust enemy
    difficulty levels, ensuring that players face challenges appropriate to their
    skill level while maintaining engagement. This method is commonly used during
    instance initialization or configuration phases when setting up the desired difficulty
    curve for encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: rate
    description: The target win rate as a floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0,
      where 0.0 represents 0% win rate and 1.0 represents 100% win rate.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Target Win Rate to 60%
    code: 'AdaptiveDifficulty* difficulty = sObjectMgr->GetAdaptiveDifficulty();

      difficulty->SetTargetWinRate(0.6f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Adaptive Difficulty for Challenging Content
    code: "void InitializeInstanceDifficulty() {\n    AdaptiveDifficulty* diff = sObjectMgr->GetAdaptiveDifficulty();\n\
      \    if (diff) {\n        // Set target win rate to 40% for more challenging\
      \ encounters\n        diff->SetTargetWinRate(0.4f);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the adaptive difficulty calculation logic and
    should be called before instances begin generating encounters. The target win
    rate influences how quickly the system adjusts enemy difficulty based on player
    performance during combat.
  warnings: Setting extremely low or high win rates (e.g., below 0.1 or above 0.9)
    may result in unrealistic difficulty adjustments that could break the intended
    gameplay balance.
