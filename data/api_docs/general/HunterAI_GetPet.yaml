documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the Pet object associated with the HunterAI instance
  description: The GetPet method returns a pointer to the Pet object that is currently
    controlled by the HunterAI. This method is typically used within the context of
    a hunter's AI behavior to access or manipulate their summoned pet. The returned
    Pet pointer may be null if no pet is currently active or summoned. This method
    provides direct access to the pet's state, abilities, and behaviors within the
    AI system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Pet object controlled by this HunterAI instance, or nullptr
    if no pet is currently active
  examples:
  - title: Basic pet access example
    code: "if (Pet* pet = hunterAI->GetPet()) {\n    // Use the pet object\n    pet->SetPower(POWER_MANA,\
      \ 100);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking pet existence before usage
    code: "Pet* pet = hunterAI->GetPet();\nif (pet && pet->IsAlive()) {\n    // Pet\
      \ is alive and can be used\n    hunterAI->AttackStart(pet->GetVictim());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides direct access to the pet object, so developers should
    ensure proper null checking before using the returned pointer. The pet object
    returned is managed by the AI system and should not be deleted directly.
  warnings: Accessing the pet through this method bypasses normal AI state management.
    Modifications to the pet's state may affect AI behavior unpredictably if not handled
    carefully. Always verify that a pet exists before using the returned pointer.
