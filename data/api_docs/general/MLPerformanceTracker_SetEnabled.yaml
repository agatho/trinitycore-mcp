  class: MLPerformanceTracker
  method: SetEnabled
  signature: void MLPerformanceTracker::SetEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the machine learning performance tracking functionality.
  description: The SetEnabled method controls whether the MLPerformanceTracker is
    actively monitoring and recording performance metrics for machine learning operations
    within the TrinityCore environment. When enabled, the tracker begins collecting
    data about ML model execution times, resource usage, and other relevant performance
    indicators. When disabled, tracking stops and any accumulated data may be cleared
    or preserved depending on implementation details. This method is typically used
    to manage performance overhead during different stages of game operation, such
    as disabling tracking during high-load periods or when debugging other systems.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: Boolean flag that determines the state of the performance tracker.
      True enables tracking, false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Enable Tracking
    code: MLPerformanceTracker::SetEnabled(true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disabling Performance Tracking
    code: 'MLPerformanceTracker tracker;

      tracker.SetEnabled(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on a global or singleton instance of MLPerformanceTracker.
    The implementation may involve thread synchronization to ensure safe state changes
    across multiple game threads. Performance impact should be minimal as this is
    typically just a flag toggle.
  warnings: Changing the enabled state while active tracking is occurring might result
    in inconsistent data collection. It's recommended to disable tracking before making
    configuration changes or during system maintenance windows.
