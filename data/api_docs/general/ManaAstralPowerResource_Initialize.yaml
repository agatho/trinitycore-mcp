  class: ManaAstralPowerResource
  method: Initialize
  signature: void ManaAstralPowerResource::Initialize(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the astral power resource for a player bot, setting up necessary
    tracking and state management.
  description: The Initialize method prepares a Player bot's astral power resource
    system by establishing internal tracking mechanisms and initializing relevant
    resource states. This method is typically called during bot creation or resource
    initialization phases to ensure that the player's astral power tracking is properly
    set up. It configures the necessary data structures and state variables required
    for managing astral power resources within the TrinityCore framework. The method
    ensures that subsequent operations involving astral power, such as resource gain,
    loss, or consumption, function correctly by pre-setting all required internal
    states.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will utilize
      astral power resources. Must be a valid player instance with proper initialization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = new Player();

      // ... bot initialization code ...

      ManaAstralPowerResource astralResource;

      astralResource.Initialize(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization in Bot Creation Context
    code: "class BotAI {\npublic:\n    void CreateBot(Player* player) {\n        //\
      \ ... other bot setup code ...\n        astralPowerResource.Initialize(player);\n\
      \        // ... continue with bot initialization ...\n    }\nprivate:\n    ManaAstralPowerResource\
      \ astralPowerResource;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per player instance during initialization.
    Repeated calls may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks. The method
    assumes that the Player object is properly constructed and valid before being
    passed as a parameter.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the bot parameter will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the Player object is fully initialized before
    calling this method.
