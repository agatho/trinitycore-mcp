documentation:
  brief: Compares two threat references to determine if the first is less than the
    second based on threat values.
  description: The CompareThreatLessThan::operator() method is a comparison function
    used within the TrinityCore AI system to sort or compare ThreatReference objects.
    It evaluates whether the threat value of the first reference (a) is less than
    that of the second reference (b). This operator is typically used in STL containers
    like std::set or std::priority_queue where ordering based on threat levels is
    required. The comparison is performed using the threat values stored within each
    ThreatReference object, which represent how much aggro a unit has accumulated
    from a specific source. This method ensures proper threat management and sorting
    for NPC behavior and combat mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the threat value of the first ThreatReference (a) is less
    than that of the second ThreatReference (b), otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Using CompareThreatLessThan in a priority queue
    code: '#include <queue>


      std::priority_queue<ThreatReference*, std::vector<ThreatReference*>, CompareThreatLessThan>
      threatQueue;


      // Add ThreatReferences to the queue

      threatQueue.push(threatRef1);

      threatQueue.push(threatRef2);


      // The queue will order elements with lowest threat first

      ThreatReference* lowest = threatQueue.top();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is part of a functor class designed specifically for threat
    management in the TrinityCore AI system. It's commonly used internally by the
    core game engine for maintaining sorted threat lists and determining target selection
    order for NPCs. The implementation assumes that ThreatReference objects contain
    valid threat data and that comparison is based solely on numeric threat values.
