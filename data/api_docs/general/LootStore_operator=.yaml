documentation:
  brief: Moves ownership of a LootStore object to another LootStore object.
  description: The move assignment operator transfers all resources from the source
    LootStore object to the destination LootStore object. This operation is typically
    used when assigning one LootStore instance to another, effectively transferring
    the internal data and state without performing a deep copy. The source object
    becomes invalid after the move operation and should not be used. In the context
    of TrinityCore's loot system, this operator allows efficient transfer of loot
    templates and associated data between LootStore instances, which is particularly
    useful when managing dynamic loot tables or during object lifecycle management.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the destination LootStore object after the move assignment
    has been completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'LootStore store1;

      LootStore store2 = std::move(store1); // Moves store1''s resources to store2

      // store1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Function Context
    code: "LootStore createLootStore() {\n    LootStore store;\n    // ... populate\
      \ store with loot data ...\n    return store; // Move semantics allow efficient\
      \ return\n}\n\nLootStore mainStore = createLootStore(); // Uses move assignment"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is part of the C++ move semantics implementation. It's important
    to note that after a move operation, the source object should not be accessed
    or used as its state becomes undefined. The move assignment operator is typically
    more efficient than copy assignment because it avoids expensive deep copying operations.
  warnings: After calling this operator, the source LootStore object must not be used.
    Attempting to use the moved-from object can lead to undefined behavior. This is
    especially important in TrinityCore's loot system where improper handling could
    result in corrupted loot data or access violations.
