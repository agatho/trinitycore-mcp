documentation:
  brief: Updates the soul shard tracking logic for the warlock AI.
  description: The UpdateSoulShardCheck method is responsible for managing and updating
    the internal state of soul shards within the WarlockAI class. This method typically
    checks the current number of soul shards available to the warlock, updates any
    relevant timers or cooldowns, and ensures that the AI's decision-making process
    accurately reflects the player's current soul shard count. It plays a crucial
    role in determining when the warlock can cast spells that require soul shards,
    such as Consume Magic or other soul shard-consuming abilities. The method is usually
    called during the AI update cycle to keep the soul shard state synchronized with
    the game's internal tracking system.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void WarlockAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    UpdateSoulShardCheck();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the regular AI update cycle and
    should not be called manually unless specifically required for custom behavior.
    The implementation likely interacts with the creature's aura system to track soul
    shard buffs or debuffs that affect the shard count.
