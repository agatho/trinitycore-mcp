  brief: Removes outdated market data entries from the database to maintain system
    performance and data integrity.
  description: The CleanupOldData method is responsible for removing expired or obsolete
    market data entries from the database. This process helps maintain optimal database
    performance by preventing unnecessary growth of market-related tables. The method
    typically targets items that have exceeded their retention period, have been sold
    long ago, or are no longer relevant to current market conditions. It ensures that
    the market analysis system operates efficiently without being bogged down by stale
    data. This cleanup operation is usually scheduled to run periodically as part
    of routine maintenance tasks.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during maintenance windows or low-traffic periods
    to minimize impact on player experience. The cleanup process may take several
    seconds to complete depending on the amount of data requiring deletion.
  warnings: Calling this method during high-traffic periods may cause temporary performance
    degradation. Ensure proper database backups are in place before running cleanup
    operations.
