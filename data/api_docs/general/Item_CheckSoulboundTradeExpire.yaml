documentation:
  brief: Checks if a soulbound item has expired its trade restriction period
  description: The CheckSoulboundTradeExpire method determines whether a soulbound
    item's trade restriction period has elapsed. In World of Warcraft, certain items
    (typically those obtained through specific quests or events) are bound to a player
    and cannot be traded until a specified time period expires. This method evaluates
    the internal timer associated with the item's soulbound state and returns true
    if the trade restriction has expired, allowing the item to be traded. The method
    typically checks against the current game time and compares it with the stored
    expiration timestamp of the item.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the soulbound trade restriction period has expired and
    the item can now be traded; returns false if the item is still under its trade
    restriction period.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (item->CheckSoulboundTradeExpire()) {\n    // Item can now be traded\n\
      \    player->AddItemToInventory(item);\n} else {\n    // Item still under trade\
      \ restriction\n    player->SendNotification(\"This item cannot be traded yet.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during trade operations or when checking
    item usability. It relies on the internal item timer and should be used in conjunction
    with proper game time synchronization. The method does not modify any state of
    the item directly but only evaluates its current condition.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called for items that are actually soulbound,
    as calling it on non-soulbound items may lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect
    trade restrictions. This method should not be used as a standalone validation
    mechanism without checking item type first.
