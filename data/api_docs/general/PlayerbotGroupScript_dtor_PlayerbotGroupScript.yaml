documentation:
  brief: Destroys a PlayerbotGroupScript instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the PlayerbotGroupScript class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the object's lifetime. This method is automatically invoked when a PlayerbotGroupScript
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's
    playerbot system, this destructor ensures proper cleanup of group-related scripting
    data and prevents memory leaks. The method does not accept any parameters and
    performs no return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of PlayerbotGroupScript
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    PlayerbotGroupScript* groupScript = new PlayerbotGroupScript();\n\
      \    // ... use the script ...\n    delete groupScript; // Destructor is called\
      \ here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is typically invoked by the C++ runtime when an object is
    destroyed. Developers should not manually call this destructor unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns.
