documentation:
  brief: Determines if an NPC is currently being escorted within a battleground.
  description: The EscortNPC method checks whether a specific NPC in the battleground
    is currently under escort status, typically used during escort quests or objectives.
    This method evaluates the current state of NPCs to determine if they are being
    escorted by players or AI-controlled units. It's commonly used in battleground
    AI logic to manage quest progression and objective completion. The method returns
    true if an escort is active for the NPC, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if an NPC is currently being escorted within the battleground,
    false if no escort is active or if the operation fails.
  examples:
  - title: Check if NPC is being escorted
    code: "if (bgAI->EscortNPC()) {\n    // Handle escort logic\n    printf(\"NPC\
      \ is currently being escorted\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle non-escort state\n\
      \    printf(\"No active escort\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within battleground AI update loops to monitor
    NPC states. The implementation may rely on internal tracking of escort quests
    and player interactions with NPCs.
  warnings: The method signature shows a parameter 'int * player' but the actual implementation
    likely doesn't use it, or it's a legacy parameter that should be ignored. Ensure
    proper synchronization when calling this in multithreaded contexts.
