documentation:
  brief: Performs self-healing action for the discipline priest
  description: 'The HandleSelfHealing method implements the core logic for a Discipline
    Priest to apply self-healing effects. This method typically activates when the
    priest uses a self-heal ability such as Power Word: Shield, or similar defensive
    healing spells. It evaluates the priest''s current mana availability, checks if
    the healing can be applied, and executes the healing effect on the priest''s own
    health. The method is designed to integrate with the TrinityCore spell system
    and follows standard game mechanics for priest class abilities.'
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the self-healing action was successfully executed, false
    otherwise. The return value indicates whether the healing process completed without
    errors or resource constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleSelfHealing
    code: "if (priest->HandleSelfHealing()) {\n    // Self-heal successful\n    SendChatMessage(\"\
      I have healed myself.\");\n} else {\n    // Self-heal failed\n    SendChatMessage(\"\
      Not enough mana to heal.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the priest object has valid mana and health state.
    It should only be called when the priest is in a state where self-healing is appropriate,
    such as during combat or when under threat. The implementation may include checks
    for cooldowns, spell availability, and resource consumption.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of priest state may lead
    to unexpected behavior or crashes. Ensure that the priest has sufficient mana
    before invoking this method. Also, be aware that this method does not handle UI
    updates or visual effects directly; those must be handled separately by calling
    appropriate TrinityCore APIs.
