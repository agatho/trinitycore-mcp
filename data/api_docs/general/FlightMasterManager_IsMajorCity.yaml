documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given taxi node represents a major city in the game
    world.
  description: The IsMajorCity method evaluates whether a specified TaxiNodesEntry
    corresponds to a major city within the World of Warcraft game world. This determination
    is typically used by the FlightMasterManager to control flight path availability,
    display appropriate UI elements, or manage player access to certain flight routes.
    Major cities are generally defined as primary hub locations with extensive flight
    network connections and significant in-game importance. The method checks internal
    criteria such as node flags, location data, or predefined city lists to make this
    determination.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the taxi node represents a major city; otherwise returns
    false. A return value of true indicates that the node is associated with a significant
    hub location in the game world, while false suggests it's either a minor location
    or not a city at all.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a Taxi Node is a Major City
    code: "const TaxiNodesEntry* node = sTaxiNodesStore.LookupEntry(12345);\nif (flightMasterManager.IsMajorCity(node))\
      \ {\n    // Handle major city logic\n    printf(\"This is a major city with\
      \ extensive flight paths\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle minor location logic\n\
      \    printf(\"This is not a major city\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The implementation likely relies on internal flags or predefined lists of
    major cities stored in the game's data files. This method may be called frequently
    during flight path calculations and UI updates, so performance is important. The
    exact criteria for 'major city' status might vary between different expansions
    or game versions.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine general location importance
    without understanding the underlying data definitions. The result depends on how
    major cities are defined in the specific TrinityCore build and may not align with
    player expectations if custom modifications have been made to taxi node data.
