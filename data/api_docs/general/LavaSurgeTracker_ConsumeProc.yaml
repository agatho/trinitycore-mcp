  method: ConsumeProc
  signature: void LavaSurgeTracker::ConsumeProc()
documentation:
  brief: Consumes an active Lava Surge proc, removing its effects from the affected
    player.
  description: The ConsumeProc method is responsible for handling the removal and
    activation of the Lava Surge buff in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation.
    This method typically gets called when a player's Lava Surge effect is triggered
    or consumed, such as after casting a spell that benefits from the proc. It manages
    internal state tracking to ensure the proc is properly cleared and any associated
    effects are removed from the target player. The method does not take any parameters
    and performs no direct return operations, focusing solely on state management
    within the LavaSurgeTracker class.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Effect
    code: "void FireElementalSpell::HandleLavaSurgeProc()\n{\n    if (player->GetLavaSurgeTracker())\n\
      \    {\n        player->GetLavaSurgeTracker()->ConsumeProc();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the spell system when a Lava
    Surge effect is consumed. It assumes that the LavaSurgeTracker instance has already
    been initialized and contains valid proc data. The implementation likely modifies
    internal flags or counters to indicate that the proc has been consumed.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that a proc is actually active may
    lead to unexpected behavior or state corruption in the tracker. Ensure proper
    validation before invoking this method to avoid invalid state transitions.
