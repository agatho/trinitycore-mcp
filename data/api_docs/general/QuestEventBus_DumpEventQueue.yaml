  brief: Dumps the contents of the quest event queue to the console for debugging
    purposes
  description: The DumpEventQueue method outputs all pending quest events currently
    stored in the QuestEventBus queue to the system console or log output. This utility
    function is primarily used for debugging and development purposes to inspect the
    state of active quest events without modifying them. The method does not alter
    the event queue's contents or trigger any event processing; it simply serializes
    and displays the current queue state. It is typically invoked during development
    or diagnostic sessions when developers need to understand what quest-related events
    are pending execution.

    operations on the actual quest events, only displays them. The output format may
    vary depending on the logging configuration of the TrinityCore instance.
