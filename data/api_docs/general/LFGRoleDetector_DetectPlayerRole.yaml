  signature: uint8 LFGRoleDetector::DetectPlayerRole(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the most suitable LFG role for a player based on their
    current equipment, stats, and class specialization.
  description: The DetectPlayerRole method evaluates a player's character attributes
    including equipped items, level, class, and specialization to determine the optimal
    Looking For Group (LFG) role they should assume. This role is typically used in
    group finding systems to match players with appropriate roles for dungeons, raids,
    or other group content. The method considers factors such as item level, stat
    distribution, and class-specific abilities to assign a role that best fits the
    player's current capabilities. It is commonly invoked when forming groups or assigning
    roles during LFG queue processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'Returns a uint8 value representing the detected LFG role. Possible values
    typically include: 1 for Tank, 2 for Healer, 3 for Damage Dealer (DPS), and 0
    for Unknown/Unassigned. The specific mapping may vary based on TrinityCore''s
    internal role definitions.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in LFG Context
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player is valid\nuint8 role = sLfgRoleDetector->DetectPlayerRole(player);\n\
      switch (role)\n{\n    case LFG_ROLE_TANK:\n        // Handle tank role assignment\n\
      \        break;\n    case LFG_ROLE_HEALER:\n        // Handle healer role assignment\n\
      \        break;\n    case LFG_ROLE_DAMAGE:\n        // Handle damage dealer\
      \ role assignment\n        break;\n    default:\n        // Handle unknown role\n\
      \        break;\n}"

  notes: This method relies on accurate player data including equipped items and class
    information. It may be computationally intensive if used frequently, so caching
    results is recommended in performance-critical scenarios. The implementation should
    account for different expansion content where role definitions might vary.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null, as accessing invalid player data can lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
    This method does not modify the player's actual role assignment; it only determines
    what role would be most appropriate based on current character state.
