  signature: void ScriptMgr::OnFailedPasswordChange(uint32 accountId)
documentation:
  brief: Called when a password change attempt fails for a given account ID
  description: This method is invoked by the TrinityCore scripting system whenever
    a password change operation fails for a specific account. It serves as a hook
    for custom scripts to handle failed password change events, allowing developers
    to implement logging, security measures, or notification systems. The method is
    part of the general script management framework and does not return any value.
    It is typically called during authentication or account management processes when
    validation checks fail.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: The unique identifier of the account for which the password change
      attempt failed. This value corresponds to the 'id' field in the 'account' table
      within the TrinityCore database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Implementation Example
    code: "class MyScript : public ScriptObject\n{\npublic:\n    MyScript() : ScriptObject(\"\
      MyScript\") {}\n\n    void OnFailedPasswordChange(uint32 accountId) override\n\
      \    {\n        // Log failed password change attempt\n        sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_SCRIPTS,\
      \ \"Failed password change attempt for account ID: %u\", accountId);\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Implementation with Security Logging
    code: "class SecurityScript : public ScriptObject\n{\npublic:\n    SecurityScript()\
      \ : ScriptObject(\"SecurityScript\") {}\n\n    void OnFailedPasswordChange(uint32\
      \ accountId) override\n    {\n        // Retrieve account information for logging\n\
      \        if (AccountEntry const* account = sAccountMgr->GetAccount(accountId))\n\
      \        {\n            sLog->outError(LOG_FILTER_SCRIPTS, \"Security Alert:\
      \ Failed password change for account %s (ID: %u)\", account->name.c_str(), accountId);\n\
      \            // Optionally trigger additional security measures\n        }\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called from within the core authentication and account management
    flow. It's important to note that this hook does not prevent or stop the failure
    itself; it merely provides notification of such an event. The method should be
    implemented efficiently as it may be called frequently during high-traffic periods.
  warnings: Ensure that any logging or security actions taken in this method do not
    introduce performance bottlenecks or expose sensitive information. Avoid performing
    heavy computations or database operations directly within this handler.
