  class: BotAIInitializer
  method: LoadValues
  signature: bool BotAIInitializer::LoadValues()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads AI configuration values for bot behavior.
  description: The LoadValues method in BotAIInitializer is responsible for loading
    and initializing all AI-related configuration parameters and settings that govern
    how game bots behave. This method typically reads from configuration files or
    database entries to set up default behaviors, decision-making parameters, and
    tactical rules for the bot AI system. It ensures that all necessary values are
    properly initialized before the AI system begins functioning. The method may also
    validate loaded values and handle fallback defaults if required settings are missing
    or invalid.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all configuration values were successfully loaded and initialized,
    false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates a failure in reading
    configuration data, missing required parameters, or validation errors in the loaded
    values.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "BotAIInitializer initializer;\nbool success = initializer.LoadValues();\n\
      if (success) {\n    // AI values successfully loaded\n    // Bot system is ready\
      \ for use\n} else {\n    // Handle configuration loading failure\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to load bot AI values\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called once during the initialization phase
    of the bot system. It's designed to be idempotent, meaning multiple calls should
    not cause issues, though subsequent calls may not reload data if already initialized.
    The method might perform database queries or file I/O operations, so it could
    have performance implications during server startup.
  warnings: This method must be called before any bot AI functionality is used. Failure
    to call LoadValues() properly can result in undefined behavior or crashes when
    bots attempt to make decisions. If the configuration data is corrupted or missing,
    this method may return false and leave the AI system in an uninitialized state.
