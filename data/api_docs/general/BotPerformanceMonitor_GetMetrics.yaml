    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current system performance metrics collected by the bot performance
    monitor.
  description: The GetMetrics method returns a constant reference to the SystemPerformanceMetrics
    object that contains aggregated performance data collected by the BotPerformanceMonitor.
    This includes information such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and other relevant
    system statistics for the bot's operational environment. The returned metrics
    are typically updated periodically by the monitor and reflect the state of the
    system at the time of the last update. This method is commonly used for debugging,
    performance tuning, and monitoring the health of bot operations within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a SystemPerformanceMetrics object containing the
    latest collected system performance data including CPU usage, memory consumption,
    and other relevant metrics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      const SystemPerformanceMetrics& metrics = monitor.GetMetrics();

      std::cout << "CPU Usage: " << metrics.cpuUsage << "%" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Example
    code: "BotPerformanceMonitor* perfMonitor = sBotAI->GetPerformanceMonitor();\n\
      if (perfMonitor)\n{\n    const SystemPerformanceMetrics& metrics = perfMonitor->GetMetrics();\n\
      \    if (metrics.cpuUsage > 80.0f)\n    {\n        // Log high CPU usage warning\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Warning: High CPU usage detected (%.2f%%)\", metrics.cpuUsage);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to internal data managed by the BotPerformanceMonitor
    instance. The data is updated automatically by the monitor's background thread
    or update cycle. This method is thread-safe for read operations, but modifications
    to the underlying metrics should be done through appropriate setter methods or
    internal update mechanisms.
  warnings: Do not store the returned reference beyond the lifetime of the BotPerformanceMonitor
    instance, as it may become invalid. The metrics object contains live data that
    changes over time, so if you need to preserve values for comparison, make a copy
    of the metrics structure rather than storing references.
