  signature: void QuestManager::ScanCreatureQuestGivers()
documentation:
  brief: Scans all creature quest givers in the world to update their quest offering
    status.
  description: The ScanCreatureQuestGivers method iterates through all active creature
    quest givers within the game world and updates their available quest status. This
    method ensures that creatures properly reflect the current state of player quests,
    including adding or removing quest markers, updating quest icons, and maintaining
    synchronization between the creature's quest offering and the player's quest log.
    It is typically invoked during quest system initialization, player login, or when
    quest states change to ensure accurate quest interaction. The method does not
    require any parameters and performs its operations internally using the core's
    quest management systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Quest System Initialization
    code: "void InitializeQuestSystem()\n{\n    sQuestMgr->ScanCreatureQuestGivers();\n\
      \    // Ensures all quest givers are properly updated after loading\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is performance-sensitive as it iterates through all creature
    entries in the world. It should be called sparingly and typically only during
    initialization or when significant quest state changes occur. The method internally
    uses thread-safe operations to prevent race conditions during world loading.
  warnings: Calling this method excessively during gameplay can cause performance
    degradation due to iterating through all creatures. Avoid invoking it within high-frequency
    loops or event handlers.
