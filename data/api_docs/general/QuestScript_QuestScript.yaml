  class: QuestScript
  method: QuestScript
  signature: void QuestScript::QuestScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a QuestScript instance with the specified quest name.
  description: The QuestScript constructor initializes a new quest script instance
    by associating it with a specific quest identified by its name. This method sets
    up the internal state of the quest script, preparing it for execution within the
    TrinityCore framework. The quest name parameter is used to locate and register
    the script with the appropriate quest system components. This initialization is
    typically called during server startup or when a quest is dynamically loaded into
    memory. The method does not perform any validation on the quest name itself, relying
    on the underlying quest system to handle invalid names appropriately.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated string representing the unique identifier/name
      of the quest this script is associated with. This name must match an existing
      quest in the database for proper functionality.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic QuestScript Initialization
    code: "class MyQuestScript : public QuestScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyQuestScript()\
      \ : QuestScript(\"My Awesome Quest\")\n    {\n        // Constructor body\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: QuestScript with Dynamic Name
    code: "void RegisterQuestScript(const char* questName)\n{\n    // Dynamically\
      \ create a quest script instance\n    new MyQuestScript(questName);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called by the TrinityCore quest system automatically
    when loading quest scripts from the database. Developers should ensure that the
    quest name provided matches exactly with the quest entry in the database. The
    QuestScript class is designed to be inherited from, and this constructor should
    only be called during object construction.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or non-existent quest name may lead to undefined behavior
    or runtime errors. Ensure all quest names are properly registered in the database
    before using them with this constructor. This method does not validate the quest
    existence at runtime.
