  class: ActionPriorityHelper
  method: CreateMovement
  signature: PrioritizedAction ActionPriorityHelper::CreateMovement(uint32 spellId,
    int * target, float distance)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a prioritized movement action for a spell with specified target and
    distance parameters.
  description: The CreateMovement method generates a PrioritizedAction object that
    represents a movement behavior intended to be executed in response to a specific
    spell. It takes into account the spell ID, target location (represented as an
    integer pointer), and the desired distance for the movement. This method is typically
    used within AI logic to determine appropriate movement actions based on spell
    casting requirements or tactical positioning. The returned PrioritizedAction encapsulates
    both the movement command and its priority level, which influences execution order
    in the action queue. The target parameter allows specifying a dynamic target location,
    while the distance parameter defines how far the unit should move relative to
    that target.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell for which movement is being created.
      This determines the movement behavior and constraints based on the spell's properties.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target location or entity
      index for the movement action. May be null if no specific target is required.
  - name: distance
    description: The distance in yards that the unit should move relative to the target.
      Positive values indicate forward movement, negative values backward movement.
  returns: A PrioritizedAction object containing the movement action and its associated
    priority level. The action can be queued for execution by the AI system and will
    determine how the unit moves in response to the spell.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement Creation
    code: PrioritizedAction action = helper.CreateMovement(12345, nullptr, 5.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Movement with Target and Distance
    code: 'int targetId = 42;

      PrioritizedAction action = helper.CreateMovement(12345, &targetId, 10.0f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ActionPriorityHelper class and integrates with
    TrinityCore's AI system to manage unit behavior. The priority level assigned to
    the returned action depends on internal logic that evaluates spell properties
    and current context. Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid location
    or entity before calling this method, as invalid targets may result in undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: The target parameter is passed by reference (as an int pointer), so it
    must be properly initialized and maintained during the lifetime of the returned
    action. Passing null for target may cause movement to be relative to the unit's
    current position rather than a specific target.
