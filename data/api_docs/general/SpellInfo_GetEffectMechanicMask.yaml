documentation:
  brief: Returns the mechanic mask for a specific spell effect.
  description: This method retrieves the mechanic mask associated with a particular
    spell effect, which defines the type of mechanical interaction that occurs when
    the spell is applied. The mechanic mask is used to determine how various game
    mechanics interact with the spell, such as whether it can be resisted, dispelled,
    or affected by specific debuffs. This information is crucial for understanding
    spell behavior and interactions in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint64 value representing the mechanic mask for the specified
    spell effect, where each bit corresponds to a different mechanic type that can
    be applied to the spell.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: uint64 mechanicMask = spellInfo->GetEffectMechanicMask(0);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related functions
    to determine how a spell interacts with various game mechanics. It's important
    to note that the effect index must be valid and within range of available effects.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method, as incorrect indexing can lead to
    undefined behavior or invalid results. Ensure that the effect index corresponds
    to an actual effect in the spell.
