  class: PlayerbotPacketSniffer
  method: ParseResourcePacket
  signature: void PlayerbotPacketSniffer::ParseResourcePacket(WorldSession * session,
    const WorldPacket & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Parses incoming resource-related packets from players in the game world.
  description: The ParseResourcePacket method processes WorldPackets that contain
    resource data, such as currency, reputation, or item quantities, received from
    a player's session. It is typically used by the Playerbot system to monitor and
    react to changes in player resources for strategic decision-making. This method
    analyzes packet contents to extract relevant resource information without modifying
    the original packet flow. The function operates within the context of TrinityCore's
    networking layer and interacts with WorldSession objects to retrieve and interpret
    packet data.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession object representing the player's active
      connection to the server. This session contains the network context and player
      state information needed to process the packet.
  - name: packet
    description: Reference to the WorldPacket object containing the raw data of the
      resource-related packet. This packet must contain valid resource update information
      for proper parsing.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in playerbot logic
    code: "void MyPlayerbotAI::Update()\n{\n    // Assume we have access to a packet\
      \ sniffer\n    PlayerbotPacketSniffer* sniffer = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetPacketSniffer();\n\
      \    if (sniffer)\n    {\n        WorldSession* session = GetSession();\n  \
      \      WorldPacket packet(CMSG_UPDATE_PROJECTILE_POSITION);\n        sniffer->ParseResourcePacket(session,\
      \ packet);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the playerbot AI framework and should only be called
    during active bot processing cycles. It assumes that the session and packet parameters
    are valid and properly initialized. The parsing logic may vary depending on the
    specific type of resource packet being processed.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or null session pointers will likely
    result in crashes or undefined behavior. Ensure that all packet data is validated
    before passing it to this function, especially when dealing with external packet
    sources.
