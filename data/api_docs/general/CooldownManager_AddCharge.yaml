documentation:
  brief: Adds a charge to the specified spell's cooldown timer.
  description: The AddCharge method increments the charge count for a given spell
    within the CooldownManager. This functionality is typically used in World of Warcraft
    mechanics where spells can have multiple charges that are consumed and replenished
    over time. The method updates internal tracking of spell charges without directly
    affecting the game state or sending packets to clients. It assumes that the spell
    ID corresponds to a valid spell with charge-based cooldown behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CooldownManager* cm = player->GetCooldownManager();

      cm->AddCharge(12345); // Adds a charge to spell ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal cooldown tracking but does not automatically
    update client UI or send network packets. The spell must already be registered
    in the cooldown manager for this call to have any effect.
