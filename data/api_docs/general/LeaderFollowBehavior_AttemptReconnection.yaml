  signature: bool LeaderFollowBehavior::AttemptReconnection(BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to re-establish a bot's connection to its leader in a group.
  description: The AttemptReconnection method is responsible for handling the logic
    required to reconnect a bot AI to its designated leader within a group context.
    This method typically gets invoked when a bot has become disconnected from its
    leader, either due to network issues, leader leaving the group, or other transient
    conditions. It evaluates whether reconnection is possible and performs necessary
    actions such as re-joining the group, re-targeting the leader, or updating internal
    state tracking. The method ensures that the bot maintains proper group cohesion
    and follows the leader as expected in a TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the reconnection attempt was successful and the bot is
    now properly connected to its leader; otherwise, returns false if the reconnection
    failed or is not possible at this time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a bot AI loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (!leaderFollowBehavior.AttemptReconnection(this))\n\
      \    {\n        // Handle reconnection failure\n        ai->TellMaster(\"Failed\
      \ to reconnect to leader.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the bot's AI update cycle and may
    involve group management operations such as checking group validity, re-joining
    groups, or updating target references. It assumes that the bot has already been
    initialized with a valid leader reference.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to bots becoming permanently
    disconnected from their leaders, resulting in erratic behavior or loss of group
    functionality. Ensure that the AI context and leader state are properly validated
    before calling this method.
