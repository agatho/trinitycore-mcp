  method: UnitSpeedChanged
  signature: void WaypointMovementGenerator::UnitSpeedChanged()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the waypoint movement generator when a unit's speed changes.
  description: The UnitSpeedChanged method is invoked when a unit's movement speed
    is modified, allowing the waypoint movement generator to adjust its behavior accordingly.
    This method ensures that waypoints are recalculated or re-evaluated based on the
    new speed parameters. It typically handles synchronization between the unit's
    current speed and the expected timing of waypoint arrivals. The method may also
    update internal state variables related to movement duration and path calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in movement update
    code: "void SomeAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_unit->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_ROAMING))\n\
      \    {\n        m_movementGenerator->UnitSpeedChanged();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore movement system
    when speed changes occur. Developers should not call this directly unless implementing
    custom movement logic that requires manual speed synchronization.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method manually in most cases as it's intended for
    internal use only. Improper usage may lead to inconsistent waypoint behavior or
    incorrect path calculations.
