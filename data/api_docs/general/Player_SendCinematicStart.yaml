  signature: void Player::SendCinematicStart(uint32 CinematicSequenceId) const
documentation:
  brief: Starts a cinematic sequence for the player, triggering a cutscene event.
  description: This method initiates a cinematic sequence for the specified player,
    allowing the game to display a cutscene or movie sequence. The method is typically
    used when a player needs to experience a specific cinematic event, such as quest
    cutscenes or story sequences. It does not directly control the playback of the
    cinematic but rather triggers it through the client-side system. The method requires
    a valid CinematicSequenceId parameter which corresponds to an existing cinematic
    sequence in the game database.
  parameters:
  - name: CinematicSequenceId
    description: The unique identifier for the cinematic sequence to be triggered.
      This value must correspond to a valid cinematic sequence entry in the game database,
      typically found in the CinematicSequences.dbc file or similar database table.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SendCinematicStart(12345);

      // This triggers cinematic sequence 12345 for the player'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically called from server-side code and may require the
    player to be in a specific state (e.g., not in combat) to properly trigger the
    cinematic. It's important to note that this method does not directly play the
    cinematic; it merely sends a command to the client to start the sequence.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player is in a valid state
    for cinematic sequences. Calling this method during combat or other restricted
    states may cause issues or prevent proper execution of the cinematic sequence.
