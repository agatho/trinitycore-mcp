  class: TransportBase
  method: GetPositionOffsetTo
  signature: int TransportBase::GetPositionOffsetTo(const int & endPos) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the positional offset between the current transport
    position and a specified end position.
  description: The GetPositionOffsetTo method computes the difference in position
    coordinates between the current location of a transport object and a given endpoint.
    This is commonly used in World of Warcraft's transport system to determine relative
    positioning for movement, docking, or synchronization purposes. The method takes
    an integer representing the target end position and returns the calculated offset
    as an integer value. It operates on the internal state of the TransportBase class
    and assumes valid coordinate systems are in place. This functionality is essential
    for maintaining accurate transport behavior within the game world, particularly
    for transports like boats, zeppelins, or other moving platforms.
  parameters:
  - name: endPos
    description: An integer value representing the target end position coordinate
      to calculate offset against. This typically corresponds to a specific waypoint
      or destination point along the transport's path.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the calculated positional offset between
    the current transport position and the specified end position. A positive value
    indicates the transport is ahead of the endpoint, while a negative value suggests
    it is behind. Zero implies exact alignment with the target position.
  examples:
  - title: Calculate Transport Offset to Destination
    code: "int offset = transport->GetPositionOffsetTo(1000);\nif (offset > 0) {\n\
      \    // Transport is ahead of destination\n    printf(\"Transport is %d units\
      \ ahead\\n\", offset);\n} else if (offset < 0) {\n    // Transport is behind\
      \ destination\n    printf(\"Transport is %d units behind\\n\", -offset);\n}\
      \ else {\n    // Transport is exactly at destination\n    printf(\"Transport\
      \ reached destination\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use Offset for Path Synchronization
    code: "class MyTransport : public TransportBase {\npublic:\n    void UpdatePosition()\
      \ {\n        int currentPos = GetCurrentPosition();\n        int targetPos =\
      \ GetNextWaypoint();\n        int offset = GetPositionOffsetTo(targetPos);\n\
      \        \n        if (abs(offset) < 10) { // Within tolerance\n           \
      \ // Synchronize with waypoint\n            SnapToWaypoint(targetPos);\n   \
      \     } else {\n            // Continue moving towards target\n            MoveTowards(targetPos);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with transport path calculations
    and movement logic. The integer-based coordinate system implies that positions
    are likely represented as discrete steps or segments rather than continuous coordinates.
    Performance-wise, this method should be lightweight since it only performs arithmetic
    operations on stored position values.
  warnings: Ensure that the endPos parameter represents a valid waypoint or destination
    within the transport's defined path; otherwise, the calculated offset may not
    reflect meaningful game state. This method assumes internal position tracking
    is properly maintained and synchronized with the transport's movement system.
