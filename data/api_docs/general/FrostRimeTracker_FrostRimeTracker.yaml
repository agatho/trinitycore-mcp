documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the FrostRimeTracker class with default values.
  description: The FrostRimeTracker constructor initializes a new instance of the
    FrostRimeTracker class. This method sets up the internal state and data members
    required for tracking frost rime effects within the TrinityCore framework. It
    ensures that all member variables are properly initialized to their default states,
    preparing the object for use in game mechanics related to frost-based abilities
    or effects. The constructor is typically called when creating a new FrostRimeTracker
    instance, such as during spell effect application or aura initialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new FrostRimeTracker instance
    code: 'FrostRimeTracker tracker;

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization logic. It simply
    sets up the basic object state. Any additional setup required for specific frost
    rime effects should be handled through dedicated methods rather than the constructor.
