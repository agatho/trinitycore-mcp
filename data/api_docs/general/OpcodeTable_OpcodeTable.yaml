documentation:
  brief: Initializes the opcode table for handling network communication in TrinityCore.
  description: The OpcodeTable constructor initializes the internal data structures
    used to manage and map network opcodes for client-server communication. This method
    sets up the necessary mappings between opcode identifiers and their corresponding
    handler functions, ensuring that incoming packets can be properly interpreted
    and processed by the server. The initialization typically occurs during server
    startup and establishes the foundation for all subsequent network message handling
    operations within the TrinityCore framework.

  - title: Server Startup Initialization
    code: "void Server::Initialize()\n{\n    // OpcodeTable is constructed during\
      \ server initialization\n    OpcodeTable opcodeTable;\n    // Network handlers\
      \ are now ready to process incoming packets\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    during server initialization. Developers should not need to manually instantiate
    OpcodeTable objects as it's managed automatically by the core networking system.
