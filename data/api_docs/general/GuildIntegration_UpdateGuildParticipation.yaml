  class: GuildIntegration
  method: UpdateGuildParticipation
  signature: void GuildIntegration::UpdateGuildParticipation()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the guild participation status for all online players in the realm.
  description: The UpdateGuildParticipation method synchronizes the current guild
    membership and participation data across all connected players in the TrinityCore
    server. This method ensures that player guild information is consistent and up-to-date
    throughout the game world, particularly important for features like guild chat,
    faction-based rewards, and guild-specific events. The method typically runs on
    a periodic basis or is triggered when significant guild changes occur, such as
    player joins, leaves, or promotions. It updates internal caches and broadcasts
    necessary notifications to maintain data integrity across the entire realm.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Server Update Loop
    code: "void WorldUpdate()\n{\n    // Periodic update of guild participation\n\
      \    sGuildIntegration->UpdateGuildParticipation();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may cause performance overhead during high player activity periods
    due to the need to iterate through all online players and synchronize their guild
    data. It's recommended to call this method at appropriate intervals rather than
    on every game tick.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently can lead to unnecessary server load.
    Ensure it's only invoked when actual guild participation changes have occurred
    or during scheduled maintenance windows.
