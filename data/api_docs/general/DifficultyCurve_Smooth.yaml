  class: DifficultyCurve
  method: Smooth
  signature: void DifficultyCurve::Smooth(float smoothingFactor)
documentation:
  brief: Applies smoothing to the difficulty curve using the provided smoothing factor.
  description: The Smooth method modifies the internal difficulty curve data by applying
    a smoothing algorithm based on the specified smoothing factor. This is typically
    used in game design to adjust the progression curve of difficulty levels, making
    transitions between difficulty tiers more gradual and less jarring for players.
    The method operates on the curve's data points and modifies them in-place to achieve
    a smoother transition. It's commonly used when adjusting encounter difficulties
    or scaling factors in World of Warcraft content.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Smoothing Application
    code: 'DifficultyCurve curve;

      curve.Smooth(0.5f); // Apply moderate smoothing to the difficulty curve'
    language: cpp
  - title: Smoothing with Different Factors
    code: 'DifficultyCurve curve;

      curve.Smooth(0.1f); // Apply light smoothing

      curve.Smooth(0.9f); // Apply heavy smoothing'
    language: cpp
  notes: The smoothing factor typically ranges between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 means
    no smoothing and 1.0 means maximum smoothing. The method modifies the curve in-place
    and may affect subsequent calculations that depend on the difficulty progression.
  warnings: This method modifies the internal state of the DifficultyCurve object
    directly. Ensure that any cached values or references to the curve are invalidated
    after calling this method, as the original data points will be altered.
