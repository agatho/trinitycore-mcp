documentation:
  brief: Returns the time limit in seconds for the quest
  description: The GetLimitTime method retrieves the maximum time duration allowed
    for completing a specific quest. This value represents the time limit in seconds,
    which is typically set by the game master or quest designer to control how long
    players have to complete the quest before it expires. The method is commonly used
    in conjunction with other quest-related functions to manage quest progression
    and ensure proper timing of quest completion. It may be influenced by server settings
    or difficulty levels, and can affect quest rewards if the time limit is exceeded.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the time limit in seconds for the
    quest. A value of 0 indicates that no time limit has been set, while negative
    values typically indicate an error condition or that the quest has expired.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int64 timeLimit = quest->GetLimitTime();\nif (timeLimit > 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Quest has a time limit\n    printf(\"Quest time limit: %lld seconds\\n\",\
      \ timeLimit);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No time limit or expired quest\n    printf(\"\
      No time limit or quest expired\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Quest class and should be used carefully when
    checking quest expiration times. The returned value may vary depending on server
    configuration settings and quest-specific parameters. It's recommended to check
    for valid time limits before using this method in conjunction with other quest-related
    functions.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it might return 0 or negative values
    if the quest has expired or has no time limit set. Also, the value returned may
    be affected by server settings and should not be relied upon for determining exact
    quest completion times without additional context.
