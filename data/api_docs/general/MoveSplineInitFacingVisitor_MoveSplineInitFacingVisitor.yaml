  class: MoveSplineInitFacingVisitor
  method: MoveSplineInitFacingVisitor
  signature: void MoveSplineInitFacingVisitor::MoveSplineInitFacingVisitor(MoveSplineInit
    & init)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a spline facing visitor with the provided move spline initialization
    data.
  description: The MoveSplineInitFacingVisitor constructor initializes a spline facing
    visitor object using the given MoveSplineInit instance. This class is typically
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server to handle spline-based movement
    calculations and orientation updates for game entities. It processes the initial
    movement parameters and prepares the necessary data structures for smooth, accurate
    entity movement along splines. The initialization includes setting up facing directions,
    spline points, and other movement-related properties required for proper animation
    and positioning within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: init
    description: Reference to a MoveSplineInit object containing the initial movement
      parameters and configuration data for the spline calculation. This includes
      starting position, target position, spline points, and movement flags.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of Spline Facing Visitor
    code: 'MoveSplineInit init;

      // Configure init with movement parameters

      MoveSplineInitFacingVisitor visitor(init);

      // visitor is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore movement
    system when processing entity movement requests. Developers should not directly
    instantiate this class unless implementing custom movement logic. The MoveSplineInit
    parameter must be properly configured before passing it to this constructor.
  warnings: Improperly configured MoveSplineInit objects can lead to incorrect movement
    behavior or runtime errors. Ensure all required movement parameters are set correctly
    before initialization. This class should only be used within the context of TrinityCore's
    movement system and not standalone.
