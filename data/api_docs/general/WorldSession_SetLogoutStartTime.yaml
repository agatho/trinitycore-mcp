  class: WorldSession
  method: SetLogoutStartTime
  signature: void WorldSession::SetLogoutStartTime(time_t requestTime)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the logout start time for the session to the specified request time.
  description: The SetLogoutStartTime method records the timestamp when a player initiated
    the logout process. This is used internally by the TrinityCore server to manage
    session cleanup, handle pending operations during logout, and ensure proper synchronization
    of game state changes. The method stores the provided time_t value as the logout
    start time, which can later be retrieved or used for timeout calculations. It
    does not perform any immediate logout actions; rather, it marks the beginning
    of the logout sequence for tracking purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: requestTime
    description: The Unix timestamp indicating when the logout request was made. This
      value is typically obtained using time(nullptr) or similar time functions to
      capture the current system time.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting logout start time upon player logout request
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogout(WorldSession* session)\n{\n    time_t logoutTime\
      \ = time(nullptr);\n    session->SetLogoutStartTime(logoutTime);\n    // Proceed\
      \ with logout logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the logout sequence to mark when a
    player began the process. The stored timestamp may be used for detecting stale
    sessions, managing delayed logout operations, or enforcing timeout behaviors during
    character disconnection.
