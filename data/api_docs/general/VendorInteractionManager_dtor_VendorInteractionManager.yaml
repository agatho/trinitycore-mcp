documentation:
  brief: Destroys the VendorInteractionManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the VendorInteractionManager class is responsible
    for releasing all dynamically allocated memory and cleaning up any internal state
    or references held by the manager. This method is automatically invoked when a
    VendorInteractionManager object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In
    the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this class likely manages
    interactions between players and NPCs acting as vendors, handling item transactions,
    inventory updates, and related game state cleanup. The destructor ensures that
    no memory leaks occur and that any pending vendor interactions are properly terminated
    before the object is destroyed.

  - title: Basic Destructor Usage
    code: 'VendorInteractionManager* manager = new VendorInteractionManager();

      // ... use the manager ...

      delete manager; // Triggers ~VendorInteractionManager()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless the object was dynamically
    allocated. It's important to ensure that all references to the manager are cleared
    before deletion to prevent dangling pointers. In TrinityCore, vendor interactions
    often involve database transactions and packet sending, so proper cleanup ensures
    no orphaned operations remain.
  warnings: Avoid calling this destructor manually on stack-allocated objects as it
    will be called automatically upon scope exit. Also, ensure that all ongoing vendor
    transactions are completed or cancelled before the manager is destroyed to prevent
    inconsistent game state.
