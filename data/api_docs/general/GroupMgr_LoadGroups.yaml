  method: LoadGroups
  signature: void GroupMgr::LoadGroups()
documentation:
  brief: Loads all player groups from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadGroups method initializes and populates the internal data structures
    of the GroupMgr class by retrieving all existing player groups from the database.
    This method is typically invoked during server startup or when the group management
    system needs to be refreshed with current group data. It ensures that all active
    groups, their members, and associated metadata are properly loaded into memory
    for real-time group operations such as member management, loot distribution, and
    group communication. The method performs database queries to fetch group information
    including leader GUIDs, group type, and member details.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadCustomData()\n{\n    sGroupMgr->LoadGroups();\n    // Groups\
      \ are now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    a complete refresh of group data is required. It's not thread-safe and should
    be executed in a single-threaded context to prevent race conditions. The method
    may block briefly while performing database queries.
  warnings: Calling LoadGroups multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to duplicate
    group entries in memory. This method assumes that the database connection is already
    established and functional.
