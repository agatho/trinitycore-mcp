  class: Arena
  method: AddPlayer
  signature: void Arena::AddPlayer(Player * player, int queueId)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a player to an arena queue with the specified queue ID.
  description: The AddPlayer method is responsible for registering a Player object
    into a specific arena queue identified by the queueId parameter. This method typically
    handles the initial setup of a player's participation in an arena match, including
    updating internal data structures and potentially triggering queue-related events
    or notifications. It ensures that the player is properly associated with the correct
    arena bracket and queue type. The method may also perform validation checks to
    ensure the player meets the requirements for joining the specified queue.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object that is being added to the arena queue.
      Must be a valid player instance; null pointers will likely cause undefined behavior.
  - name: queueId
    description: An integer identifier representing the specific arena queue or bracket
      into which the player should be added. This typically corresponds to predefined
      arena types such as 2v2, 3v3, or 5v5 queues.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Arena* arena = sObjectAccessor->GetArenaByQueueId(0);\nPlayer* player =\
      \ sObjectAccessor->FindPlayerByName(\"TestPlayer\");\nif (player && arena)\n\
      {\n    arena->AddPlayer(player, 0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the process of joining an arena match
    or when a player attempts to enter an arena queue. It may internally update player
    state, send packet notifications to the client, and manage internal arena data
    structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer can lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Also, verify
    that the queueId corresponds to a valid arena queue type; invalid IDs may result
    in silent failures or incorrect queue assignment.
