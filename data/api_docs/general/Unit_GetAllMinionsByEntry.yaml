  signature: void Unit::GetAllMinionsByEntry(int & Minions, uint32 entry)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves all minions of a specified entry type from the unit's summon list.
  description: This method allows developers to fetch all minions that match a specific
    creature entry ID from the unit's summon list. It is commonly used in AI scripts
    and game mechanics to manage summoned creatures or pets. The method operates on
    the unit's internal summon list, which contains all summoned creatures including
    pets, guardians, and other summoned entities. This function is particularly useful
    for identifying and managing specific types of minions within a creature's summon
    list, such as those that are summoned by spells or abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: Minions
    description: Reference to a vector containing all matching minions found in the
      unit's summon list. This parameter is modified in-place to contain the results.
  - name: entry
    description: The creature entry ID used to filter minions from the summon list.
      Only minions with this specific entry ID will be included in the Minions vector.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = GetUnit();

      std::vector<Creature*> minions;

      unit->GetAllMinionsByEntry(minions, 12345);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Unit* unit = GetUnit();\nstd::vector<Creature*> minions;\nunit->GetAllMinionsByEntry(minions,\
      \ 12345);\nfor (auto& minion : minions)\n{\n    if (minion && minion->IsAlive())\n\
      \    {\n        // Process alive minions\n    }\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other summon-related methods.
    It requires the unit to have a valid summon list and may not work properly if
    the unit has no summons or if the entry ID does not match any existing minions.
    Performance considerations include iterating through potentially large summon
    lists, so it should be used judiciously.
  warnings: This method assumes that the unit has a valid summon list and will not
    work correctly if the unit has no summoned creatures or if the entry ID is invalid.
    Care must be taken when using this method in AI scripts to avoid infinite loops
    or incorrect behavior.
