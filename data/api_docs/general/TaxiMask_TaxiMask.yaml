  method: TaxiMask
  signature: void TaxiMask::TaxiMask()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new TaxiMask object with default values.
  description: The TaxiMask constructor initializes a new instance of the TaxiMask
    class, setting up internal data structures to manage taxi route information for
    players. This class is used within TrinityCore's player movement and flight path
    systems to track which taxi nodes a player has visited or can access. The constructor
    typically sets all mask bits to false or zero, indicating no known taxi routes
    by default. It prepares the object for subsequent operations such as adding known
    taxi nodes or checking route availability.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new TaxiMask instance
    code: 'TaxiMask mask;

      // Initializes a new empty taxi mask

      mask.AddTaxiNode(12345);

      // Adds a known taxi node to the mask'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when creating player objects or during world initialization. Developers should
    not directly instantiate TaxiMask objects unless implementing custom flight path
    logic. The class likely uses bitmasks for efficient storage and lookup of taxi
    node information.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly in most cases - it's intended for
    internal use by the TrinityCore framework. Incorrect usage may lead to undefined
    behavior or memory corruption if the internal data structures aren't properly
    initialized.
