  method: UpdateVengeanceRotation
  signature: void DemonHunterAI::UpdateVengeanceRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the vengeance rotation logic for a demon hunter AI, determining the
    next ability to cast based on current combat state and resource management.
  description: The UpdateVengeanceRotation method is responsible for managing the
    core combat decision-making process for a Demon Hunter's Vengeance specialization
    AI. This method evaluates the current target, available resources (such as Fury),
    and combat conditions to determine the optimal ability to execute next. It integrates
    with the overall AI framework to ensure proper rotation execution while considering
    cooldowns, damage output priorities, and defensive mechanics. The method typically
    updates internal state variables that track the AI's current action plan and may
    modify the target reference if a more suitable enemy is identified during rotation
    evaluation.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the current target identifier.
      This parameter allows the method to access and potentially modify the target
      selection during rotation updates.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::Update()\n{\n    int currentTarget = GetTargetId();\n\
      \    UpdateVengeanceRotation(&currentTarget);\n    // Additional logic for executing\
      \ the determined action\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat state management
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UpdateCombatState()\n{\n    if (IsInCombat())\n   \
      \ {\n        int targetId = GetTargetId();\n        UpdateVengeanceRotation(&targetId);\n\
      \        SetTargetId(targetId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the main AI update loop and should
    not be invoked directly outside of combat state management. The target parameter
    may be modified by this function to reflect updated targeting decisions, so callers
    should be prepared to handle potential changes to the target reference.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target parameter can lead to incorrect targeting
    behavior or null pointer exceptions. Ensure that the target integer is properly
    initialized before calling this method.
