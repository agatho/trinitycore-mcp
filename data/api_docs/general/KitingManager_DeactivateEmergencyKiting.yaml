documentation:
  brief: Deactivates the emergency kiting state for a player, restoring normal movement
    behavior.
  description: The DeactivateEmergencyKiting method is responsible for ending the
    emergency kiting state that may have been previously activated by the KitingManager.
    This typically occurs when a player's movement has been altered due to an emergency
    situation such as being in combat or under specific game mechanics that require
    temporary movement adjustments. When called, this method restores the player's
    normal movement behavior and resets any kiting-related flags or states. The method
    does not take any parameters and performs no return operations. It is generally
    used internally by the TrinityCore AI system to manage player movement during
    dynamic gameplay scenarios.

    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_player->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        m_kitingManager->ActivateEmergencyKiting();\n    }\n    else\n\
      \    {\n        m_kitingManager->DeactivateEmergencyKiting();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the emergency kiting state has been
    previously activated. Calling it without an active emergency state may have no
    effect or could potentially cause unexpected behavior in movement logic.
