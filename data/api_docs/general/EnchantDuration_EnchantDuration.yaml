  class: EnchantDuration
  method: EnchantDuration
  signature: void EnchantDuration::EnchantDuration(Item * _item, int _slot, uint32
    _leftduration)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the duration of an enchantment on a specific item slot.
  description: The EnchantDuration method is used to modify or set the remaining duration
    of an enchantment applied to a specific slot of an item. This function directly
    manipulates the enchantment timer, which affects how long the enchantment effects
    remain active on the item. It is typically invoked when enchantments need to be
    adjusted due to gameplay events such as spell effects, item modifications, or
    time-based expiration handling. The method operates on the provided item object
    and updates its enchantment data in place.
  parameters:
  - name: _item
    description: Pointer to the Item object whose enchantment duration is being modified.
      Must not be null.
  - name: _slot
    description: The slot index of the enchantment on the item. Valid values are typically
      0-5 for different enchantment slots.
  - name: _leftduration
    description: The new duration value in milliseconds to set for the enchantment.
      A value of 0 removes the enchantment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Enchantment Duration to 30 Seconds
    code: 'Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0, 15);

      EnchantDuration::EnchantDuration(item, 0, 30000);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove Enchantment by Setting Duration to Zero
    code: 'Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0, 15);

      EnchantDuration::EnchantDuration(item, 2, 0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal enchantment data of an item. It
    should only be called when the item is known to be valid and has an active enchantment
    in the specified slot. The duration value is interpreted as milliseconds, so ensure
    proper conversion from game time units if needed.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null item pointer will result in undefined
    behavior or crash. Ensure that the item exists and contains an enchantment before
    calling this function. Incorrect slot indices may cause data corruption or unexpected
    behavior.
