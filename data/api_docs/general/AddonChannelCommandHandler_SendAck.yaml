documentation:
  brief: Sends an acknowledgment message to the client for addon channel commands.
  description: The SendAck method is used within the AddonChannelCommandHandler class
    to transmit an acknowledgment response back to the client that initiated an addon
    channel command. This method ensures proper communication between the server and
    the client for addon-related operations, typically used after processing a command
    to confirm receipt and successful handling. It is part of the TrinityCore's addon
    channel system which allows third-party addons to communicate with the game server
    through specific channels. The method does not require any parameters and performs
    no return value operations, serving purely as a communication endpoint.

  - title: Basic Usage in Addon Command Handler
    code: "void MyAddonCommandHandler::HandleMyCommand(Player* player)\n{\n    //\
      \ Process the addon command logic here\n    \n    // Send acknowledgment back\
      \ to client\n    SendAck();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the context of a player's addon channel
    communication. It should only be invoked when there is an active addon channel
    connection with a client. The method does not perform any validation checks on
    whether the acknowledgment was actually sent, as it relies on the underlying network
    infrastructure to handle transmission.
