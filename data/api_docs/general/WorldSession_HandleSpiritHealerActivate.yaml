documentation:
  brief: Processes a spirit healer activation packet from the client to initiate spirit
    healer interaction.
  description: The HandleSpiritHealerActivate method is responsible for handling the
    client's request to interact with a spirit healer NPC. When a player clicks on
    a spirit healer, this method is invoked to process the packet and determine the
    appropriate response, such as reviving the player if they are dead or providing
    information about resurrection services. The method typically checks the player's
    current state and the healer's availability before proceeding with any actions.
    This method is part of the WorldSession class and is called in response to a SpiritHealerActivate
    packet sent by the client.

    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSpiritHealerActivate(WorldPackets::NPC::SpiritHealerActivate&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    if (!GetPlayer())\n        return;\n\n    Player* player =\
      \ GetPlayer();\n    // Process the spirit healer interaction logic here\n  \
      \  // e.g., check if player is dead, initiate resurrection\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically triggered when a player interacts with a spirit
    healer NPC in the game world. It's important to note that this method should only
    be called when the player is in a valid state for spirit healer interaction, such
    as being dead or in need of resurrection services.
