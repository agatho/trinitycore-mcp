  signature: void InterruptDatabase::LoadRaidOverrides(uint32 encounterId)
documentation:
  brief: Loads raid encounter overrides for the specified encounter ID from the database.
  description: The LoadRaidOverrides method retrieves and processes raid encounter
    override data associated with a given encounter ID from the TrinityCore database.
    This functionality is typically used to manage special behaviors or modifications
    for specific raid encounters, such as adjusting loot distribution, modifying NPC
    abilities, or applying custom difficulty settings. The method likely populates
    internal data structures with override configurations that are then applied during
    raid instance execution. It is designed to be called during server initialization
    or when loading specific encounter data.
  parameters:
  - name: encounterId
    description: The unique identifier for the raid encounter to load overrides for.
      This value typically corresponds to a specific boss or encounter in the game's
      database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Load Overrides for Specific Encounter
    code: 'InterruptDatabase db;

      uint32 raidEncounterId = 12345;

      db.LoadRaidOverrides(raidEncounterId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves database queries and should be called during
    server startup or when encounter data needs to be refreshed. It may cache loaded
    override data for performance reasons.
