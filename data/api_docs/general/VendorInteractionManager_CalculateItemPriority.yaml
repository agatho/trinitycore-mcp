  signature: PurchasePriority VendorInteractionManager::CalculateItemPriority(const
    ItemTemplate * item) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the purchase priority of an item based on its properties
    and vendor interaction context.
  description: The CalculateItemPriority method determines how urgently an item should
    be purchased by a vendor or player, considering factors such as item rarity, value,
    utility, and current inventory status. This method is typically used within the
    VendorInteractionManager to prioritize which items to buy or sell during transactions.
    It evaluates the item's template data and applies internal logic to assign a priority
    level that influences purchasing decisions. The returned PurchasePriority enum
    indicates whether the item should be prioritized for purchase, ignored, or considered
    neutral in the vendor's decision-making process.
  parameters: []
  returns: A PurchasePriority enum value indicating the calculated priority of the
    item. Possible values may include HIGH_PRIORITY, MEDIUM_PRIORITY, LOW_PRIORITY,
    or NO_PRIORITY depending on how the vendor system evaluates the item based on
    its properties and context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const ItemTemplate* item = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nPurchasePriority\
      \ priority = vendorManager.CalculateItemPriority(item);\nif (priority == HIGH_PRIORITY)\
      \ {\n    // Handle high priority item purchase\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal vendor configuration settings and may vary
    based on the specific vendor's behavior or player class. It is recommended to
    cache results when processing multiple items to avoid redundant calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that the ItemTemplate pointer passed to this method is valid and
    not null, as dereferencing an invalid pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    The method assumes that item data has been properly loaded into memory.
