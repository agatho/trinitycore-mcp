  class: AoEDecisionManager
  method: CalculateAoEEfficiency
  signature: float AoEDecisionManager::CalculateAoEEfficiency(uint32 targets, float
    spellRadius) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the efficiency of an area-of-effect spell based on target count
    and spell radius.
  description: The CalculateAoEEfficiency method computes a normalized efficiency
    value for area-of-effect spells, taking into account the number of targets affected
    and the spell's radius. This value is typically used by AI decision-making systems
    to evaluate whether casting an AoE spell is beneficial compared to single-target
    spells. The calculation considers how well the spell covers its targets relative
    to its radius, with higher values indicating better efficiency. This method is
    part of the AoEDecisionManager class which handles various area-of-effect related
    decisions in the game's AI system.
  parameters:
  - name: targets
    description: The number of valid targets within the spell's range and line of
      sight. Must be a non-negative integer representing the count of affected entities.
  - name: spellRadius
    description: The radius of the area-of-effect spell in yards. Must be a positive
      floating-point value greater than zero, representing the spell's coverage area.
  returns: Returns a float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the efficiency of
    the AoE spell. A value of 1.0 indicates maximum efficiency (targets are optimally
    distributed within the radius), while values closer to 0.0 indicate poor efficiency
    (either too few targets or targets too spread out).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float efficiency = decisionManager.CalculateAoEEfficiency(5, 10.0f);

      // Returns efficiency value for 5 targets within a 10-yard radius'
    language: cpp
  - title: AI Decision Making Example
    code: "if (decisionManager.CalculateAoEEfficiency(targetCount, spellRadius) >\
      \ 0.7f)\n{\n    // Cast AoE spell\n    caster.CastSpell(target, spellId);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Choose single-target spell instead\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that targets are uniformly distributed within the spell
    radius. Performance is optimized for frequent calls as it's used in real-time
    AI decision loops. The calculation may involve geometric approximations to determine
    optimal target distribution within the given radius.
  warnings: This method does not validate input parameters, so calling with negative
    target counts or zero/negative spell radius values may produce undefined results.
    Ensure that targets are properly filtered for validity before passing them to
    this method.
