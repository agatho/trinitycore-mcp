documentation:
  brief: Fills instance script data with values based on the specified flag.
  description: The FillData method in InstanceScriptDataWriter is responsible for
    populating or updating instance-specific data within the script. When called with
    'withValues' set to true, it typically initializes or updates internal data structures
    with current game state values. This method is commonly used during instance loading,
    saving, or synchronization processes. The behavior may vary depending on whether
    the instance is being loaded from saved data or initialized fresh. It's an essential
    part of maintaining consistent instance state across different phases of a dungeon
    or raid encounter.
  parameters: []
  returns: void

  - title: Basic Usage in Instance Loading
    code: "class MyInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    void FillData(bool\
      \ withValues) override\n    {\n        // Initialize instance data\n       \
      \ if (withValues)\n        {\n            // Load saved values or set defaults\n\
      \            m_data[0] = 1;\n            m_data[1] = 2;\n        }\n       \
      \ else\n        {\n            // Reset to default state\n            m_data[0]\
      \ = 0;\n            m_data[1] = 0;\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during instance initialization and should
    not be invoked directly by other systems. The 'withValues' parameter determines
    whether to load existing data or reset to default values. Implementation may involve
    accessing global or persistent storage mechanisms.
