  method: RemoveGroup
  signature: void GroupMgr::RemoveGroup(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a group from the group manager's internal tracking system.
  description: The RemoveGroup method removes a specified Group object from the GroupMgr's
    collection of active groups. This method is typically called when a group is disbanded
    or when a player leaves a group, ensuring that the group is no longer tracked
    by the group management system. It performs necessary cleanup operations such
    as removing references to the group and potentially notifying other subsystems
    about the group's removal. The group object itself is not deleted from memory;
    this method only removes it from the manager's tracking.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object that needs to be removed from the group
      manager. Must be a valid pointer to an existing group, otherwise behavior is
      undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing a group after player leaves
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    GroupMgr::instance()->RemoveGroup(group);\n\
      \    // Group is now removed from manager\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Disbanding a group and cleaning up
    code: "void DisbandGroup(Player* leader)\n{\n    Group* group = leader->GetGroup();\n\
      \    if (group && group->IsLeader(leader->GetGUID()))\n    {\n        // Notify\
      \ all members\n        group->Disband();\n        // Remove the group from manager\n\
      \        GroupMgr::instance()->RemoveGroup(group);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group is valid and has been properly initialized.
    It does not delete the group object, so callers should ensure proper memory management
    if needed. The method may trigger internal cleanup routines but does not directly
    affect players in the group unless they are also removed.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method will likely cause undefined behavior
    or crashes. Always verify that the group exists and is valid before calling RemoveGroup.
    Additionally, ensure that no other systems are actively using the group object
    after calling this method.
