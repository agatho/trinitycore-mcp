  class: VendorInteraction
  method: InitializeReagentLists
  signature: void VendorInteraction::InitializeReagentLists()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the reagent lists used in vendor interactions for item transactions.
  description: The InitializeReagentLists method prepares and populates internal data
    structures that store information about reagents required for crafting items within
    the vendor interaction system. This method is typically called during the initialization
    phase of a vendor session to ensure that all necessary reagent data is loaded
    and available for subsequent crafting operations. It sets up mappings between
    item IDs and their corresponding reagent requirements, enabling the vendor to
    validate whether a player has sufficient reagents before allowing them to purchase
    or craft items.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'VendorInteraction vendor;

      vendor.InitializeReagentLists();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the setup of a vendor interaction
    session. Repeated calls may result in duplicate data entries or unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of a valid vendor interaction context,
    as it relies on internal state that may not be initialized properly.
