  class: AreaTriggerOrbit
  method: ClearChangesMask
  signature: void AreaTriggerOrbit::ClearChangesMask()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the area trigger orbit object, resetting its dirty
    state flags.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask of an
    AreaTriggerOrbit object, effectively clearing all pending updates or modifications
    that would normally be sent to clients. This is typically used during synchronization
    processes or when the server needs to indicate that no changes are currently pending
    for the area trigger. The method ensures that subsequent calls to methods checking
    for changes will not detect any modifications until new changes are applied. This
    functionality is essential for maintaining efficient network communication and
    state management in World of Warcraft's area trigger system.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AreaTriggerOrbit* orbit = new AreaTriggerOrbit();

      // ... perform some modifications ...

      orbit->ClearChangesMask();

      // Now the orbit is marked as clean and no changes will be sent to clients'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after applying all necessary updates to an area
    trigger orbit to prevent unnecessary network traffic. It's commonly used in conjunction
    with other synchronization methods during server tick processing or when preparing
    for client updates.
