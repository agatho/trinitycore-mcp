  class: Weather
  method: SetWeather
  signature: void Weather::SetWeather(int type, float intensity)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the weather type and intensity for a specific zone or area.
  description: The SetWeather method is used to change the current weather conditions
    in a given area. It allows developers to control environmental effects such as
    rain, snow, or clear skies by specifying a weather type and intensity level. This
    method typically affects players within the specified zone and can be used for
    quest events, seasonal changes, or custom game mechanics. The weather system in
    TrinityCore is designed to enhance immersion and provide dynamic world experiences.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: 'The type of weather to set. Valid values include: 0 (clear), 1 (rain),
      2 (snow), 3 (storm). The exact numeric values may vary based on the client version
      and server configuration.'
  - name: intensity
    description: The intensity level of the weather effect, typically ranging from
      0.0f (no effect) to 1.0f (maximum effect). Values outside this range may be
      clamped or cause unexpected behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Light Rain
    code: "Weather* weather = player->GetMap()->GetWeather();\nif (weather)\n{\n \
      \   weather->SetWeather(1, 0.3f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Set Heavy Snowfall
    code: "Weather* weather = player->GetMap()->GetWeather();\nif (weather)\n{\n \
      \   weather->SetWeather(2, 0.9f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the weather state for a specific zone and may not immediately
    affect all players in that area depending on their current location or map loading
    state. The weather system is typically tied to the Map object, so calling this
    method requires access to a valid Weather instance.
  warnings: Setting invalid weather types or intensity values outside the expected
    range can cause visual glitches or undefined behavior. Always ensure that the
    Weather object exists before calling SetWeather to avoid null pointer exceptions.
