  brief: Moves a World object instance to another World object instance
  description: The World::World(World&&) method is a move constructor for the World
    class. It transfers ownership of resources from a source World object to a newly
    constructed World object, effectively moving the state rather than copying it.
    This is typically used in scenarios where temporary or intermediate World objects
    need to be efficiently transferred to new variables without unnecessary copying
    operations. The move constructor is part of C++'s resource management strategy
    and helps optimize performance when dealing with large objects or those managing
    system resources.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to another World object whose resources will
      be moved to this new instance
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic move construction
    code: 'World world1;

      // ... perform operations on world1 ...

      World world2 = std::move(world1); // Move constructor called here'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move in function return
    code: "World createWorld() {\n    World w;\n    // ... initialize world ...\n\
      \    return w; // Move constructor used for return value optimization\n}\n\n\
      World mainWorld = createWorld();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a regular constructor. After the move operation,
    the source object should be considered in a valid but unspecified state. The World
    class likely manages significant resources such as game world data structures,
    maps, or server connections that benefit from efficient move semantics.
  warnings: Do not use the source object after moving it. The moved-from object is
    left in a valid but undefined state and accessing its members may lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure proper use of std::move() when calling this constructor explicitly.
