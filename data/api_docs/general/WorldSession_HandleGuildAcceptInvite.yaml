  signature: void WorldSession::HandleGuildAcceptInvite(WorldPackets::Guild::AcceptGuildInvite
    & invite)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a guild invitation acceptance from a player.
  description: The HandleGuildAcceptInvite method handles the client-side packet sent
    when a player accepts a guild invitation. It validates the invitation, checks
    if the player can join the guild, and performs the necessary actions to add the
    player to the guild roster. This method is part of the WorldSession's packet handling
    system and is invoked automatically when the client sends an accept guild invite
    packet. The method ensures that the player meets all requirements for guild membership
    and updates the guild's internal state accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: invite
    description: The packet containing information about the guild invitation being
      accepted, including the guild ID and other relevant data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet handling context
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleGuildAcceptInvite(WorldPackets::Guild::AcceptGuildInvite&\
      \ invite)\n{\n    // Validate the invitation\n    if (!CanJoinGuild(invite.GuildId))\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Add player to guild\n    Guild* guild = sGuildMgr->GetGuildById(invite.GuildId);\n\
      \    if (guild)\n        guild->AddMember(GetPlayer());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the WorldSession's packet handling
    mechanism. It assumes that the player has already been validated and that the
    invitation exists in the system. The method does not directly send any response
    packets to the client; it relies on other systems to handle notifications.
  warnings: Improper validation of guild invitations can lead to security vulnerabilities
    or inconsistent guild states. Ensure all preconditions are checked before proceeding
    with guild membership addition.
