  signature: void CollectionMgr::AddItemAppearance(uint32 itemId, uint32 appearanceModId)
documentation:
  brief: Adds an item appearance modifier to the player's collection.
  description: The AddItemAppearance method registers a specific appearance modification
    for an item within the player's collection system. This allows players to unlock
    or apply visual modifications to items, such as cosmetic changes or alternate
    models. The method updates internal tracking structures to reflect that the specified
    item now has the given appearance modifier available. This functionality is typically
    used in conjunction with item appearance systems, such as those found in World
    of Warcraft's vanity and collection mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item to which the appearance modifier
      will be applied. Must correspond to a valid item in the game database.
  - name: appearanceModId
    description: The identifier of the appearance modification to associate with the
      item. This typically corresponds to an entry in the item_appearance_mod table
      or similar system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'CollectionMgr* collectionMgr = player->GetCollectionMgr();

      collectionMgr->AddItemAppearance(12345, 67890);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal data structures related to the player's
    item appearance collection. It should be called after verifying that both itemId
    and appearanceModId are valid. The actual visual effect may require additional
    calls to update the client-side display.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid itemId or appearanceModId values may
    lead to undefined behavior or errors in the collection system. Ensure all identifiers
    correspond to existing entries in the game database before invoking this method.
