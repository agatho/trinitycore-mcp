  class: RoleBasedCombatPositioning
  method: CoordinateGroupPositioning
  signature: void RoleBasedCombatPositioning::CoordinateGroupPositioning(Group * group,
    Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates group positioning relative to a target unit for role-based combat.
  description: The CoordinateGroupPositioning method adjusts the positioning of players
    within a group based on their roles and the position of a specified target unit.
    This functionality is typically used in combat scenarios where optimal positioning
    is crucial for effective gameplay, such as in raids or dungeons. The method evaluates
    each group member's role (e.g., tank, healer, damage dealer) and repositions them
    accordingly to maintain proper formation and tactical advantage. It ensures that
    players are positioned correctly relative to the target based on their assigned
    roles and combat requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players whose positioning
      will be coordinated. Must not be null.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that serves as the reference point for
      positioning. This is typically the primary target in combat. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Positioning
    code: 'Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();

      Unit* combatTarget = unit;

      RoleBasedCombatPositioning::CoordinateGroupPositioning(playerGroup, combatTarget);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Positioning with Role Checks
    code: "if (playerGroup && combatTarget)\n{\n    // Ensure group has members and\
      \ target exists\n    RoleBasedCombatPositioning::CoordinateGroupPositioning(playerGroup,\
      \ combatTarget);\n    // Additional logic for role-specific positioning could\
      \ follow\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during combat situations where dynamic positioning
    is required. It assumes that group members are already assigned roles and that
    the target unit is valid. The actual positioning logic may vary depending on the
    specific implementation of role-based combat systems within TrinityCore.
  warnings: Ensure that both the Group and Unit parameters are valid before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior or crashes. This function should not be
    called outside of combat contexts unless specifically designed for non-combat
    positioning.
