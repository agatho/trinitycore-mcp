  class: CreateObjectBits
  method: Clear
  signature: void CreateObjectBits::Clear()
documentation:
  brief: Clears all bits within the CreateObjectBits object, resetting its state to
    empty.
  description: The Clear method resets the internal bitset of a CreateObjectBits object,
    effectively clearing all previously set bits. This operation is commonly used
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework when preparing or reinitializing
    object visibility or update masks. The method ensures that no residual bits remain
    in the object's state, which is essential for proper network packet construction
    and object synchronization. It typically serves as a preparatory step before setting
    new bits for a specific object's update flags.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of Clear Method
    code: 'CreateObjectBits bits;

      // Set some bits...

      bits.Set(1);

      bits.Set(5);

      // Reset all bits

      bits.Clear(); // All bits are now cleared'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often used in conjunction with other bit manipulation methods
    like Set() and Test(). It's important to call Clear() before populating a new
    set of bits to avoid incorrect state propagation. The performance impact is minimal
    as it typically involves resetting internal memory or bit counters.
