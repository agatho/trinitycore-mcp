  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: RegisterBot
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::RegisterBot(uint32_t botGuid, uint8_t botClass,
    uint8_t botLevel, uint8_t specialization)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a new bot with the performance analytics system, storing its GUID,
    class, level, and specialization for tracking and analysis.
  description: The RegisterBot method is used to add a new bot instance to the performance
    analytics subsystem within TrinityCore. This method stores essential metadata
    about the bot including its unique identifier (GUID), player class, current level,
    and specialization. The registration allows the system to track and analyze bot
    behavior, performance metrics, and usage patterns over time. This functionality
    is typically invoked when a bot is created or initialized in the game world, ensuring
    that all relevant data is captured for subsequent analysis. The method does not
    return any value and operates as a void function, meaning it performs its task
    silently without providing feedback on success or failure.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot being registered. This is
      typically a 32-bit unsigned integer that uniquely identifies the bot instance
      within the game world.
  - name: botClass
    description: The player class of the bot, represented as an 8-bit unsigned integer.
      Valid values correspond to standard World of Warcraft class IDs (e.g., 1 for
      Warrior, 2 for Paladin, etc.).
  - name: botLevel
    description: The current level of the bot, stored as an 8-bit unsigned integer.
      This represents the bot's progression within the game and is typically between
      1 and 80.
  - name: specialization
    description: The specialization or role of the bot, encoded as an 8-bit unsigned
      integer. This value indicates the bot's primary gameplay focus (e.g., tank,
      healer, damage dealer) within its class.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Registration
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      uint32_t guid = 123456;

      uint8_t cls = 7; // Mage

      uint8_t level = 70;

      uint8_t spec = 2; // Arcane specialization

      analytics.RegisterBot(guid, cls, level, spec);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering Multiple Bots
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      // Register a warrior bot

      analytics.RegisterBot(1001, 1, 70, 1);

      // Register a rogue bot

      analytics.RegisterBot(1002, 4, 60, 3);

      // Register a priest bot

      analytics.RegisterBot(1003, 5, 80, 2);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during bot initialization or creation. The
    data stored through this method may be used for performance monitoring, statistical
    analysis, or debugging purposes. It's important to ensure that the GUID provided
    is unique to avoid conflicts in the analytics system.
  warnings: Ensure that all parameters are within valid ranges before calling this
    method. Invalid class or specialization values may lead to incorrect data being
    stored or analyzed. The method does not validate input parameters, so callers
    should ensure data integrity.
