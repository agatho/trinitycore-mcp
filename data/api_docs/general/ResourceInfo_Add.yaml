  class: ResourceInfo
  method: Add
  signature: uint32 ResourceInfo::Add(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Adds the specified amount to the resource and returns the updated total.
  description: The Add method increments the current resource value by the provided
    amount and returns the new total. This method is typically used in World of Warcraft
    TrinityCore to manage player resources such as mana, rage, energy, or runic power.
    The operation ensures that the resource count is properly updated within the game's
    resource management system. It may perform bounds checking to prevent overflow
    or underflow depending on the specific resource type and implementation. This
    method is commonly invoked during gameplay events like spell casting, ability
    usage, or passive resource regeneration.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity to add to the current resource value. Must be a non-negative
      integer. Values exceeding the maximum resource capacity may be clamped depending
      on implementation.
  returns: Returns the updated total resource amount after adding the specified amount.
    If the addition would exceed the maximum allowed resource value, the return value
    reflects the clamped result.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Addition
    code: 'ResourceInfo resource;

      resource.Add(50);

      // Adds 50 to the current resource total and returns the new value'
    language: cpp
  - title: Mana Regeneration Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->GetPower(POWER_MANA)->Add(100);

      // Adds 100 mana points to the player''s current mana pool'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ResourceInfo class which handles resource tracking
    for various game elements including players, creatures, and game objects. The
    implementation may include automatic clamping to prevent resource values from
    exceeding defined maximums or falling below zero. Thread safety depends on how
    the underlying resource system is implemented; it's recommended to check for thread-safety
    in multi-threaded contexts.
  warnings: Be cautious when adding large amounts to resources, as this could potentially
    cause overflow issues if not properly bounded. Ensure that the amount parameter
    is validated before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior or resource
    corruption.
