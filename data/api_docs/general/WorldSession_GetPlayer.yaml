  signature: Player * WorldSession::GetPlayer() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the Player object associated with this session.
  description: The GetPlayer method retrieves the Player instance that is currently
    logged in and associated with this WorldSession. This method is commonly used
    throughout the TrinityCore codebase to access player-specific data, such as inventory,
    stats, quest progress, or position information. The returned pointer is valid
    only if the session has an active player connection; otherwise, it will return
    a null pointer. This method does not perform any locking or thread safety checks
    internally, so callers should ensure proper synchronization when accessing player
    data from multiple threads.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Player object associated with this session, or nullptr
    if no player is currently logged in.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* player = session->GetPlayer();\nif (player)\n{\n    // Safe to\
      \ use player object\n    player->SendNotification(\"Hello, %s!\", player->GetName().c_str());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Player Position
    code: "WorldSession* session = ...;\nPlayer* player = session->GetPlayer();\n\
      if (player)\n{\n    float x, y, z;\n    player->GetPosition(x, y, z);\n    //\
      \ Use position data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is frequently used in packet handlers and game logic to access
    the player context. The returned Player pointer should not be stored for long
    periods as the session may become disconnected or the player may log out, invalidating
    the pointer.
  warnings: Never assume that GetPlayer() will return a valid pointer. Always check
    for null before dereferencing the result. Using an invalid pointer can lead to
    crashes or undefined behavior.
