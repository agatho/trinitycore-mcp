  signature: void BitVectors::ClearChangesMask()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the bit vector, resetting all tracked modifications.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with a BitVectors object. This operation effectively clears any previously marked
    changes, indicating that the current state of the bit vector is considered up-to-date
    and no modifications have been made since the last reset. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft server implementation, this method is typically used when synchronizing
    player data or updating object states to ensure that only new changes are tracked
    and sent to clients. The method does not alter the actual bit values themselves
    but merely resets the tracking mechanism for changes.

  - title: Basic Usage in Player Update Context
    code: 'BitVectors playerUpdateMask;

      // ... set some bits ...

      playerUpdateMask.ClearChangesMask();

      // All previous changes are now cleared, ready for new updates'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly called during the process of sending updates to clients
    in TrinityCore. It's important to call this after processing or sending change
    notifications to prevent duplicate sends. The implementation likely involves resetting
    an internal flag or bitfield that tracks which bits have been modified since the
    last clear operation.
