  class: ProfessionManager
  method: Initialize
  signature: void ProfessionManager::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the profession manager's internal data structures and loads all
    available professions from the database.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the ProfessionManager class by loading
    and caching all available professions from the game database. This includes retrieving
    profession information such as names, ranks, required skills, and associated spells.
    The method ensures that all profession-related data is properly initialized before
    any player can interact with professions. It typically runs during server startup
    or when the profession system is first accessed. The initialization process may
    involve database queries, caching of profession templates, and setting up internal
    lookup tables for fast access to profession data. This method should only be called
    once during the application lifecycle to avoid duplicate initialization.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'ProfessionManager* pm = new ProfessionManager();

      pm->Initialize();

      // Professions are now loaded and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    server initialization. It's not recommended to call this method manually after
    initial startup as it may cause data inconsistencies or duplicate loading. The
    method performs database operations that could impact performance if called frequently.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times can lead to memory leaks or corrupted
    internal state. This method should only be invoked once during the application
    lifecycle, typically at server startup. Do not call this method from within multithreaded
    contexts without proper synchronization.
