  signature: void Spell::CallScriptAfterHitHandlers()
documentation:
  brief: Executes all registered script handlers after a spell hit occurs.
  description: The CallScriptAfterHitHandlers method is responsible for invoking all
    script-based event handlers that are registered to execute after a spell has successfully
    hit its target. This method is typically called during the spell's execution flow,
    specifically after the damage calculation and application phases but before the
    spell finishes processing. It allows custom scripts and addons to modify or react
    to the spell's effects post-hit, such as applying additional effects, modifying
    damage, or triggering other game events. The method ensures that all registered
    AfterHit handlers are called in the correct order, maintaining the integrity of
    the spell's script execution sequence.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within spell processing
    code: "void MySpell::EffectExecute()\n{\n    // ... spell logic ...\n    if (m_hitTarget)\n\
      \    {\n        m_spell->CallScriptAfterHitHandlers();\n    }\n    // ... continue\
      \ spell execution ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's spell script system and should only
    be called when the spell has actually hit a target. It assumes that all necessary
    preconditions for script execution have been met, such as valid target references
    and proper spell state. The method does not perform any safety checks on whether
    handlers are registered or valid.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring that the spell has hit a target may
    result in unexpected behavior or crashes. It should only be invoked during appropriate
    phases of spell execution, typically after m_hitTarget is confirmed to be valid.
    Avoid calling this method from within script handlers themselves to prevent potential
    stack overflow or infinite recursion.
