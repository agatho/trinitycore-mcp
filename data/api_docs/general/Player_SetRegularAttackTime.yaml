documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's regular attack time to the default value.
  description: This method configures the player's attack speed to match the standard
    melee attack time, which is typically 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds) for normal
    attacks. It ensures that the player's auto-attack behavior aligns with game mechanics
    and prevents any discrepancies in combat timing. The method is commonly used during
    character initialization or when resetting attack speed after modifications.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetRegularAttackTime();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the player's attack speed and is typically invoked
    during initialization or when resetting to default combat behavior. It does not
    return any value but modifies internal state.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause inconsistent attack timing, leading
    to unexpected behavior in combat. Ensure that this method is called only when
    necessary to avoid unintended side effects.
