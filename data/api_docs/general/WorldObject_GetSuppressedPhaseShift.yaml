documentation:
  brief: Returns the suppressed phase shift value for the WorldObject.
  description: The GetSuppressedPhaseShift method retrieves the current suppressed
    phase shift value associated with the WorldObject. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    implementation, phase shifts are used to control which players can see specific
    objects based on game events, quests, or other conditions. This suppression mechanism
    allows certain objects to be hidden from players even when they would normally
    be visible in the same phase. The returned integer represents the phase mask that
    suppresses visibility for this object. A value of 0 typically indicates no suppression
    is active.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const reference to an integer representing the suppressed phase shift
    mask. This value can be used to determine which phases are currently suppressing
    visibility of this WorldObject. A return value of 0 means no phase suppression
    is applied.
  examples:
  - title: Check if object has phase suppression
    code: "const int& suppressedPhase = worldObject->GetSuppressedPhaseShift();\n\
      if (suppressedPhase != 0)\n{\n    // Object is currently suppressed in certain\
      \ phases\n    sLog->outString(\"Object is suppressed in phase mask: %u\", suppressedPhase);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a const reference, so the value should not be modified
    directly. The phase shift system is integral to TrinityCore's visibility management
    and affects how players perceive world objects during gameplay events.
