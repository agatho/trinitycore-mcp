  class: WorldSession
  method: GetRemoteAddress
  signature: const std::string & WorldSession::GetRemoteAddress() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the remote IP address of the client connection associated with
    this WorldSession.
  description: The GetRemoteAddress method returns a string representation of the
    IP address from which the client is connected to the TrinityCore server. This
    information is typically used for logging, security checks, or identifying player
    locations. The returned address is in standard IPv4 format (e.g., "192.168.1.1")
    or IPv6 format if the client uses IPv6. This method does not perform any network
    operations; it simply returns cached connection information that was established
    during the initial handshake. The method is thread-safe and can be called from
    any context where a WorldSession object is available.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the remote IP address
    of the client connection in textual format (e.g., "127.0.0.1" or "2001:db8::1").
  examples:
  - title: Logging Client IP Address
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogin(WorldSession* session)\n{\n    std::string ip =\
      \ session->GetRemoteAddress();\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_SERVER, \"Player\
      \ connected from IP: %s\", ip.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: IP-Based Security Check
    code: "bool IsAllowedIP(WorldSession* session)\n{\n    std::string ip = session->GetRemoteAddress();\n\
      \    // Example: check if IP is in allowed list\n    return ip == \"192.168.1.100\"\
      \ || ip == \"10.0.0.1\";\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned IP address reflects the actual network endpoint of the client,
    which may be a direct connection or behind a NAT/router. In some cases, especially
    with proxy setups, this might not represent the true physical location of the
    player. The method is optimized for performance and does not involve any blocking
    I/O operations.
  warnings: This method returns an IP address string that should not be used directly
    for security-sensitive operations without additional validation or sanitization.
    Also, in IPv6 environments, ensure your application properly handles both IPv4-mapped
    and native IPv6 addresses if they are relevant to your use case.
