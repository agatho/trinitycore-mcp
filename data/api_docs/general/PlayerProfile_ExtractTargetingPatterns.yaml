documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and extracts targeting patterns from player behavior data for threat
    and combat analysis.
  description: The ExtractTargetingPatterns method processes stored player targeting
    behavior data to identify consistent patterns in how a player selects targets
    during combat. This method is typically invoked as part of the player's profile
    analysis system within TrinityCore's combat simulation framework. It examines
    various factors such as target selection timing, preferred target types, and aggression
    levels to build a comprehensive targeting profile that can be used for AI behavior
    adjustment, threat calculation, or player performance analysis. The extracted
    patterns are stored internally for later use in combat decision-making algorithms.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Analysis
    code: 'PlayerProfile* profile = player->GetPlayerProfile();

      profile->ExtractTargetingPatterns();

      // Targeting patterns are now available for threat calculations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after sufficient combat data has been collected
    and stored in the player profile. The method performs intensive pattern matching
    operations that may impact performance during high-frequency combat scenarios.
    It is recommended to call this method asynchronously or during combat pauses to
    avoid frame rate drops.
  warnings: Calling this method without prior data collection will result in empty
    targeting patterns. This method modifies internal player profile state and should
    not be called during critical combat states where target switching is actively
    occurring.
