  class: GroupFormation
  method: GroupFormation
  signature: void GroupFormation::GroupFormation(uint32 groupId, FormationType type)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes or updates the formation of a group based on the specified formation
    type.
  description: The GroupFormation method configures how a group of players or creatures
    should be positioned within the game world. This method is typically used to define
    the tactical layout for groups during combat or movement scenarios. It allows
    for dynamic adjustment of group positioning, which can affect AI behavior, player
    interactions, and overall battlefield strategy. The method takes a group identifier
    and a formation type to determine how members of that group should align with
    one another.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: Unique identifier for the group whose formation is being set or updated.
      This value must correspond to an existing group in the game world.
  - name: type
    description: Specifies the formation type to apply to the group. Valid values
      are typically defined by an enumeration such as LINE, CIRCLE, SQUARE, or other
      tactical formations used in World of Warcraft's combat system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Group Formation to Line
    code: 'GroupFormation formation;

      formation.GroupFormation(12345, LINE);

      // Sets group with ID 12345 to a line formation.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update Group Formation Type
    code: 'GroupFormation formation;

      formation.GroupFormation(player->GetGroup()->GetId(), CIRCLE);

      // Updates the current player''s group to a circle formation.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for internal use by the TrinityCore framework
    and may be invoked during group creation, leader changes, or tactical adjustments.
    It does not directly affect the visual appearance of players or creatures but
    influences their positioning logic in combat scenarios.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of invalid group IDs or formation types can lead to undefined
    behavior or errors within the game's AI system. Ensure that the groupId refers
    to a valid active group before calling this method.
