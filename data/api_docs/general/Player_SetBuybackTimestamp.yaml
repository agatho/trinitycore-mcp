  method: SetBuybackTimestamp
  signature: void Player::SetBuybackTimestamp(uint32 slot, time_t timestamp)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the buyback timestamp for a specific inventory slot in the player's
    buyback system.
  description: This method allows developers to set the timestamp for a specific buyback
    slot, which controls when items in that slot will be removed from the player's
    buyback inventory. The buyback system is used to store items purchased from vendors
    that are not immediately sold back to the vendor. This method is typically used
    during player initialization or when modifying buyback item properties. The timestamp
    represents a Unix time value indicating when the buyback item will expire and
    become unavailable for purchase.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The inventory slot index (0-127) to set the buyback timestamp for.
      This corresponds to the buyback slot in the player's inventory where items are
      stored.
  - name: timestamp
    description: The Unix timestamp value to set for the buyback slot. This represents
      the time when the item will expire and become unavailable for purchase.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Buyback Timestamp
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 slot = 0;

      time_t timestamp = time(NULL) + 3600;

      player->SetBuybackTimestamp(slot, timestamp);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Buyback Timestamp for Multiple Slots
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nfor (int i = 0; i < 128; ++i)\n{\n    time_t\
      \ timestamp = time(NULL) + 3600;\n    player->SetBuybackTimestamp(i, timestamp);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other buyback-related methods
    to manage player inventory items. The timestamp value should be set appropriately
    based on the desired item expiration time. This method may affect performance
    if called frequently during gameplay, as it involves updating internal player
    data structures.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect buyback item behavior
    or inventory issues. Care must be taken when setting timestamps to ensure they
    are valid and appropriately timed for the intended game mechanics.
