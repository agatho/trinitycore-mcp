  class: LFGRoleDetector
  method: CalculateDPSScore
  signature: uint32 LFGRoleDetector::CalculateDPSScore(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the Damage Per Second (DPS) score for a given player
    based on their equipped items and combat abilities.
  description: The CalculateDPSScore method computes a numerical DPS value for a Player
    object by evaluating their current gear, weapon damage, attack speed, and other
    relevant combat statistics. This score is typically used in the context of LFG
    (Looking For Group) role detection to determine if a player is suitable for a
    DPS role within a group. The calculation considers the player's main hand and
    off-hand weapon damage, weapon speed, and any applicable buffs or talents that
    affect damage output. It does not account for temporary effects like potions or
    buffs that may change during combat but rather provides a baseline score based
    on static equipment and character attributes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the calculated DPS score. Higher values indicate
    higher potential damage output, which can be used to match players with appropriate
    group roles in LFG systems.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      uint32 dpsScore = LFGRoleDetector::CalculateDPSScore(player);

      // Use dpsScore to determine if player qualifies for DPS role in LFG'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's current gear and static character data.
    It does not factor in buffs, debuffs, or temporary stat changes that might occur
    during actual gameplay. The score is calculated using a standardized formula that
    weights weapon damage and attack speed to produce a normalized DPS value suitable
    for role matching.
  warnings: The returned DPS score may not reflect real-time combat performance due
    to its reliance on static data. It should be used primarily for LFG role assignment
    rather than as an indicator of actual in-game damage output during encounters.
