  brief: Loads faction change achievement data from the database into memory for use
    in the game.
  description: The LoadFactionChangeAchievements method initializes and populates
    internal data structures with faction change achievement information retrieved
    from the database. This method is typically called during server startup or reload
    operations to ensure that players can earn and track faction change-related achievements.
    It processes records related to faction transitions and their associated achievements,
    making them available for validation when players complete faction changes. The
    method does not take any parameters and performs no direct return operations;
    instead, it updates internal caches and lookup tables used by the achievement
    system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: ObjectMgr::instance()->LoadFactionChangeAchievements();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically during server initialization
    or database reload processes. It assumes that the database connection is already
    established and that the relevant faction change achievement tables exist. The
    loaded data is cached in memory for fast access during runtime.
