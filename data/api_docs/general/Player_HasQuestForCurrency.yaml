documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player has a quest associated with a specific currency.
  description: This method determines if a player has any quest that requires a specific
    currency for completion. It is commonly used in quest system logic to verify currency
    requirements for quest completion, particularly when dealing with reputation-based
    quests or currency-based rewards. The method returns true if the player has at
    least one quest that requires the specified currency, false otherwise. This functionality
    is essential for handling currency-based quest systems and ensuring proper quest
    progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has any quest requiring the specified currency,
    false otherwise. The return value represents whether a valid quest exists that
    requires the given currency ID for completion.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->HasQuestForCurrency(384)) {\n    // Player has a quest requiring\
      \ currency ID 384\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "uint32 currencyId = 384;\nif (player->HasQuestForCurrency(currencyId))\
      \ {\n    // Check if player has any quest requiring this currency\n    // This\
      \ could be used in quest completion logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal quest data structures to check for currency
    requirements. Performance may be affected by the number of active quests in the
    player's quest log. The method is thread-safe as it operates on player data that
    is typically accessed through safe methods.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly in quest completion logic without
    checking if the player has completed the quest. It only checks for existence of
    currency requirements, not whether the quest is complete or available.
