  class: Item
  method: GetGemCountWithID
  signature: uint8 Item::GetGemCountWithID(uint32 GemID) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of gems with a specific ID embedded in the item.
  description: This method retrieves the number of gems with a given ID that are currently
    socketed into the item. It is used to determine how many times a particular gem
    has been inserted into the item's gem slots, which is essential for game mechanics
    involving gemming, enchanting, and item evaluation. The method operates on the
    item's internal gem data structure and provides accurate counts based on the gem
    ID provided. This functionality is particularly important for players who want
    to track their gem usage or for developers working with item gemming systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the count of gems with the specified
    ID embedded in the item. A value of 0 indicates that no gems with the given ID
    are socketed into the item, while higher values indicate the number of times that
    specific gem appears in the item's gem slots.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: uint8 count = item->GetGemCountWithID(12345); // Returns the count of gems
      with ID 12345
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal gem handling system and relies on the
    item's gem slot data structure. It should be used carefully as it may not reflect
    actual gem counts if the item has been modified through game mechanics or player
    actions. Performance considerations include potential overhead when used in loops
    or frequent calls.
  warnings: This method does not validate whether the GemID exists or is valid; it
    simply returns the count of gems with that ID, which could lead to incorrect results
    if the gem ID is invalid or non-existent. Be cautious when using this method with
    unknown gem IDs.
