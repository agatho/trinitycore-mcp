documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the hunter's pet requires revival.
  description: The NeedsPetRevive method checks if the hunter's current pet is dead
    or in a state where it needs to be revived. This method is typically used by the
    HunterAI class to determine when to trigger pet revival mechanics, such as using
    a resurrection spell or summoning a new pet. The check considers the pet's health
    status and whether it has been killed by an enemy or has expired due to time limits.
    This functionality is crucial for maintaining optimal hunter gameplay performance
    in both PvE and PvP scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the hunter's pet is dead or requires revival, false otherwise.
    The method returns false when the pet is alive and functional, or when there is
    no pet assigned to the hunter.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (player->GetAI()->NeedsPetRevive()) {\n    // Attempt to revive the\
      \ pet\n    player->GetPet()->Revive();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Pet Management System
    code: "void HunterAI::UpdatePetBehavior() {\n    if (NeedsPetRevive()) {\n   \
      \     // Handle pet revival logic\n        if (GetPet()->GetHealth() == 0) {\n\
      \            // Pet is dead, attempt to revive\n            CastSpellOnPet(SPELL_REVIVE_PET);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state tracking of the pet's health and
    status. It should be called regularly during AI updates to ensure timely pet revival
    actions. The implementation may vary depending on the specific hunter class specialization
    or talent configuration.
  warnings: Ensure that the hunter actually has a pet assigned before calling this
    method, as it might not properly handle cases where no pet exists. Calling this
    method inappropriately could lead to incorrect AI behavior or potential crashes
    if pet-related operations are attempted without proper validation.
