  class: NearestUnspawnedGameObjectEntryInObjectRangeCheck
  method: NearestUnspawnedGameObjectEntryInObjectRangeCheck
  signature: void NearestUnspawnedGameObjectEntryInObjectRangeCheck::NearestUnspawnedGameObjectEntryInObjectRangeCheck(const
    NearestUnspawnedGameObjectEntryInObjectRangeCheck & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the NearestUnspawnedGameObjectEntryInObjectRangeCheck
    class with values from another instance.
  description: This is a copy constructor for the NearestUnspawnedGameObjectEntryInObjectRangeCheck
    class. It initializes a new object by copying all member variables and state information
    from an existing instance of the same class. The method performs a shallow copy
    of the provided object's data members, ensuring that the newly created object
    has identical properties and configuration as the source object. This constructor
    is typically used when creating copies of check objects for use in spatial queries
    or AI decision-making systems within the TrinityCore framework. The underlying
    game mechanics involve searching for unspawned game objects within a specified
    range of another object, commonly used in NPC behavior scripting and quest system
    implementations.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source instance of NearestUnspawnedGameObjectEntryInObjectRangeCheck
      to copy values from. This parameter must be a valid, initialized object of the
      same class type.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Copying a GameObject Check Instance
    code: 'NearestUnspawnedGameObjectEntryInObjectRangeCheck originalCheck(12345,
      50.0f);

      NearestUnspawnedGameObjectEntryInObjectRangeCheck copiedCheck(originalCheck);

      // copiedCheck now contains identical values to originalCheck'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the standard C++ copy semantics and should be
    used carefully in performance-critical sections. Since it's a copy constructor,
    it may involve copying large amounts of data depending on the internal structure
    of the class. The implementation assumes that the source object is valid and properly
    initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that the source object passed to this constructor is fully initialized
    before calling, as copying an uninitialized object can lead to undefined behavior.
    This constructor does not perform deep copying if the class contains pointers
    or complex nested objects.
