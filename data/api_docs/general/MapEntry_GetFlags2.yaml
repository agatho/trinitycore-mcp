documentation:
  brief: Returns the second set of flags for the map entry, used to define additional
    map properties and behaviors.
  description: The GetFlags2 method retrieves the secondary flags associated with
    a MapEntry object. These flags are typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    to define various map-specific properties such as instance types, difficulty settings,
    or special gameplay mechanics. The returned integer value is a bitmask that can
    be checked against specific flag constants to determine enabled features or behaviors
    for the map. This method does not modify any internal state and is safe to call
    multiple times. It is commonly used during map loading, player entry validation,
    and instance management logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the bitmask of secondary flags for the map entry.
    Each bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific flag that defines various
    properties or behaviors of the map. Commonly checked flags include values like
    MAP_FLAG_2_ALLOW_MOUNTED, MAP_FLAG_2_INSTANCED, etc., depending on the game version
    and implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a map allows mounted combat
    code: "MapEntry* entry = sMapStore.LookupEntry(mapId);\nif (entry && entry->GetFlags2()\
      \ & MAP_FLAG_2_ALLOW_MOUNTED)\n{\n    // Map permits mounted combat\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validate instance type using flags
    code: "MapEntry* entry = sMapStore.LookupEntry(mapId);\nif (entry)\n{\n    int\
      \ flags2 = entry->GetFlags2();\n    if (flags2 & MAP_FLAG_2_INSTANCED)\n   \
      \ {\n        // This is an instanced map\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned flags value should be interpreted using bitwise operations.
    The exact meaning of each bit depends on the specific constants defined in the
    TrinityCore codebase for the current game version. This method is part of the
    core map management system and is frequently accessed during player login, zone
    transitions, and instance creation processes.
  warnings: Be cautious when directly comparing flag values without proper bitwise
    checking. Always use the & operator to test specific flags rather than direct
    equality comparisons. The flags may vary between different World of Warcraft patches
    or TrinityCore builds.
