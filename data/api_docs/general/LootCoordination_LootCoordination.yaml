  method: LootCoordination
  signature: void LootCoordination::LootCoordination()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new loot coordination instance for managing distributed loot
    among group members.
  description: The LootCoordination constructor initializes a new loot coordination
    object used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server to manage how loot is distributed
    among group or raid members. This method sets up internal tracking structures
    for loot items, players involved in the loot process, and handles the coordination
    logic required for proper loot distribution according to group rules such as round-robin,
    free-for-all, or master loot. The initialization ensures that all necessary data
    structures are properly allocated and configured before any loot decisions are
    made.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new LootCoordination instance
    code: 'LootCoordination* coordination = new LootCoordination();

      // This creates a new loot coordination object ready to manage group loot distribution.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the server when a new loot
    event needs to be coordinated. Developers should not directly instantiate this
    class unless implementing custom loot coordination logic. The constructor initializes
    internal state that must remain consistent during the loot process.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of LootCoordination without proper context may lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. This class is designed to work within the TrinityCore
    framework's existing loot system and should not be used outside of appropriate
    game event handlers.
