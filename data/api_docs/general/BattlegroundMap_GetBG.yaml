  class: BattlegroundMap
  method: GetBG
  signature: Battleground * BattlegroundMap::GetBG() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the battleground instance associated with this map.
  description: The GetBG method returns a pointer to the Battleground object that
    is currently active on this battleground map. This method is typically used to
    access the specific battleground instance for managing game state, player assignments,
    scoring, and other battleground-specific functionality. The returned pointer may
    be null if no battleground is currently running on the map. This method provides
    direct access to the battleground's core logic and data structures, enabling developers
    to interact with the active battleground session.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Battleground object if a battleground is currently active
    on this map, or nullptr if no battleground is running.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Active Battleground
    code: "Battleground* bg = map->GetBG();\nif (bg != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process\
      \ battleground logic\n    bg->Update(1000);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Battleground Data for Player Management
    code: "BattlegroundMap* bgMap = reinterpret_cast<BattlegroundMap*>(player->GetMap());\n\
      Battleground* bg = bgMap->GetBG();\nif (bg && bg->IsPlayerInBattleground(player->GetGUID()))\n\
      {\n    // Perform player-specific battleground operations\n    TeamId team =\
      \ bg->GetPlayerTeam(player->GetGUID());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the map instance is a battleground map. Calling
    this on a regular world map may return nullptr or undefined behavior. The returned
    Battleground pointer remains valid only as long as the battleground session is
    active and has not been destroyed.
  warnings: Never assume the returned pointer is non-null without checking first.
    Accessing methods on a null pointer will cause a crash. This method should only
    be called from contexts where it's guaranteed that the map is actually a battleground
    map.
