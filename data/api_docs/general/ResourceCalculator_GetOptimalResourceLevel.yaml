api:
  class: ResourceCalculator
  method: GetOptimalResourceLevel
  signature: uint32 ResourceCalculator::GetOptimalResourceLevel(ResourceType type,
    int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal resource level for a given resource type
    based on player data.
  description: The GetOptimalResourceLevel method determines the most efficient resource
    level for a specified ResourceType by analyzing the provided player data. This
    calculation takes into account various game mechanics such as player skill levels,
    equipment bonuses, and resource quality modifiers. The method is typically used
    in crafting systems to determine the best possible outcome when generating resources
    or items. It requires valid player data to be passed in order to perform accurate
    calculations.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The ResourceType enum value indicating which type of resource level
      should be calculated. Valid values include common resource types like ORE, HERB,
      and SKIN.
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer array containing player-specific data used
      in the calculation. The array should contain at least one element representing
      the player's skill level or relevant attribute for the given resource type.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the calculated optimal resource level.
    This value typically indicates the maximum quality or quantity that can be achieved
    for the specified resource type based on player capabilities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'ResourceCalculator calculator;

      uint32 optimalLevel = calculator.GetOptimalResourceLevel(ResourceType::ORE,
      &playerSkill);

      // Returns the optimal mining level for the player''s current skill'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with multiple player attributes
    code: 'int playerAttributes[3] = {player->GetSkillValue(SKILL_MINING), player->GetLevel(),
      player->GetItemLevel()};

      ResourceCalculator calculator;

      uint32 optimalLevel = calculator.GetOptimalResourceLevel(ResourceType::HERB,
      playerAttributes);

      // Uses multiple player attributes to determine optimal herbalism level'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs calculations based on internal game formulas and may
    vary depending on the specific TrinityCore version. The player data array must
    be properly initialized with valid values; otherwise, results may be unpredictable
    or incorrect.
  warnings: Ensure that the player parameter points to a valid memory location with
    sufficient elements. Passing null or uninitialized pointers will result in undefined
    behavior. The method assumes that the ResourceType enum is correctly defined and
    supported within the current game context.
