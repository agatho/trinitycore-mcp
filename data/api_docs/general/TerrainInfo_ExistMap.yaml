  signature: bool TerrainInfo::ExistMap(uint32 mapid, int32 gx, int32 gy, bool log)
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specific map tile exists for the given map ID and grid coordinates.
  description: The ExistMap method determines if a particular map tile is available
    within the game world for the specified map identifier and grid position. This
    function is essential for validating map data integrity before attempting to access
    or load terrain information. It verifies that the requested map tile has been
    properly initialized and is accessible, which helps prevent errors when navigating
    or interacting with world objects. The method supports both logging of missing
    tiles and silent validation depending on the log parameter value.
  parameters:
  - name: mapid
    description: The unique identifier of the map to check for existence. This corresponds
      to the Map.dbc entry ID used internally by TrinityCore.
  - name: gx
    description: The grid X coordinate (tile column) to validate. Grid coordinates
      are typically in the range of 0-63 for standard world maps.
  - name: gy
    description: The grid Y coordinate (tile row) to validate. Grid coordinates are
      typically in the range of 0-63 for standard world maps.
  - name: log
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to log missing map tiles. When true,
      logs warnings if a tile does not exist; when false, suppresses logging.
  returns: Returns true if the specified map tile exists and is accessible, false
    otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that the requested map
    ID or grid coordinates are invalid or that the tile has not been loaded into memory.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check map tile existence
    code: "if (TerrainInfo::ExistMap(0, 10, 15, true)) {\n    // Map tile exists,\
      \ safe to proceed with operations\n    printf(\"Map tile (10,15) exists for\
      \ map 0\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Map tile does not exist or is inaccessible\n\
      \    printf(\"Map tile (10,15) does not exist for map 0\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using ExistMap to validate world navigation
    code: "uint32 mapId = player->GetMapId();\nint32 gridX = (int32)player->GetPositionX()\
      \ / 533.333f;\nint32 gridY = (int32)player->GetPositionY() / 533.333f;\n\nif\
      \ (!TerrainInfo::ExistMap(mapId, gridX, gridY, false)) {\n    // Prevent navigation\
      \ to invalid locations\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Invalid location\
      \ - terrain not loaded\");\n    return;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used during world loading and navigation validation
    processes. It may involve disk I/O operations or memory lookups depending on how
    the map data is stored and cached. The grid coordinates are typically derived
    from world coordinates using a fixed tile size of approximately 533.3333 units
    per tile. Performance can be impacted when checking large numbers of tiles in
    rapid succession.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid map IDs or out-of-bounds grid coordinates
    may result in undefined behavior or performance degradation. Always validate inputs
    before calling this function, especially in high-frequency contexts such as player
    movement validation.
