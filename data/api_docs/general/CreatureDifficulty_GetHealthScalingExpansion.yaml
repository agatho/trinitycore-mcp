  class: CreatureDifficulty
  method: GetHealthScalingExpansion
  signature: int32 CreatureDifficulty::GetHealthScalingExpansion() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the expansion level used for health scaling calculations in creature
    difficulty settings.
  description: The GetHealthScalingExpansion method returns an integer value representing
    the expansion level that determines how creature health is scaled based on player
    level and difficulty settings. This value is crucial for determining the appropriate
    health modifiers applied to creatures in different expansions, ensuring that creatures
    scale appropriately with player progression. The returned value typically corresponds
    to expansion IDs such as 0 for Vanilla, 1 for Burning Crusade, etc., and affects
    how creature stats are adjusted during dynamic scaling processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int32 value representing the expansion level used for health scaling.
    Typical values include 0 for Classic/Original, 1 for The Burning Crusade, 2 for
    Wrath of the Lich King, and so on. This value defines which set of scaling rules
    should be applied to determine creature health in different game expansions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'CreatureDifficulty* difficulty = creature->GetCreatureDifficulty();

      int32 expansionLevel = difficulty->GetHealthScalingExpansion();

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Health scaling expansion level: %d", expansionLevel);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    calculating creature stats during combat or when loading creature data. The returned
    value directly influences how health scaling modifiers are applied to creatures
    based on player level and difficulty settings.
