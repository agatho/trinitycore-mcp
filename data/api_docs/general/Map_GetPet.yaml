  class: Map
  method: GetPet
  signature: int * Map::GetPet(const int & guid)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the pet associated with a given GUID from the map
  description: The GetPet method retrieves the pet object corresponding to a specific
    GUID within the Map class. This method is used to access pet entities that are
    stored in the map's data structures, allowing for direct interaction with pets
    in the game world. It serves as a lookup mechanism for retrieving pet objects
    based on their unique identifiers, which is essential for managing pet behavior
    and interactions in World of Warcraft. The method operates within the context
    of TrinityCore's object management system where pets are tracked by GUID and stored
    in map containers.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the pet to retrieve. This parameter
      represents the specific pet entity that should be returned from the map.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the pet object associated with the given GUID, or
    nullptr if no pet exists with that GUID in the map.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Pet* pet = map->GetPet(12345);\nif (pet != nullptr)\n{\n    // Pet found,\
      \ perform actions\n    pet->SetOwner(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for retrieving pets from the map's container.
    It may involve a lookup operation that could be performance-sensitive in large
    maps with many objects. The method assumes that the GUID passed corresponds to
    an existing pet in the map.
  warnings: The method may return nullptr if no pet exists with the specified GUID,
    which can lead to null pointer dereferences if not handled properly. Care should
    be taken when using this method to ensure proper validation of returned pointers
    before accessing pet properties.
