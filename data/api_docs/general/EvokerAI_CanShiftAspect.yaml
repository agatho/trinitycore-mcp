  class: EvokerAI
  method: CanShiftAspect
  signature: bool EvokerAI::CanShiftAspect()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the evoker can shift to a different aspect.
  description: The CanShiftAspect method evaluates if the current evoker AI unit is
    eligible to transition between different aspects, such as from Fire to Frost or
    Shadow. This check typically considers factors like the evoker's current mana
    level, cooldowns on aspect abilities, and whether the evoker is in a valid state
    to perform the shift. It ensures that the evoker does not shift aspects under
    conditions that would be invalid or detrimental to gameplay balance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the evoker can shift to another aspect; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision logic
    code: "if (evokerAI->CanShiftAspect()) {\n    evokerAI->ShiftToNextAspect();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI's update cycle to determine
    if a shift action should be considered. It may also be used in conjunction with
    other checks such as target validity or threat level before allowing an aspect
    shift.
