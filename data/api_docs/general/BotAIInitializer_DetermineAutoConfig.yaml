  signature: BotAIConfig BotAIInitializer::DetermineAutoConfig() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the appropriate AI configuration for a bot based on
    current settings and conditions.
  description: The DetermineAutoConfig method evaluates the current state and configuration
    parameters to automatically select an appropriate BotAIConfig. This method is
    typically used during initialization or reconfiguration of bot AI behavior, ensuring
    that bots are assigned suitable AI strategies based on factors such as player
    level, available resources, and game context. The returned configuration can be
    used to set up or modify a bot's AI behavior dynamically without manual intervention.
    This method does not require any input parameters and relies entirely on internal
    state and configuration data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A BotAIConfig object representing the determined AI configuration for the
    bot. This configuration includes settings such as combat behavior, movement patterns,
    and decision-making parameters that define how the bot will act in-game.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotAIConfig config = initializer.DetermineAutoConfig();

      // Use the returned configuration to initialize a bot''s AI

      bot->SetAIConfig(config);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during bot initialization or when significant
    changes in game context occur. It may involve internal logic that evaluates player
    status, environment conditions, and available resources to determine the most
    appropriate AI behavior.
