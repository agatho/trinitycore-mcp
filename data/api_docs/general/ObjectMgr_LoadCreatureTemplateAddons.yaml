documentation:
  brief: Loads creature template addon data from the database into memory for use
    in game.
  description: The LoadCreatureTemplateAddons method initializes and populates internal
    data structures with creature template addon information retrieved from the database.
    This data includes additional properties such as movement patterns, auras, and
    other behavioral configurations that extend the base creature template. The method
    is typically invoked during server startup or database reload operations to ensure
    all creature addons are properly loaded and available for use when spawning creatures
    in the world. It processes entries from the creature_template_addon table and
    associates them with their respective creature templates.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize()\n{\n    // ... other initialization code\
      \ ...\n    sObjectMgr->LoadCreatureTemplateAddons();\n    // ... continue with\
      \ server startup ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the database connection is established
    and the creature_template table has been loaded. It performs a database query
    to fetch all records from the creature_template_addon table and caches them in
    memory for fast lookup during creature spawning.
