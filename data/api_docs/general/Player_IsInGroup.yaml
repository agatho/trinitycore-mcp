documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player is a member of a specific group.
  description: The IsInGroup method determines if the current player is part of a
    particular group identified by the provided groupGuid. This method is commonly
    used in game logic to verify group membership, especially when dealing with group-based
    content such as dungeons, raids, or questing. It returns true if the player belongs
    to the specified group, false otherwise. The method relies on internal group tracking
    mechanisms and can be used to validate group membership before performing actions
    that require group participation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is a member of the specified group, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsInGroup(12345)) {\n    // Player is in group with guid 12345\n\
      }\nelse {\n    // Player is not in group with guid 12345\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and does not require any special considerations
    for usage. It performs a quick lookup of the player's group membership using internal
    data structures.
