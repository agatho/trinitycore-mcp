documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the team affiliation (Alliance or Horde) of a character by their
    GUID.
  description: The GetCharacterTeamByGuid method retrieves the team ID (either 0 for
    Alliance or 1 for Horde) associated with a specific character identified by their
    globally unique identifier (GUID). This method is typically used in World of Warcraft
    server logic to determine faction alignment for gameplay mechanics such as PvP
    interactions, quest gating, or team-based events. The method performs a lookup
    in the character cache, which should already contain the necessary data for the
    specified GUID. It's important to note that this method assumes the character
    exists and has a valid team assignment; otherwise, it may return an unexpected
    value or cause undefined behavior if not properly validated.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'Returns an integer representing the team ID of the character: 0 for Alliance,
    1 for Horde. If the character GUID is not found in the cache or is invalid, the
    method may return an incorrect value or trigger undefined behavior.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Determine Character Team
    code: "int guid = 12345;\nint teamId = CharacterCache::GetCharacterTeamByGuid(guid);\n\
      if (teamId == 0)\n{\n    // Character is on Alliance\n    printf(\"Character\
      \ is on the Alliance team.\\n\");\n}\nelse if (teamId == 1)\n{\n    // Character\
      \ is on Horde\n    printf(\"Character is on the Horde team.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on cached character data, so it should only be called
    after ensuring that the character's information has been loaded into the cache.
    The implementation likely uses an internal map or lookup table for O(1) access
    time. Be cautious when using this method with GUIDs that have not been validated
    against existing characters to avoid accessing invalid memory.
  warnings: This method does not validate whether the provided GUID corresponds to
    an actual character in the database. Using it with invalid or non-existent GUIDs
    may result in undefined behavior or incorrect return values. Always ensure proper
    validation before calling this method in production code.
