documentation:
  brief: Builds an out-of-range update block for the object to be sent to clients.
  description: The BuildOutOfRangeUpdateBlock method constructs an update block containing
    information about the object that is no longer within the client's view range.
    This method is typically invoked when an object moves outside of a player's visibility
    range, ensuring that the client properly removes or updates the object's state.
    It integrates with TrinityCore's update system to manage network traffic efficiently
    by only sending relevant data to players who can see objects. The method operates
    on the object's current state and prepares the appropriate update data structure
    for transmission.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Update System
    code: 'UpdateData data;

      player->BuildOutOfRangeUpdateBlock(&data);

      // Sends out-of-range updates to player''s client

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal update mechanism and should not be called
    directly by most game logic. It relies on the object's current visibility state
    and may interact with spatial partitioning systems. The UpdateData parameter is
    modified in-place to accumulate the out-of-range updates.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context or before the object has been
    properly initialized may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the UpdateData
    object is valid and cleared before calling this method.
