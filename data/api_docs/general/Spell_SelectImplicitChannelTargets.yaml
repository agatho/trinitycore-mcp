documentation:
  brief: Selects implicit channel targets for spell effects based on target type and
    spell effect information
  description: This method processes and selects appropriate target entities for spell
    channeling effects, determining which targets are valid based on the provided
    spell effect information and target type. It handles the selection of targets
    for spells that involve channeling mechanics, such as those requiring a specific
    target or range to be selected for execution. The method ensures proper targeting
    logic is applied during spell casting and channeling operations within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters:
  - name: spellEffectInfo
    description: Contains information about the spell effect being processed, including
      effect type, value, and other relevant parameters that determine how targets
      should be selected for channeling.
  - name: targetType
    description: Defines the implicit target type for the spell effect, specifying
      what kind of targets are allowed or required for channeling operations, such
      as enemies, allies, or specific positional requirements.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Spell::SelectImplicitChannelTargets(spellEffectInfo, targetType);

      // This call selects targets for a channeling spell based on the effect and
      target type'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core spell handling logic in TrinityCore and is
    typically invoked during spell execution or channeling phases. It requires proper
    initialization of spell effect and target type data before being called.
  warnings: Improper handling of spell effect information or target type can lead
    to incorrect targeting, potentially causing spells to fail or select invalid targets
    for channeling operations.
