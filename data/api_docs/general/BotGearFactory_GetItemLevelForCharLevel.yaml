  class: BotGearFactory
  method: GetItemLevelForCharLevel
  signature: uint32 BotGearFactory::GetItemLevelForCharLevel(uint32 charLevel)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the appropriate item level for a bot character based on its level.
  description: The GetItemLevelForCharLevel method determines the suitable item level
    that a bot character should use when equipping gear, based on the character's
    current level. This method is essential for ensuring that bots receive gear that
    matches their progression and remains balanced within the game mechanics. The
    calculation typically scales with character level to provide appropriate gear
    difficulty without overwhelming or underwhelming the bot. This function is commonly
    used in bot AI systems to dynamically adjust gear selection during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the calculated item level that corresponds
    to the provided character level. The value typically increases as the character
    level increases, following a predefined scaling formula or lookup table within
    the BotGearFactory implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 itemLevel = botGearFactory->GetItemLevelForCharLevel(60);

      // Returns the appropriate item level for a level 60 bot character'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal scaling tables or mathematical formulas
    to map character levels to item levels. It's important to note that the exact
    mapping may vary depending on the game version and expansion content, as item
    level progression can differ between different World of Warcraft expansions.
  warnings: Ensure that the input character level is valid (typically within the supported
    range for the current expansion) to avoid unexpected results or potential errors
    in gear assignment. Invalid levels might cause undefined behavior or incorrect
    gear selection.
