documentation:
  brief: Updates the AFK (Away From Keyboard) report status for the player based on
    the current time.
  description: The UpdateAfkReport method is responsible for managing and updating
    a player's AFK status in the World of Warcraft client. It checks whether the player
    has been inactive for a specified period and updates their AFK state accordingly.
    This method is typically called periodically by the game loop to maintain accurate
    AFK reporting, which can affect various gameplay mechanics such as loot distribution,
    quest progression, and player interactions. The method uses the provided current
    time to determine if the player's inactivity threshold has been exceeded.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    time_t currentTime = time(nullptr);\n    for (Player*\
      \ player : sObjectAccessor->GetPlayers())\n    {\n        if (player)\n    \
      \        player->UpdateAfkReport(currentTime);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the server's main game loop
    at regular intervals. It does not directly send packets to clients but modifies
    internal player state that may be synchronized later. The AFK reporting logic
    typically involves checking against a configurable inactivity timeout value defined
    in the server configuration.
  warnings: Do not call this method manually unless you understand its internal behavior
    and dependencies. Improper usage can lead to incorrect AFK status reporting, which
    might affect gameplay mechanics or player experience.
