documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AuctionBotConfig instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the AuctionBotConfig class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the object's
    lifetime. This method ensures proper resource deallocation when an AuctionBotConfig
    instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's
    auction house system, this destructor likely handles cleanup of configuration
    data structures or cached values related to auction bot behavior. The method does
    not take any parameters and performs no return operations as it is a destructor.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Automatic destruction of AuctionBotConfig instance
    code: "void exampleFunction() {\n    AuctionBotConfig config;\n    // ... use\
      \ config ...\n    // config is automatically destroyed here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: As a destructor, this method is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime
    when an object goes out of scope or is deleted. Developers should not manually
    call destructors in normal code flow. The destruction process typically involves
    calling base class destructors first, followed by member object destructors, and
    finally cleaning up any allocated memory.
