    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves an array of skill line IDs associated with a given parent skill
    ID.
  description: The GetSkillLinesForParentSkill method retrieves a const pointer to
    an array of integers representing skill line IDs that are linked to a specified
    parent skill ID. This is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to map
    hierarchical skill relationships, where parent skills may have multiple child
    skill lines. The returned array is managed internally by the DB2Manager and should
    not be modified or freed by the caller. The method does not perform any validation
    on the input parameter, so calling with an invalid parentSkillId may return a
    null pointer or an empty array depending on internal data structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an array of integers (int*) representing skill line
    IDs associated with the specified parent skill. Returns nullptr if no skill lines
    are found for the given parent skill ID, or if the parent skill ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve skill lines for a parent skill
    code: "const int* skillLines = sDB2Manager->GetSkillLinesForParentSkill(129);\
      \ // 129 is the parent skill ID for First Aid\nif (skillLines != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    for (int i = 0; skillLines[i] != 0; ++i)\n    {\n        printf(\"Skill\
      \ Line ID: %d\\n\", skillLines[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned array is internally managed and should not be freed or modified.
    The method assumes that the DB2 files have been loaded and parsed correctly. Performance
    is optimized through internal caching mechanisms, but repeated calls with the
    same parentSkillId will still require lookup operations.
  warnings: Do not attempt to free or modify the returned pointer. Ensure that the
    DB2Manager has been initialized before calling this method. Be cautious when using
    the returned array as it may contain trailing zeros indicating end of list, and
    always check for null return values.
