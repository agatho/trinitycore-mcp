documentation:
  brief: Updates threat distances for all bots in the threat manager.
  description: The UpdateDistances method recalculates and refreshes the distance-based
    threat values for all bot units managed by this BotThreatManager instance. This
    method is typically invoked during AI update cycles to ensure that threat calculations
    reflect current positions and combat states of bots and their targets. It plays
    a crucial role in maintaining accurate threat distribution within bot combat scenarios,
    particularly when dealing with multiple bots targeting the same enemy or when
    bot positioning changes significantly. The method does not require any explicit
    parameters as it operates on the internal state of the threat manager.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    threatManager->UpdateDistances();\n\
      \    // ... continue with threat-based decisions ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is performance-sensitive and should be called judiciously during
    AI update cycles. It internally iterates through all managed bots and recalculates
    their distances to targets, which may involve expensive distance computations
    depending on the number of bots and target entities involved.
