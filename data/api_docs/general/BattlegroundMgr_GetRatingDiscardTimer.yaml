documentation:
  brief: Returns the rating discard timer value used in battlegrounds for managing
    player ratings.
  description: The GetRatingDiscardTimer method retrieves the current rating discard
    timer value from the BattlegroundMgr instance. This timer is used in World of
    Warcraft's battleground system to determine how long a player's rating contribution
    remains active before being discarded or reset. The value represents a time interval
    in milliseconds and is typically used during battleground matchmaking and rating
    calculations. This method provides access to internal battleground management
    timing logic that affects player progression and ranking within competitive game
    modes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the rating discard timer in milliseconds. This
    value indicates how long rating contributions are retained before being discarded
    in battleground scenarios.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Log Rating Discard Timer
    code: 'uint32 timer = sBattlegroundMgr->GetRatingDiscardTimer();

      TC_LOG_INFO("bg", "Current rating discard timer: %u ms", timer);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal battleground management system and should
    only be called when necessary for game logic operations. The returned value may
    vary depending on server configuration or battleground type.
