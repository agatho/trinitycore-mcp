documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has a specific item appearance in their collection.
  description: The HasItemAppearance method determines whether a player has acquired
    a particular item appearance within their character's collection. This method
    is typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's collection systems, such
    as cosmetic appearances for items. It returns a pair of booleans indicating both
    the existence and acquisition status of the specified appearance. The first boolean
    indicates if the appearance ID exists in the player's collection, while the second
    boolean may indicate whether the appearance has been unlocked or obtained in a
    specific context (e.g., via a quest, achievement, or purchase). This method does
    not modify any state but provides read-only access to the player's appearance
    collection data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::pair<bool, bool> where the first boolean indicates whether the item
    appearance ID is present in the player's collection and the second boolean indicates
    whether the appearance has been fully acquired or unlocked in the current context.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a player has an appearance
    code: "if (auto result = sCollectionMgr->HasItemAppearance(12345); result.first)\
      \ {\n    // Player has the appearance\n    if (result.second) {\n        //\
      \ Appearance is unlocked\n    } else {\n        // Appearance exists but not\
      \ yet acquired\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal collection tracking systems and may involve
    database lookups or cached data. It is generally safe to call from game logic
    threads, but performance should be considered in high-frequency scenarios.
