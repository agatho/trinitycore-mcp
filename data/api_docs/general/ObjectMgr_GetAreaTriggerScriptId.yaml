documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the script identifier associated with a specified area trigger
    ID.
  description: The GetAreaTriggerScriptId method is used to lookup and return the
    script identifier (ID) that is assigned to a specific area trigger within the
    TrinityCore database. This function is typically invoked during runtime when an
    area trigger is activated or processed, allowing the core to determine which custom
    script should be executed for that particular trigger. The method performs a lookup
    in the internal data structures maintained by ObjectMgr, which maps area trigger
    IDs to their corresponding script identifiers. It is essential for implementing
    dynamic gameplay mechanics such as quest triggers, teleportation effects, or event
    activations that are defined in the game's scripting system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the script identifier associated with
    the given area trigger ID. If no script is assigned to the specified trigger,
    it returns 0, indicating that no custom script should be executed for this trigger.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 scriptId = sObjectMgr->GetAreaTriggerScriptId(1234);\nif (scriptId\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Execute the script with ID 'scriptId'\n    sScriptMgr->OnAreaTrigger(player,\
      \ scriptId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectMgr class and relies on internal data structures
    that are populated during server startup from database entries. The returned script
    ID corresponds to a registered script in the ScriptMgr system. Ensure that area
    triggers and their associated scripts are properly defined in the database for
    correct behavior.
