  brief: Moves the contents of another RBACPermission object to this object
  description: The move assignment operator transfers ownership of resources from
    the right-hand side RBACPermission object to the left-hand side object. This operation
    is typically used in scenarios where temporary or intermediate RBACPermission
    objects need to be efficiently transferred without unnecessary copying. The method
    performs an efficient move operation that leaves the source object in a valid
    but unspecified state. In the context of TrinityCore's permission system, this
    allows for optimized handling of role-based access control permissions during
    runtime operations such as permission assignment, validation, or management within
    the game's security framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current RBACPermission object after the move operation
    has completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'RBACPermission perm1;

      RBACPermission perm2 = std::move(perm1); // Move perm1''s contents to perm2

      // perm1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Container Operations
    code: 'std::vector<RBACPermission> permissions;

      permissions.emplace_back(); // Construct new permission

      permissions.back() = std::move(someOtherPermission); // Move assignment to vector
      element'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is part of the C++ move semantics implementation and should
    be used when transferring ownership of resources. The source object after a move
    operation remains valid but its contents are unspecified, so it should not be
    used for further operations unless reinitialized.
  warnings: Using this operator on an already moved-from object can lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the source object is not accessed after being moved from,
    and avoid double-move scenarios.
