  class: HunterAI
  method: GetNearbyEnemyCount
  signature: int HunterAI::GetNearbyEnemyCount(float range) const
documentation:
  brief: Counts the number of nearby enemy units within a specified range for the
    hunter AI.
  description: The GetNearbyEnemyCount method calculates and returns the total number
    of hostile units (enemies) that are currently within the defined range around
    the hunter's position. This method is typically used by the HunterAI class to
    make tactical decisions, such as determining when to use certain abilities or
    whether to engage in combat. The range parameter defines the maximum distance
    from the hunter's current location at which enemies are considered 'nearby'. This
    functionality is integral to the AI's decision-making process and helps simulate
    realistic hunting behavior in the game environment.
  parameters:
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance (in yards) from the hunter's position to consider
      enemies as nearby. Must be a positive floating-point value.
  returns: An integer representing the count of enemy units located within the specified
    range. Returns 0 if no enemies are found within the given range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: int nearbyEnemies = hunterAI->GetNearbyEnemyCount(10.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Decision Making Based on Enemy Count
    code: "if (hunterAI->GetNearbyEnemyCount(25.0f) > 3)\n{\n    // Use area-of-effect\
      \ ability\n    hunter->CastSpell(target, SPELL_AOE_SHOT);\n}\nelse\n{\n    //\
      \ Use single-target ability\n    hunter->CastSpell(target, SPELL_SERPENT_STING);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a spatial query using the game's internal collision
    detection or unit positioning system. It may be optimized for performance by caching
    nearby units or using spatial partitioning techniques. The implementation might
    exclude certain types of enemies (e.g., invisible or dead units) depending on
    the AI logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the range value passed is positive and reasonable to avoid
    unexpected behavior or performance issues. This method should not be called during
    critical sections of AI processing where high-frequency updates could cause performance
    degradation.
