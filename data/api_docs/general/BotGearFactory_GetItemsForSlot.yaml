  method: GetItemsForSlot
  signature: const int * BotGearFactory::GetItemsForSlot(uint8 cls, uint32 specId,
    uint32 level, uint8 slot) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves an array of item IDs suitable for a specified player class, specialization,
    level, and inventory slot.
  description: The GetItemsForSlot method returns a constant pointer to an array of
    integers representing item IDs that are appropriate for the given class, specialization,
    level, and inventory slot. This function is typically used by bot systems or gear
    recommendation engines within TrinityCore to determine which items should be equipped
    in specific slots based on character build parameters. The returned array is managed
    internally and should not be modified by the caller. The method does not perform
    any validation of input parameters beyond what is necessary for internal lookup
    operations.
  parameters:
  - name: cls
    description: The player class identifier (e.g., CLASS_WARRIOR = 1, CLASS_MAGE
      = 8). Must be a valid class enum value.
  - name: specId
    description: The specialization ID for the character. Zero indicates default or
      no specialization.
  - name: level
    description: The character's level, used to determine item availability and quality.
      Must be a positive integer within valid range.
  - name: slot
    description: The inventory slot index (e.g., EQUIPMENT_SLOT_HEAD = 0, EQUIPMENT_SLOT_MAINHAND
      = 16). Must correspond to a valid equipment slot.
  returns: A constant pointer to an array of integers representing item IDs. The array
    is null-terminated and should not be freed by the caller. Returns nullptr if no
    items are found for the specified criteria.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve head gear for a level 60 warrior
    code: "const int* headItems = factory->GetItemsForSlot(CLASS_WARRIOR, 0, 60, EQUIPMENT_SLOT_HEAD);\n\
      if (headItems != nullptr) {\n    for (int i = 0; headItems[i] != 0; ++i) {\n\
      \        std::cout << \"Item ID: \" << headItems[i] << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Get main hand weapons for a frost mage at level 70
    code: "const int* weaponItems = factory->GetItemsForSlot(CLASS_MAGE, SPEC_MAGE_FROST,\
      \ 70, EQUIPMENT_SLOT_MAINHAND);\nif (weaponItems != nullptr) {\n    // Process\
      \ the list of valid frost mage weapons\n    for (int i = 0; weaponItems[i] !=\
      \ 0; ++i) {\n        ItemTemplate const* proto = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(weaponItems[i]);\n\
      \        if (proto)\n            std::cout << \"Weapon: \" << proto->Name1 <<\
      \ std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The internal array returned by this method is static and reused across calls,
    so it should not be stored or modified. The implementation relies on precomputed
    data tables that map class/spec/level/slot combinations to valid item IDs.
  warnings: Do not attempt to free or modify the returned pointer. The array is null-terminated
    but may contain zero values indicating end of list. Ensure all parameters are
    within expected ranges to avoid undefined behavior.
