documentation:
  brief: Sends a loot coordination message to all members of a group
  description: The BroadcastCoordinationMessage method is responsible for distributing
    loot coordination messages to all players within a specified group. This functionality
    is typically used during loot distribution events, such as when a quest item or
    rare drop needs to be shared among group members. The method ensures that all
    group members receive the same message, maintaining synchronization of loot decisions
    across the group. It handles the communication aspect of the loot coordination
    system in TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the members who will receive
      the message. Must be a valid group instance, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  - name: message
    description: String containing the coordination message to broadcast. Should be
      properly formatted and localized for display to players.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Broadcast loot coordination message to group
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    LootCoordination::BroadcastCoordinationMessage(group,\
      \ \"Rolling for epic item!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal messaging systems to ensure all group members
    receive the message in a timely manner. The implementation may involve checking
    group member states and ensuring players are online before sending messages.
