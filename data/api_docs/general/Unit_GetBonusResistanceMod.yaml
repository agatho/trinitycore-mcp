documentation:
  brief: Returns the bonus resistance modifier for a specific school of magic.
  description: This method retrieves the total bonus resistance value applied to a
    given magical school, which can be used to calculate the effective resistance
    against spells or abilities of that school. The returned value represents the
    sum of all bonus resistances from various sources including buffs, talents, and
    other game effects. This method is commonly used in spell calculations and damage
    reduction mechanics within TrinityCore's core functionality.
  parameters:
  - name: school
    description: The magical school for which to retrieve the bonus resistance modifier.
      Valid values are 0-6 representing different schools of magic (Physical, Holy,
      Fire, Nature, Frost, Shadow, Arcane).
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the total bonus resistance modifier
    for the specified school. A value of 0 indicates no bonus resistance, while negative
    values indicate resistance reduction or penalties. The return value can be positive,
    negative, or zero depending on the current game state and applied effects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int32 bonusResist = unit->GetBonusResistanceMod(SPELL_SCHOOL_FIRE);

      // This retrieves the bonus resistance modifier for Fire school

      '

  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other resistance-related
    functions to calculate final resistance values. It should be noted that this value
    may change during combat or when applying buffs, and it's important to understand
    that the bonus resistance modifier is separate from base resistance values.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it may return negative
    values in certain situations, which could affect spell calculations. Also, this
    method does not account for resistance penalties from debuffs or other negative
    effects that might be applied during combat.
