  brief: Exits the voidform state for the insanity resource.
  description: The ExitVoidform method transitions the insanity resource from its
    voidform state back to normal operation. This method is typically invoked when
    a player's voidform ability expires or is manually canceled. The method handles
    the necessary cleanup and state changes required to return the resource to its
    default configuration. It may also trigger visual effects or updates to the player's
    UI to reflect the change in state.

  returns: null

  notes: This method should only be called when the resource is currently in voidform
    state. Calling it outside of this context may result in undefined behavior or
    inconsistent state.
