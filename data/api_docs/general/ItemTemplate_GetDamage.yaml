  signature: void ItemTemplate::GetDamage(uint32 itemLevel, float & minDamage, float
    & maxDamage) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and retrieves the minimum and maximum damage values for an item
    based on its level.
  description: The GetDamage method computes the damage range for a given item at
    a specified item level. It populates two float references with the calculated
    minimum and maximum damage values. This method is typically used during item creation,
    leveling, or stat calculation processes within the TrinityCore framework. The
    implementation likely considers item type, quality, enchantments, and other factors
    that influence damage output in World of Warcraft mechanics. The method does not
    return any value but modifies the provided references directly.
  parameters:
  - name: itemLevel
    description: The level of the item for which to calculate damage values. This
      determines how the base damage scales according to item progression and game
      balance.
  - name: minDamage
    description: Reference to a float that will be set to the calculated minimum damage
      value for the item at the given level.
  - name: maxDamage
    description: Reference to a float that will be set to the calculated maximum damage
      value for the item at the given level.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Damage Calculation Example
    code: 'ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);

      float minDmg, maxDmg;

      itemTemplate->GetDamage(80, minDmg, maxDmg);

      // minDmg and maxDmg now contain calculated damage values for item level 80'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Damage in Weapon Stats Calculation
    code: 'ItemTemplate* weapon = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(54321);

      float minDamage, maxDamage;

      weapon->GetDamage(90, minDamage, maxDamage);

      float averageDamage = (minDamage + maxDamage) / 2.0f;

      // Use averageDamage for weapon stat display or combat calculations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core item template system and assumes that the
    ItemTemplate instance has been properly initialized with all necessary data. The
    actual damage calculation logic may vary based on item type (weapon, armor, etc.)
    and internal item properties. Performance-wise, this method should be lightweight
    as it's designed for frequent use during item instantiation and stat recomputation.
  warnings: Ensure that the ItemTemplate instance is valid before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. The minDamage and maxDamage references must be properly
    initialized or the results may be unpredictable. Be cautious when using high item
    levels that might exceed expected bounds in certain game contexts.
