  method: HandleAuraModIncreaseSwimSpeed
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleAuraModIncreaseSwimSpeed(const AuraApplication
    * aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the target's swimming speed when an aura is applied or removed.
  description: The HandleAuraModIncreaseSwimSpeed method adjusts the swimming speed
    of a unit affected by an aura. It is called during aura application or removal
    to update the unit's movement speed properties. This method specifically handles
    the modification of swim speed, which affects how fast a player or creature can
    move through water. The effect is applied or removed based on the 'apply' parameter
    and the mode of operation specified by the aura application.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object that contains information about
      the aura being applied or removed. This includes details about which unit is
      affected and the aura's properties.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation for the aura effect, typically indicating whether
      it's being applied (1) or removed (0). This parameter controls how the speed
      modification is processed.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag that determines if the speed modification should be
      applied (true) or removed (false). When true, the swim speed is increased; when
      false, it's reverted to normal.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying Swim Speed Aura
    code: "void ApplySwimSpeedAura(Unit* target)\n{\n    AuraApplication* auraApp\
      \ = new AuraApplication(target, target, SpellInfo);\n    auraApp->SetMode(1);\
      \ // Apply mode\n    HandleAuraModIncreaseSwimSpeed(auraApp, 1, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Swim Speed Aura
    code: "void RemoveSwimSpeedAura(Unit* target)\n{\n    AuraApplication* auraApp\
      \ = new AuraApplication(target, target, SpellInfo);\n    auraApp->SetMode(0);\
      \ // Remove mode\n    HandleAuraModIncreaseSwimSpeed(auraApp, 0, false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the aura effect handling system in TrinityCore. It
    directly modifies the unit's movement speed properties and should be called only
    when appropriate aura application events occur. The implementation assumes that
    the target unit has a valid swim speed property that can be modified.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may result in incorrect swimming behavior
    or performance issues. Ensure that the aura application object is properly initialized
    before calling this method. Avoid calling it outside of the proper aura application
    lifecycle to prevent undefined behavior.
