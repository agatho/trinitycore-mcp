  class: TargetSelector
  method: DetermineTargetPriority
  signature: TargetPriority TargetSelector::DetermineTargetPriority(Unit * target,
    const SelectionContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the priority level of a target unit based on selection
    context.
  description: The DetermineTargetPriority method assesses a given target unit's suitability
    for selection within an AI decision-making process. It takes into account various
    factors such as threat level, distance, health status, and other contextual variables
    defined in the SelectionContext. This method is typically used by AI systems to
    determine which enemy or ally should be targeted next during combat or non-combat
    scenarios. The returned TargetPriority value indicates how favorable the target
    is for selection, with higher values representing more preferred targets. The
    method does not modify the state of either the target or context objects.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that will be evaluated for target priority.
      Must not be null.
  - name: context
    description: Reference to a SelectionContext object containing environmental and
      situational data used in priority calculation. Includes information such as
      threat levels, available targets, and AI behavior settings.
  returns: A TargetPriority enum value indicating the calculated priority of the target.
    Higher values indicate more desirable targets. Possible values may include HIGH_PRIORITY,
    MEDIUM_PRIORITY, LOW_PRIORITY, or NO_PRIORITY depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "TargetPriority priority = selector.DetermineTargetPriority(enemyUnit, context);\n\
      if (priority >= TargetPriority::HIGH_PRIORITY) {\n    // Select this target\
      \ for attack\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with multiple targets to find best
    code: "Unit* bestTarget = nullptr;\nTargetPriority bestPriority = TargetPriority::NO_PRIORITY;\n\
      \nfor (auto& target : context.GetAvailableTargets()) {\n    TargetPriority currentPriority\
      \ = selector.DetermineTargetPriority(target, context);\n    if (currentPriority\
      \ > bestPriority) {\n        bestPriority = currentPriority;\n        bestTarget\
      \ = target;\n    }\n}\n\nif (bestTarget && bestPriority >= TargetPriority::MEDIUM_PRIORITY)\
      \ {\n    // Execute targeting logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI target selection system and is called frequently
    during combat decision cycles. It's designed to be fast and efficient, avoiding
    heavy computations that could impact performance. The implementation may vary
    based on specific AI behavior configurations.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method; passing
    a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. Be aware that
    the context object must contain valid data for accurate priority calculations.
