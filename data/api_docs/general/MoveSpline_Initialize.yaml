  class: MoveSpline
  method: Initialize
  signature: void MoveSpline::Initialize(const MoveSplineInitArgs & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a movement spline with the provided parameters for pathfinding
    and animation.
  description: The MoveSpline::Initialize method sets up the internal state of a movement
    spline object using the specified initialization arguments. This method prepares
    the spline for calculating and executing smooth character movement paths, typically
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server to handle NPC and player locomotion.
    It configures key properties such as start and end positions, movement speed,
    orientation, and spline flags that determine how the character will move through
    the world. The initialization process is critical for ensuring accurate pathfinding
    and animation synchronization during movement operations.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A constant reference to MoveSplineInitArgs structure containing all
      necessary parameters for initializing the movement spline, including start position,
      end position, speed values, orientation, and movement flags.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement Spline Initialization
    code: 'MoveSplineInitArgs args;

      args.start = Position(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f);

      args.end = Position(150.0f, 250.0f, 300.0f);

      args.speed = 4.0f;

      args.orientation = 0.0f;

      MoveSpline spline;

      spline.Initialize(args);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per MoveSpline instance to avoid undefined
    behavior. The initialization arguments must contain valid position data and appropriate
    speed values for proper movement calculation. The method internally performs validation
    on input parameters to ensure movement integrity.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times on the same MoveSpline object may lead
    to memory leaks or inconsistent state. Ensure that all positions passed in the
    MoveSplineInitArgs are within valid world boundaries to prevent unexpected movement
    artifacts.
