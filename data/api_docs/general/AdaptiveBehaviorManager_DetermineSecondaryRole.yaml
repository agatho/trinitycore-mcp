  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: DetermineSecondaryRole
  signature: BotRole AdaptiveBehaviorManager::DetermineSecondaryRole() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the secondary role assigned to a bot within the adaptive
    behavior system.
  description: The DetermineSecondaryRole method evaluates the current state and context
    of a bot to assign an appropriate secondary role. This role complements the primary
    role and helps define the bot's specific behavioral patterns during gameplay.
    The method considers various factors such as player class, available resources,
    group composition, and mission objectives to make this determination. It is typically
    invoked during bot initialization or when role adjustments are needed based on
    dynamic game conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a BotRole enum value representing the determined secondary role
    for the bot. Possible values may include roles like 'Tank', 'Healer', 'DamageDealer',
    or other specialized roles depending on the implementation and current context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "BotRole secondaryRole = behaviorManager.DetermineSecondaryRole();\nif (secondaryRole\
      \ == BotRole::Healer)\n{\n    // Configure bot for healing duties\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the adaptive behavior system and may be called frequently
    during gameplay. It should ideally be optimized for performance to avoid impacting
    game frame rate. The result of this method can influence other behaviors in the
    bot's decision-making process.
