documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes LFG rewards from the database into memory
  description: The LoadRewards method is responsible for loading all LFG (Looking
    For Group) rewards from the database into the in-memory reward structures. This
    method is typically called during server startup or when the LFG system needs
    to refresh its reward data. It processes reward entries for various dungeon types,
    difficulty levels, and requirements, ensuring that players can receive appropriate
    rewards when completing LFG instances. The method handles parsing of reward data
    including item IDs, currency rewards, experience bonuses, and other in-game benefits.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeLFGSystem()\n{\n    sLFGMgr->LoadRewards();\n    // Reward\
      \ data is now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    reward data needs to be refreshed. The method performs database queries and may
    cause temporary performance impact during execution. It's designed to be thread-safe
    as it's typically called during single-threaded startup phases.
  warnings: Do not call this method repeatedly in high-frequency scenarios as it may
    cause unnecessary database load. Ensure that the database tables containing LFG
    reward data are properly populated before calling this method, otherwise rewards
    may be missing or incorrect.
