documentation:
  brief: Invites all eligible players within the battlefield zone to join the ongoing
    war.
  description: The InvitePlayersInZoneToWar method is responsible for identifying
    and inviting all qualifying players who are currently located within the battlefield's
    designated zone to participate in the active war. This method typically gets invoked
    during the initialization or activation phase of a battlefield instance, ensuring
    that eligible players are automatically enrolled in the conflict. The invitation
    process usually considers factors such as player level ranges, faction alignment,
    and proximity to the battlefield area. It is commonly used in conjunction with
    other battlefield management functions to maintain dynamic player engagement and
    ensure balanced combat participation.

  - title: Basic Usage in Battlefield Initialization
    code: "void Battlefield::OnBattlefieldCreate()\n{\n    // Initialize battlefield\
      \ properties\n    InvitePlayersInZoneToWar();\n    // Continue with other initialization\
      \ steps\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the battlefield is in an active state
    and ready to accept players. It may internally perform checks for player eligibility,
    including level requirements and faction restrictions. The method does not guarantee
    that all players will be invited; it depends on the specific rules of the battlefield
    instance.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of appropriate battlefield states might result
    in unexpected behavior or errors. Ensure that the battlefield zone is properly
    initialized before invoking this function to avoid potential issues with player
    invitations.
