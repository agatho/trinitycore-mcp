  brief: Retrieves the current cooldown status of warrior offensive abilities for
    a player
  description: The GetWarriorOffensiveCooldowns method returns an integer value representing
    the cooldown state of a warrior's offensive abilities within PvP combat. This
    method is typically used by the PvPCombatAI system to determine when a warrior
    can next use offensive spells or abilities. The returned value likely encodes
    information about which abilities are on cooldown and their remaining duration,
    allowing the AI to make strategic decisions about when to engage or disengage
    from combat. This functionality is crucial for simulating realistic warrior behavior
    in PvP scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the cooldown status of warrior offensive
    abilities. The specific bitfield or value format depends on internal implementation,
    but typically indicates which abilities are currently on cooldown and their remaining
    time. A return value of 0 may indicate all abilities are available, while non-zero
    values represent various cooldown states.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in PvP AI
    code: "PvPCombatAI* ai = player->GetPvPCombatAI();\nint cooldownStatus = ai->GetWarriorOffensiveCooldowns(nullptr);\n\
      if (cooldownStatus == 0) {\n    // All offensive abilities available\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_BLADESTORM, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal PvP AI system and may not be directly
    accessible from external scripts or addons. The return value format is likely
    a bitfield encoding multiple cooldown states for different warrior abilities.
    Implementation details may vary based on TrinityCore version and patch level.
  warnings: The method signature shows a parameter 'int * player' but the description
    indicates it takes no parameters, which may be an inconsistency in documentation
    or implementation. The return value interpretation should be verified against
    current TrinityCore source code for accurate bitfield decoding.
