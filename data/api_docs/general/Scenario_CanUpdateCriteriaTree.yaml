  class: Scenario
  method: CanUpdateCriteriaTree
  signature: bool Scenario::CanUpdateCriteriaTree(const int * criteria, const int
    * tree, int * referencePlayer) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a scenario can update its criteria tree based on provided
    criteria and tree data.
  description: 'The CanUpdateCriteriaTree method evaluates if a scenario instance
    is eligible to update its internal criteria tree structure. This typically occurs
    during scenario progression or reward evaluation when the system needs to verify
    that the current state allows for updating the criteria associated with the scenario.
    The method takes three parameters: a pointer to an array of criteria IDs, a pointer
    to a tree structure identifier, and a reference player ID. It returns true if
    the update is allowed; otherwise, it returns false. This check is crucial in maintaining
    consistency between player progress and scenario objectives within the World of
    Warcraft framework.'
  parameters:
  - name: criteria
    description: Pointer to an array of integers representing criteria IDs that define
      the conditions or achievements to be evaluated.
  - name: tree
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the identifier of the criteria
      tree structure being updated.
  - name: referencePlayer
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the ID of the player whose progress
      or state is used as a reference for the update check.
  returns: Returns true if the scenario can safely update its criteria tree with the
    provided data; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Scenario Logic
    code: "if (scenario->CanUpdateCriteriaTree(criteriaArray, &treeId, &playerId))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with updating scenario criteria\n    scenario->UpdateCriteriaTree(criteriaArray,\
      \ treeId, playerId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during scenario progression events or when
    evaluating rewards. It's important to ensure that the criteria and tree data passed
    are valid and consistent with the current scenario state to avoid unexpected behavior.
