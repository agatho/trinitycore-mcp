  signature: void BotThreatManager::SetThreatRadius(float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the threat radius for the bot's threat management system.
  description: The SetThreatRadius method configures the maximum distance within which
    the bot will consider targets for threat generation and management. This parameter
    defines how far the bot will actively monitor and respond to nearby enemies in
    terms of threat calculation. The value is typically used in conjunction with other
    threat-related settings to control the bot's combat behavior and targeting logic.
    This method does not validate the input radius, so it should be set to a reasonable
    positive float value based on game mechanics and desired bot behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Threat Radius for a Bot
    code: 'BotThreatManager* threatManager = bot->GetThreatManager();

      threatManager->SetThreatRadius(25.0f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal threat radius value used by the
    bot's AI system. Changes to this value may affect how quickly the bot identifies
    and engages targets, as well as how it prioritizes different enemies within its
    detection range.
