  class: AIDecisionProfiler
  method: GeneratePerformanceInsights
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::GeneratePerformanceInsights(uint32_t botGuid,
    std::string & insights) const
documentation:
  brief: Generates performance insights for a specified AI bot based on decision profiling
    data.
  description: The GeneratePerformanceInsights method analyzes and compiles detailed
    performance metrics and behavioral patterns of an AI-controlled bot identified
    by its GUID. It processes collected profiling data to produce actionable insights
    that can be used for tuning AI behavior, identifying bottlenecks, or optimizing
    decision-making logic within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically
    invoked during debugging sessions or automated analysis routines where AI performance
    evaluation is required. The insights are returned as a formatted string containing
    structured data about decision frequency, execution times, and potential inefficiencies
    in the bot's AI logic.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the AI bot for which performance
      insights are to be generated. This value must correspond to a valid active bot
      within the game world.
  - name: insights
    description: A reference to a std::string where the generated performance insights
      will be stored. The string is overwritten with the formatted insight data upon
      method completion.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      std::string insights;

      profiler.GeneratePerformanceInsights(botGuid, insights);

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_AI, "AI Insights: %s", insights.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = 12345;\nstd::string insights;\ntry {\n    profiler.GeneratePerformanceInsights(botGuid,\
      \ insights);\n    if (!insights.empty()) {\n        // Process or log the insights\n\
      \        std::cout << \"Performance Insights:\\n\" << insights << std::endl;\n\
      \    } else {\n        TC_LOG_ERROR(LOG_FILTER_AI, \"No performance data available\
      \ for bot %u\", botGuid);\n    }\n} catch (const std::exception& e) {\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(LOG_FILTER_AI,\
      \ \"Error generating insights: %s\", e.what());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that profiling data for the specified bot has been previously
    collected and is available in memory. The output string may contain newline characters
    and structured formatting suitable for logging or display purposes. Performance
    of this method may vary depending on the amount of profiling data accumulated
    for the bot.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid corresponds to an active AI bot; otherwise,
    the behavior is undefined. The insights string will be overwritten without warning,
    so ensure it's not used elsewhere before calling this method.
