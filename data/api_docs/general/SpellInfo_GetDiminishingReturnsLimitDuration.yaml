documentation:
  brief: Returns the diminishing returns limit duration for a spell
  description: This method retrieves the maximum duration for which a spell's diminishing
    returns effect will be applied. Diminishing returns is a game mechanic that reduces
    the effectiveness of repeated spell effects on the same target, typically used
    for abilities like stun, fear, or root. The returned value represents the time
    in milliseconds during which the diminishing returns will be active before reset.
    This method is essential for understanding how long certain spell effects will
    remain effective in combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the duration in milliseconds of the
    diminishing returns limit, or 0 if no diminishing returns limit is defined for
    the spell.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int32 duration = spellInfo->GetDiminishingReturnsLimitDuration();\nif (duration\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Apply diminishing returns logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    to determine how long a spell's diminishing returns will last. It should be called
    during spell initialization or when checking the effectiveness of spell mechanics.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it may not always be available
    for all spells, particularly those that do not have diminishing returns applied.
    Also, this value is often set to 0 for spells that don't have diminishing returns
    defined.
