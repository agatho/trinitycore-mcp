  class: InteractionData
  method: GetPlayerChoice
  signature: PlayerChoiceData * InteractionData::GetPlayerChoice()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the PlayerChoiceData associated with this InteractionData instance.
  description: The GetPlayerChoice method returns a pointer to the PlayerChoiceData
    object that is linked to the current InteractionData instance. This method is
    typically used in the context of player interactions, such as quest choices or
    dialogue options within World of Warcraft's interaction system. The returned pointer
    may be null if no player choice data has been assigned to the interaction. This
    method does not modify any internal state and is safe for read-only access.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the PlayerChoiceData object associated with this InteractionData,
    or nullptr if no such data exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "InteractionData* interaction = ...;\nPlayerChoiceData* choice = interaction->GetPlayerChoice();\n\
      if (choice)\n{\n    // Process the player choice\n    uint32 choiceId = choice->ChoiceID;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Valid Choice Before Use
    code: "InteractionData* interaction = ...;\nPlayerChoiceData* choice = interaction->GetPlayerChoice();\n\
      if (choice && choice->ChoiceID > 0)\n{\n    // Safe to use the choice data\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Choice ID: \" << choice->ChoiceID << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Handle case where no valid choice exists\n    std::cout << \"No player\
      \ choice available.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a direct access to the associated PlayerChoiceData without
    performing any additional operations. It is expected that the InteractionData
    instance has been properly initialized with valid player choice data before calling
    this method.
  warnings: Ensure that the returned pointer is checked for null before dereferencing,
    as it may be nullptr if no player choice data was assigned to the interaction.
