  class: WaypointMgr
  method: VisualizePath
  signature: void WaypointMgr::VisualizePath(Unit * owner, const WaypointPath * path,
    int displayId)
documentation:
  brief: Displays a visual representation of a waypoint path for a unit using a specified
    display ID.
  description: The VisualizePath method renders a visual path for a given unit by
    creating and displaying a set of waypoints using a specific model display ID.
    This functionality is typically used for debugging or visualization purposes within
    the TrinityCore framework, allowing developers to see the intended movement path
    of NPCs or creatures. The method operates on a provided waypoint path and associates
    it with a unit, displaying visual markers along the path. It does not modify the
    actual path data or affect gameplay mechanics directly, but rather provides a
    graphical representation for development and testing purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that owns or is associated with the waypoint
      path. This unit will be used as the reference point for visualizing the path.
  - name: path
    description: Pointer to a WaypointPath object containing the sequence of waypoints
      to visualize. The path defines the positions and order of points that will be
      displayed.
  - name: displayId
    description: Integer value representing the model display ID used for visualizing
      each waypoint marker. This determines what graphical representation (e.g., a
      glowing orb, arrow, etc.) will appear at each path point.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Waypoint Path Visualization
    code: 'Unit* npc = ...; // Get reference to an NPC

      WaypointPath* path = sWaypointMgr->GetWaypointPath(12345); // Get a specific
      path

      sWaypointMgr->VisualizePath(npc, path, 1234); // Visualize the path with display
      ID 1234'
    language: cpp
  - title: Debugging NPC Movement Path
    code: "Unit* mob = ...; // Get reference to a creature\nif (mob && sWaypointMgr->HasWaypointPath(mob->GetGUID()))\n\
      {\n    WaypointPath* debugPath = sWaypointMgr->GetWaypointPath(mob->GetGUID());\n\
      \    sWaypointMgr->VisualizePath(mob, debugPath, 3456); // Visualize path for\
      \ debugging\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for development and debugging purposes.
    It may not be available or have any effect in production environments without
    specific debug flags enabled. The visual markers are typically only visible to
    developers or in special debug modes.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided unit pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Also,
    be cautious when using high display IDs that might conflict with existing game
    objects or cause performance issues due to excessive visual elements.
