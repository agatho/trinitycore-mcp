documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the paragon level for a specified faction entry.
  description: The GetParagonLevel method returns the current paragon level of the
    player for a given faction entry. Paragon levels are used in World of Warcraft
    to track a player's progression beyond normal reputation thresholds, typically
    associated with achievements or special rewards. This method accesses internal
    reputation tracking data and provides the level value that corresponds to how
    far the player has progressed within the paragon system for that specific faction.
    The method requires a valid FactionEntry pointer to determine which faction's
    paragon level should be retrieved.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int32 representing the current paragon level for the specified
    faction. A value of 0 indicates no paragon progress has been made for that faction,
    while positive values indicate increasing levels of paragon progression. The exact
    range and meaning of these values depend on the game's internal paragon system
    implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Paragon Level for a Specific Faction
    code: "const FactionEntry* faction = sFactionStore.LookupEntry(1234);\nint32 paragonLevel\
      \ = player->GetReputationMgr().GetParagonLevel(faction);\nif (paragonLevel >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Player has made progress in this faction's paragon system\n\
      \    printf(\"Player has reached paragon level %d for faction %u\\n\", paragonLevel,\
      \ faction->ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within the context of player reputation management
    and may be called during events or when checking achievement progress. The paragon
    system in TrinityCore is implemented to mirror Blizzard's mechanics where players
    can earn special rewards or titles by reaching certain paragon thresholds with
    factions.
  warnings: Ensure that the FactionEntry pointer passed to this method is valid, otherwise
    behavior is undefined. This method should not be called on faction entries that
    do not support paragon progression.
