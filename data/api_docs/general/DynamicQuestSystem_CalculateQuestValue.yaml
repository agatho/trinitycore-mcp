  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: CalculateQuestValue
  signature: float DynamicQuestSystem::CalculateQuestValue(uint32 questId, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the dynamic value of a quest for a specified player
    bot.
  description: The CalculateQuestValue method computes a float-based value representing
    the relative worth or priority of a given quest for a specific player bot. This
    value is typically used by AI systems to determine which quests should be prioritized
    or completed first. The calculation may consider factors such as quest rewards,
    level requirements, quest type, and player progress. The method requires a valid
    quest ID and player object to perform the computation. It's designed to support
    dynamic quest selection logic within automated gameplay systems.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to evaluate. Must correspond to
      a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for whom the quest
      value is being calculated. Must be a valid player instance.
  returns: A float value representing the computed dynamic value of the quest. Higher
    values indicate higher priority or worth for the specified bot. The exact scale
    and interpretation depend on internal logic but typically ranges from 0.0 (lowest
    value) to potentially several hundred depending on quest attributes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Value Calculation
    code: "float value = dynamicQuestSystem.CalculateQuestValue(12345, playerBot);\n\
      if (value > 10.0f)\n{\n    // Prioritize this quest\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"quest\"\
      , \"High-value quest detected: {}\", value);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Quest Value for AI Decision Making
    code: "uint32 bestQuestId = 0;\nfloat highestValue = 0.0f;\nfor (auto& quest :\
      \ availableQuests)\n{\n    float currentValue = dynamicQuestSystem.CalculateQuestValue(quest.GetQuestId(),\
      \ playerBot);\n    if (currentValue > highestValue)\n    {\n        highestValue\
      \ = currentValue;\n        bestQuestId = quest.GetQuestId();\n    }\n}\n// Use\
      \ bestQuestId for bot's next action"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database lookups and complex calculations involving
    player stats, quest data, and reward structures. It should not be called excessively
    in tight loops due to performance implications. The returned value may vary based
    on the bot's current level, available quests, and game state.
  warnings: Ensure that both questId and bot parameters are valid before calling this
    method. Passing null pointers or invalid quest IDs may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. The calculation might be influenced by server-side configurations
    and should not be relied upon for exact numerical comparisons across different
    server builds.
