documentation:
  brief: Clears all skillup entries from the GameObject's skillup list
  description: This method removes all skillup entries from a GameObject's skillup
    list, effectively resetting the skillup state for the object. It is typically
    used during object initialization or when clearing existing skillup data before
    re-populating it with new values. The method ensures that no skillup information
    remains in the GameObject's internal data structures, allowing for clean reinitialization
    of skillup behavior.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();


      // Clear skillup list

      go->ClearSkillupList();


      // The skillup list is now empty'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method should be used carefully during object initialization or when
    resetting skillup data, as it may affect gameplay mechanics related to skillup
    progression. This operation is typically performed internally by the game engine.
