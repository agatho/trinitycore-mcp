  brief: Refreshes the vendor data for all active trade vendors in the system.
  description: The RefreshVendorData method updates the inventory and pricing information
    for all vendors currently managed by the TradeSystem. This method ensures that
    vendor items reflect the latest database state, including any changes made to
    item templates, prices, or availability. It is typically invoked when vendor data
    needs to be synchronized with the game world, such as after a server restart or
    when item configurations are updated. The method iterates through all registered
    vendors and reloads their item lists from the database, making sure that any modifications
    are properly applied.
