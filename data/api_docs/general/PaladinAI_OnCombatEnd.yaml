documentation:
  brief: Performs cleanup and state reset operations when a paladin's combat session
    ends
  description: The OnCombatEnd method is called when a PaladinAI instance transitions
    out of combat mode. This method handles necessary cleanup tasks such as resetting
    combat-related flags, clearing temporary states, and ensuring the AI returns to
    its default non-combat behavior. It is typically invoked by the core game loop
    when the paladin's combat timer expires or when the player exits combat through
    various means. The method ensures that all combat-specific resources are properly
    released and that the AI state machine transitions cleanly back to idle or patrol
    modes.

  - title: Basic usage in custom paladin AI
    code: "class MyPaladinAI : public PaladinAI {\npublic:\n    void OnCombatEnd()\
      \ override {\n        // Custom cleanup logic\n        PaladinAI::OnCombatEnd();\n\
      \        // Additional post-combat reset\n        ResetSpecialAbilities();\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the standard AI lifecycle management and should not
    be called manually unless implementing custom AI behavior. The base implementation
    handles core state resets, but derived classes may override it to perform additional
    cleanup operations specific to their functionality.
