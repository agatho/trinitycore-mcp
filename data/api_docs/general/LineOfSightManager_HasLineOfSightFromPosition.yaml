  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: HasLineOfSightFromPosition
  signature: bool LineOfSightManager::HasLineOfSightFromPosition(const int & fromPos,
    Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a unit has line of sight to a target from a specified
    position.
  description: The HasLineOfSightFromPosition method evaluates whether there is an
    unobstructed visual path between a given position and a target unit. This is commonly
    used in game mechanics such as spell casting, AI behavior, and combat interactions
    where entities must be able to see each other to perform actions. The method performs
    a raycast check from the specified position to the target's location, taking into
    account environment geometry, obstacles, and collision detection. It returns true
    if there is a clear line of sight, and false otherwise. This function is essential
    for implementing realistic gameplay behaviors where visibility affects interaction.
  parameters:
  - name: fromPos
    description: An integer reference representing the index or identifier of the
      starting position from which to check line of sight. This typically corresponds
      to a specific point in space, such as a unit's location or a designated coordinate
      within the game world.
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Unit object that represents the target entity for
      which line of sight is being evaluated. The method checks if the specified position
      has an unobstructed view to this target unit's location.
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether there is a clear line of sight
    from the provided position to the target unit. A return value of true means that
    no obstacles block the visual path, while false indicates that an obstruction
    exists between the two points.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (lineOfSightManager.HasLineOfSightFromPosition(unit->GetMapId(), targetUnit))\
      \ {\n    // Perform action requiring line of sight\n    unit->CastSpell(targetUnit,\
      \ SPELL_FIREBALL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: AI Decision Making Based on Line of Sight
    code: "if (HasLineOfSightFromPosition(currentPosition, enemy)) {\n    // Enemy\
      \ is visible, proceed with attack\n    DoAttack(enemy);\n} else {\n    // Enemy\
      \ not visible, search for better position\n    FindBetterPosition();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying collision system of TrinityCore to determine
    if any objects block the line between two points. Performance can be impacted
    by complex terrain or numerous obstacles in the path. The 'fromPos' parameter
    must correspond to a valid position within the game world; otherwise, behavior
    is undefined.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of the 'fromPos' parameter may lead to incorrect results
    or runtime errors. Ensure that the position index corresponds to an actual location
    in the map before calling this method. Also, be aware that line of sight checks
    are not instantaneous and may introduce slight delays depending on world complexity.
