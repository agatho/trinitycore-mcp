  brief: Resets the Azerite empowered item's ability points to their original state.
  description: This method handles the reset of Azerite empowered items' ability points,
    allowing players to reassign their Azerite powers after they have been modified
    through certain gameplay mechanics. It typically occurs when a player uses an
    item that has been modified by Azerite power changes and needs to revert back
    to the original state of the item's abilities. The method ensures that all Azerite
    empowered item effects are properly reset, maintaining game balance and preventing
    unintended progression.

  notes: This method is part of the internal Azerite system handling and requires
    careful implementation to ensure proper reset of item abilities. It should only
    be called when necessary, as it may affect game balance if used incorrectly.
  warnings: Improper usage can lead to incorrect item behavior or loss of ability
    points. This method should not be used outside of appropriate game mechanics contexts.
