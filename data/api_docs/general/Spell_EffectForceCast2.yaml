    casting mechanics. It handles the execution of specific spell effects that may
    require immediate application or bypass normal casting sequence. The method is
    commonly used in special abilities or triggered spells where direct targeting
    and execution are required.

  notes: This method likely operates within the context of spell execution and may
    require proper target selection before being invoked. Implementation details include
    handling of spell effects that bypass normal casting sequence, such as those used
    in triggered abilities or special mechanics.
  warnings: Improper usage can lead to incorrect targeting or execution of spell effects,
    potentially causing game balance issues or unexpected behavior. This method should
    only be called when specific conditions are met.
