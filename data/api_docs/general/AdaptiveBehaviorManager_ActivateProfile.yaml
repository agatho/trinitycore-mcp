  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: ActivateProfile
  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::ActivateProfile(const std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Activates a specified behavior profile by name within the AdaptiveBehaviorManager.
  description: The ActivateProfile method initializes and enables a behavior profile
    identified by its name within the AdaptiveBehaviorManager. This method is typically
    used to switch between different AI behavior configurations during runtime, allowing
    for dynamic adjustment of NPC or creature behaviors based on game conditions,
    events, or player interactions. The profile must already be registered with the
    manager before activation. Behavior profiles often contain predefined sets of
    actions, decision trees, and state transitions that govern how an entity responds
    to various stimuli in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The unique identifier string of the behavior profile to activate.
      This name must correspond to a previously registered profile within the AdaptiveBehaviorManager.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Profile Activation
    code: 'AdaptiveBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = ...;

      behaviorManager->ActivateProfile("AggressiveCombatProfile");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Profile Switching
    code: "if (player->GetMap()->GetDifficulty() == DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_HEROIC)\n{\n\
      \    behaviorManager->ActivateProfile(\"HeroicEliteBehavior\");\n}\nelse\n{\n\
      \    behaviorManager->ActivateProfile(\"NormalMobBehavior\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the specified profile name exists and has been properly
    initialized in the AdaptiveBehaviorManager. It is recommended to verify profile
    existence before calling this method to prevent runtime errors. The activation
    process may involve resetting internal state machines and reloading behavior configurations.
  warnings: Calling ActivateProfile with a non-existent profile name can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure all profiles are registered prior to activation. Additionally,
    frequent switching between profiles might cause performance overhead due to state
    transitions and configuration reloads.
