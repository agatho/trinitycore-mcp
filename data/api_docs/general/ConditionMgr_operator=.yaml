  brief: Moves ownership of a ConditionMgr object to another ConditionMgr object
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment operation on a ConditionMgr
    object, transferring all resources and state from the source object to the target
    object. This is a standard C++ move semantics implementation that efficiently
    transfers ownership without deep copying. The method is typically used when assigning
    one ConditionMgr instance to another, particularly in scenarios involving temporary
    objects or when optimizing resource management. In the context of TrinityCore's
    condition system, this operation allows for efficient handling of condition data
    structures during runtime evaluation and management.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the target ConditionMgr object after the move assignment
    has been completed, enabling method chaining.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'ConditionMgr sourceMgr;

      // ... populate sourceMgr with conditions ...

      ConditionMgr targetMgr = std::move(sourceMgr); // Uses move assignment operator

      // sourceMgr is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Method Chaining with Move Assignment
    code: 'ConditionMgr mgr1;

      ConditionMgr mgr2;

      // ... populate managers ...

      ConditionMgr mgr3 = std::move(mgr1).operator=(std::move(mgr2));

      // Performs move assignment and enables chaining'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method implements move semantics which is essential for efficient resource
    management in TrinityCore's condition system. The source object after move assignment
    enters a valid but unspecified state, meaning its contents should not be relied
    upon. This operation is particularly useful when working with temporary ConditionMgr
    objects or during performance-critical code paths where avoiding deep copies is
    important.
  warnings: After performing move assignment, the source object should not be used
    in any way that assumes it contains valid data. The moved-from object's state
    is undefined but still valid for destruction or reassignment. Avoid using the
    source object after a move operation unless you explicitly reinitialize it.
