  class: Garrison
  method: GetSiteLevel
  signature: const GarrSiteLevelEntry * Garrison::GetSiteLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the GarrisonSiteLevel entry associated with the garrison's current
    site level.
  description: The GetSiteLevel method returns a pointer to the GarrSiteLevelEntry
    object that defines the properties and characteristics of the garrison's current
    site level. This entry contains information such as the maximum number of buildings
    that can be placed, the required resources for upgrades, and other level-specific
    attributes. The method is typically used during garrison management operations,
    building placement validation, and upgrade calculations. It provides access to
    static game data that defines how the garrison behaves at its current level.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to a GarrSiteLevelEntry object representing the site
    level configuration for this garrison. Returns nullptr if the garrison has no
    valid site level assigned or if the garrison data is not properly initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Site Level
    code: "const GarrSiteLevelEntry* siteLevel = playerGarrison->GetSiteLevel();\n\
      if (siteLevel != nullptr)\n{\n    uint32 maxBuildings = siteLevel->MaxBuildingCount;\n\
      \    // Use maxBuildings for validation or display\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Site Level for Building Validation
    code: "Garrison* garrison = player->GetGarrison();\nconst GarrSiteLevelEntry*\
      \ siteLevel = garrison->GetSiteLevel();\nif (siteLevel && garrison->GetBuildingCount()\
      \ >= siteLevel->MaxBuildingCount)\n{\n    // Prevent adding more buildings\n\
      \    SendErrorMessage(\"Cannot place more buildings at this garrison level.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses static game data from the database and should not be
    called excessively in performance-critical code paths. The returned pointer is
    valid only as long as the garrison object remains alive and properly initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that the garrison object is valid and properly initialized before
    calling this method, as it may return nullptr if the garrison data is corrupted
    or uninitialized. Do not modify the returned entry as it represents static game
    data.
