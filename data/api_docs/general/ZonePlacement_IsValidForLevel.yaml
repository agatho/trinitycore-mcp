  class: ZonePlacement
  method: IsValidForLevel
  signature: bool ZonePlacement::IsValidForLevel(uint32 level) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the zone placement is valid for a given player level.
  description: The IsValidForLevel method checks if the current zone placement configuration
    allows players of the specified level to enter or interact with the zone. This
    validation typically considers level restrictions imposed by the zone's content,
    such as minimum and maximum allowed player levels. The method ensures that game
    balance and progression requirements are maintained by preventing players from
    accessing zones that are inappropriate for their character's development stage.
    It is commonly used during zone entry, teleportation, or quest system evaluations
    to enforce level-based access control.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the zone placement allows the specified player level to
    interact with the zone; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 playerLevel = 15;\nif (zonePlacement.IsValidForLevel(playerLevel))\
      \ {\n    // Allow player to enter zone\n    printf(\"Player level %u is valid\
      \ for this zone\\n\", playerLevel);\n} else {\n    // Prevent player from entering\
      \ zone\n    printf(\"Player level %u is not valid for this zone\\n\", playerLevel);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a comparison against internal minimum and maximum
    level thresholds stored within the ZonePlacement object. It may be called frequently
    during gameplay, so performance should be considered in high-frequency scenarios
    such as zone transitions or player movement checks.
