  signature: bool SpellInfo::IsAbilityOfSkillType(uint32 skillType) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell is associated with a specific skill type.
  description: This method checks if the spell is linked to a particular skill type,
    which is commonly used in World of Warcraft to categorize spells based on their
    associated skills such as professions, weapons, or other skill categories. The
    method returns true if the spell belongs to the specified skill type, false otherwise.
    This functionality is essential for determining spell eligibility for skill-based
    requirements and can be used in conjunction with other spell-related methods to
    validate spell usage within specific contexts.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell is associated with the specified skill type,
    false otherwise. The method may return false for spells that are not linked to
    any skill type or when the skill type does not match the spell's associated skill.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'SpellInfo* spellInfo = new SpellInfo();

      bool result = spellInfo->IsAbilityOfSkillType(129); // Check if spell is related
      to Enchanting skill'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal spell data structures and may involve
    performance considerations when used in loops or frequently during gameplay. The
    implementation typically involves checking against predefined skill type constants
    or mappings stored within the SpellInfo class.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method with spells that might have
    multiple skill associations, as the result could vary depending on how the spell
    is defined internally. Also, ensure that skillType parameter values are valid
    and known to avoid unexpected behavior.
