  signature: void BossAI::_JustReachedHome()
documentation:
  brief: Called when the boss creature returns to its home position after being engaged
    in combat.
  description: The _JustReachedHome method is a virtual callback function invoked
    by the BossAI system in TrinityCore when a boss creature successfully returns
    to its predefined home location, typically after being defeated or fleeing from
    combat. This method serves as a hook for custom AI behavior that should occur
    upon the boss's return to its original position. It is commonly used to reset
    the boss's state, trigger events, or perform cleanup operations related to the
    completion of an encounter. The method does not take any parameters and does not
    return a value, making it suitable for executing side-effect operations within
    the AI logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "class MyBossAI : public BossAI\n{\npublic:\n    MyBossAI(Creature* creature)\
      \ : BossAI(creature) {}\n\n    void _JustReachedHome() override\n    {\n   \
      \     // Reset boss state upon returning home\n        me->SetReactState(REACT_IDLE);\n\
      \        me->SetFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS, UNIT_FLAG_NON_ATTACKABLE);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the BossAI framework and is automatically called by
    the core AI system when a boss reaches its home position. It should be overridden
    in custom boss AI implementations to define specific behavior upon return to home.
