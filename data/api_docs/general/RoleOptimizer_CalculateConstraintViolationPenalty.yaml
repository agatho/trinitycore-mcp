  class: RoleOptimizer
  method: CalculateConstraintViolationPenalty
  signature: float RoleOptimizer::CalculateConstraintViolationPenalty(const int &
    assignments, const int & players, const OptimizationConstraints & constraints)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the penalty for constraint violations in role assignments within
    a group context.
  description: The CalculateConstraintViolationPenalty method evaluates how severely
    a given set of role assignments violates predefined optimization constraints.
    It is used during group composition analysis to determine the fitness of a particular
    role distribution. The method takes into account the number of players, current
    assignments, and defined constraints to compute a floating-point penalty value
    that reflects the severity of constraint violations. This penalty is typically
    used in optimization algorithms to guide towards valid role distributions that
    satisfy all game mechanics requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: assignments
    description: The number of role assignments made for the group. Represents how
      many players have been assigned specific roles.
  - name: players
    description: The total number of players in the group. This parameter defines
      the scope of the assignment problem being evaluated.
  - name: constraints
    description: An object containing the optimization constraints that define valid
      role assignments. These may include restrictions on role distribution, player
      class requirements, or other game-specific rules.
  returns: A floating-point value representing the calculated penalty for constraint
    violations. Higher values indicate more severe violations, while zero indicates
    a perfect match to all constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: float penalty = optimizer.CalculateConstraintViolationPenalty(5, 10, constraints);
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Optimization Loop
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < assignmentCount; ++i)\n{\n    float penalty = optimizer.CalculateConstraintViolationPenalty(assignments[i],\
      \ playerCount, constraints);\n    if (penalty < bestPenalty)\n    {\n      \
      \  bestPenalty = penalty;\n        bestAssignment = assignments[i];\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically part of a larger optimization system that seeks
    to find the best role distribution for groups in World of Warcraft. The penalty
    calculation may involve complex logic based on constraint types and player roles,
    potentially including weighted scoring systems or probabilistic evaluations.
  warnings: Ensure that the constraints object passed is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as invalid or uninitialized constraints could lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect penalty calculations.
