  method: ValidateBotState
  signature: bool DeathRecoveryManager::ValidateBotState() const
documentation:
  brief: Validates the current state of a bot to ensure it is in a recoverable condition
    after death.
  description: The ValidateBotState method checks whether a bot's current state meets
    the requirements for successful death recovery within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method ensures that the bot is not in an invalid or inconsistent state that
    would prevent proper resurrection or revival mechanics from functioning correctly.
    It typically verifies that the bot has valid player data, is not already resurrected,
    and maintains internal consistency with the game's death recovery system. The
    validation process may include checking for active sessions, verifying character
    state flags, and ensuring that all necessary resources are available for a potential
    recovery operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot's state is valid and recoverable, false otherwise.
    A return value of false indicates that the bot cannot be recovered at this time
    due to invalid or inconsistent internal state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic State Validation
    code: "if (deathRecoveryManager.ValidateBotState()) {\n    // Proceed with death\
      \ recovery logic\n    deathRecoveryManager.AttemptRecovery();\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Handle invalid bot state\n    LOG_ERROR(\"world\", \"Cannot recover bot:\
      \ Invalid state detected\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before attempting any death recovery operations
    to prevent system errors or inconsistent states. It may perform lightweight checks
    only, avoiding heavy computations that could impact performance during critical
    game events.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the DeathRecoveryManager
    can lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that all bot data is properly loaded and
    synchronized before invoking state validation.
