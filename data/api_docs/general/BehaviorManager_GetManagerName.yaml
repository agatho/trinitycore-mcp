documentation:
  brief: Returns the name of the behavior manager instance
  description: The GetManagerName method retrieves the unique string identifier associated
    with a BehaviorManager instance. This name is typically used to distinguish between
    different behavior managers within the AI system, allowing for proper management
    and retrieval of specific AI behaviors. The returned reference points to an internal
    string member that should not be modified directly. This method is commonly used
    in debugging and logging scenarios to identify which behavior manager is handling
    specific AI operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the name of the behavior
    manager. The string is guaranteed to be valid and non-empty for properly initialized
    instances.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BehaviorManager* manager = new BehaviorManager();

      std::cout << "Manager name: " << manager->GetManagerName() << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Debug Logging
    code: "void LogBehaviorState(BehaviorManager& manager) {\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"ai\"\
      , \"Current behavior manager: {}\", manager.GetManagerName());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned string reference is valid only as long as the BehaviorManager
    instance exists. The method is marked as const, indicating it does not modify
    the object state. This is a performance-friendly getter that returns a reference
    rather than copying the string.
