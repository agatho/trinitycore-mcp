  method: GetStats
  signature: const ArenaTeamStats & ArenaTeam::GetStats() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current statistics structure for this arena team.
  description: The GetStats method retrieves a constant reference to the ArenaTeamStats
    structure that holds all current statistical data for the arena team. This includes
    metrics such as rating, games played, wins, and losses. The returned structure
    is read-only and should not be modified directly. The statistics are updated dynamically
    as the team participates in arena matches and the data reflects the most recent
    state of the team's performance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the ArenaTeamStats structure containing all current
    statistical information for this arena team, including rating, match history,
    and performance metrics.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Arena Team Statistics
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\nif (team)\n\
      {\n    const ArenaTeamStats& stats = team->GetStats();\n    std::cout << \"\
      Team Rating: \" << stats.rating << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Games Played:\
      \ \" << stats.gamesPlayed << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned ArenaTeamStats reference points to internal data that may be
    modified by other methods in the arena system. While the reference itself is const,
    the underlying data structure can change when new matches are processed or team
    members update their stats.
