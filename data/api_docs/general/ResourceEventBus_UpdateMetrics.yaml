  class: ResourceEventBus
  method: UpdateMetrics
  signature: void ResourceEventBus::UpdateMetrics(std::chrono::microseconds processingTime)
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal resource metrics with the provided processing time.
  description: The UpdateMetrics method is responsible for recording and updating
    performance-related metrics within the ResourceEventBus. It accepts a std::chrono::microseconds
    parameter representing the time taken to process a specific resource event. This
    method is typically invoked after completing a resource operation to track how
    long operations take, which helps in monitoring system performance and identifying
    bottlenecks. The method does not return any value but modifies internal state
    for metric tracking purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: processingTime
    description: The time duration in microseconds that was spent processing a resource
      event. This value is used to update internal performance statistics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ResourceEventBus bus;

      std::chrono::microseconds time(1500);

      bus.UpdateMetrics(time);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Performance Monitoring Context
    code: "void ProcessResource() {\n    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \    // ... perform resource operations ...\n    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \    auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end\
      \ - start);\n    ResourceEventBus::Instance()->UpdateMetrics(duration);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called from within event handling or resource processing
    loops. It's important to ensure that the processingTime value accurately reflects
    the actual time spent on the operation, as incorrect values will skew performance
    metrics. The method may be thread-safe depending on implementation, but it's recommended
    to verify synchronization if used in multi-threaded contexts.
  warnings: Ensure that processingTime is always a positive value; negative or zero
    durations could lead to incorrect metric calculations. If this method is called
    frequently, consider its impact on performance due to potential locking mechanisms
    or frequent updates to shared metrics data structures.
