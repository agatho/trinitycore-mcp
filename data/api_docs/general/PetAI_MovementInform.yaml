  class: PetAI
  method: MovementInform
  signature: void PetAI::MovementInform(int type, int id)
documentation:
  brief: Handles movement completion events for a pet AI, notifying when a pet has
    finished moving to a specified location or path.
  description: 'The MovementInform method is a callback function in the PetAI class
    that is invoked when a pet finishes its movement animation or pathfinding. This
    method is typically called by the core game engine when a pet''s movement behavior
    completes, allowing the AI to perform actions based on the completion of a specific
    movement type. It is part of the broader AI system that governs how pets behave
    in World of Warcraft, particularly in relation to their movement patterns and
    interaction with the environment. The method accepts two parameters: the type
    of movement that was completed and an identifier for that specific movement instance,
    which allows for distinguishing between different movement events.'
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: An integer representing the type of movement that has completed.
      Common values include 0 for normal movement, 1 for waypoint movement, and 2
      for spell-based movement. The exact meaning depends on how the movement was
      initiated.
  - name: id
    description: An integer identifier associated with the specific movement event.
      This value is typically used to distinguish between multiple concurrent movements
      or to track a particular path or destination.
  returns: null

    code: "void PetAI::MovementInform(int type, int id)\n{\n    if (type == 0 && id\
      \ == 1)\n    {\n        // Pet has finished moving to a specific location\n\
      \        owner->SendPetSpellCooldown(12345);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Movement Inform with State Management
    code: "void PetAI::MovementInform(int type, int id)\n{\n    switch (type)\n  \
      \  {\n        case 0: // Normal movement\n            if (id == currentTargetId)\n\
      \                AttackStart(target);\n            break;\n        case 1: //\
      \ Waypoint reached\n            if (waypoints.empty())\n                return;\n\
      \            MoveToNextWaypoint();\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI event system and should not be called directly
    from outside the core AI framework. The parameters 'type' and 'id' are determined
    by how the movement was initiated, so developers must ensure consistency between
    movement initiation and handling. MovementInform may be called multiple times
    during a pet's lifetime depending on the complexity of its behavior.
  warnings: Do not assume that all movement types will be handled in the same way;
    different movement types (e.g., pathfinding vs. spell-based) might require distinct
    logic. Incorrectly handling or ignoring this callback can lead to pets not performing
    expected actions after moving, such as attacking targets or following waypoints.
