  signature: void Guild::BroadcastToGuild(WorldSession * session, bool officerOnly,
    std::string_view msg, uint32 language) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a message to all guild members or officers in the guild.
  description: The BroadcastToGuild method sends a specified message to either all
    members of the guild or only officers, depending on the officerOnly parameter.
    It uses the provided WorldSession to determine the sender and broadcasts the message
    using the specified language. This method is typically used for guild announcements,
    warnings, or general communication within the guild context. The message is sent
    through the game's chat system and respects the language settings of the sending
    player.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession of the player sending the broadcast.
      Used to determine the sender and apply appropriate language settings.
  - name: officerOnly
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the message should be sent only to
      guild officers (true) or to all guild members (false).
  - name: msg
    description: String view containing the message text to be broadcasted to the
      guild members.
  - name: language
    description: Language identifier specifying the language in which the message
      should be sent. Used for proper localization and chat filtering.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Broadcast a general guild announcement to all members
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    guild->BroadcastToGuild(session,\
      \ false, \"Welcome to our guild!\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Send an officer-only notice about a raid
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    guild->BroadcastToGuild(session,\
      \ true, \"Raid starts in 10 minutes!\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally handles the filtering of recipients based on the officerOnly
    flag and ensures that messages are properly formatted for chat display. It does
    not validate the message content or check for spam filters, which are handled
    at a higher level in the chat system.
  warnings: Ensure that the session parameter is valid and points to an active player
    session; otherwise, the broadcast may fail or cause unexpected behavior. The language
    parameter should be set correctly to avoid miscommunication issues with players
    who speak different languages.
