  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: LeaveGroup
  signature: bool GroupCoordinator::LeaveGroup()
documentation:
  brief: Removes the current player from their group and updates group state accordingly.
  description: The LeaveGroup method removes the calling player from their current
    group. It handles the necessary cleanup of group membership, updates internal
    group data structures, and notifies other group members of the player's departure.
    This method ensures proper group state management by removing the player's entry
    from the group roster and potentially triggering group reorganization if the group
    becomes invalid (e.g., when a group is left with only one member). The method
    returns true upon successful removal, or false if the player was not in a group
    or if the operation failed for any reason.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player was successfully removed from the group and
    the group state was updated correctly. Returns false if the player was not part
    of a group or if an error occurred during the removal process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (groupCoordinator->LeaveGroup()) {\n    // Player successfully left\
      \ the group\n    sLog->outString(\"Player has left the group.\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Failed to leave group\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to remove player\
      \ from group.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on a valid GroupCoordinator instance that
    represents the current player's group context. The method does not handle sending
    notifications to other players in the group; this is typically handled by the
    calling code or internal group systems.
  warnings: Calling LeaveGroup when the player is not actually in a group may result
    in unexpected behavior or errors. Always verify group membership before calling
    this method if unsure of the current state.
