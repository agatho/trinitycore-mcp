  class: KitingManager
  method: ShouldMaintainDistance
  signature: bool KitingManager::ShouldMaintainDistance(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the AI-controlled unit should maintain a specific distance
    from its target during kiting behavior.
  description: The ShouldMaintainDistance method evaluates if the current unit's positioning
    relative to its target warrants maintaining a certain distance, typically used
    in kiting AI logic. This decision is based on factors such as the unit's attack
    range, the target's movement patterns, and the unit's current health or mana state.
    The method is crucial for determining when a unit should retreat or reposition
    itself during combat, especially in scenarios involving ranged attackers or casters.
    It ensures that the AI behaves realistically by not getting too close to enemies
    that can melee attack, while also avoiding unnecessary distance management when
    it's safe to remain close.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit should maintain distance from its target based
    on kiting logic and combat conditions; otherwise returns false. A return value
    of true indicates that the AI should either move away from or avoid closing to
    the target to optimize positioning for continued engagement.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void KitingAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->GetVictim()\
      \ && ShouldMaintainDistance(me->GetVictim()))\n    {\n        // Initiate kiting\
      \ movement\n        DoKitingMovement();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom kiting behavior
    code: "bool KitingManager::ShouldMaintainDistance(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (!target\
      \ || !me->IsInCombat())\n        return false;\n\n    float distance = me->GetDistance(target);\n\
      \    float attackRange = me->GetAttackDistance(target);\n\n    // If we're too\
      \ close to melee range, maintain distance\n    if (distance < attackRange *\
      \ 0.8f)\n        return true;\n\n    // If target is moving fast and we're in\
      \ range, consider kiting\n    if (target->HasUnitMovementFlag(MOVEMENTFLAG_FORWARD)\
      \ && distance < attackRange * 1.5f)\n        return true;\n\n    return false;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the kiting AI system and is typically called during
    AI update cycles to make real-time positioning decisions. It's important to note
    that this function may be overridden or extended by custom AI modules in order
    to implement more complex kiting behaviors. The decision logic may vary depending
    on the unit type (ranged vs melee), class abilities, and specific encounter mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is valid before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Also, be cautious
    when modifying the return logic in custom implementations, as incorrect distance
    calculations can cause units to either get stuck in combat or flee unnecessarily.
