  class: CooldownManager
  method: TriggerGCD
  signature: void CooldownManager::TriggerGCD(uint32 durationMs)
documentation:
  brief: Triggers the Global Cooldown (GCD) for the associated unit with the specified
    duration.
  description: The TriggerGCD method initiates the Global Cooldown (GCD) timer for
    a unit, preventing the execution of certain abilities or spells until the cooldown
    period has elapsed. This mechanism is fundamental to World of Warcraft's combat
    system, ensuring that players cannot spam powerful abilities excessively. The
    duration parameter defines how long the GCD will last in milliseconds. This method
    typically gets called when a player or creature performs an action that triggers
    the global cooldown, such as casting a spell or using a melee attack. It updates
    internal cooldown tracking structures and may affect the unit's ability to perform
    subsequent actions during the GCD period.
  parameters:
  - name: durationMs
    description: The duration of the Global Cooldown in milliseconds. This value determines
      how long the unit will be unable to perform GCD-triggering actions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Unit* player = ...;

      player->GetCooldownManager()->TriggerGCD(1500); // Triggers a 1.5 second GCD'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Spell Cast
    code: "void Player::CastSpell(SpellInfo const* spellInfo)\n{\n    // ... spell\
      \ logic ...\n    TriggerGCD(spellInfo->GetCastTime());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the unit's cooldown manager. It
    should be called only when an action actually triggers a GCD, not for arbitrary
    durations. The implementation may involve updating timers and potentially notifying
    other systems about the GCD state change.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context might lead to incorrect gameplay
    behavior or unexpected cooldown states. Ensure that the duration passed is appropriate
    for the action being performed (e.g., use spell cast times, not fixed values).
