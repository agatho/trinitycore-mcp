  method: GetCurrentDamageModifier
  signature: float CooldownStackingOptimizer::GetCurrentDamageModifier() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current damage modifier based on cooldown stacking
    mechanics.
  description: The GetCurrentDamageModifier method retrieves the cumulative damage
    multiplier applied to a spell or ability due to cooldown stacking effects. This
    value is typically used in conjunction with cooldown reduction mechanics to determine
    how much additional damage is dealt when abilities are cast in quick succession.
    The returned float represents a multiplicative factor (e.g., 1.0 for no modifier,
    1.5 for 50% increased damage). This method does not modify internal state and
    is read-only, making it safe to call during active combat or spell processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current cumulative damage modifier. A value
    of 1.0 indicates no damage increase, while values greater than 1.0 indicate increased
    damage (e.g., 1.25 means 25% more damage). Values less than 1.0 are not typical
    for this method but may occur in edge cases involving debuffs or negative modifiers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Processing
    code: 'float modifier = optimizer.GetCurrentDamageModifier();

      float finalDamage = baseDamage * modifier;

      // Apply finalDamage to target'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Modifier for Damage Calculation
    code: "void ApplyCooldownDamageBoost(Player* player, SpellInfo const* spellInfo)\n\
      {\n    CooldownStackingOptimizer& optimizer = player->GetCooldownStackingOptimizer();\n\
      \    float damageMod = optimizer.GetCurrentDamageModifier();\n    if (damageMod\
      \ > 1.0f)\n    {\n        // Log or display increased damage\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Cooldown stacking increased damage by %.2f%%\", (damageMod - 1.0f) * 100);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that cooldown stacking effects have already been properly
    calculated and applied to the optimizer's internal state. It should only be called
    after relevant cooldown events have occurred, such as successful spell casts or
    ability usage. The value returned is cached and may not reflect real-time changes
    unless the optimizer has been updated with new cooldown data.
  warnings: Calling this method before any cooldown stacking has occurred may return
    unexpected values (e.g., 1.0 if no stacking was applied). Ensure that the CooldownStackingOptimizer
    instance is properly initialized and updated before invoking this method to avoid
    incorrect damage calculations.
