documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns a suitable target for healing within the paladin's group
  description: The SelectHealingTarget method identifies and returns the most appropriate
    player target within the paladin's current group for performing healing spells.
    This method evaluates group members based on their health percentage, distance
    from the paladin, and other relevant factors to determine the optimal healing
    target. The returned pointer points to an integer representing the target's GUID,
    or NULL if no suitable target is found. This method is typically used in AI decision-making
    processes for Holy Paladins to ensure efficient resource allocation during combat
    situations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer containing the GUID of the selected healing target,
    or NULL if no valid target exists within the group
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Paladin AI
    code: "int *target = paladin->SelectHealingTarget(nullptr);\nif (target != nullptr)\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with healing spell on target\n    paladin->CastSpell(*target,\
      \ SPELL_FLASH_OF_LIGHT);\n} else {\n    // No suitable target found\n    paladin->Say(\"\
      No targets to heal!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the paladin has a valid group context and that group
    members are within reasonable distance. The selection algorithm prioritizes players
    with the lowest health percentage, but may also consider proximity and threat
    level in more complex implementations.
  warnings: The returned pointer should not be freed or modified directly. It points
    to internal data structures managed by the TrinityCore framework. Using an invalid
    pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
