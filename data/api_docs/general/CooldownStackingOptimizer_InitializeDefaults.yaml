  class: CooldownStackingOptimizer
  method: InitializeDefaults
  signature: void CooldownStackingOptimizer::InitializeDefaults()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes default cooldown stacking behavior settings for the optimizer.
  description: The InitializeDefaults method sets up the default configuration values
    for cooldown stacking optimization within the CooldownStackingOptimizer class.
    This method is typically called during object initialization or reset operations
    to establish baseline behavior for how cooldowns are managed and stacked. It configures
    internal parameters that control the decision-making process for when and how
    cooldowns should be prioritized or delayed based on game mechanics such as spell
    priorities, resource management, and combat efficiency. The method ensures that
    all relevant cooldown-related variables are properly initialized with sensible
    default values before any optimization calculations begin.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'CooldownStackingOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.InitializeDefaults();

      // Default settings are now configured for cooldown optimization'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any cooldown optimization calculations
    are performed. It is typically invoked automatically during object construction,
    but may also be called manually to reset the optimizer to its default state.
