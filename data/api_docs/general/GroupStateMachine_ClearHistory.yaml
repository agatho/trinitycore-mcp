documentation:
  brief: Clears the group state machine's history of previous group states and transitions.
  description: The ClearHistory method resets the internal history tracking of a GroupStateMachine
    instance, removing all recorded group state changes and transitions. This is typically
    used when a group's state needs to be reset or when starting a new logical sequence
    of group operations. The method ensures that subsequent state checks or transitions
    will not be influenced by previously recorded states. It does not affect the current
    group state itself, only the historical record of state changes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to reset group state history
    code: 'GroupStateMachine* groupSM = player->GetGroup()->GetGroupStateMachine();

      groupSM->ClearHistory();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it permanently removes historical
    state information, which may be needed for debugging or rollback operations. It
    is recommended to call this only when explicitly required, such as after completing
    a group operation sequence.
