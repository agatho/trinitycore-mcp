  class: DeathKnightAI
  method: CanUseAbility
  signature: bool DeathKnightAI::CanUseAbility(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a Death Knight can use a specified ability based on current
    game state and resource requirements.
  description: The CanUseAbility method evaluates if a Death Knight AI character is
    capable of casting or using a specific spell or ability. It checks various conditions
    such as mana, rage, runic power, cooldowns, and other resource constraints that
    are typical for Death Knights in World of Warcraft. This method is crucial for
    AI decision-making processes, ensuring abilities are only attempted when the character
    has sufficient resources and meets all preconditions. The method returns true
    if the ability can be used immediately, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell or ability to check for usability.
      This ID corresponds to entries in the game's spell database and must reference
      a valid Death Knight ability.
  returns: Returns true if the Death Knight can currently use the specified ability,
    considering all relevant resource requirements and cooldowns; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (deathKnightAI->CanUseAbility(49576)) // Death Grip\n{\n    // Attempt\
      \ to use Death Grip\n    deathKnightAI->DoCastVictim(49576);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ability Usage
    code: "uint32 abilities[] = { 49576, 47541, 49998 };\nfor (uint32 ability : abilities)\n\
      {\n    if (deathKnightAI->CanUseAbility(ability))\n    {\n        deathKnightAI->DoCastVictim(ability);\n\
      \        break; // Use only the first available ability\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely integrates with internal resource tracking systems such
    as runic power, rage, and cooldown management. It may also consider the current
    target state, positioning, and other AI-specific conditions to determine usability.
  warnings: Ensure that spellId corresponds to a valid Death Knight ability; invalid
    IDs might cause undefined behavior or return incorrect results. The method does
    not account for temporary buffs or debuffs that could affect usability outside
    of core resource constraints.
