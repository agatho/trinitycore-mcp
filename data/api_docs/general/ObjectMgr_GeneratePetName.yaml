  brief: Generates a unique name for a pet based on its creature entry ID
  description: The GeneratePetName method creates a distinctive name for a pet creature
    using its entry identifier. This function is typically used when spawning pets
    in the game world to ensure each pet has a unique and appropriate name. The generated
    names are usually derived from predefined naming patterns or lookup tables associated
    with specific creature types. The method does not require any parameters beyond
    the entry ID, which uniquely identifies the type of pet being named. This functionality
    supports the game's pet system by providing meaningful names that enhance player
    immersion and distinguish between different pet types.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the generated pet name. The returned string will
    be a valid, unique name for the specified creature entry type.
  examples:
  - title: Generate a pet name for a specific creature entry
    code: 'uint32 petEntry = 416; // Generic pet entry ID

      std::string petName = sObjectMgr->GeneratePetName(petEntry);

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Generated pet name: %s", petName.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely utilizes internal naming tables or patterns specific to
    the creature entry. It may cache previously generated names to avoid duplicates
    within a session. The implementation is probably thread-safe as it's part of the
    ObjectMgr singleton class.
