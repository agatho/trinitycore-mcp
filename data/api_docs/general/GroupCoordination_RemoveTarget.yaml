  method: RemoveTarget
  signature: void GroupCoordination::RemoveTarget(int targetGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a target from the group coordination system by its unique identifier.
  description: The RemoveTarget method removes a specified target from the group coordination
    system using its unique identifier (GUID). This function is typically used in
    group-based gameplay mechanics where targets are dynamically added and removed
    during encounters or quests. The method ensures that the target is properly unregistered
    from any active group coordination structures, preventing further interaction
    with group-based systems such as shared loot, coordinated abilities, or synchronized
    events. It is important to note that this operation may have cascading effects
    on dependent systems if the removed target was involved in ongoing group activities.
  parameters:
  - name: targetGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target to be removed from the
      group coordination system. This value must correspond to a valid target that
      has been previously added to the system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GroupCoordination* coord = sGroupCoordination->GetGroupCoordination();

      coord->RemoveTarget(123456);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Removal with Validation
    code: "GroupCoordination* coord = sGroupCoordination->GetGroupCoordination();\n\
      if (coord && targetGuid > 0)\n{\n    coord->RemoveTarget(targetGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on targets that have been previously registered
    with the group coordination system. Improper usage may lead to inconsistent state
    in group-based systems. The implementation likely involves internal data structure
    updates and event notifications to maintain synchronization across related components.
  warnings: Calling RemoveTarget with an invalid or non-existent GUID may cause undefined
    behavior or system instability. Always validate that the target exists before
    attempting removal. This method should not be called from within critical sections
    of code where race conditions might occur.
