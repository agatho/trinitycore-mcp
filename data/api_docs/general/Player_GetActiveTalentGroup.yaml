  method: GetActiveTalentGroup
  signature: uint8 Player::GetActiveTalentGroup() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the active talent group identifier for the player.
  description: This method retrieves the currently active talent group for the player,
    which determines which set of talents is being used for spell learning and advancement.
    The returned value represents a numeric identifier that corresponds to one of
    the two available talent groups (0 or 1) in the game. This method is commonly
    used during talent point allocation and character progression to ensure the correct
    talent tree is being updated. The active talent group can be changed through various
    game mechanics including talent reset spells, class change, and certain quest
    rewards.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the active talent group identifier.
    Value 0 indicates the first talent group (primary), while value 1 indicates the
    second talent group (secondary). This value is typically used to determine which
    talent tree is currently being updated during talent point allocation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint8 activeGroup = player->GetActiveTalentGroup();\nif (activeGroup ==\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Player is using primary talent group\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player\
      \ is using secondary talent group\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is thread-safe and does not require any special considerations
    for usage. It's commonly used in conjunction with other talent-related methods
    like GetTalentPoints and GetTalentGroup. This method returns the current active
    group, which may differ from the default group if a player has changed their talent
    group through various game mechanics.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine which talent group is currently
    being used for spell learning, as it only returns the active group and does not
    account for other potential changes in talent group usage. The value returned
    may change during gameplay when a player resets talents or changes class.
