  class: WarlockAI
  method: ShouldConserveMana
  signature: bool WarlockAI::ShouldConserveMana()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the warlock should conserve mana during spell casting.
  description: The ShouldConserveMana method evaluates the current state of the warlock's
    mana resources and combat situation to decide if it is beneficial to conserve
    mana for future spells. This decision is based on factors such as available mana
    percentage, current target health, and the presence of high-damage spells that
    might be more effective when cast with full mana. The method helps optimize resource
    management by preventing unnecessary expenditure during low-priority encounters
    or when mana is critically low.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the warlock should conserve mana (e.g., low mana, non-critical
    target, or upcoming high-cost spells), otherwise returns false to indicate that
    mana can be used freely for spell casting.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (warlockAI->ShouldConserveMana()) {\n    // Avoid casting high-mana\
      \ spells\n    DoNotCastExpensiveSpells();\n} else {\n    // Proceed with normal\
      \ spell rotation\n    CastNextSpell();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within the WarlockAI's decision-making loop
    to dynamically adjust spell selection based on resource availability. It may consider
    factors like current mana level, target threat, and cooldown status of key abilities.
