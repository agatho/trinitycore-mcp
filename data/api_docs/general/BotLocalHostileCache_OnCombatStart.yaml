documentation:
  brief: Initializes the hostile cache when a bot enters combat mode
  description: The OnCombatStart method is invoked when a bot begins combat, triggering
    the initialization and population of the local hostile cache. This method ensures
    that the bot maintains an up-to-date list of nearby hostile targets for decision-making
    and behavior execution. It typically runs during the initial phase of combat engagement
    and prepares the internal data structures required for threat management and target
    selection logic.
  parameters: []

  - title: Basic usage in combat initialization
    code: "void MyBot::EnterCombat()\n{\n    // Bot enters combat\n    m_hostileCache.OnCombatStart();\n\
      \    // Proceed with combat behavior logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the TrinityCore AI system
    when a bot's combat state transitions to active. It may perform operations such
    as scanning nearby units, updating threat lists, and initializing combat-related
    timers or flags.
