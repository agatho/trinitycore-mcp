  method: GetMainTank
  signature: int * RestorationDruidRefactored::GetMainTank(const int & group) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the main tank's GUID within the specified group
  description: The GetMainTank method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of the
    primary tank in a specified group. This is commonly used in raid and group scenarios
    where the Druid needs to identify which player is designated as the main tank
    for threat management, cooldown usage, or positioning decisions. The method takes
    a group identifier as input and returns a pointer to an integer representing the
    GUID of the main tank. If no main tank is found or the group is invalid, it may
    return nullptr or a default value depending on implementation details.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the main tank in the specified
    group, or nullptr if no valid main tank exists or the group is invalid
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int* mainTankGUID = druid.GetMainTank(0);\nif (mainTankGUID != nullptr)\
      \ {\n    // Use the GUID for targeting or threat management\n    printf(\"Main\
      \ tank GUID: %d\\n\", *mainTankGUID);\n} else {\n    printf(\"No main tank found\
      \ in group\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within group-based AI logic for Restoration
    Druids in TrinityCore. It assumes that the group structure and tank designation
    are properly maintained by the game engine or plugin. The returned pointer should
    be checked for null before dereferencing to avoid runtime errors.
  warnings: Ensure that the group index passed to this method is valid; otherwise,
    it may return an invalid pointer. Also, note that the GUID returned might change
    during combat if tank switching occurs, so caching the result may not always be
    appropriate.
