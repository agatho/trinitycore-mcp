  method: OnInitialize
  signature: void SmartAreaTriggerAI::OnInitialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the SmartAreaTriggerAI instance and sets up internal state for
    area trigger event handling.
  description: The OnInitialize method is called during the construction or activation
    of a SmartAreaTriggerAI instance. It performs necessary setup operations such
    as initializing internal data structures, registering event handlers, and preparing
    the AI for processing area trigger events. This method ensures that all required
    resources are allocated and configured before the AI begins its operational lifecycle.
    The initialization typically occurs once when the area trigger is first created
    or enabled within the game world.

  - title: Basic Usage in Area Trigger Creation
    code: "class MyAreaTriggerAI : public SmartAreaTriggerAI\n{\npublic:\n    void\
      \ OnInitialize() override\n    {\n        // Custom initialization logic\n \
      \       SmartAreaTriggerAI::OnInitialize();\n        // Additional setup code\
      \ here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should not be called manually by developers unless implementing
    a custom AI class. It's automatically invoked during the area trigger's lifecycle
    management in TrinityCore. The method is typically overridden in derived classes
    to add custom initialization behavior while still calling the base implementation.
