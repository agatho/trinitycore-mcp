  signature: bool TraitEntry::operator!=(const TraitEntry & right) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two TraitEntry objects for inequality.
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this TraitEntry
    instance and another TraitEntry object to determine if they are not equal. This
    comparison is typically used to check whether two trait entries have different
    properties or identifiers. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    TraitEntry objects represent specific traits that players can acquire through
    various gameplay mechanics such as character progression, class specialization,
    or achievement rewards. The method returns true if the two objects differ in any
    meaningful way, and false if they are considered equal based on their internal
    data members.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The TraitEntry object to compare against this instance for inequality.
  returns: Returns true if the current TraitEntry object is not equal to the provided
    right operand; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Inequality Check
    code: 'TraitEntry entry1;

      TraitEntry entry2;

      bool areDifferent = (entry1 != entry2); // Returns true if entries differ

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Conditional Logic
    code: "if (playerTrait != defaultTrait) {\n    // Apply custom trait logic\n \
      \   player->ApplyCustomTrait();\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely compares internal member variables such as ID, flags,
    or other identifying attributes of the TraitEntry. It is commonly used in containers
    like std::set or std::map where equality and inequality operators are required
    for proper functioning.
