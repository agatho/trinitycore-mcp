  class: LFGMgr
  method: GetPlayers
  signature: const int & LFGMgr::GetPlayers(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of players in a specific LFG (Looking for Group) dungeon
    finder instance.
  description: The GetPlayers method returns the current count of players participating
    in a particular Looking for Group dungeon finder instance identified by its GUID.
    This method is used internally by the LFG system to track group sizes and manage
    queue operations. The returned value represents the actual number of players currently
    queued or assigned to that specific dungeon group. It's important to note that
    this method may return different values depending on the current state of the
    LFG instance, such as whether players are in the queue, forming a group, or already
    inside the dungeon.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the LFG dungeon finder instance for
      which to retrieve player count. This is typically a 32-bit integer representing
      the dungeon's internal ID.
  returns: Returns a constant reference to an integer representing the number of players
    currently associated with the specified LFG instance. The value will be zero if
    no players are in that instance, or a positive integer indicating the current
    group size.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 dungeonGuid = 12345;\nint playerCount = LFGMgr::GetPlayers(dungeonGuid);\n\
      if (playerCount > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Dungeon has \" << playerCount <<\
      \ \" players\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Group Size Before Adding Players
    code: "uint32 dungeonGuid = 54321;\nconst int& currentPlayers = LFGMgr::GetPlayers(dungeonGuid);\n\
      if (currentPlayers < MAX_GROUP_SIZE)\n{\n    // Add player to group\n    LFGMgr::AddPlayerToGroup(dungeonGuid,\
      \ newPlayerGuid);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle full group case\n    SendLFGFullMessage(dungeonGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a const reference to an integer which means it should
    not be modified directly. The implementation likely involves accessing internal
    LFG data structures that track player counts per dungeon instance. Performance
    is generally good as it's designed for frequent polling during LFG operations,
    but excessive calls without caching may impact performance in high-traffic scenarios.
  warnings: Be aware that the returned reference points to an internal value that
    might change if other methods modify the LFG state. Avoid storing this reference
    for extended periods as it could become invalid or point to outdated data. Also
    ensure the GUID parameter is valid and corresponds to an existing LFG instance
    to prevent undefined behavior.
