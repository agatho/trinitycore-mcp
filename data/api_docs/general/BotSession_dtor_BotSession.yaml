documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BotSession instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The BotSession destructor is called automatically when a BotSession
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any allocated memory, active bot connections, and related session data.
    In the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this destructor plays a critical role
    in preventing memory leaks and maintaining stable server performance by releasing
    all resources held by the session. The destruction process typically involves
    disconnecting bots, freeing internal buffers, and notifying the system that the
    session is no longer active.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    BotSession session;\n    // ... use session\
      \ ...\n} // Destructor called automatically here"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit Deletion
    code: 'BotSession* session = new BotSession();

      // ... use session ...

      delete session; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when objects go
    out of scope. Developers should not manually call this destructor unless explicitly
    managing object lifetime through dynamic allocation. The destruction process may
    involve asynchronous operations such as disconnecting bots from the server, which
    could introduce slight delays in object cleanup.
  warnings: Avoid calling the destructor directly on stack-allocated objects as it
    will result in undefined behavior. Also, ensure that all bot-related operations
    are properly terminated before the session is destroyed to prevent potential crashes
    or data corruption.
