  brief: Returns the maximum skill value for a specified skill.
  description: This method retrieves the maximum skill value that can be achieved
    for a given skill in the game. It is commonly used to determine the highest possible
    skill level a player can reach for a specific skill, such as professions or secondary
    skills. The method returns a uint16 value representing the skill level, which
    typically corresponds to the maximum skill cap that can be reached through normal
    gameplay progression. This value may vary based on game expansion and player level.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the maximum skill value (uint16) for the specified skill, representing
    the highest possible skill level a player can achieve for that skill.

    code: 'uint16 maxSkill = player->GetMaxSkillValue(129);

      // Returns the maximum skill value for the Mining skill (129)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other skill-related methods
    to determine skill progression and cap. It may be affected by game expansion changes
    or player level restrictions.
  warnings: The method does not validate if the skill ID is valid; calling it with
    an invalid skill ID may result in undefined behavior or return zero.
