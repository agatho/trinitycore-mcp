  method: GetQuestPickupFilter
  signature: QuestPickupFilter QuestPickup::GetQuestPickupFilter(uint32 botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the quest pickup filter configuration for a specified bot GUID
  description: The GetQuestPickupFilter method retrieves the quest pickup filter settings
    associated with a specific bot identified by its GUID. This filter determines
    which quests can be picked up by the bot based on various criteria such as level
    requirements, faction restrictions, and quest flags. The method is typically used
    in AI scripting to control quest behavior for automated characters within the
    TrinityCore framework. It returns a QuestPickupFilter object that contains all
    relevant filtering parameters for quest pickup operations.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character for which to retrieve
      the quest pickup filter configuration
  returns: A QuestPickupFilter object containing the filtering criteria and settings
    for quest pickup operations for the specified bot. The filter may include parameters
    such as minimum/maximum level requirements, faction restrictions, quest flags,
    and other conditional logic that determines which quests are eligible for pickup
    by the bot.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 botGuid = 12345;

      QuestPickupFilter filter = questPickup->GetQuestPickupFilter(botGuid);

      // Use filter to determine which quests can be picked up by this bot'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Validation
    code: "uint32 botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nQuestPickupFilter filter\
      \ = questPickup->GetQuestPickupFilter(botGuid);\nif (filter.IsQuestAllowed(questId))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with quest pickup logic\n    player->AddQuest(questId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in bot AI implementations and quest management
    systems within TrinityCore. The returned filter object should be cached when possible
    to avoid repeated lookups for the same bot. The method assumes that the bot GUID
    corresponds to a valid character in the database, otherwise behavior may be undefined.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid is valid and corresponds to an existing
    bot character before calling this method. Invalid GUIDs may result in undefined
    behavior or memory access violations. This method should not be called from within
    critical sections where thread safety is required without proper synchronization.
