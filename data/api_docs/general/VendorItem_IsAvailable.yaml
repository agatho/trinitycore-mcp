  method: IsAvailable
  signature: bool VendorItem::IsAvailable() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a vendor item is currently available for purchase by a
    player.
  description: The IsAvailable method checks if a VendorItem is eligible for purchase
    by a player, considering factors such as item availability, player requirements,
    and vendor stock status. This method evaluates the internal state of the vendor
    item to determine if it can be bought at the current time. It typically accounts
    for item cooldowns, quest requirements, faction standing, and whether the item
    is in stock or has been sold out. The result indicates whether a player can successfully
    interact with this item through the vendor interface.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the vendor item is currently available for purchase, false
    otherwise. This indicates that all conditions for purchasing the item have been
    met and the item is not restricted or out of stock.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Vendor Item is Available
    code: "VendorItem* item = vendor->GetItem(12345);\nif (item && item->IsAvailable())\
      \ {\n    // Item can be purchased\n    player->AddItem(item->GetItemId(), item->GetItemCount());\n\
      } else {\n    // Item is not available\n    player->SendBuyError(BUY_ERR_ITEM_SOLD_OUT,\
      \ item, 0, 0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform checks against player faction, quest completion status,
    and item availability flags. It's commonly used in vendor interaction logic to
    determine what items should be displayed as purchasable to players.
