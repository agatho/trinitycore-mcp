  signature: float AOEZone::GetCurrentRadius(uint32 currentTime) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current radius of an area of effect zone at a
    given time.
  description: The GetCurrentRadius method computes the effective radius of an Area
    of Effect (AOE) zone at a specified point in time. This is typically used in spell
    or ability systems where AOE effects have dynamic radii that change over time,
    such as expanding circles or shrinking zones. The method takes into account the
    time elapsed since the AOE was initiated and applies any relevant scaling or animation
    curves to determine the current radius. It's commonly used for collision detection,
    visual rendering, and determining which targets are affected by the AOE at any
    given moment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the current radius of the AOE zone in
    world units (typically yards or meters). The value is always non-negative and
    represents the distance from the center point of the AOE to its outer boundary
    at the specified time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Spell Effect
    code: "float radius = aoeZone->GetCurrentRadius(getMSTime());\nif (radius > 0.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Use radius to determine affected targets\n    // Example: Check if\
      \ target is within AOE range\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Radius Calculation for Visual Effects
    code: "uint32 currentTime = getMSTime();\nfloat currentRadius = aoeZone->GetCurrentRadius(currentTime);\n\
      // Update visual effect to match current radius\nUpdateAOEVisualEffect(currentRadius);\n\
      // Check if AOE is still active\nif (currentRadius <= 0.0f)\n{\n    // Mark\
      \ AOE as expired\n    SetAOEExpired();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AOEZone has been properly initialized with start
    time, duration, and radius parameters. The calculation is typically performed
    using linear interpolation or other mathematical functions to smoothly transition
    between initial and final radii over the lifetime of the effect. The method should
    be called frequently during the AOE's active period for smooth animation.
  warnings: Ensure that the AOEZone object is valid and properly initialized before
    calling this method, as invalid state could lead to incorrect radius calculations
    or runtime errors. Be aware that calling this method with a time value that is
    earlier than the AOE's start time may produce unexpected results depending on
    implementation.
