documentation:
  brief: Removes a rewarded quest from the player's quest log.
  description: This method removes a rewarded quest from the player's quest log, effectively
    clearing the quest from their completed quests list. The method allows for optional
    updating of the quest log, which can be useful when performing bulk operations
    on quest data. It is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to manage quest progression and completion status within the game.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to remove from the player's rewarded
      quests list. This must be a valid quest ID that has been previously rewarded
      to the player.
  - name: update
    description: When set to true, the method will update the quest log and potentially
      trigger related updates in the client. When false, the removal is performed
      silently without triggering updates.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->RemoveRewardedQuest(12345, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Bulk removal example
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nfor (uint32 questId : questList)\n{\n    player->RemoveRewardedQuest(questId,\
      \ false);\n}\n// Perform update after all removals\nplayer->UpdateQuestStatus();"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method internally calls the QuestLog system to remove the quest from
    the rewarded list. It is important to note that this method does not affect the
    quest's status in the player's active quest log, only the rewarded quests. The
    method may be used in conjunction with UpdateQuestStatus() for proper synchronization
    of quest data.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it can affect quest progression
    and completion status. If used incorrectly, it may lead to inconsistent quest
    tracking or missing rewards. Also, if update is set to true, it may cause performance
    overhead due to client updates.
