  class: BotSpawner
  method: CanSpawnMore
  signature: bool BotSpawner::CanSpawnMore() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether additional bot units can be spawned by the spawner instance.
  description: The CanSpawnMore method evaluates the current state of the BotSpawner
    to determine if it is still capable of spawning new bot units. This check typically
    considers factors such as maximum spawn limits, available resources, or cooldown
    periods between spawns. The method returns true if more bots can be spawned according
    to configured rules and false otherwise. It is commonly used in bot management
    systems to prevent exceeding system constraints or to control bot population density
    within a given area or context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether additional bots can be spawned. Returns
    true if the spawner has not reached its limit or restrictions, and false if spawning
    is currently prohibited.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Management
    code: "if (spawner->CanSpawnMore()) {\n    // Spawn a new bot\n    spawner->SpawnBot();\n\
      } else {\n    // Log or handle the case where no more bots can be spawned\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Cannot spawn more bots at this time.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before attempting to spawn a new bot to avoid
    exceeding system limits or violating game balance rules. It may involve checking
    internal counters, resource availability, or configuration settings.
