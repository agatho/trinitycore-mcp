documentation:
  brief: Loads and processes game object override data from the database into memory
    for use during world initialization.
  description: The LoadGameObjectOverrides method initializes and loads all game object
    override configurations stored in the database into memory. This process typically
    occurs during server startup or world loading phases to ensure that custom game
    object behaviors, positions, or states are properly applied. It reads data from
    relevant database tables such as gameobject_override or similar structures and
    applies these overrides to existing game objects within the world. The method
    is crucial for maintaining customizations made through database entries rather
    than hardcoded values.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadCustomData()\n{\n    sObjectMgr->LoadGameObjectOverrides();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server startup sequence before the
    world is fully initialized. It may involve database queries and memory allocations,
    so performance impact should be considered in high-traffic environments. The method
    assumes that database connections are already established and functional.
  warnings: Calling this method after world initialization might lead to inconsistent
    object states or data races if not properly synchronized. Ensure all game objects
    are either fully loaded or locked before calling this method.
