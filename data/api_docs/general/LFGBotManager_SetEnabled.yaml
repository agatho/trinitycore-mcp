documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the LFG bot functionality within the LFGBotManager.
  description: The SetEnabled method controls whether the LFG (Looking for Group)
    bot system is active or inactive. When enabled, the bot will participate in group
    finding activities according to configured settings. When disabled, the bot will
    cease all LFG-related operations. This method directly affects the operational
    state of the LFGBotManager instance and can be used to toggle the bot's behavior
    during runtime. The change takes effect immediately without requiring a restart
    or reload of the system.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      the LFG bot functionality.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable LFG Bot
    code: 'LFGBotManager* manager = LFGBotManager::instance();

      manager->SetEnabled(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable LFG Bot
    code: 'LFGBotManager* manager = LFGBotManager::instance();

      manager->SetEnabled(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other manager methods to
    control the bot's lifecycle. The internal state of the LFGBotManager should be
    checked before calling this method if precise control over operational states
    is required.
