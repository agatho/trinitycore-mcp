  class: PlayerbotGroupManager

  signature: void PlayerbotGroupManager::BroadcastToGroup(uint32 groupId, const std::string
    & message, int type)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a message to all players in a specified group
  description: The BroadcastToGroup method sends a message to all members of a player
    group within the TrinityCore framework. This function is typically used by player
    bot systems to communicate with group members, allowing bots to relay information,
    commands, or status updates to their assigned groups. The method operates asynchronously
    and does not block execution while sending messages. It requires a valid group
    ID and message content to function properly.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: Unique identifier of the player group to broadcast the message to.
      Must correspond to an existing group in the game world.
  - name: message
    description: The text message to be sent to all group members. Should be a valid
      UTF-8 string with appropriate length constraints for in-game communication.
  - name: type
    description: Message type identifier that determines how the message is displayed
      or handled by clients. Common types include system messages, chat channels,
      or custom bot-specific formats.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic broadcast to group
    code: 'PlayerbotGroupManager* groupMgr = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetGroupManager();

      std::string msg = "Please gather around the objective";

      groupMgr->BroadcastToGroup(12345, msg, 0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Broadcast with custom message type
    code: 'PlayerbotGroupManager* groupMgr = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetGroupManager();

      std::string msg = "Enemy spotted at coordinates X:123 Y:456";

      groupMgr->BroadcastToGroup(54321, msg, 5); // Custom type for tactical alerts'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for use within the player bot AI system.
    It may not be suitable for general game client communication due to its specialized
    nature. The message delivery is asynchronous and does not guarantee immediate
    receipt by all group members. Ensure that the groupId parameter corresponds to
    a valid active group before calling this function.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid groupId may result in undefined behavior
    or silent failures. Avoid sending large messages as they might be truncated or
    cause performance issues. This method should only be called from within the context
    of player bot AI logic where group membership is guaranteed.
