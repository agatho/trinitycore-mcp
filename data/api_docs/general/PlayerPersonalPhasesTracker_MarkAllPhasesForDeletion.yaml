documentation:
  brief: Marks all personal phases for deletion in the player's phase tracker.
  description: The MarkAllPhasesForDeletion method schedules all currently active
    personal phases associated with a player for removal from the phase system. This
    typically occurs when a player's phase data needs to be reset or cleaned up, such
    as during character logout, zone changes, or phase transition events. The method
    does not immediately remove the phases but rather sets an internal flag or marker
    indicating that these phases should be deleted at the next appropriate cleanup
    cycle. This ensures that phase-related resources are properly managed and prevents
    memory leaks or stale phase data from persisting in the system.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->GetPhaseTracker()->MarkAllPhasesForDeletion();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    phase management operations. It's important to understand that marking phases
    for deletion does not immediately free memory or remove them from active systems;
    it simply flags them for future cleanup.
