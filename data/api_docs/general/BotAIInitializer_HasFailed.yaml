  method: HasFailed
  signature: bool BotAIInitializer::HasFailed() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot AI initialization process has failed.
  description: The HasFailed method determines if the initialization of a bot's AI
    system has encountered an error or failure. This method is typically used during
    the bot creation or loading phase to verify that all necessary components for
    the AI have been successfully set up. If the initialization fails, this method
    will return true, indicating that the bot may not function properly or at all.
    The check is usually performed after attempting to initialize the AI components
    and can be used to trigger fallback mechanisms or error handling routines.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot AI initialization has failed, false otherwise.
    A return value of true indicates that one or more required AI components did not
    initialize correctly, while false indicates successful initialization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (botAIInitializer.HasFailed()) {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Bot AI initialization failed for bot %u\", bot->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Creation
    code: "BotAIInitializer initializer(bot);\nif (!initializer.Initialize()) {\n\
      \    if (initializer.HasFailed()) {\n        // Log failure and cleanup\n  \
      \      sLog->outError(\"Failed to initialize AI for bot %u\", bot->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      \        return false;\n    }\n}\n// Proceed with normal bot operation"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called after the initialization process has been
    attempted. It's important to note that a failure check should be performed immediately
    after initialization attempts to prevent using an improperly initialized AI system.
    The method itself does not perform any initialization or cleanup operations, it
    only reports on the current state.
  warnings: Using this method without first attempting initialization may return incorrect
    results. Always ensure that initialization has been attempted before calling HasFailed().
    Additionally, if this method returns true, it's crucial to properly handle the
    failure case to avoid undefined behavior in the bot's operation.
