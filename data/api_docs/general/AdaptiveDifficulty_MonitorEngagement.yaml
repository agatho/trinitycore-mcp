  signature: void AdaptiveDifficulty::MonitorEngagement(Player * player, BotAI * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Monitors player and bot engagement levels to adjust difficulty dynamically
  description: The MonitorEngagement method tracks the interaction and activity levels
    between a player and their bot AI within the AdaptiveDifficulty system. It evaluates
    factors such as combat involvement, movement patterns, and response times to determine
    whether the difficulty should be increased or decreased. This method is typically
    called during gameplay sessions to ensure that the challenge remains appropriate
    for the player's skill level and engagement. The monitoring process helps maintain
    an optimal gaming experience by preventing situations where the difficulty becomes
    too easy or too hard based on player behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose engagement is being monitored.
      Must be a valid player instance with active gameplay state.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the BotAI object representing the AI companion. Must be
      a valid bot instance that is currently engaged with the player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic engagement monitoring call
    code: 'AdaptiveDifficulty* difficultySystem = AdaptiveDifficulty::Instance();

      Player* player = ...; // Valid player instance

      BotAI* bot = ...; // Valid bot AI instance


      difficultySystem->MonitorEngagement(player, bot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat event handling
    code: "void OnPlayerCombatStart(Player* player, Unit* target)\n{\n    BotAI* bot\
      \ = player->GetBot();\n    if (bot)\n    {\n        AdaptiveDifficulty::Instance()->MonitorEngagement(player,\
      \ bot);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking mechanisms that may be affected by
    network latency or AI decision-making delays. It should only be called when both
    player and bot are in valid gameplay states to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with null pointers for either player or bot will likely
    result in a crash or undefined behavior. Ensure proper validation before invoking
    the method.
