  class: FlightPathMovementGenerator
  method: SkipCurrentNode
  signature: void FlightPathMovementGenerator::SkipCurrentNode()
documentation:
  brief: Skips the current node in the flight path movement generator, advancing to
    the next waypoint in the sequence.
  description: The SkipCurrentNode method is used to immediately advance the flight
    path movement generator to the next node in the flight path sequence. This functionality
    is typically utilized when a player's flight path needs to be interrupted or modified
    mid-flight, such as during teleportation events, flight path changes, or when
    certain conditions are met that require skipping the current waypoint. The method
    updates the internal state of the movement generator to reflect the skipped node
    and prepares the next node for execution. It does not perform any validation on
    whether the skip is allowed; it simply advances the sequence.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Skipping Current Node in Flight Path
    code: "FlightPathMovementGenerator* flightGen = dynamic_cast<FlightPathMovementGenerator*>(unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator());\n\
      if (flightGen)\n{\n    flightGen->SkipCurrentNode();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly manipulates the internal state of the FlightPathMovementGenerator
    and should be used carefully to avoid unexpected behavior in movement sequences.
    It is typically called internally by the core movement system, but can also be
    invoked externally when specific flight path modifications are required.
  warnings: Calling SkipCurrentNode while the unit is not actively following a flight
    path may result in undefined behavior or movement inconsistencies. Ensure that
    the unit has an active flight path before invoking this method.
