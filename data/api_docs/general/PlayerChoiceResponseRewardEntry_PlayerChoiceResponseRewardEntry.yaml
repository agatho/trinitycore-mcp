  method: PlayerChoiceResponseRewardEntry
  signature: void PlayerChoiceResponseRewardEntry::PlayerChoiceResponseRewardEntry(uint32
    id, int32 quantity)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a PlayerChoiceResponseRewardEntry with the specified ID and quantity.
  description: The PlayerChoiceResponseRewardEntry constructor initializes a reward
    entry for a player choice response. This class represents a single reward that
    can be granted to a player when they make a selection in a player choice window.
    The ID parameter identifies the specific reward type (such as an item, currency,
    or spell), while the quantity specifies how much of that reward should be given.
    This constructor is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    processing player choice responses and is not usually called directly by external
    code.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier for the reward type. This could represent an
      item entry ID, currency ID, spell ID, or other reward type identifier depending
      on the context of the player choice.
  - name: quantity
    description: The amount or count of the reward to be given. For items, this represents
      the stack size; for currencies, it's the amount; for spells, it may represent
      the number of times the spell should be applied.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a basic reward entry
    code: PlayerChoiceResponseRewardEntry reward(12345, 10); // Reward 10 items with
      ID 12345
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a currency reward
    code: PlayerChoiceResponseRewardEntry currencyReward(123, 500); // Reward 500
      of currency ID 123
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the internal player choice system in TrinityCore.
    It's primarily used during the processing of player choice events and should not
    be invoked directly unless you're implementing custom player choice logic. The
    class likely stores these values for later application to the player upon choice
    confirmation.
