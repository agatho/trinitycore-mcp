  method: GetItemLevelOffsetItemLevel
  signature: uint32 ItemTemplate::GetItemLevelOffsetItemLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the adjusted item level based on the template's item
    level offset.
  description: The GetItemLevelOffsetItemLevel method computes the effective item
    level for an item by applying a specific offset value stored within the ItemTemplate.
    This offset is typically used in World of Warcraft to adjust item levels for items
    that are generated with a base level but need to be modified based on player level,
    quality, or other game mechanics. The returned value represents the final calculated
    item level after applying this adjustment. This method does not modify any internal
    state and is purely a getter function.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the adjusted item level after applying the
    offset from the ItemTemplate. This value reflects the effective level of the item
    in the game context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ItemTemplate* template = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);

      uint32 adjustedLevel = template->GetItemLevelOffsetItemLevel();

      printf("Adjusted Item Level: %u\n", adjustedLevel);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal data members of the ItemTemplate class that
    are populated during server startup or when item templates are loaded. It is safe
    to call from any thread as long as the ItemTemplate instance itself is not being
    modified concurrently.
  warnings: Ensure that the ItemTemplate object being queried is valid and properly
    initialized before calling this method, otherwise it may return unexpected or
    invalid values.
