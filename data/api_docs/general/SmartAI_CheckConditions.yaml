  brief: Evaluates and processes AI conditions for SmartAI-controlled creatures
  description: The CheckConditions method in SmartAI is responsible for evaluating
    all active AI conditions associated with a creature's smart scripts. It iterates
    through registered conditions and determines whether they are met based on current
    game state, player proximity, health levels, or other relevant factors. This method
    is typically called during the AI update cycle to ensure that conditional events
    are properly triggered when their criteria are satisfied. The method does not
    directly execute actions but rather assesses whether conditions are true, allowing
    the AI system to proceed with appropriate event handling.

  - title: Basic usage within AI update loop
    code: "void SmartAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n    \
      \    return;\n\n    CheckConditions(diff);\n    // Other AI logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called internally by the SmartAI framework during each AI
    update cycle. It's important to note that condition evaluation happens in a specific
    order and may affect performance if too many complex conditions are present. The
    method uses the provided diff parameter to handle time-based condition checks
    such as cooldowns or timed events.
