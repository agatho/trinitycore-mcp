  class: LootDistribution
  method: ApplyStrategyModifiers
  signature: void LootDistribution::ApplyStrategyModifiers(Player * player, const
    LootItem & item, LootRollType & decision)
documentation:
  brief: Applies loot distribution strategy modifiers to determine the final decision
    for a player's loot roll.
  description: The ApplyStrategyModifiers method evaluates and modifies the loot roll
    decision for a given player based on predefined distribution strategies. This
    method is typically invoked during the loot rolling process in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework, where it adjusts the outcome of a player's vote (e.g.,
    need, greed, pass) according to various game mechanics such as group composition,
    loot rules, and player roles. It modifies the LootRollType decision in-place,
    allowing for dynamic adjustments that reflect the current state of the loot distribution
    system.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose loot roll decision is being modified.
      Must be a valid player instance within the game world.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure representing the item for which
      the decision is being made. Contains information about the item's properties
      and distribution context.
  - name: decision
    description: Reference to a LootRollType variable that holds or will hold the
      final loot roll decision (Need, Greed, Pass, etc.). The method modifies this
      value in-place based on strategy rules.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in loot distribution
    code: "void HandleLootRoll(Player* player, LootItem const& item, LootRollType&\
      \ decision)\n{\n    LootDistribution ld;\n    ld.ApplyStrategyModifiers(player,\
      \ item, decision);\n    // decision is now modified according to strategy rules\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom loot rules
    code: "void CustomLootHandler(Player* player, LootItem const& item)\n{\n    LootRollType\
      \ decision = LOOT_ROLL_PASS;\n    LootDistribution ld;\n    ld.ApplyStrategyModifiers(player,\
      \ item, decision);\n    switch (decision)\n    {\n        case LOOT_ROLL_NEED:\n\
      \            // Handle need roll\n            break;\n        case LOOT_ROLL_GREED:\n\
      \            // Handle greed roll\n            break;\n        case LOOT_ROLL_PASS:\n\
      \            // Handle pass\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core loot distribution system and should only
    be called during active loot rolling events. It modifies the decision parameter
    directly, so callers must ensure that the input decision is initialized before
    calling this function.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to incorrect loot distribution behavior.
    Ensure that player and item parameters are valid and that the decision variable
    is properly initialized before passing it to the method.
