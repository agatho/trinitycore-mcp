  signature: uint16 InteractionData::AddPlayerChoiceResponse(uint32 responseId)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a player choice response to the interaction data and returns its index.
  description: The AddPlayerChoiceResponse method is used within the InteractionData
    class to register a new player choice response. It assigns a unique index to the
    response, which can be used later to reference or retrieve the specific choice
    made by the player. This method is typically invoked when processing interactive
    dialogues or quest choices in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework. The returned
    index allows for efficient tracking and management of multiple responses within
    a single interaction context.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint16 value representing the index at which the player choice
    response was added. This index can be used to later retrieve or reference the
    specific response in the interaction data structure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InteractionData data;

      uint16 responseIndex = data.AddPlayerChoiceResponse(12345);

      // responseIndex now holds the index where response ID 12345 was stored'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the interaction data structure maintains an internal
    list or container for storing player choice responses. The returned index is typically
    sequential and may be used as an array index for accessing stored responses.
