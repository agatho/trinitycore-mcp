  class: CorpsePreventionManager
  method: SetEnabled
  signature: void CorpsePreventionManager::SetEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the corpse prevention feature in the game world.
  description: The SetEnabled method controls whether the corpse prevention system
    is active within the TrinityCore server. When enabled, this system prevents players
    from leaving corpses behind upon death, which can be useful for preventing exploitation
    or maintaining specific gameplay mechanics. The method directly modifies an internal
    flag that governs the behavior of corpse handling during player deaths. This change
    takes effect immediately and affects all subsequent player deaths in the game
    world.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      the corpse prevention system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Corpse Prevention
    code: CorpsePreventionManager::instance().SetEnabled(true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Corpse Prevention
    code: CorpsePreventionManager::instance().SetEnabled(false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies a global system state that affects all players in the
    world. It should be used carefully during runtime, as changing this setting may
    have unexpected consequences for existing gameplay sessions.
  warnings: Changing the enabled state of corpse prevention during active gameplay
    may cause inconsistencies with existing player states or quest progress that relies
    on corpse behavior. Ensure proper synchronization with other systems before calling
    this method.
