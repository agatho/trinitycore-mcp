  class: Player
  method: GetDebugInfo
  signature: std::string Player::GetDebugInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns debug information about the player including character name, level,
    and realm.
  description: The GetDebugInfo method retrieves comprehensive debug information about
    a Player object, including essential details such as the player's character name,
    current level, and realm information. This method is primarily used for debugging
    purposes within the TrinityCore framework, providing developers with quick access
    to key player attributes without requiring additional database queries or complex
    operations. The returned string contains formatted information that can be useful
    for logging, monitoring, or troubleshooting scenarios in game development.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a std::string containing formatted debug information about the
    player including character name, level, and realm details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Info Usage
    code: 'Player* player = Player::GetPlayer("player_name");

      std::string debugInfo = player->GetDebugInfo();

      std::cout << debugInfo << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Debug Info for Logging
    code: 'Player* player = Player::GetPlayer("player_name");

      std::string debugInfo = player->GetDebugInfo();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("player", "Player Debug Info: %s", debugInfo.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for debugging purposes and may include performance
    implications if called frequently. The returned string format is consistent across
    all player instances, making it suitable for standard logging operations.
  warnings: The method should not be used in performance-critical code sections as
    it involves string formatting operations that could impact execution speed under
    high load conditions.
