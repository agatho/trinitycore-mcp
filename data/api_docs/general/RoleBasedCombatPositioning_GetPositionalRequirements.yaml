  class: RoleBasedCombatPositioning
  method: GetPositionalRequirements
  signature: PositionalRequirement RoleBasedCombatPositioning::GetPositionalRequirements(Player
    * bot, Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the positional requirements for a bot to effectively engage a
    target in combat based on role-based positioning logic.
  description: The GetPositionalRequirements method evaluates the current combat situation
    between a bot player and a target unit, determining what positional stance or
    orientation is required for optimal engagement. This method considers factors
    such as the bot's role (e.g., tank, healer, damage dealer), the target's threat
    level, and environmental constraints to return a PositionalRequirement structure
    that defines the necessary positioning behavior. The returned value typically
    indicates whether the bot should maintain a specific angle relative to the target,
    stay within certain distance ranges, or adopt particular combat stance behaviors.
    This functionality is essential for AI-driven bots to make intelligent positioning
    decisions during combat encounters in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A PositionalRequirement enum value that specifies the required positional
    behavior for effective combat engagement. Possible values may include FRONT, BACK,
    SIDE, DISTANCE_CLOSE, DISTANCE_MEDIUM, DISTANCE_FAR, or other role-specific positioning
    flags depending on the implementation details of the RoleBasedCombatPositioning
    system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nUnit* target = ...;\nPositionalRequirement req = bot->GetRoleBasedCombatPositioning()->GetPositionalRequirements(bot,\
      \ target);\nif (req == PositionalRequirement::BACK)\n{\n    // Move behind the\
      \ target for optimal positioning\n    bot->MoveToTargetBack(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during AI decision-making cycles when evaluating
    combat actions. It may cache or precompute results based on recent combat state
    changes to improve performance. The actual implementation details of how positional
    requirements are calculated depend heavily on the specific role-based combat system
    configuration and may vary between different bot AI modules.
  warnings: The method assumes valid Player and Unit pointers are provided; passing
    null pointers will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. The returned
    PositionalRequirement should be interpreted within the context of the current
    combat situation, as requirements can change rapidly during dynamic encounters.
