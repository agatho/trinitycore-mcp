documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the creature should not clear its threat list when evading.
  description: This method controls whether a creature will maintain its current threat
    list when it enters evade mode. When set to true, the creature will not clear
    its threat list upon evading, allowing it to retain its previous targets and potentially
    continue combat with those players who were previously attacking it. This is particularly
    useful for creatures that should remain in combat even after evading, such as
    bosses or special encounters where maintaining the threat list is critical for
    proper gameplay mechanics.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting creature to retain threat list during evading
    code: 'Creature* creature = GetCreature();

      creature->SetDontClearTapListOnEvade(true);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the creature's behavior during evading, which is a core
    mechanic in World of Warcraft. The implementation likely involves modifying internal
    flags or state variables that control how threat lists are handled when evading
    occurs.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it can affect combat mechanics
    and potentially lead to unexpected behavior if not properly understood. Improper
    use may cause creatures to remain in combat even when they should be evading.
