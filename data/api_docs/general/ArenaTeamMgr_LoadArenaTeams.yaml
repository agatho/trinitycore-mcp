  brief: Loads all arena teams from the database into memory for active use in the
    game world.
  description: The LoadArenaTeams method initializes and populates the internal data
    structures of the ArenaTeamMgr class with all existing arena teams stored in the
    database. This method is typically invoked during server startup or when arena
    team data needs to be refreshed. It retrieves team information including members,
    statistics, and roster details, ensuring that arena teams are ready for player
    participation in battlegrounds and competitive gameplay. The method performs necessary
    validation and error handling to ensure data integrity and consistency across
    the game world.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeArenaTeams()\n{\n    ArenaTeamMgr::Instance()->LoadArenaTeams();\n\
      \    // Arena teams are now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    a complete refresh of arena team data is required. It's not thread-safe and should
    be executed in the main game thread to prevent race conditions with other subsystems
    accessing arena team data.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate arena team entries. Ensure that any existing arena team
    data is properly cleared before invoking this method.
