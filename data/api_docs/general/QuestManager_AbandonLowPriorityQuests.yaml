documentation:
  brief: Abandons all low-priority quests from the player's active quest log.
  description: The QuestManager::AbandonLowPriorityQuests method removes all quests
    marked as low priority from the player's current quest log. This function is typically
    used during player logout, zone changes, or when the system needs to clean up
    inactive or less important quests to maintain optimal performance and quest management.
    The method iterates through the player's active quests and identifies those with
    a low priority flag, then removes them from the quest log. It does not affect
    high-priority or essential quests that are required for progression.

  warnings: Calling this method during active quest interactions or while processing
    quest events might lead to unexpected behavior or incomplete quest state updates.
