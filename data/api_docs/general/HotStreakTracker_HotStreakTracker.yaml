documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the HotStreakTracker class
  description: The HotStreakTracker constructor initializes a new instance of the
    HotStreakTracker class. This class is typically used to track hot streak effects
    in World of Warcraft spell systems, particularly for managing the state and duration
    of hot streak buffs that enhance spell damage or other effects. The constructor
    sets up internal tracking variables and initializes default values for the hot
    streak state, ensuring proper behavior when the tracker is first created and attached
    to a spell or aura.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new HotStreakTracker instance
    code: 'HotStreakTracker* tracker = new HotStreakTracker();

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track hot streak effects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when creating a new HotStreakTracker
    instance. It does not perform any validation or initialization of external dependencies,
    so it's expected that the tracker will be properly configured before being used
    in spell systems.
