  signature: float BotCharacterDistribution::GetClassPopularity(uint8 classId) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the popularity percentage of a specified class within the bot character
    distribution.
  description: The GetClassPopularity method retrieves the relative frequency or popularity
    of a given class among all bot characters in the distribution. This value represents
    how commonly a specific class appears compared to others, expressed as a floating-point
    percentage. The method is typically used for balancing AI behavior, ensuring diverse
    class representation, or analyzing bot character composition in game environments.
    It operates on internal class distribution data that may be updated dynamically
    during runtime. The returned value is normalized between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0
    indicates the class is not present and 1.0 indicates it's the only class represented.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the popularity of the specified class within
    the bot distribution. Values range from 0.0 (not present) to 1.0 (only this class).
    Returns 0.0 if the class ID is invalid or not found in the distribution.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve popularity of Warrior class
    code: 'float warriorPopularity = botDistribution->GetClassPopularity(CLASS_WARRIOR);

      // Returns a value between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating how common Warriors are among
      bots'
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if a class is well-represented
    code: "float roguePopularity = botDistribution->GetClassPopularity(CLASS_ROGUE);\n\
      if (roguePopularity > 0.2f)\n{\n    // Rogue bots are well represented\n   \
      \ // Proceed with AI logic that favors rogues\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the BotCharacterDistribution object has been properly
    initialized with valid class data. The internal distribution may be updated by
    other systems, so repeated calls might return different values over time. Class
    IDs should be validated against known constants (e.g., CLASS_WARRIOR, CLASS_MAGE)
    to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid class ID may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect results. Ensure that the class ID passed is valid and corresponds
    to a supported class in the game. The returned float values are not guaranteed
    to sum up to 1.0 across all classes if some classes have zero representation.
