documentation:
  brief: Handles incoming contact list request from client and sends player's social
    contacts
  description: This method processes the client's request for the player's contact
    list, including friends, ignored players, and blocked users. It retrieves the
    current state of the player's social interactions from the database and constructs
    a response packet containing all relevant contact information. The method ensures
    that only valid and active contacts are sent to the client, maintaining synchronization
    between the server and client social data. This is part of the World of Warcraft
    social system implementation within TrinityCore.

  - title: Basic contact list handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleContactListOpcode(WorldPackets::Social::SendContactList&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Process incoming contact list request\n    SendContactList();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on the player's social database entries being properly
    maintained. It should only be called when a valid session exists and the player
    is authenticated. Performance considerations include database queries for contact
    data retrieval which may impact server performance with many contacts.
  warnings: This method assumes the player has proper authentication and session state.
    Improper handling could lead to synchronization issues between client and server
    social data, potentially causing display inconsistencies in the player's contact
    list.
