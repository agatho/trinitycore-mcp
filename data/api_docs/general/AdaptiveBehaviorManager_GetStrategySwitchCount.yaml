  method: GetStrategySwitchCount
  signature: uint32 AdaptiveBehaviorManager::GetStrategySwitchCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of strategy switches performed by the adaptive behavior
    manager.
  description: The GetStrategySwitchCount method retrieves the cumulative count of
    strategy switches that have been executed by the AdaptiveBehaviorManager instance.
    This counter tracks how many times the AI behavior has changed strategies during
    the lifetime of the manager. The value is typically incremented each time a new
    strategy is selected or activated, allowing developers to monitor and analyze
    AI decision-making patterns. This method is useful for debugging AI behavior,
    measuring strategy adaptability, and tracking performance metrics related to adaptive
    decision-making processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of strategy switches that
    have occurred since the manager was initialized or last reset. Returns zero if
    no switches have been performed yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor AI Behavior
    code: "AdaptiveBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = player->GetAI()->GetAdaptiveBehaviorManager();\n\
      uint32 switchCount = behaviorManager->GetStrategySwitchCount();\nif (switchCount\
      \ > 10)\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"Player AI has switched strategies %u times\"\
      , switchCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Strategy Switches for Performance Analysis
    code: "void AnalyzeAIPerformance(Player* player)\n{\n    AdaptiveBehaviorManager*\
      \ manager = player->GetAI()->GetAdaptiveBehaviorManager();\n    uint32 switches\
      \ = manager->GetStrategySwitchCount();\n    \n    if (switches > 0)\n    {\n\
      \        float averageSwitchesPerMinute = switches / (player->GetMap()->GetWorldTickTime()\
      \ / 60.0f);\n        sLog->outString(\"Average strategy switches per minute:\
      \ %.2f\", averageSwitchesPerMinute);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other adaptive AI metrics
    to provide comprehensive behavior analysis. The counter may be reset under certain
    conditions, such as when a new combat encounter begins or when the AI system is
    reinitialized. The value returned represents a monotonically increasing count
    and does not account for any strategy switch resets or resets that might occur
    during runtime.
  warnings: Be aware that this counter may not persist across server restarts or AI
    system resets, so it should be used primarily for runtime monitoring rather than
    long-term tracking. Additionally, frequent strategy switching might indicate suboptimal
    AI behavior or aggressive enemy tactics that could impact performance.
