  class: BotResourcePool
  method: SetMaxPoolSize
  signature: void BotResourcePool::SetMaxPoolSize(uint32 maxSize)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum size of the bot resource pool to control resource allocation
    limits.
  description: The SetMaxPoolSize method configures the upper limit for the number
    of resources that can be allocated within a bot resource pool. This method is
    typically used to manage memory or computational resources in a controlled manner,
    preventing excessive consumption by bot systems. The maximum pool size directly
    affects how many concurrent operations or objects can be active within the pool.
    This setting is crucial for maintaining system stability and performance when
    managing multiple bots with varying resource requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: maxSize
    description: The new maximum number of resources allowed in the pool. Must be
      a positive integer value representing the upper bound of resource allocation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotResourcePool pool;

      pool.SetMaxPoolSize(100); // Sets maximum pool size to 100 resources'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Pool Size Adjustment
    code: "void AdjustBotPoolSize(uint32 newLimit) {\n    BotResourcePool* botPool\
      \ = GetBotResourcePool();\n    if (botPool) {\n        botPool->SetMaxPoolSize(newLimit);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not immediately affect existing resources in the pool; it
    only sets a new limit for future allocations. If the current pool size exceeds
    the new maximum, existing resources remain active until they are freed or replaced.
  warnings: Setting the maximum pool size too low may cause resource exhaustion errors
    when bots attempt to allocate more resources than allowed. Ensure that the new
    size is sufficient for expected bot operations.
