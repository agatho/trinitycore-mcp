  method: SkillStatusData
  signature: void SkillStatusData::SkillStatusData(uint8 _pos, SkillUpdateState _uState)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a SkillStatusData object with the specified skill position and
    update state.
  description: The SkillStatusData constructor initializes a skill status data structure
    with the given position and update state. This method is typically used within
    the TrinityCore framework to manage player skill states, particularly in relation
    to skill updates sent to clients. The position parameter indicates where the skill
    is stored (e.g., in a player's skill list), while the update state defines how
    the skill should be handled during synchronization with the client. This constructor
    is part of the internal skill management system and is not directly called by
    external code but rather used by the core systems when processing skill-related
    events.
  parameters:
  - name: _pos
    description: The position index of the skill within the player's skill list. Valid
      values are typically 0 to the maximum number of skills supported by the client,
      with each position representing a specific skill slot.
  - name: _uState
    description: The update state indicating how the skill should be handled during
      synchronization. This value determines whether the skill is newly added, modified,
      or removed from the client's view.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initializing SkillStatusData for a new skill
    code: SkillStatusData skillData(5, SkillUpdateState::New);
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating SkillStatusData for an updated skill
    code: SkillStatusData skillData(12, SkillUpdateState::Changed);
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the internal skill management system in TrinityCore
    and should not be directly invoked by custom modules or addons. It's used primarily
    by the core systems when processing skill updates and synchronization events.
