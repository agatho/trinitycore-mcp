  signature: bool SpellInfo::HasHitDelay() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell has a hit delay component.
  description: This method checks if a spell possesses a hit delay, which is a timing
    component that affects when the spell's effects occur after casting. In World
    of Warcraft, many spells have a delay between the cast time and the actual execution
    of the spell's effects. This method returns true if the spell has such a delay,
    false otherwise. The hit delay is typically used for spells that require a brief
    waiting period before their effects are applied to targets, such as certain damage-dealing
    spells or healing spells.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell has a hit delay component, false otherwise. This
    indicates that the spell's effects will occur after a specified delay following
    the cast completion.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spellInfo->HasHitDelay()) {\n    // Spell has hit delay, process accordingly\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    to determine the timing and execution of spells. It is important to note that
    this method does not directly affect the spell's cast time but rather indicates
    whether there is a delay between casting and effect application.
