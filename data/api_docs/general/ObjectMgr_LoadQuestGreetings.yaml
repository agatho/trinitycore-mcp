  method: LoadQuestGreetings
  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadQuestGreetings()
documentation:
  brief: Loads quest greeting messages from the database for all game objects and
    NPCs that have associated quest interactions.
  description: The LoadQuestGreetings method initializes and populates internal data
    structures with quest greeting entries stored in the database. These greetings
    are typically displayed to players when they interact with specific game objects
    or NPCs that have quests assigned to them. The method iterates through the relevant
    database tables, retrieves quest greeting data, and stores it within the ObjectMgr
    singleton for quick access during player interactions. This process is essential
    for proper quest progression and user experience in World of Warcraft-style gameplay.
    The method should only be called once during server initialization or database
    reload operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during server startup
    code: "void InitializeServer()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n    ObjectMgr::instance()->LoadQuestGreetings();\n\
      \    // Continue with other initialization...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server startup or database reload
    operations. It's important to note that this method modifies internal object manager
    state and should not be called concurrently with other methods that access quest
    data. The method relies on proper database connection and table structure to function
    correctly.
  warnings: Calling this method after the server has started processing player interactions
    may lead to inconsistent quest greeting behavior. Additionally, if database tables
    are missing or improperly structured, this method will fail silently or cause
    runtime errors.
