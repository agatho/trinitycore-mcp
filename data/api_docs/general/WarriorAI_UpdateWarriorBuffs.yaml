  signature: void WarriorAI::UpdateWarriorBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the warrior's buffs and aura states based on current combat conditions
    and spell availability.
  description: The UpdateWarriorBuffs method is responsible for managing the buff
    states of a warrior AI character. It evaluates the current combat situation, checks
    for available warrior-specific abilities, and applies or removes relevant buffs
    such as Battle Shout, Demoralizing Shout, and other combat-affecting auras. This
    method ensures that the warrior maintains optimal buff status during battle by
    dynamically adjusting to changing conditions like target health, distance, and
    cooldowns. The function typically runs during each AI update cycle to keep the
    warrior's buff state current with game mechanics.
  parameters: []

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    UpdateWarriorBuffs();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the main AI update loop and should
    not be invoked manually unless specifically required for custom behavior. The
    implementation may vary depending on the specific warrior subclass (Arms, Fury,
    Protection) as different specs have different buff priorities and logic.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the AI update context as it relies
    on current combat state and may cause undefined behavior if called when the warrior
    is not in a valid combat state. The method assumes that the warrior's target and
    spell availability are properly initialized.
