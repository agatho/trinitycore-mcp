  class: BotLevelManager
  method: SelectZone
  signature: void BotLevelManager::SelectZone(BotCreationTask * task)
documentation:
  brief: Selects an appropriate zone for bot creation based on the provided task's
    parameters and current server conditions.
  description: The SelectZone method determines the most suitable game zone for creating
    a new bot character by evaluating the BotCreationTask's requirements, including
    level range, faction, and player population data. It considers server load, zone
    availability, and optimal gameplay balance to assign a zone that ensures the bot
    will have an appropriate experience. This method is typically invoked during the
    bot creation process before spawning the actual bot entity in the world. The selection
    logic may take into account existing player distribution across zones to prevent
    overcrowding in popular areas.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Zone Selection
    code: 'BotCreationTask* task = new BotCreationTask();

      task->SetLevelRange(10, 20);

      task->SetFaction(FACTION_ALLIANCE);

      BotLevelManager manager;

      manager.SelectZone(task);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal zone management systems and may
    cache zone selections for performance. It assumes that the BotCreationTask has
    been properly initialized with valid parameters before calling.
  warnings: Calling this method without properly setting up the BotCreationTask's
    parameters may result in invalid or inappropriate zone selection. The method should
    only be called during bot creation workflows, not after a bot has already been
    spawned.
