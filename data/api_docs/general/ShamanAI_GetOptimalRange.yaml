  class: ShamanAI
  method: GetOptimalRange
  signature: float ShamanAI::GetOptimalRange(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal attack range for the shaman's current
    spell or ability.
  description: The GetOptimalRange method determines the ideal distance at which a
    shaman should position themselves to effectively use their current spell or ability.
    This calculation takes into account the shaman's current target, the type of spell
    being cast (such as healing or damage), and the specific mechanics of that spell.
    The returned float value represents the distance in yards. This method is crucial
    for AI behavior in determining when a shaman should move closer to or farther
    from their target during combat. It considers both offensive and defensive spell
    ranges, ensuring optimal positioning for maximum effectiveness.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the optimal range in yards. This value indicates
    the ideal distance from the current target at which the shaman should position
    themselves for effective spell casting.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine optimal range
    code: "float optimalRange = shamanAI->GetOptimalRange();\nif (shamanAI->GetRangeToTarget()\
      \ > optimalRange)\n{\n    // Move closer to target\n    shamanAI->Move closer\
      \ to target;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal state information about the current spell
    being cast and target position. It may dynamically adjust based on the shaman's
    current spell selection and target type. The implementation probably accounts
    for different spell types (healing vs damage) which have different optimal ranges.
  warnings: The method assumes a valid target exists in the AI context. If no target
    is set, the behavior may be undefined or return an invalid range value. This method
    should only be called when the shaman AI has an active target and spell selection.
