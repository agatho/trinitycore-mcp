  method: GetTotalProcessed
  signature: size_t AsyncBotInitializer::GetTotalProcessed() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of processed bot initialization tasks.
  description: The GetTotalProcessed method retrieves the cumulative count of successfully
    completed bot initialization operations. This value represents how many individual
    bot setup processes have been finalized within the asynchronous initialization
    system. The method is typically used to monitor progress or determine when all
    background bot initialization tasks have completed. It provides a thread-safe
    way to query the current state of the async initialization process without modifying
    internal counters.
  parameters: []
  returns: A size_t value representing the total number of processed bot initialization
    tasks that have been completed successfully.
  examples:
  - title: Monitor Bot Initialization Progress
    code: 'AsyncBotInitializer initializer;

      // ... initialize bots ...

      size_t processed = initializer.GetTotalProcessed();

      std::cout << "Processed " << processed << " bot initializations" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Completion Status
    code: "AsyncBotInitializer initializer;\n// ... start async initialization ...\n\
      while (initializer.GetTotalProcessed() < totalBots) {\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));\n\
      }\nstd::cout << \"All bots initialized\" << std::endl;"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not block execution.
    The returned value is cumulative and only increases as tasks complete successfully.
    It's recommended to use this method for progress tracking rather than as a synchronization
    primitive.
