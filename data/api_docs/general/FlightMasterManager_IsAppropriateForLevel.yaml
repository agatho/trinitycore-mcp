  signature: bool FlightMasterManager::IsAppropriateForLevel(const TaxiNodesEntry
    * nodeEntry) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines if a taxi node is appropriate for the player's current level
  description: This method evaluates whether a given taxi node entry is suitable for
    the player's current level. It checks if the player's level meets or exceeds the
    minimum level requirement specified in the taxi node entry. This is used by the
    Flight Master system to filter out taxi nodes that are not accessible to the player
    based on their character level. The method typically gets called when displaying
    available flight paths to a player to ensure only appropriate routes are shown.
  parameters:
  - name: nodeEntry
    description: Pointer to the TaxiNodesEntry structure containing the taxi node
      data to evaluate for level appropriateness
  returns: Returns true if the player's level is sufficient for the taxi node, false
    otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a taxi node is appropriate for current player level
    code: "const TaxiNodesEntry* node = sTaxiNodesStore.LookupEntry(1234);\nbool isAppropriate\
      \ = flightMasterManager.IsAppropriateForLevel(node);\nif (isAppropriate)\n{\n\
      \    // Node is accessible to current player\n    printf(\"Node is available\
      \ for current level\\n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Node requires higher level\n\
      \    printf(\"Node requires higher level to access\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses the player's current level through internal state
    management. It may cache results or perform quick lookups against the player's
    character data. The implementation assumes that TaxiNodesEntry contains a minimum
    level requirement field.
  warnings: Ensure that nodeEntry is not null before calling this method, as dereferencing
    a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. This method should only be called
    in contexts where player level and taxi node data are valid.
