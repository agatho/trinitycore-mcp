  signature: uint32 PvPCombatAI::GetCCSpellId(int * player, CCType ccType) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell ID of a crowd control effect applied to a player.
  description: The GetCCSpellId method is used within the PvPCombatAI class to determine
    which specific crowd control spell is currently affecting a player. This method
    takes a pointer to a player object and a CCType enumeration indicating the type
    of crowd control being queried. It returns the unique identifier (spell ID) associated
    with that particular crowd control effect. The method is typically invoked during
    PvP encounters to track and manage active debuffs on opponents.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the player object for which the crowd control spell
      ID is being retrieved. This parameter must not be null.
  - name: ccType
    description: An enumeration value specifying the type of crowd control effect
      being queried. Valid values are typically defined in the CCType enum, such as
      CC_STUN, CC_ROOT, CC_SILENCE, etc.
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the spell ID of the crowd control effect
    currently applied to the player. If no matching crowd control effect is found,
    it may return 0 or an invalid spell ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* target = ...; // Get a reference to a player\nuint32 ccSpellId\
      \ = ai->GetCCSpellId(target, CC_STUN);\nif (ccSpellId != 0)\n{\n    // Process\
      \ the stun spell\n    sLog->outString(\"Target is stunned by spell ID: %u\"\
      , ccSpellId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple CC Types
    code: "Player* target = ...;\nfor (int i = 0; i < MAX_CCTYPE; ++i)\n{\n    CCType\
      \ type = static_cast<CCType>(i);\n    uint32 spellId = ai->GetCCSpellId(target,\
      \ type);\n    if (spellId != 0)\n    {\n        sLog->outString(\"Found %s spell\
      \ ID: %u\", GetCCTypeName(type), spellId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PvP combat AI system and relies on internal tracking
    of active crowd control effects. It assumes that the player object passed in has
    been properly initialized with current debuff information. The CCType enumeration
    should match the expected values used by the game's spell system.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer may lead to undefined behavior. Also note that this method
    only returns spell IDs for active crowd control effects; it does not provide information
    about inactive or expired debuffs.
