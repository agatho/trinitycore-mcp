api:
  class: SpatialGridQueryHelpers
  method: FindGroupMembersInRange
  signature: int SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindGroupMembersInRange(Player * bot, float
    range)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the number of group members within a specified range of
    the given player.
  description: The FindGroupMembersInRange method searches for all members of the
    player's group who are within a defined radius. It iterates through the group
    members and checks their distance from the provided player using spatial grid
    queries. This function is commonly used in AI scripts or quest logic to determine
    nearby group members for cooperative actions, such as summoning allies or triggering
    group-based events. The method relies on the TrinityCore's spatial grid system
    to efficiently query nearby objects without iterating through all players in the
    world.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which to find group members within
      range.
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance (in yards) within which to search for group
      members.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of group members found within
    the specified range. Returns 0 if no group members are found or if the player
    is not in a group.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to count nearby group members
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume initialized\nint count = SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindGroupMembersInRange(bot,\
      \ 30.0f);\nif (count > 0)\n{\n    // Perform action based on number of nearby\
      \ group members\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using result to trigger group-based behavior
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nfloat range = 25.0f;\nint memberCount = SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindGroupMembersInRange(bot,\
      \ range);\nif (memberCount >= 2)\n{\n    // Trigger a group ability or event\n\
      \    bot->CastSpell(bot, 12345, true); // Example spell cast\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses the spatial grid system for efficient querying of nearby
    players. It is recommended to use reasonable range values to avoid performance
    degradation. The method assumes that the player is part of a group; otherwise,
    it will return zero without error.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'bot' parameter is a valid Player pointer and not null.
    If the player is not in a group, the function returns 0 but does not throw an
    exception or log an error.
