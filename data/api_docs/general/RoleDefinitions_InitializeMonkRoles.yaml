documentation:
  brief: Initializes role definitions for Monk class specializations in the TrinityCore
    framework.
  description: The InitializeMonkRoles method sets up and registers all available
    role definitions specific to the Monk class within the TrinityCore server environment.
    This includes defining roles such as Tank, Healer, and Damage Dealer for Monks,
    which are used by the AI system to determine appropriate behavior and decision-making
    patterns for Monk NPCs or players in various combat scenarios. The method is typically
    called during server initialization or when loading role configurations for class-specific
    behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: RoleDefinitions::InitializeMonkRoles();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server startup to avoid duplicate
    role registrations. The method relies on internal TrinityCore role management
    systems and assumes that the Monk class data has already been loaded into memory.
