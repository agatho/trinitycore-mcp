  method: SetPositionManager
  signature: void RoleBasedCombatPositioning::SetPositionManager(PositionManager *
    mgr)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the PositionManager instance for role-based combat positioning.
  description: The SetPositionManager method assigns a PositionManager object to the
    RoleBasedCombatPositioning class, enabling it to utilize position management functionality
    for coordinating player or NPC placements during combat scenarios. This method
    is typically called during initialization or configuration phases when establishing
    the positional behavior for role-based combat systems within TrinityCore. The
    assigned manager handles positioning logic such as maintaining proper distances
    between units, managing flanking positions, and ensuring strategic placement based
    on roles like tank, healer, or damage dealer.
  parameters:
  - name: mgr
    description: Pointer to a PositionManager instance that will be used for managing
      combat positioning. Must not be null; passing a null pointer may result in undefined
      behavior or crashes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'RoleBasedCombatPositioning* positioning = new RoleBasedCombatPositioning();

      PositionManager* manager = new PositionManager();

      positioning->SetPositionManager(manager);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Existing Manager
    code: "class MyCombatSystem {\npublic:\n    void InitializePositioning() {\n \
      \       RoleBasedCombatPositioning* rbcp = GetRoleBasedPositioning();\n    \
      \    PositionManager* existingManager = GetPositionManager();\n        rbcp->SetPositionManager(existingManager);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation on the input pointer. It is the
    caller's responsibility to ensure that the PositionManager instance passed is
    valid and properly initialized before calling this method. The RoleBasedCombatPositioning
    class assumes ownership of the manager pointer, so it should not be deleted elsewhere
    in the code unless explicitly handled.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method will likely cause a crash or undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the PositionManager object is fully constructed and valid
    before assignment. Also, avoid calling this method multiple times on the same
    RoleBasedCombatPositioning instance without proper cleanup of previous managers.
