  class: PetAI
  method: Permissible
  signature: int PetAI::Permissible(const Creature * creature)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether this PetAI instance can be assigned to a given creature.
  description: The Permissible method is used in TrinityCore's AI system to evaluate
    if a specific PetAI implementation is suitable for handling a particular creature.
    This method is part of the AI permissible system which allows the game to dynamically
    assign appropriate AI behaviors based on creature types and properties. It returns
    an integer value indicating the level of permissibility, where higher values indicate
    stronger suitability. The method typically checks creature type, flags, and other
    attributes to determine if this PetAI should be used for the given creature.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to the Creature object being evaluated for AI assignment.
      This parameter represents the specific creature instance that the AI system
      is attempting to assign a PetAI to.
  returns: 'Returns an integer value indicating the permissibility level:

    - Negative values indicate the AI should not be used

    - Zero indicates the AI can be used but with low priority

    - Positive values indicate strong suitability for use

    - The exact meaning of positive values may depend on implementation details in
    the AI system'
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI assignment logic
    code: "int permissible = petAI->Permissible(creature);\nif (permissible > 0) {\n\
      \    // Assign this PetAI to the creature\n    creature->SetAI(petAI);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking AI suitability before assignment
    code: "class MyPetAI : public PetAI {\npublic:\n    int Permissible(const Creature*\
      \ creature) override {\n        if (creature && creature->IsPet())\n       \
      \     return PERMIT_BASE_MAYBE + 10; // Strong preference for pets\n       \
      \ return PERMIT_BASE_NO;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI assignment and initialization phases.
    The return value is used by the core AI system to determine which AI implementation
    should be assigned to a creature. It's important to note that this method is part
    of a larger permissible system where multiple AI implementations may be evaluated
    for the same creature, and the highest permissible value wins.
  warnings: The Permissible method should not perform heavy computations or operations
    that might affect performance. It's meant to be a quick evaluation function. Also,
    ensure that the returned values follow the established conventions (negative =
    no, zero = maybe, positive = yes) to maintain consistency with the AI system.
