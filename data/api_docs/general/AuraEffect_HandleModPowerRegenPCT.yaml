    uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the percentage of power regeneration for a player or creature
  description: The HandleModPowerRegenPCT method is responsible for adjusting the
    rate at which a unit's power (such as mana, rage, or energy) regenerates. This
    method is typically invoked when an aura effect that modifies power regeneration
    is applied or removed from a unit. It directly influences the regeneration rate
    by a specified percentage, allowing for buffs or debuffs that increase or decrease
    how quickly power restores over time. The implementation handles both application
    and removal of the effect based on the 'apply' parameter.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. This contains context about the aura's state, target, and
      other relevant data.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation for the aura effect, typically indicating whether
      it is being applied (1) or removed (0). This value may influence how the power
      regeneration modification is calculated or applied.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the effect should be applied (true) or
      removed (false). When true, the percentage change in power regeneration is added
      to the unit's current rate; when false, it is subtracted.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying a Power Regen Buff
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication app;

      uint8 mode = 1;

      bool apply = true;

      effect->HandleModPowerRegenPCT(&app, mode, apply);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing a Power Regen Debuff
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication app;

      uint8 mode = 0;

      bool apply = false;

      effect->HandleModPowerRegenPCT(&app, mode, apply);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore aura system and is intended to be
    used internally by the engine when applying or removing aura effects. It modifies
    the unit's power regeneration rate directly through internal calculations involving
    the aura's modifier value.
