documentation:
  brief: Moves the contents of another LootTemplate object to this instance, leaving
    the source in a valid but unspecified state.
  description: The move assignment operator for LootTemplate transfers all internal
    data members from the source LootTemplate object to the current object. This operation
    is typically used to efficiently transfer ownership of resources without performing
    deep copies. After the move, the source object will be left in a valid state,
    though its contents are unspecified and should not be relied upon. In the context
    of TrinityCore's loot system, this operator allows for efficient management of
    loot templates during runtime when templates need to be reassigned or swapped
    between different loot containers or systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current LootTemplate object, allowing for chaining of
    assignment operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'LootTemplate template1;

      LootTemplate template2 = std::move(template1); // Moves contents from template1
      to template2

      // template1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Move Assignments
    code: 'LootTemplate t1, t2, t3;

      t3 = std::move(t2) = std::move(t1); // Chained move assignments

      // t1 and t2 are left in valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is part of the C++ move semantics implementation. It's designed
    to be efficient by transferring ownership rather than copying data. The moved-from
    object remains valid but its contents are undefined after the operation.
  warnings: After calling this operator, never use the source object in any way that
    depends on its previous state. The contents of the moved-from object are unspecified
    and may cause undefined behavior if accessed.
