documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of items that provide a specific temporary appearance.
  description: The GetItemsProvidingTemporaryAppearance method queries the collection
    manager to determine how many items in the player's inventory or collection are
    associated with a given temporary appearance ID. This is commonly used in World
    of Warcraft's UI systems to display how many items can be used to apply a particular
    visual effect, such as a cosmetic transformation or appearance override. The method
    does not modify any state and is typically called during UI updates or appearance-related
    logic processing. It relies on internal data structures that map item modified
    appearance IDs to item entries.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of items in the player's collection
    that provide the specified temporary appearance. Returns zero if no items are
    found with the given appearance ID.
  examples:
  - title: Check for Items Providing Temporary Appearance
    code: "uint32 appearanceId = 12345;\nint itemCount = sCollectionMgr->GetItemsProvidingTemporaryAppearance(appearanceId);\n\
      if (itemCount > 0)\n{\n    // Display UI element indicating that items exist\
      \ providing this appearance\n    sLog->outString(\"Found %d items providing\
      \ temporary appearance %u\", itemCount, appearanceId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely optimized for frequent calls in UI rendering contexts.
    It may cache results or use fast lookup tables internally to improve performance
    when dealing with large collections of items and appearances.
