documentation:
  brief: Clears all world effects from the unit.
  description: The ClearWorldEffects method removes all active world effects (such
    as aura applications, periodic effects, and other game mechanics) from the target
    unit. This method is typically used during unit cleanup or when removing effects
    that would otherwise interfere with gameplay mechanics. It ensures that no lingering
    world effects remain on the unit after the operation.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* target = GetUnit();\n target->ClearWorldEffects();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by TrinityCore's core system to
    ensure clean state management during unit destruction or when removing effects
    that would otherwise persist. It should be used carefully as it may affect gameplay
    mechanics if not handled properly.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior in game mechanics,
    especially when dealing with active effects that are meant to persist through
    certain events or conditions.
