documentation:
  brief: Sets the social status of all players to friendly for this player.
  description: The SetFriendlyToAll method configures the social behavior of a player
    within the TrinityCore framework, specifically enabling or disabling the automatic
    friendly status towards all other players in the game. This functionality affects
    how the player's social list is populated and can influence interactions such
    as group invitations, guild communications, and general player-to-player visibility.
    When enabled, the player will have a friendly relationship with all other players,
    which may impact certain gameplay mechanics like faction-based interactions or
    social features that rely on player relationships.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      friendly status towards all players. When true, the player will be marked as
      friendly to all other players in the social system.
  returns: null
  examples:

  - title: Disable Friendly Status for All Players
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();

  notes: This method modifies the internal social state of a player and may trigger
    updates to the player's social list. It is typically used in scenarios where a
    player's social behavior needs to be temporarily altered, such as during certain
    quest events or game mode changes. The change takes effect immediately for the
    current session.
