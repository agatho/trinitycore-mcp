  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: OptimizePath
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::OptimizePath(int & path)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the movement path for a follower unit to efficiently follow its
    leader.
  description: The OptimizePath method adjusts the current movement path of a follower
    unit to ensure it follows its leader in the most efficient manner possible. This
    typically involves recalculating waypoints or adjusting the follower's trajectory
    to minimize deviation from the intended path while maintaining appropriate distance
    and formation. The method is commonly used in AI behavior systems where units
    must dynamically adapt their movement based on leader position changes or environmental
    obstacles. It modifies the internal path data structure of the follower unit,
    ensuring smooth and realistic group movement mechanics.

  - title: Basic Path Optimization Call
    code: 'LeaderFollowBehavior behavior;

      int currentPath = 0;

      behavior.OptimizePath(currentPath);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles when the leader's
    position has changed significantly. The path optimization process may involve
    pathfinding algorithms to determine the most efficient route while considering
    obstacles and group cohesion requirements.
  warnings: The method modifies the internal path data directly, so calling it without
    proper synchronization in multi-threaded environments may lead to race conditions
    or unexpected behavior. Ensure that path data is not being accessed concurrently
    by other threads during optimization.
