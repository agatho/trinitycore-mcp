  class: RoleBasedCombatPositioning
  method: GenerateCandidatePositions
  signature: int RoleBasedCombatPositioning::GenerateCandidatePositions(Player * bot,
    const CombatPositionContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a list of candidate combat positions for a bot based on role and
    context.
  description: The GenerateCandidatePositions method calculates and returns a set
    of viable positioning options for a player bot within the context of combat. It
    evaluates the bot's role, current combat state, and environmental factors to determine
    optimal positioning strategies. This method is typically used in AI-driven gameplay
    systems where strategic positioning can significantly impact combat effectiveness.
    The returned integer indicates the number of valid candidate positions generated,
    with zero or negative values suggesting failure or no applicable positions.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which candidate
      positions are being generated.
  - name: context
    description: Reference to a CombatPositionContext structure containing relevant
      combat state and environmental data used for position calculation.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of valid candidate positions
    generated. A positive value indicates successful generation, zero means no applicable
    positions were found, and negative values may indicate errors or invalid input
    parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "CombatPositionContext context;\ncontext.target = targetPlayer;\ncontext.isInCombat\
      \ = true;\nint count = roleBasedCombat->GenerateCandidatePositions(botPlayer,\
      \ context);\nif (count > 0)\n{\n    // Process candidate positions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Position Validation
    code: "CombatPositionContext context;\ncontext.target = targetPlayer;\ncontext.isInCombat\
      \ = true;\ncontext.formationType = FORMATION_CIRCLE;\nint count = roleBasedCombat->GenerateCandidatePositions(botPlayer,\
      \ context);\nif (count > 0)\n{\n    // Iterate through generated positions and\
      \ validate against current game state\n    for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i)\n\
      \    {\n        Position pos = candidatePositions[i];\n        if (IsPositionValid(pos))\n\
      \        {\n            // Use this position for bot movement\n        }\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the bot's current role and combat context to determine
    positioning strategies. It may perform complex calculations involving distance,
    angle, threat assessment, and environmental obstacles. The generated positions
    are typically used in conjunction with pathfinding algorithms to execute optimal
    movement during combat.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Invalid or uninitialized CombatPositionContext data can lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect positioning decisions. This method should only be called
    when the bot is in a valid combat state.
