  method: PopulateQuestMetadata
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::PopulateQuestMetadata(uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Populates metadata for a specified quest ID within the dynamic quest system.
  description: The PopulateQuestMetadata method initializes and loads all relevant
    metadata associated with a given quest ID into the dynamic quest system's internal
    data structures. This includes loading quest details such as objectives, rewards,
    prerequisites, and any dynamic properties that may affect how the quest behaves
    during gameplay. The method is typically invoked when a quest needs to be activated
    or refreshed in memory, ensuring that all necessary information is available for
    quest progression and reward distribution. It operates within the context of TrinityCore's
    quest management framework and integrates with the broader dynamic quest system
    architecture.

  notes: This method should only be called after verifying that the quest ID exists
    in the database. It is recommended to use this method in conjunction with a quest
    existence check to prevent errors during metadata loading.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent quest ID may result
    in undefined behavior or data corruption within the dynamic quest system's internal
    structures.
