  signature: float DefensiveBehaviorManager::CalculateDefensiveScore(const DefensiveCooldown
    & cooldown, DefensivePriority priority) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates a defensive score based on cooldown and priority for use in AI
    decision making.
  description: The CalculateDefensiveScore method computes a weighted defensive value
    that represents the strategic importance of using a specific defensive ability.
    This value is derived from the provided DefensiveCooldown object and the associated
    DefensivePriority level. The method is used by the AI system to evaluate which
    defensive actions should be prioritized under various combat conditions. It takes
    into account both the cooldown duration and the priority level assigned to the
    defensive ability, returning a normalized float score that can be compared against
    other defensive options.
  parameters:
  - name: cooldown
    description: The DefensiveCooldown object containing information about the cooldown
      duration and related defensive properties for the ability being evaluated.
  - name: priority
    description: The DefensivePriority enum value indicating the relative importance
      or urgency of using this defensive ability in the current situation.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated defensive score. Higher values
    indicate more strategically important defensive actions. The exact range and interpretation
    depend on internal weighting algorithms within the AI system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: float score = defensiveManager.CalculateDefensiveScore(myCooldown, DefensivePriority::High);
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing multiple defensive options
    code: "float shieldScore = manager.CalculateDefensiveScore(shieldCooldown, DefensivePriority::Medium);\n\
      float healScore = manager.CalculateDefensiveScore(healCooldown, DefensivePriority::High);\n\
      if (shieldScore > healScore) {\n    // Use shield\n} else {\n    // Use heal\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI decision-making cycles when evaluating
    defensive actions. The implementation likely uses internal scaling factors and
    priority multipliers to normalize different cooldown durations and priority levels
    into a single comparable score. The method should be called with valid DefensiveCooldown
    and DefensivePriority values to ensure meaningful results.
  warnings: The exact calculation logic is not visible in the provided source code,
    so assumptions are made based on typical AI behavior in TrinityCore. Calling this
    method with invalid or uninitialized DefensiveCooldown objects may lead to unexpected
    results. The returned score should not be used as an absolute value but rather
    for relative comparisons against other defensive scores.
