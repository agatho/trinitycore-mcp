  class: AggressorAI
  method: UpdateAI
  signature: void AggressorAI::UpdateAI(int param0)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the aggressor AI behavior based on the provided time delta parameter.
  description: The UpdateAI method is responsible for executing the core logic of
    the AggressorAI class, which controls how an NPC behaves when it is in combat
    or aggressive state. This method typically handles target selection, movement
    decisions, spell casting, and other AI-related actions. It is called regularly
    by the game loop with a time delta parameter that represents the elapsed time
    since the last update. The implementation may vary depending on the specific creature
    type and its assigned AI behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Time delta in milliseconds representing the elapsed time since the
      last AI update call. This value is used to determine how much time has passed
      for AI calculations such as cooldowns, movement timing, and spell casting delays.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateAI Call
    code: "void SomeCreature::UpdateAI(int diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n  \
      \      return;\n\n    // Perform AI logic with time delta\n    m_ai->UpdateAI(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced UpdateAI Usage with Custom Logic
    code: "void AggressorAI::UpdateAI(int diff)\n{\n    if (!m_creature->IsInCombat())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // Handle spell casting based on time delta\n    if\
      \ (m_spellTimer <= 0)\n    {\n        CastSpell();\n        m_spellTimer = 3000;\
      \ // Reset timer\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        m_spellTimer -= diff;\n  \
      \  }\n\n    // Update movement and target selection\n    DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the creature's main update loop, usually
    once per game tick. Developers should ensure that all time-based calculations
    within this function are properly scaled using the provided delta parameter to
    maintain consistent behavior across different frame rates.
  warnings: Improper handling of the time delta parameter can lead to inconsistent
    AI behavior such as spells being cast too frequently or not at all. Always validate
    that the delta value is positive and reasonable before performing any time-sensitive
    operations.
