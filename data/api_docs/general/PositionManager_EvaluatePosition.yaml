  class: PositionManager
  method: EvaluatePosition
  signature: PositionInfo PositionManager::EvaluatePosition(const int & pos, const
    MovementContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns detailed positional information for a given position
    within a movement context.
  description: The EvaluatePosition method computes and retrieves comprehensive positional
    data for a specified location based on the provided movement context. This function
    is typically used in pathfinding, movement validation, or spatial reasoning systems
    within the TrinityCore framework. It processes the input position and applies
    contextual constraints such as terrain, obstacles, or game rules to determine
    the resulting PositionInfo structure. The method ensures that all positional calculations
    are consistent with the current game state and movement mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific position in the game
      world. This value typically corresponds to a node, waypoint, or coordinate within
      a navigation mesh or pathfinding system.
  - name: context
    description: A MovementContext object that provides environmental and situational
      data affecting how the position is evaluated. This includes factors like current
      terrain type, movement restrictions, player state, or game rules that influence
      positional validity.
  returns: Returns a PositionInfo structure containing detailed evaluation results
    for the specified position. The structure may include coordinates, validity flags,
    height information, and other relevant spatial data derived from applying the
    movement context to the input position.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Position Evaluation
    code: "PositionInfo info = positionManager.EvaluatePosition(12345, movementContext);\n\
      if (info.IsValid()) {\n    // Process valid positional data\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"Position is valid at X: \" << info.GetX() << \", Y: \" << info.GetY() <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Evaluation for Pathfinding
    code: "MovementContext context;\ncontext.SetPlayerState(PlayerState::MOVING);\n\
      context.SetTerrainType(TerrainType::ROAD);\n\nPositionInfo result = positionManager.EvaluatePosition(67890,\
      \ context);\nif (result.IsWalkable()) {\n    // Proceed with movement along\
      \ this path segment\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal caching or lookup operations for performance.
    Developers should be aware that repeated calls with the same parameters may return
    cached results. The PositionInfo structure returned by this method is designed
    to be immutable after evaluation.
  warnings: Ensure that the input position value corresponds to a valid node or location
    within the current navigation system; invalid positions may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect results. Avoid using this method in high-frequency loops
    without considering performance implications.
