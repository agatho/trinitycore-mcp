  signature: void CinematicMgr::~CinematicMgr()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the CinematicMgr instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the CinematicMgr class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This includes
    cleaning up any active cinematic sequences, stopping playback of ongoing cinematics,
    and ensuring proper cleanup of internal data structures. The destructor is automatically
    invoked when a CinematicMgr instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    It ensures that no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur during the shutdown
    process of the cinematic system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of CinematicMgr
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    CinematicMgr* mgr = new CinematicMgr();\n \
      \   // ... use the manager ...\n    delete mgr; // Destructor is called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing object
    lifetime. It's typically invoked by the runtime when objects go out of scope or
    are deleted. Ensure that no active cinematic sequences are running before destruction
    to prevent unexpected behavior.
