documentation:
  brief: Preloads frequently accessed guild bank items into memory for improved performance.
  description: The PreloadFrequentItems method initializes and loads commonly accessed
    items from the guild bank into memory to reduce database queries and improve response
    times when players interact with the guild bank interface. This method is typically
    called during server startup or when a guild's bank data is first accessed, ensuring
    that frequently requested items such as common crafting materials, consumables,
    and frequently withdrawn items are readily available in memory. The preloading
    process helps optimize performance by minimizing disk I/O operations and database
    lookups for items that are regularly accessed by guild members.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GuildBankManager* bankManager = sGuildBankMgr;

      bankManager->PreloadFrequentItems();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the TrinityCore framework
    during guild initialization or when the first guild bank query is processed. It
    performs memory allocation and database reads, so calling it unnecessarily may
    impact performance. The preloaded items are cached in a temporary structure for
    quick access.
  warnings: Do not call this method manually unless you understand its internal workings
    and the implications of preloading data. Improper usage could lead to unnecessary
    memory consumption or performance degradation.
