documentation:
  brief: Checks if the shaman has a weapon imbue active on the specified hand.
  description: The HasWeaponImbue method determines whether the shaman character currently
    has an active weapon imbue effect applied to either their main hand or off-hand
    weapon. This method is typically used in AI logic to make decisions about when
    to apply new imbuements or avoid certain abilities that might interfere with existing
    ones. The check considers both the presence of an imbue and its validity, ensuring
    it's not expired or otherwise invalid. In World of Warcraft's context, shaman
    weapon imbuements are temporary enhancements that modify weapon properties such
    as damage or elemental effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a valid weapon imbue is currently active on the specified
    hand (main hand when mainHand=true, off-hand otherwise), false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check for Main Hand Imbue
    code: "if (shamanAI->HasWeaponImbue(true)) {\n    // Perform action that requires\
      \ main hand imbue to be active\n    DoMainHandImbueAction();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic Based on Imbue State
    code: "if (!shamanAI->HasWeaponImbue(false)) {\n    // Apply off-hand imbue if\
      \ none exists\n    ApplyOffHandImbue();\n} else {\n    // Continue with current\
      \ off-hand imbue\n    ContinueWithCurrentImbue();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks internal AI state variables tracking active imbuements
    rather than querying the actual spell effects directly. It may be used in conjunction
    with other ShamanAI methods like GetWeaponImbueType() or ApplyWeaponImbue(). The
    implementation should account for different shaman specs (Elemental, Enhancement,
    Restoration) which might have different imbue mechanics.
  warnings: This method assumes that the AI state is properly maintained and synchronized
    with the actual character's imbue status. If used outside of proper AI context
    or without ensuring the AI has been initialized correctly, it may return incorrect
    results. Also note that this check does not account for temporary removals due
    to combat situations or other game mechanics.
