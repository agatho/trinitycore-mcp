documentation:
  brief: Returns the spell ID of the interrupt ability used by warrior NPCs in PvP
    combat.
  description: The GetWarriorInterruptSpell method retrieves the specific spell identifier
    that a warrior NPC uses to interrupt enemy spellcasters during PvP encounters.
    This method is part of the PvPCombatAI class and is typically invoked when determining
    which interrupt spell should be cast during combat. The returned value corresponds
    to a defined spell in the game's database, usually representing abilities like
    Shield Slam or Pummel. The method does not take any parameters and returns a uint32
    representing the spell ID. This functionality is crucial for AI-driven warrior
    NPCs to maintain balanced PvP behavior by ensuring they use appropriate interrupt
    mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the spell ID of the warrior's interrupt ability.
    If no valid interrupt spell is defined, it may return 0 or a default interrupt
    spell ID depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "uint32 interruptSpell = ai->GetWarriorInterruptSpell();\nif (interruptSpell\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Cast the interrupt spell on target\n    me->CastSpell(target,\
      \ interruptSpell, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the AI system to determine appropriate
    combat behavior for warrior NPCs in PvP scenarios. The actual spell ID returned
    may depend on the specific warrior NPC's level or faction. Implementation details
    are based on typical TrinityCore AI patterns where interrupt spells are defined
    per class or subclass.
  warnings: Ensure that the returned spell ID corresponds to a valid, existing spell
    in the database; otherwise, casting it will result in no effect. This method should
    only be called during active combat situations when an interrupt is actually needed.
