  class: LootDistribution
  method: HandleGroupLoot
  signature: void LootDistribution::HandleGroupLoot(Group * group, Loot * loot)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and distributes loot among group members according to group loot
    rules.
  description: The HandleGroupLoot method manages the distribution of loot within
    a group context, ensuring that items are properly awarded to players based on
    group loot settings such as round-robin, free-for-all, or master loot. This method
    typically handles the logic for determining which player receives which item,
    considering factors like loot rules, group composition, and player eligibility.
    It is invoked when a group loots an item and ensures proper synchronization of
    loot distribution across all group members.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group that will receive
      the loot. Must not be null.
  - name: loot
    description: Pointer to the Loot object containing the items to be distributed
      among the group members. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Distribute loot to a group
    code: 'Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      Loot* loot = new Loot();

      // ... populate loot with items ...

      lootDistribution->HandleGroupLoot(group, loot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group and loot objects are valid and properly
    initialized. It may modify internal state of both the group and loot objects during
    execution. The actual distribution logic depends on the group's loot settings.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as passing a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior or
    crash. Also, make sure the loot object contains valid items before invoking this
    function.
