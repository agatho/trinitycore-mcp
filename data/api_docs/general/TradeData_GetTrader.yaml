  class: TradeData
  method: GetTrader
  signature: Player * TradeData::GetTrader() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the player object associated with the trade data.
  description: The GetTrader method retrieves the Player object that is involved in
    the trade represented by this TradeData instance. This method is typically used
    during trade operations to access the player who initiated or is participating
    in the trade. The returned pointer should be validated before use as it may be
    null if the trade data is not properly initialized or if the player has disconnected.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Player object representing the trader, or nullptr if no
    valid trader exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in trade handler
    code: "void HandleTradeRequest(Player* player)\n{\n    TradeData* trade = player->GetTradeData();\n\
      \    if (trade)\n    {\n        Player* trader = trade->GetTrader();\n     \
      \   if (trader)\n        {\n            // Proceed with trade logic\n      \
      \      sLog->outString(\"Trader found: %s\", trader->GetName().c_str());\n \
      \       }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the trade system in TrinityCore and relies on internal
    state management. The returned Player pointer should not be stored long-term as
    the player object may be destroyed during the trade process.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned pointer directly without checking
    for null. The player object might have been deleted or disconnected, leading to
    undefined behavior if dereferenced.
