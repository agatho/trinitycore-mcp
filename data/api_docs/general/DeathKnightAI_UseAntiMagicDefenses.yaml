  method: UseAntiMagicDefenses
  signature: void DeathKnightAI::UseAntiMagicDefenses(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Activates the Death Knight's Anti-Magic Defense ability on the specified
    target.
  description: The UseAntiMagicDefenses method triggers the Death Knight's Anti-Magic
    Defense ability, which provides immunity to magic effects for a short duration.
    This ability is typically used in combat situations where the Death Knight needs
    to protect themselves or their target from magical attacks. The method takes a
    Unit pointer as input, specifying which unit should receive the defensive effect.
    The implementation likely involves checking if the ability is available, consuming
    necessary resources (such as runes or energy), and applying the appropriate aura
    or buff to the target. This method is part of the Death Knight's core combat AI
    behavior and is crucial for managing magical threats during encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that will receive the Anti-Magic Defense
      effect. This can be the Death Knight itself or another friendly unit in combat.
  returns: null
  examples:

    code: "void DeathKnightAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->GetVictim() &&\
      \ me->GetVictim()->IsNonMeleeSpellCast(true))\n    {\n        UseAntiMagicDefenses(me);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Target Selection
    code: "void DeathKnightAI::DoCombatAction()\n{\n    Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO,\
      \ 0, 100.0f, true);\n    if (target && target->IsInWorld())\n    {\n       \
      \ UseAntiMagicDefenses(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the Death Knight's resource management
    system, potentially consuming runes or other combat resources. The effect duration
    and effectiveness may vary based on the Death Knight's level, talents, or gear.
    Implementation details are not visible in the provided source code, but it would
    typically involve aura application and cooldown handling.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is valid and in the world before calling
    this method to avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior. The method should
    only be called when the Death Knight has sufficient resources to activate the
    ability.
