  class: EvokerAI
  method: GetHighestPriorityDamageTarget
  signature: int * EvokerAI::GetHighestPriorityDamageTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the highest priority damage target for the evoker AI.
  description: The GetHighestPriorityDamageTarget method determines and returns the
    unique identifier (GUID) of the most critical enemy target for an evoker AI to
    attack. This method evaluates various factors such as threat level, distance,
    and target priority to select the optimal target. It is typically used during
    combat decision-making processes within the EvokerAI class to ensure the evoker
    focuses its damage output on the most dangerous or prioritized enemy. The returned
    value represents a valid GUID that can be used to retrieve or manipulate the target
    object in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the highest priority damage
    target. Returns NULL if no valid target is found or if the AI is not in combat.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat
    code: "if (int* targetGuid = evokerAI->GetHighestPriorityDamageTarget()) {\n \
      \   Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*me, *targetGuid);\n    if (target\
      \ && me->CanAttack(target)) {\n        me->Attack(target, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal threat management and target prioritization
    systems. The returned GUID is only valid while the target remains in the game
    world and is not destroyed or removed from combat.
  warnings: The returned pointer may be NULL, so always check for null before using
    the value. Using an invalid GUID can lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
