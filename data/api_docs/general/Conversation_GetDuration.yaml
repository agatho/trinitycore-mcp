  class: Conversation
  method: GetDuration
  signature: int Conversation::GetDuration() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the duration in seconds of a conversation.
  description: The GetDuration method returns the total duration, in seconds, that
    a conversation is set to last. This value determines how long the conversation
    will remain active before automatically ending. The duration is typically configured
    when the conversation is created or initialized and may be influenced by game
    mechanics such as quest progression or NPC behavior. This method provides access
    to the static duration setting of the conversation object and does not account
    for dynamic modifications during runtime.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the duration of the conversation in seconds. A
    value of 0 indicates that the conversation has no fixed duration or is infinite,
    while positive values indicate a specific time limit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int duration = conversation->GetDuration();\nif (duration > 0)\n{\n   \
      \ // Conversation has a defined duration\n    printf(\"Conversation will last\
      \ %d seconds\\n\", duration);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Infinite Duration
    code: "int duration = conversation->GetDuration();\nif (duration == 0)\n{\n  \
      \  // Conversation is infinite or has no set duration\n    printf(\"Conversation\
      \ will continue indefinitely\\n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle finite duration\n\
      \    printf(\"Conversation ends in %d seconds\\n\", duration);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a cached value and does not perform any runtime calculations.
    The actual conversation behavior may be affected by other systems such as quest
    timers or player actions, but GetDuration itself only reflects the configured
    duration.
