documentation:
  brief: Processes pending database queries in the bot database connection pool
  description: The ProcessQueryQueue method handles execution of queued database operations
    within the BotDatabasePool. This method is responsible for managing asynchronous
    database requests, ensuring that pending queries are executed in an orderly fashion
    while maintaining thread safety and connection integrity. It typically runs as
    part of a background processing loop to prevent blocking the main game thread
    during database operations.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // Process pending bot database queries\n    sBotDatabasePool->ProcessQueryQueue();\n\
      \    // Continue with other game logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called periodically from the main game loop or dedicated
    background thread. It ensures that database operations don't block gameplay execution
    while maintaining proper connection management and query ordering.
