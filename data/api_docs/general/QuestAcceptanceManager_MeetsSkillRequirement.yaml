  signature: bool QuestAcceptanceManager::MeetsSkillRequirement(const int * quest)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player meets the required skill level for a given quest
  description: The MeetsSkillRequirement method evaluates whether the current player
    character has sufficient skill levels in relevant professions or abilities to
    accept and progress through a specified quest. This method typically checks against
    the minimum skill requirements defined in the quest's data, ensuring that players
    cannot take quests they are not qualified for based on their current skill set.
    The function is commonly used during quest acceptance logic within the TrinityCore
    framework to enforce game balance and progression restrictions.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the quest ID to check against
      the player's skill requirements
  returns: Returns true if the player meets all required skill levels for the specified
    quest, false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest acceptance logic
    code: "if (questManager.MeetsSkillRequirement(&questId)) {\n    // Player can\
      \ accept the quest\n    player->AddQuest(questId);\n} else {\n    // Player\
      \ lacks required skills\n    player->SendNotification(\"You do not meet the\
      \ skill requirements for this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal skill tracking systems and may
    cache results for performance. It should only be called when a player attempts
    to accept or interact with a quest that has skill prerequisites.
  warnings: Ensure the quest ID passed is valid and corresponds to an actual quest
    in the database, as invalid IDs might lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    evaluations.
