documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell requires an explicit unit target for execution
  description: The NeedsExplicitUnitTarget method checks if a spell requires a specific
    unit target to be specified during casting. This is particularly important for
    spells that need to target specific units, such as those requiring a target or
    those that cannot be cast without explicit targeting. The method returns true
    if the spell needs an explicit unit target, false otherwise. This functionality
    is crucial for ensuring proper spell execution and preventing invalid casting
    scenarios in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell requires an explicit unit target, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the spell can be cast without specifying a target or requires
    one to be explicitly provided during casting.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spellInfo->NeedsExplicitUnitTarget()) {\n    // Spell requires explicit\
      \ unit target\n    // Handle accordingly\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during spell validation and casting checks.
    It's important to note that this method does not directly determine if a spell
    can be cast on targets, but rather whether the spell requires an explicit target
    to be specified. This method is often called in conjunction with other spell validation
    methods.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with methods that check for target
    requirements or those that validate target types. It's important to understand
    that this method only indicates if a spell requires an explicit unit target, not
    whether it can be cast on any target.
