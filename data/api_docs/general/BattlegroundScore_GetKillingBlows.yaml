documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of killing blows delivered by the player in a battleground.
  description: The GetKillingBlows method retrieves the count of successful killing
    blows (player eliminations) that a specific player has achieved during a battleground
    match. This value is typically tracked as part of the player's score and contributes
    to overall performance metrics within the context of battlegrounds such as Warsong
    Gulch, Arathi Basin, or Eye of the Storm. The method is read-only and does not
    modify any internal state. It is commonly used in scoring systems, player statistics
    reporting, and victory condition checks.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of killing blows (player eliminations)
    achieved by this player during the current battleground match. Returns zero if
    no kills have been recorded or if the player has not participated in a battleground.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and display killing blows for a player
    code: 'BattlegroundScore* score = player->GetBattlegroundScore();

      int kills = score->GetKillingBlows();

      printf("Player has delivered %d killing blows in the battleground.\n", kills);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Use killing blow count to determine player contribution
    code: "BattlegroundScore* score = player->GetBattlegroundScore();\nint kills =\
      \ score->GetKillingBlows();\nif (kills >= 5) {\n    // Player is considered\
      \ a significant contributor\n    SendSystemMessage(\"Excellent killing performance!\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on valid BattlegroundScore objects that
    are associated with an active battleground. The value returned reflects the player's
    performance during the current match and resets upon battleground completion or
    player leave.
