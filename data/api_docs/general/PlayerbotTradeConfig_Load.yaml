  method: Load
  signature: void PlayerbotTradeConfig::Load()
documentation:
  brief: Loads trade configuration settings for player bots from the database or configuration
    files.
  description: The Load method initializes and populates the internal configuration
    data structure of the PlayerbotTradeConfig class. It typically retrieves trade-related
    settings such as item thresholds, vendor prices, and bot behavior parameters from
    persistent storage like the database or local config files. This method is usually
    invoked during the initialization phase of player bot systems to ensure that trading
    behaviors are properly configured before the bots begin interacting with the game
    world. The method does not take any parameters and performs no direct return operations;
    instead, it modifies the internal state of the class instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Initialization
    code: 'PlayerbotTradeConfig tradeConfig;

      tradeConfig.Load();

      // Configuration is now loaded and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization of a player
    bot system. Repeated calls may lead to duplicate or inconsistent configuration
    data. The implementation likely involves database queries or file I/O operations,
    which could introduce performance overhead if invoked frequently.
