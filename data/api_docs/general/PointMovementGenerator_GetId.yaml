  class: PointMovementGenerator
  method: GetId
  signature: int PointMovementGenerator::GetId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the point movement generator.
  description: The GetId method retrieves the unique integer identifier associated
    with a PointMovementGenerator instance. This identifier is typically used internally
    by the TrinityCore AI system to distinguish between different movement generators
    assigned to units. The returned ID helps in tracking and managing various movement
    behaviors such as waypoint following, random walking, or targeted movement. This
    method is commonly called during AI update cycles to determine which specific
    movement behavior is currently active for a unit.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique identifier of this PointMovementGenerator
    instance. The value is typically assigned at object creation and remains constant
    throughout the generator's lifetime.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Movement Generator ID
    code: 'PointMovementGenerator* movementGen = new PointMovementGenerator(1, x,
      y, z);

      int id = movementGen->GetId();

      // id now contains the unique identifier for this movement generator'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that performs no computation and has O(1)
    time complexity. The ID returned is usually assigned sequentially by the AI system
    when movement generators are created, making it useful for debugging and logging
    purposes.
