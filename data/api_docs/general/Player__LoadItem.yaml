    * fields)
documentation:
  brief: Loads an item from the database for the player with specified transaction,
    zone ID, and time difference.
  description: The _LoadItem method retrieves an item from the database for a player
    based on transaction parameters, zone identification, and time difference. This
    method is typically used during player initialization or when loading items that
    have been stored in the database. It handles the retrieval of item data including
    item properties, enchantments, and other relevant information. The method ensures
    proper item loading by considering transactional data, zone ID, and time differences
    to maintain game balance and integrity. It may be called during character creation
    or when restoring items from saved state.
  parameters:
  - name: trans
    description: Transaction identifier used to track database operations for item
      loading. This parameter typically represents a transaction ID that ensures proper
      item retrieval from the database.
  - name: zoneId
    description: Zone identification value used to determine where the item was loaded
      from. This parameter helps identify the zone context for item loading and may
      affect item properties based on zone-specific rules.
  - name: timeDiff
    description: Time difference value that determines how long an item has been stored
      in database. This parameter affects item expiration and time-based properties
      of loaded items, ensuring proper item handling based on time constraints.
  - name: fields
    description: Pointer to integer array containing field values for item loading.
      This parameter represents the fields that are used to determine item properties
      during loading process, typically including item data such as item ID, enchantment,
      and other relevant information.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the loaded Item object from database. The method returns
    an Item pointer which can be null if no item is found or if loading fails due
    to database issues. This return value represents the item that was successfully
    loaded from database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Item Loading Example
    code: Item* item = player->_LoadItem(1, 12345, 3600, &fields);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Item Loading with Error Handling
    code: "Item* item = player->_LoadItem(1, 12345, 3600, &fields);\nif (item != nullptr)\
      \ {\n    // Process item\n}\nelse {\n    // Handle error case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during player initialization or when restoring
    items from database. It requires proper transaction handling and may involve database
    transactions for item loading. Performance considerations include database query
    optimization and potential memory usage when loading multiple items. Thread safety
    depends on database transaction handling and may require synchronization in multi-threaded
    environments.
  warnings: This method may fail if the database transaction is invalid or if the
    item cannot be loaded properly due to database issues. Care should be taken to
    ensure proper field values are passed to avoid loading errors. The method may
    return null if item loading fails, so error handling should be implemented.
