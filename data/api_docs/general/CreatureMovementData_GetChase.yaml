  signature: CreatureChaseMovementType CreatureMovementData::GetChase() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the chase movement type configuration for the creature.
  description: The GetChase method returns the current chase movement type setting
    for a creature's AI behavior. This value determines how the creature will pursue
    targets during combat, including whether it uses direct pursuit, flanking maneuvers,
    or other movement patterns. The returned CreatureChaseMovementType enum indicates
    specific movement behaviors that influence pathfinding and target tracking mechanics
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A CreatureChaseMovementType enumeration value representing the creature's
    current chase behavior configuration. Possible values typically include direct
    pursuit, circular flanking, or other predefined movement patterns used by the
    AI system.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and log creature chase type
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      CreatureChaseMovementType chaseType = creature->GetCreatureMovementData()->GetChase();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("ai", "Creature chase type: %u", static_cast<uint32>(chaseType));'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI behavior scripts to determine how a creature
    should move when chasing targets. The returned value directly affects the creature's
    pathfinding and movement logic during combat situations.
