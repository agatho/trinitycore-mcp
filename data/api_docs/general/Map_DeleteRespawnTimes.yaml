  signature: void Map::DeleteRespawnTimes()
documentation:
  brief: Removes all respawn times for game objects and creatures on this map.
  description: The DeleteRespawnTimes method clears all stored respawn timers for
    game objects and creatures within the current map instance. This operation is
    typically used during map cleanup or when resetting the state of a map to ensure
    that all entities will respawn according to their default settings rather than
    any previously saved respawn times. The method does not affect the actual entities
    themselves, only their respawn time tracking data. It's commonly invoked during
    map unloading or reset procedures in TrinityCore's core systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during map cleanup
    code: "void MyMapManager::CleanupMap(Map* map)\n{\n    map->DeleteRespawnTimes();\n\
      \    // Other cleanup operations...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the map's internal respawn time tracking system and
    should only be called when it's safe to clear all respawn data. It does not modify
    object states or trigger any respawn events; it merely removes the recorded times
    from memory.
  warnings: Calling this method while creatures or game objects are actively respawning
    may lead to inconsistent behavior if respawn logic relies on previous timing data.
    Ensure that no active respawns are occurring before invoking this method.
