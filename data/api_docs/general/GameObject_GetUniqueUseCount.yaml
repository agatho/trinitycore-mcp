  class: GameObject
  method: GetUniqueUseCount
  signature: uint32 GameObject::GetUniqueUseCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique use count of the game object, indicating how many times
    it has been used by players.
  description: The GetUniqueUseCount method retrieves the number of times a game object
    has been interacted with by players, representing the unique usage count for the
    object. This value is typically used in conjunction with other game mechanics
    to track player interactions and prevent duplicate usage of certain objects. The
    method returns a uint32 value that reflects the total number of unique uses recorded
    for this specific game object instance. This information is crucial for maintaining
    game balance and preventing exploitation of game objects through repeated use.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the count of unique uses for this game
    object, indicating how many times it has been interacted with by players.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 useCount = gameObject->GetUniqueUseCount();\nif (useCount > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Handle the object's unique usage\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other game object interaction
    tracking mechanisms. The value returned represents the total unique interactions,
    not necessarily the number of players who have interacted with it. Performance
    considerations are minimal as this method simply reads a stored value.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when implementing game mechanics
    that rely on unique usage counts, as incorrect handling can lead to exploitation
    or imbalance in gameplay.
