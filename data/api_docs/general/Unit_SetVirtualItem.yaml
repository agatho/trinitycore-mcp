  method: SetVirtualItem
  signature: void Unit::SetVirtualItem(uint32 slot, uint32 itemId, uint16 appearanceModId,
    uint16 itemVisual)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the virtual item for a specified slot on the unit.
  description: This method configures a virtual item for a given slot on a Unit, allowing
    the unit to display specific items without actually possessing them in inventory.
    The virtual item is used primarily for visual representation in combat and non-combat
    scenarios, such as when a unit needs to appear with specific equipment or weapon
    types without having those items in their actual inventory. This method is commonly
    used for NPC's that need to show different gear or weapons without being bound
    to actual item ownership.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The slot index where the virtual item should be set, typically ranging
      from 0-3 for main hand, off hand, ranged, and total 4 slots.
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item being set as virtual, which can
      be any valid item ID in the game database.
  - name: appearanceModId
    description: The appearance modification ID that defines how the item appears
      visually, used to modify the visual appearance of the item.
  - name: itemVisual
    description: The visual ID that determines how the item appears in-game, used
      for specific visual effects or animations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: Unit->SetVirtualItem(0, 12345, 100, 200);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetVirtualItem(1, 67890, 150, 300);

      unit->SetVirtualItem(2, 54321, 200, 400);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it affects visual representation
    of units in-game. It does not actually add items to the unit's inventory but merely
    sets a virtual item for display purposes. Performance considerations include potential
    visual lag if too many virtual items are set simultaneously.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect visual representations
    or even crash scenarios if invalid IDs are passed. Always ensure that the parameters
    are valid and within expected ranges before calling this method.
