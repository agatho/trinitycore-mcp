documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the GUID of the player who currently carries the enemy
    flag in a battleground.
  description: The FindEnemyFlagCarrier method is used within the BattlegroundAI class
    to locate the player who currently possesses the enemy team's flag. This method
    is typically invoked during battleground gameplay to determine which player has
    captured the opposing team's flag, enabling the AI to make strategic decisions
    such as pursuing the carrier or defending key areas. The method returns a pointer
    to an integer representing the GUID of the player carrying the flag, or nullptr
    if no such player exists. This functionality is crucial for battleground mechanics
    involving capture-the-flag scenarios and helps maintain game balance and tactical
    engagement.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID (Global Unique Identifier)
    of the player who currently carries the enemy flag. Returns nullptr if no enemy
    flag carrier is found, indicating that either the flag has not been captured or
    the flag is currently in its original position.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Battleground AI
    code: "void MyBattlegroundAI::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    int* carrierGuid = FindEnemyFlagCarrier();\n\
      \    if (carrierGuid != nullptr)\n    {\n        // Enemy flag carrier found,\
      \ pursue or defend\n        Player* carrier = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(*carrierGuid));\n\
      \        if (carrier)\n        {\n            // Perform actions based on carrier\
      \ location\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground AI system and relies on internal
    flag state tracking. The returned GUID pointer should be dereferenced carefully
    to ensure it points to a valid player object before use. Performance-wise, this
    method typically performs a lookup within the battleground's player list, so frequent
    calls should be avoided in performance-critical sections.
  warnings: The return value is a pointer to an integer, not the integer itself. Dereferencing
    a null pointer returned by this method will cause undefined behavior. Ensure proper
    null checking before using the returned GUID value. Additionally, the returned
    GUID may become invalid if the player leaves the battleground or is removed from
    the game state.
