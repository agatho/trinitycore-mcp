  class: Loot
  method: NotifyMoneyRemoved
  signature: void Loot::NotifyMoneyRemoved(const Map * map)
documentation:
  brief: Notifies players in the map that loot money has been removed from a container.
  description: The NotifyMoneyRemoved method is responsible for informing all nearby
    players within a specified map that monetary loot has been taken or removed from
    a loot container, such as a corpse or chest. This ensures that players are aware
    of changes to the loot state and prevents them from attempting to claim already
    taken money. The method typically triggers a network update to clients, updating
    their UI to reflect the current loot status. It is commonly called during the
    loot removal process when a player successfully loots money from a container.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object where the loot container resides. This
      parameter determines which players receive the notification about the removed
      money.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Notify Money Removal on Corpse Loot
    code: "Loot* loot = corpse->GetLoot();\nif (loot)\n{\n    loot->NotifyMoneyRemoved(corpse->GetMap());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using NotifyMoneyRemoved After Player Loots Money
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nLoot* loot = ...;\nif (loot->HasMoney() && loot->IsLooted())\n\
      {\n    loot->NotifyMoneyRemoved(player->GetMap());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the loot system when money
    is removed from a container. It does not directly remove the money but sends a
    notification to clients. The map parameter must be valid and should correspond
    to the location where the loot container exists.
  warnings: Ensure that the map pointer passed to this method is valid and not null,
    as passing an invalid pointer may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This
    method should only be called after confirming that money has actually been removed
    from the loot container.
