  class: RogueAI
  method: GetOptimalRange
  signature: float RogueAI::GetOptimalRange(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal attack range for the rogue AI based on
    current target.
  description: The GetOptimalRange method determines the ideal distance at which a
    rogue AI character should engage its target for maximum effectiveness. This calculation
    takes into account various factors such as the rogue's weapon type, movement capabilities,
    and the target's positioning. The returned float value represents the squared
    distance (to avoid expensive square root operations) at which the rogue should
    position itself for optimal combat performance. This method is typically used
    internally by the AI system to make decisions about movement and attack timing.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the squared optimal range distance from the
    target. This value should be compared against the square of the actual distance
    to determine if the rogue is at the correct position for attacking.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "float optimalRange = rogueAI->GetOptimalRange();\nfloat currentDistanceSqr\
      \ = (player->GetPosition() - target->GetPosition()).GetLength2();\nif (currentDistanceSqr\
      \ > optimalRange)\n{\n    // Move closer to target\n    rogueAI->MoveToTarget(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely caches its result or recalculates based on the current
    target's state. The returned value is squared for performance reasons, as comparing
    squared distances avoids costly sqrt() operations. The optimal range may vary
    depending on whether the rogue has stealth active, is using a ranged weapon, or
    has specific abilities like Vanish or Blind.
  warnings: Be cautious when comparing against the raw return value - always ensure
    you're comparing squared distances with squared distances to avoid incorrect logic.
    This method should only be called when a valid target exists, as it may return
    unexpected values if no target is set.
