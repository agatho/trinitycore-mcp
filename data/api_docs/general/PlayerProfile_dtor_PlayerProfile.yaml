  method: ~PlayerProfile
  signature: void PlayerProfile::~PlayerProfile()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a PlayerProfile instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~PlayerProfile destructor is automatically invoked when a PlayerProfile
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory, internal data structures, and references
    held by the player profile. In the context of TrinityCore's architecture, this
    typically occurs during player logout, character deletion, or server shutdown
    sequences. The destructor performs necessary cleanup operations to prevent memory
    leaks and maintain system stability.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction at scope exit
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    PlayerProfile profile;\n    // ... use profile\
      \ ...\n} // Destructor automatically called here"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of dynamic PlayerProfile
    code: 'PlayerProfile* profile = new PlayerProfile();

      // ... use profile ...

      delete profile; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and should not be
    invoked manually. It's important to note that any references or pointers to this
    PlayerProfile object become invalid after destruction. The implementation likely
    handles cleanup of internal caches, database connections, and temporary data structures
    associated with the player's profile.
  warnings: Never call the destructor directly (e.g., profile.~PlayerProfile()). This
    can lead to undefined behavior. Also, ensure that no other objects hold references
    to this PlayerProfile before it is destroyed to avoid dangling pointer issues.
