  signature: void BotSpawner::CalculateZoneTargets()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and updates the list of valid target positions within the current
    zone for bot spawning.
  description: The CalculateZoneTargets method determines all eligible spawn points
    within the active zone where game bots can be instantiated. This method evaluates
    the current map and zone data to identify suitable locations, taking into account
    terrain, object placement, and other environmental factors that may affect bot
    spawning. It typically runs during initialization or when zone boundaries change,
    ensuring that the bot spawner has an up-to-date list of valid target coordinates
    for creating new bots.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotSpawner spawner;

      spawner.CalculateZoneTargets();

      // Updates internal target list for bot spawning in current zone'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the bot management system
    when a new zone is loaded or when the spawner's configuration changes. It may
    perform expensive calculations involving map data traversal, so frequent calls
    should be avoided.
