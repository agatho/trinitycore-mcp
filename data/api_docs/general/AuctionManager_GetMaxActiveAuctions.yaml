  class: AuctionManager
  method: GetMaxActiveAuctions
  signature: uint32 AuctionManager::GetMaxActiveAuctions() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum number of active auctions allowed for a player.
  description: The GetMaxActiveAuctions method retrieves the upper limit of auctions
    that a player can have listed simultaneously in the auction house. This value
    is typically determined by game rules, player account type, or server configuration
    settings. The returned value represents a soft cap that affects how many items
    a player can auction at once without exceeding the system's limits. This method
    does not perform any validation or modification of auction state; it simply returns
    the configured maximum count.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of active auctions allowed
    per player. This is typically a fixed server configuration value, often ranging
    from 5 to 50 depending on the server settings and player account type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 maxAuctions = auctionMgr->GetMaxActiveAuctions();\nif (playerAuctionCount\
      \ >= maxAuctions)\n{\n    // Inform player they've reached the auction limit\n\
      \    player->SendAuctionError(AUCTION_ERROR_NO_MORE_AUCTIONS);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Auction Limit Before Listing
    code: "uint32 maxActive = auctionMgr->GetMaxActiveAuctions();\nuint32 currentActive\
      \ = player->GetAuctionListCount();\nif (currentActive >= maxActive)\n{\n   \
      \ // Prevent listing new auction\n    SendAuctionError(AUCTION_ERROR_NO_MORE_AUCTIONS);\n\
      \    return;\n}\n// Proceed with auction listing\nCreateNewAuction(player, item,\
      \ bid, buyout);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with player-specific auction
    counting logic to enforce server-side limits. The value returned may vary based
    on account privileges or server configuration, and it's recommended to cache this
    value if accessed frequently during high-volume operations.
  warnings: The returned value represents a hard limit enforced by the server. Exceeding
    this limit may result in auction listing failures or player warnings. This method
    should not be used as a substitute for actual auction counting logic when determining
    whether a new auction can be created.
