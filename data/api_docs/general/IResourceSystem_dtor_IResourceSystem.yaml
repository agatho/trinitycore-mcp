documentation:
  brief: Destroys the resource system instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the IResourceSystem class is responsible for cleaning
    up all allocated memory and resources used by the resource system. This method
    ensures that any dynamically allocated data, file handles, or internal structures
    are properly released when the resource system object goes out of scope or is
    explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore, this typically involves releasing
    loaded resource files such as textures, models, sound files, or other game assets
    that were managed by the system. The destructor should be called automatically
    by the C++ runtime when the object is destroyed, and developers should not manually
    invoke it unless implementing custom memory management patterns.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of resource system
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    IResourceSystem* resourceSystem = new IResourceSystem();\n\
      \    // ... use the resource system ...\n    delete resourceSystem; // Destructor\
      \ called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-based resource system destruction
    code: "void AnotherExample()\n{\n    IResourceSystem resourceSystem; // Constructor\
      \ called\n    // ... use the resource system ...\n    // Destructor automatically\
      \ called when going out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is typically implemented as a virtual function in base classes
    to ensure proper cleanup of derived class members. Since this is a pure virtual
    interface, the actual implementation will be provided by concrete implementations
    of IResourceSystem. Developers should ensure that no references to the resource
    system remain after destruction to prevent dangling pointers.
  warnings: Never manually call the destructor unless implementing custom memory management.
    The destructor should only be invoked by the C++ runtime during object destruction.
    Attempting to use a resource system after its destructor has been called will
    result in undefined behavior.
