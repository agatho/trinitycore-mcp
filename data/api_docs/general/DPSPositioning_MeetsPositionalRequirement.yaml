  class: DPSPositioning
  method: MeetsPositionalRequirement
  signature: bool DPSPositioning::MeetsPositionalRequirement(Player * dps, Unit *
    target, PositionalRequirement req)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a DPS player meets the positional requirements relative
    to a target unit.
  description: The MeetsPositionalRequirement method evaluates if a given Player object
    satisfies specific positional conditions in relation to a target Unit. This functionality
    is typically used in combat scenarios where certain abilities or attacks require
    the player to be positioned in a particular way, such as behind the target, facing
    the target, or within a specified angle. The method takes into account the player's
    current position and orientation compared to the target's position and orientation,
    using the provided PositionalRequirement enum to define what constitutes a valid
    positional state. It returns true if all conditions defined in the requirement
    are met, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: dps
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the DPS character whose
      positioning is being evaluated.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target against which
      the player's positioning is checked.
  - name: req
    description: The PositionalRequirement enum value that defines the specific positional
      conditions to be validated (e.g., behind, in front, within angle).
  returns: Returns true if the DPS player meets all positional requirements relative
    to the target; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of MeetsPositionalRequirement
    code: "if (DPSPositioning::MeetsPositionalRequirement(player, target, PositionalRequirement::Behind))\
      \ {\n    // Player is positioned behind the target\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_BACKSTAB);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking multiple positional requirements
    code: "bool isBehind = DPSPositioning::MeetsPositionalRequirement(player, target,\
      \ PositionalRequirement::Behind);\nbool isFacing = DPSPositioning::MeetsPositionalRequirement(player,\
      \ target, PositionalRequirement::Facing);\nif (isBehind && isFacing) {\n   \
      \ // Player is both behind and facing the target\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_SHURIKEN_STORM);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal trigonometric calculations to determine
    angular relationships between player and target orientations. It may also utilize
    spatial distance checks depending on the PositionalRequirement type. The implementation
    assumes valid pointers for both Player and Unit objects, and does not perform
    null checking internally.
  warnings: Ensure that both 'dps' and 'target' pointers are valid before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior. The PositionalRequirement enum must be
    properly defined and understood to correctly interpret the results of this function.
