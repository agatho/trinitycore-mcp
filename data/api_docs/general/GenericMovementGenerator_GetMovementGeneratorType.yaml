documentation:
  brief: Returns the movement generator type identifier for this generic movement
    generator instance.
  description: The GetMovementGeneratorType method retrieves the specific type of
    movement generator assigned to this instance. In TrinityCore's AI and movement
    system, movement generators define how a creature or unit moves within the game
    world. This method allows code to identify which type of movement behavior is
    currently active for an object, enabling conditional logic based on movement type.
    The returned value corresponds to predefined movement generator types such as
    idle, waypoint, follow, or target-based movement. This is commonly used in AI
    decision-making processes and movement management systems to determine appropriate
    actions or transitions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A MovementGeneratorType enum value indicating the specific type of movement
    generator this instance represents. Possible values include types like IDLE_MOTION_TYPE,
    RANDOM_MOTION_TYPE, WAYPOINT_MOTION_TYPE, CHASE_MOTION_TYPE, FOLLOW_MOTION_TYPE,
    and others defined in the MovementGeneratorType enumeration.
  examples:
  - title: Checking movement type for AI logic
    code: "if (unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGeneratorType() == CHASE_MOTION_TYPE)\n\
      {\n    // Unit is currently chasing a target\n    // Perform chase-specific\
      \ actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determining movement behavior for pathfinding
    code: "MovementGeneratorType type = movementGenerator->GetMovementGeneratorType();\n\
      switch (type)\n{\n    case IDLE_MOTION_TYPE:\n        // Handle idle movement\n\
      \        break;\n    case WAYPOINT_MOTION_TYPE:\n        // Handle waypoint-based\
      \ movement\n        break;\n    default:\n        // Handle other movement types\n\
      \        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a constant function and does not modify the object state.
    It's typically called frequently during AI updates and movement processing, so
    it should be efficient. The returned MovementGeneratorType enum values are defined
    in the core TrinityCore movement system and correspond directly to specific movement
    behaviors implemented in the game engine.
