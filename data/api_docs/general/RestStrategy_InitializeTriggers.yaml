documentation:
  brief: Initializes the triggers for the rest strategy in the AI system
  description: The InitializeTriggers method sets up and configures all necessary
    triggers that govern when a character should enter or exit a resting state within
    the TrinityCore AI framework. This method is typically called during the initialization
    phase of an AI strategy to establish the conditions under which rest behavior
    will be activated, such as when health or mana levels fall below certain thresholds,
    or when specific environmental factors are met. It ensures that the rest strategy
    can properly respond to game events and player actions by registering appropriate
    trigger conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'RestStrategy strategy;

      strategy.InitializeTriggers();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization of an AI
    strategy. It is not thread-safe and should be executed in the main game thread
    to avoid race conditions with AI state management.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in duplicate trigger registrations,
    leading to unexpected behavior or performance degradation. Ensure that all necessary
    preconditions for rest behavior are properly configured before invoking this method.
