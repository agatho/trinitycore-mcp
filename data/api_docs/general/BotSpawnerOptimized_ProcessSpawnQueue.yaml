  method: ProcessSpawnQueue
  signature: void BotSpawnerOptimized::ProcessSpawnQueue()
documentation:
  brief: Processes the bot spawn queue to handle pending bot spawning requests in
    the optimized spawner system.
  description: The ProcessSpawnQueue method is responsible for iterating through and
    executing all pending bot spawning operations that have been queued for processing.
    This method ensures that bots are spawned according to configured limits, cooldowns,
    and priority rules within the BotSpawnerOptimized class. It typically runs during
    game ticks or at scheduled intervals to maintain an optimal number of active bots
    while respecting server resource constraints. The method may check for valid spawn
    locations, verify player availability, and manage internal state tracking for
    each queued spawn request.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    botSpawnerOptimized.ProcessSpawnQueue();\n\
      \    // Other update logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Spawning Logic
    code: "class MyBotManager\n{\npublic:\n    void Tick()\n    {\n        botSpawnerOptimized.ProcessSpawnQueue();\n\
      \        if (ShouldSpawnMoreBots())\n        {\n            botSpawnerOptimized.AddToSpawnQueue(playerGuid);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called regularly from the main game loop or
    a dedicated update thread. It's important that this method does not block for
    extended periods as it may impact overall server performance. The internal queue
    management handles concurrency, but developers should ensure that external calls
    to AddToSpawnQueue are thread-safe if used from multiple threads.
  warnings: Calling this method directly without proper game loop integration may
    lead to inconsistent bot states or spawn behavior. Avoid calling ProcessSpawnQueue
    recursively or from within other methods that modify the spawn queue to prevent
    potential race conditions or stack overflow issues.
