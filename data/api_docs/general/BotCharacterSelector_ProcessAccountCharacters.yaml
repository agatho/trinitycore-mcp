  class: BotCharacterSelector
  method: ProcessAccountCharacters
  signature: void BotCharacterSelector::ProcessAccountCharacters(uint32 accountId,
    const int & request, int characters, int callback)
documentation:
  brief: Processes account characters for bot selection based on provided request
    parameters and callback mechanism.
  description: The ProcessAccountCharacters method handles the retrieval and processing
    of character data associated with a specific account ID. It utilizes the provided
    request parameter to determine what type of character information should be fetched,
    and then invokes a callback function with the resulting character count. This
    method is typically used in bot management systems to populate character lists
    for automated gameplay or selection logic. The method operates asynchronously
    through the callback mechanism, allowing the calling code to continue execution
    while the character data is being processed.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: Unique identifier of the account whose characters are to be processed.
      Must be a valid, non-zero account ID in the database.
  - name: request
    description: Integer value indicating the type of character request to process.
      Values may represent different filtering criteria or data retrieval modes (e.g.,
      all characters, online only, specific class).
  - name: characters
    description: Integer representing the number of characters found for the given
      account. This parameter is typically populated by the method during processing
      and passed to the callback.
  - name: callback
    description: Integer identifier or function pointer that specifies which callback
      handler should be invoked after character processing completes. Used to route
      results to appropriate handlers in the bot system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotCharacterSelector selector;

      uint32 accountId = 12345;

      int requestType = 0; // All characters

      int characterCount = 0;

      int callbackId = 1; // Callback for character list processing

      selector.ProcessAccountCharacters(accountId, requestType, characterCount, callbackId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple Requests
    code: 'BotCharacterSelector selector;

      uint32 accountId = 12345;

      int onlineOnlyRequest = 1; // Filter for online characters only

      int characterCount = 0;

      int callbackId = 2; // Callback for online character list

      selector.ProcessAccountCharacters(accountId, onlineOnlyRequest, characterCount,
      callbackId);

      // Another request for specific class

      int warriorRequest = 3; // Warriors only

      selector.ProcessAccountCharacters(accountId, warriorRequest, characterCount,
      callbackId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore bot management system and relies on
    database queries to fetch character information. The callback mechanism allows
    for asynchronous processing, which improves performance in multi-bot scenarios.
    Developers should ensure that the accountId exists in the database before calling
    this method to avoid errors.
  warnings: Passing an invalid accountId may result in undefined behavior or database
    query failures. Ensure that the request parameter values are within expected ranges
    to prevent unexpected filtering results. The callback mechanism must be properly
    initialized and registered before calling this method.
