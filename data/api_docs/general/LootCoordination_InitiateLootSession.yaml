  class: LootCoordination
  method: InitiateLootSession
  signature: void LootCoordination::InitiateLootSession(Group * group, Loot * loot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a loot coordination session for a group with specified loot.
  description: The InitiateLootSession method starts a loot distribution process within
    a group context. It prepares the necessary data structures and communication channels
    to manage how loot items are distributed among group members according to the
    configured loot rules. This typically involves setting up timers, notifying players
    of pending loot, and preparing for loot rolling or direct assignment based on
    group settings. The method is usually invoked when a creature or container is
    looted by a group, triggering the coordination logic to ensure fair distribution.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group of players who
      will participate in the loot coordination session.
  - name: loot
    description: Pointer to the Loot object containing the items and distribution
      information for the current loot session.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a loot handler
    code: "void HandleCreatureLoot(Creature* creature, Player* player) {\n    Group*\
      \ group = player->GetGroup();\n    if (!group)\n        return;\n    \n    Loot*\
      \ loot = &creature->loot;\n    loot->Initialize(player);\n    \n    LootCoordination::InitiateLootSession(group,\
      \ loot);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided Group and Loot objects are valid and
    properly initialized. It may modify internal state of both objects to track loot
    distribution progress.
