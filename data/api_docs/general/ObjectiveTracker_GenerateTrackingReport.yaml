  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: GenerateTrackingReport
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::GenerateTrackingReport(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a detailed tracking report for the specified player's objectives
    and quests.
  description: The GenerateTrackingReport method compiles and outputs a comprehensive
    summary of all active objectives and quests assigned to the given player. This
    functionality is typically used within the context of quest management, objective
    tracking, or debugging tools. The method iterates through the player's current
    quest log and active objectives, gathering relevant data such as progress status,
    rewards, and completion criteria. It may also integrate with the game's internal
    tracking systems to provide real-time updates on quest progression. This method
    is often invoked when a player requests a status update or when automated systems
    need to evaluate quest completion states.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object for which the tracking report will
      be generated. This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid player
      instance within the game world.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      ObjectiveTracker tracker;

      tracker.GenerateTrackingReport(player);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Status Check
    code: "void CheckAndReportQuestStatus(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player && player->GetQuestStatus(12345)\
      \ == QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE)\n    {\n        ObjectiveTracker tracker;\n  \
      \      tracker.GenerateTrackingReport(player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state of the player's quest log and objective
    tracking system. It assumes that all relevant quest data has been properly initialized
    and synchronized with the game server. The output may vary depending on the player's
    current quest progression and whether any objectives are actively being tracked.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null, as passing an invalid pointer can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    Additionally, calling this method during critical gameplay moments might impact
    performance if large numbers of quests are active.
