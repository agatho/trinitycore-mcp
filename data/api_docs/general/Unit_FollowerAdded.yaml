  class: Unit
  method: FollowerAdded
  signature: void Unit::FollowerAdded(AbstractFollower * f)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a follower to the unit's follower list and triggers associated events.
  description: The FollowerAdded method is called when a new follower is added to
    a Unit, typically in the context of World of Warcraft's follower system. This
    method handles the internal processing required when a follower is added to a
    unit's collection, including updating the unit's follower list and potentially
    triggering related events or callbacks. It ensures proper integration of the follower
    into the unit's existing follower management system and may involve various game
    mechanics such as quest completion, achievement unlocking, or resource updates.
  parameters:
  - name: f
    description: Pointer to the AbstractFollower object being added to the unit. This
      parameter must be a valid pointer to an existing follower instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      AbstractFollower* follower = new AbstractFollower();

      unit->FollowerAdded(follower);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with event handling
    code: "Unit* unit = new Unit();\nAbstractFollower* follower = new AbstractFollower();\n\
      unit->FollowerAdded(follower);\n// Additional logic to handle events\nif (follower->IsQuestCompleted())\
      \ {\n    unit->HandleQuestCompletion();\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally during follower addition processes
    and may involve multiple internal callbacks. It should be called only when the
    follower is confirmed to be valid and ready for integration into the unit's system.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to memory leaks or invalid pointer
    access. Ensure that the follower object is properly initialized before calling
    this method.
