  class: TriggerFactory
  method: GetAvailableTriggers
  signature: int TriggerFactory::GetAvailableTriggers() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total count of available triggers managed by the TriggerFactory
    instance.
  description: The GetAvailableTriggers method returns an integer representing the
    number of triggers currently available within the TriggerFactory. This count typically
    reflects the number of active or registered triggers that can be invoked or processed
    by the system. The method is read-only and does not modify any internal state.
    It is commonly used in game logic to determine how many triggers are ready for
    execution, particularly in event-driven systems or scripted environments where
    trigger availability impacts gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value indicating the number of available triggers. A return
    value of zero means no triggers are currently available, while a positive integer
    represents the total count of triggers that can be accessed or executed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "TriggerFactory factory;\nint triggerCount = factory.GetAvailableTriggers();\n\
      if (triggerCount > 0) {\n    // Proceed with trigger processing\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Available triggers: \" << triggerCount << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other TriggerFactory methods
    to manage and iterate over available triggers. It may be called frequently during
    game updates or event processing, so performance should be considered in high-frequency
    scenarios.
