  class: Totem
  method: UpdateMaxHealth
  signature: void Totem::UpdateMaxHealth()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the maximum health value of the totem based on its current properties
    and effects.
  description: The UpdateMaxHealth method recalculates and sets the maximum health
    value for a Totem object. This method is typically invoked when the totem's stats,
    buffs, or ownership changes, ensuring that the totem's health reflects its current
    state. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, totems are temporary summoned
    creatures that can have varying health values depending on their type, level,
    and any active modifiers. This method ensures internal consistency by updating
    the totem's maximum health attribute to match its current configuration. The update
    process may involve recalculating base stats, applying buffs or debuffs, and considering
    the caster's influence.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Totem* totem = player->GetTotem(TOTEM_SLOT_FIRE);\nif (totem)\n{\n    totem->UpdateMaxHealth();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Health After Buff Application
    code: "Aura* aura = totem->AddAura(SPELL_ID_ENHANCED_TOTEM, totem);\nif (aura)\n\
      {\n    totem->UpdateMaxHealth();\n    totem->SetHealth(totem->GetMaxHealth());\
      \ // Ensure health is within new limits\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally calls the base Creature::UpdateMaxHealth() function,
    ensuring that all creature-specific health calculations are applied. It should
    be called after any changes to the totem's stats or status effects that might
    affect its maximum health value.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context may cause unexpected behavior
    if not paired with appropriate health adjustments. Always ensure that the totem's
    current health is adjusted accordingly after calling UpdateMaxHealth() to maintain
    consistency.
