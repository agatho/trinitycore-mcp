  class: AuctionManager
  method: OnInitialize
  signature: bool AuctionManager::OnInitialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the auction house system and sets up required data structures
    for auction management.
  description: The OnInitialize method is responsible for setting up the auction house
    functionality within the TrinityCore server. It performs essential initialization
    tasks such as loading auction data from the database, creating necessary internal
    structures, and preparing the system to handle auction-related operations. This
    method is typically called during server startup or when the auction house module
    is first activated. The method ensures that all required resources are properly
    allocated and configured before the auction system can be used by players. It
    also handles any preconditions needed for the auction manager to function correctly,
    such as verifying database connections and initializing internal caches.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initialization was successful and all systems were
    properly set up; returns false if there was a failure during initialization, such
    as database connection issues or missing required data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Check
    code: "AuctionManager auctionMgr;\nbool success = auctionMgr.OnInitialize();\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Auction system is ready for use\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Auction House initialized successfully.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle initialization\
      \ failure\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to initialize Auction House!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the server's lifecycle. Repeated
    calls may lead to resource leaks or undefined behavior. The method performs database
    operations and may block briefly while loading auction data. It is recommended
    to call this method during server startup when system resources are less constrained.
  warnings: Do not call this method from within time-critical sections of code as
    it may perform blocking operations. Ensure that all required database tables exist
    before calling this method, otherwise initialization will fail. Avoid calling
    OnInitialize multiple times without proper cleanup between calls.
