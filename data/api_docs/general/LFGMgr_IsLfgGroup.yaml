  class: LFGMgr
  method: IsLfgGroup
  signature: bool LFGMgr::IsLfgGroup(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a given group GUID corresponds to a valid LFG group in the
    system.
  description: The IsLfgGroup method determines if a specified group identifier (GUID)
    represents an active Looking For Group (LFG) group within the TrinityCore framework.
    This utility function is commonly used during group operations, such as verifying
    group eligibility for LFG activities or ensuring that a group has not been disbanded.
    The method performs internal validation to confirm that the provided GUID exists
    in the LFG manager's registered groups and is currently active. It does not validate
    player membership or group composition beyond checking if the group ID itself
    is recognized by the LFG system.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group to check. This should be
      a valid group GUID obtained from the game's object manager, typically representing
      a player group or raid instance.
  returns: Returns true if the specified group GUID corresponds to an active LFG group
    in the system; otherwise returns false. A return value of false may indicate that
    the group does not exist, has been disbanded, or is not registered with the LFG
    manager.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (sLFGMgr->IsLfgGroup(groupGuid)) {\n    // The group is a valid LFG\
      \ group\n    sLog->outString(\"Group %u is an LFG group.\", groupGuid);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // The group is not recognized as an LFG group\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Group %u is not an LFG group.\", groupGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Group Management
    code: "void HandleLfgGroupCheck(Player* player, uint64 groupGuid) {\n    if (sLFGMgr->IsLfgGroup(groupGuid))\
      \ {\n        // Proceed with LFG-related operations\n        sLFGMgr->AddPlayerToLfgQueue(player);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Inform the player that the group is not valid for\
      \ LFG\n        player->SendSystemMessage(\"Invalid group for LFG.\");\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal data structures maintained by the LFG manager
    and should only be called with valid GUIDs. It is recommended to validate that
    the GUID refers to a group before calling this method, as invalid GUIDs may lead
    to undefined behavior or performance degradation. The method performs a lookup
    in an internal registry of active LFG groups, so it may have performance implications
    when used frequently in tight loops.
  warnings: Do not assume that a group identified as an LFG group is necessarily eligible
    for joining or participating in LFG activities. Additional checks such as player
    eligibility, queue status, and group leader permissions should be performed separately.
    This method does not verify whether the group has been disbanded or if its members
    are still valid.
