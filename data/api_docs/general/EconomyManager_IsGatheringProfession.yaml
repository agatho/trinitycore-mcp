documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified profession is a gathering profession.
  description: The IsGatheringProfession method checks if a given profession is classified
    as a gathering profession within the TrinityCore framework. Gathering professions
    typically include skills like Mining, Herbalism, and Skinning that allow players
    to collect resources from the environment. This method is commonly used in game
    logic to differentiate between crafting professions (like Blacksmithing or Tailoring)
    and gathering professions, which may have distinct behaviors, cooldowns, or resource
    requirements. The method performs a simple lookup against an internal list or
    classification of professions to determine their category.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified profession is a gathering profession; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Herbalism is a Gathering Profession
    code: 'EconomyManager economyMgr;

      Profession herbalism = Profession::HERBALISM;

      bool isGathering = economyMgr.IsGatheringProfession(herbalism);

      // isGathering will be true for Herbalism'
    language: cpp
  - title: Validate Multiple Professions
    code: "EconomyManager economyMgr;\nstd::vector<Profession> professions = {Profession::MINING,\
      \ Profession::BLACKSMITHING, Profession::SKINNING};\nfor (const auto& prof :\
      \ professions) {\n    if (economyMgr.IsGatheringProfession(prof)) {\n      \
      \  std::cout << \"Gathering profession: \" << static_cast<int>(prof) << std::endl;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on an internal classification system for professions.
    Developers should be aware that the definition of 'gathering profession' may vary
    depending on the TrinityCore version and any custom modifications to the profession
    system. The method is designed to be fast and efficient, suitable for frequent
    calls in game logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the Profession enum values passed to this method are valid
    and correspond to actual professions defined in the TrinityCore codebase. Passing
    invalid or uninitialized profession values may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    results.
