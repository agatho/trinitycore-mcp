  class: SpellScriptBase
  method: ValidateSpellEffect
  signature: bool SpellScriptBase::ValidateSpellEffect(int effects)
documentation:
  brief: Validates spell effects for a spell script and returns true if all effects
    are valid.
  description: The ValidateSpellEffect method checks whether the spell effects defined
    in a spell script are valid according to the game's internal validation rules.
    This method is typically called during spell initialization or loading to ensure
    that the spell effects conform to expected parameters and do not contain invalid
    configurations. It helps prevent runtime errors caused by malformed spell data
    and ensures that spells behave as intended within the TrinityCore framework. The
    method performs checks on effect types, targets, and other spell-related parameters
    to maintain game integrity.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all spell effects are valid according to internal validation
    rules; otherwise returns false if any effect fails validation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    bool ValidateSpellEffect(int\
      \ effects) override\n    {\n        // Perform custom validation logic here\n\
      \        return SpellScriptBase::ValidateSpellEffect(effects);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell script validation lifecycle and should be
    overridden in custom spell scripts to provide additional validation beyond base
    functionality. It's typically invoked during spell loading or initialization phases.
  warnings: Incorrect implementation of this method can lead to spells not being properly
    loaded or causing runtime exceptions. Ensure that any override maintains compatibility
    with the core validation logic.
