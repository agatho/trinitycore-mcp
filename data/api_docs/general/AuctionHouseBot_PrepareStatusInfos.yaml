  signature: void AuctionHouseBot::PrepareStatusInfos(int & statusInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Updates and prepares internal status information for the Auction House Bot's
    operations.
  description: The PrepareStatusInfos method is responsible for updating internal
    tracking variables and status flags that govern how the Auction House Bot operates.
    It typically collects or calculates current state data such as item counts, auction
    durations, bid statuses, or other operational metrics needed for the bot to make
    informed decisions about buying, selling, or managing auctions. This method is
    generally called internally by the bot's main loop or during specific events like
    auction updates or periodic maintenance cycles. The method modifies an integer
    reference parameter to reflect the current status of the bot's internal state,
    which may be used for logging, debugging, or triggering further actions within
    the Auction House Bot system.
  parameters:
  - name: statusInfo
    description: A reference to an integer that will be updated with the current status
      code or flag values. This value represents various operational states of the
      Auction House Bot such as idle, processing auctions, or encountering errors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AuctionHouseBot context
    code: 'int status = 0;

      AuctionHouseBot bot;

      bot.PrepareStatusInfos(status);

      // ''status'' now contains the updated operational state of the bot'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger internal workflow and may be invoked
    automatically by the Auction House Bot's core logic. It does not perform external
    API calls or interact directly with the game world, but rather prepares data for
    internal processing.
