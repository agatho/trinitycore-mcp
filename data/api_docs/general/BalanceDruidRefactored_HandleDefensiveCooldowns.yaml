documentation:
  brief: Handles the application and management of defensive cooldowns for the Balance
    Druid AI.
  description: The HandleDefensiveCooldowns method is responsible for managing and
    applying defensive cooldown abilities within the Balance Druid's AI logic. This
    method evaluates the current state of the druid, including health levels, threat
    situation, and available cooldowns, to determine when and how defensive abilities
    should be used. It ensures that defensive mechanics are properly integrated into
    the overall combat strategy, helping the druid survive longer in encounters by
    intelligently utilizing abilities such as Barkskin, Innervate, or other defensive
    cooldowns based on situational awareness and game state conditions.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MyBalanceDruidAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    HandleDefensiveCooldowns();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during the AI update cycle, ideally
    after threat assessment and before offensive action selection. It relies on internal
    state tracking of cooldowns and health status to make decisions.
