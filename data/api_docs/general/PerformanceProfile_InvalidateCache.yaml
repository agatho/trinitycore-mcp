  signature: void PerformanceProfile::InvalidateCache()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the internal performance profiling cache to ensure accurate subsequent
    measurements.
  description: The InvalidateCache method clears any cached performance data within
    the PerformanceProfile class. This ensures that subsequent profiling operations
    start with a clean state and do not use stale or outdated measurement data. The
    method is typically called when performance metrics need to be reset, such as
    before beginning a new profiling session or after significant system changes that
    could affect timing accuracy. This operation is essential for maintaining the
    integrity of performance measurements in TrinityCore's profiling system.

    code: 'PerformanceProfile profile;

      profile.InvalidateCache();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initiating new performance measurements
    to ensure accurate results. The cache invalidation is a lightweight operation
    that does not involve heavy computation or I/O operations.
