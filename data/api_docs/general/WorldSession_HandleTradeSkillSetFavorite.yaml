  brief: Sets or updates the favorite status of a trade skill for the player.
  description: The HandleTradeSkillSetFavorite method processes client requests to
    mark or unmark a specific trade skill as a favorite within the player's interface.
    This functionality allows players to quickly identify and access their most frequently
    used or preferred skills. The method receives a packet containing the trade skill
    identifier and the desired favorite state, then updates the player's saved preferences
    accordingly. It typically operates in the context of crafting, professions, or
    other skill-based systems where favorites enhance user experience by providing
    quick access to important entries.
  parameters:
  - name: tradeSkillSetFavorite

      favorite status (true for set as favorite, false for unset).

      worldSession->HandleTradeSkillSetFavorite(packet);'

  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's saved preferences database
