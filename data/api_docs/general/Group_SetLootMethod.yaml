documentation:
  brief: Sets the loot method for the group
  description: Configures the loot distribution method for the group, determining
    how loot is awarded to group members. This method updates the group's internal
    loot settings and broadcasts the change to all group members. The loot method
    affects how items are distributed when a monster is killed and loot is generated.
    Valid loot methods include free-for-all, round-robin, master loot, and need-before-greed.
    This setting is typically used by group leaders or raid leaders to manage loot
    distribution according to their group's preferences.
  parameters:
  - name: method
    description: 'The LootMethod enum value specifying the loot distribution style.
      Valid values include: LOOT_METHOD_FREEFORALL (free-for-all), LOOT_METHOD_ROUNDROBIN
      (round-robin), LOOT_METHOD_MASTERLOOT (master loot), and LOOT_METHOD_NEEDBEFOREGREED
      (need-before-greed).'
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set group to master loot method
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->SetLootMethod(LOOT_METHOD_MASTERLOOT);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Configure loot method based on group type
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && group->isRaidGroup())\n\
      {\n    // Use master loot for raids\n    group->SetLootMethod(LOOT_METHOD_MASTERLOOT);\n\
      }\nelse if (group)\n{\n    // Use free-for-all for small groups\n    group->SetLootMethod(LOOT_METHOD_FREEFORALL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method automatically broadcasts the new loot method to all group members
    via a packet update. The change takes effect immediately and affects all subsequent
    loot drops. The method does not validate whether the player has permission to
    change the loot method - this is typically handled by the calling code through
    group leadership checks.
  warnings: Changing the loot method while players are in combat or during active
    loot distribution may cause unexpected behavior. Ensure that the group leader
    has proper permissions before calling this method. The method does not prevent
    invalid loot methods from being set, so callers should validate input values.
