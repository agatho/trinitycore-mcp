  method: GetNextQuestToPick
  signature: uint32 QuestPickup::GetNextQuestToPick(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the next quest ID that a bot player should pick up based on available
    quest options and quest state.
  description: The GetNextQuestToPick method evaluates the current state of available
    quests for a given player bot, determining which quest should be picked up next
    in order to progress through the questing system. This method typically considers
    factors such as quest availability, prerequisites, player level, and quest flags
    to make an intelligent selection. It is commonly used in automated questing systems
    or AI-driven bots within TrinityCore's framework. The method returns a quest ID
    (as a uint32) representing the next logical quest to initiate, or zero if no suitable
    quest is available.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the quest ID of the next quest to pick up.
    A return value of 0 indicates that no valid quest is available for pickup at this
    time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot AI logic
    code: "uint32 nextQuestId = bot->GetNextQuestToPick();\nif (nextQuestId > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with quest pickup logic\n    bot->CompleteQuest(nextQuestId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically part of a larger questing AI system and may rely
    on internal quest state tracking. It assumes that the Player object passed in
    has been properly initialized with quest data and that the bot's quest log is
    up to date.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as it could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also, be aware that
    the returned quest ID may not always be immediately available for pickup due to
    prerequisites or other game conditions.
