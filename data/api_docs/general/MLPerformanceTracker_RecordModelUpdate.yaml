  class: MLPerformanceTracker
  method: RecordModelUpdate
  signature: void MLPerformanceTracker::RecordModelUpdate(uint32_t botGuid, uint64_t
    experienceCount)
documentation:
  brief: Records a model update event with associated bot GUID and experience count
    for performance tracking.
  description: The RecordModelUpdate method logs a model update event within the MLPerformanceTracker
    system. It takes a bot's unique identifier (GUID) and an experience count value
    to track how often models are updated and the associated experience values. This
    functionality is typically used in machine learning or AI-driven systems within
    TrinityCore to monitor performance metrics related to bot behavior updates. The
    method does not return any value but contributes to internal tracking mechanisms
    that may be used for debugging, optimization, or analytics purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose model update is being
      recorded. This value should correspond to a valid bot entity within the game
      world.
  - name: experienceCount
    description: The experience count associated with the model update event. This
      typically represents accumulated experience points or training data used for
      updating the bot's behavior model.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'MLPerformanceTracker tracker;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      uint64_t expCount = 98765;

      tracker.RecordModelUpdate(botGuid, expCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Bot Update Context
    code: "void OnBotUpdate(Bot* bot) {\n    uint32_t guid = bot->GetGUID();\n   \
      \ uint64_t experience = bot->GetExperience();\n    MLPerformanceTracker::Instance()->RecordModelUpdate(guid,\
      \ experience);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a performance monitoring system and may be
    used in conjunction with other tracking methods to gather comprehensive data on
    AI behavior updates. It's important to ensure that the botGuid corresponds to
    an active bot entity to avoid invalid tracking entries.
  warnings: Ensure that botGuid values are valid and correspond to existing bots to
    prevent tracking inconsistencies or errors. Repeated calls with identical parameters
    may skew performance metrics if not handled properly.
