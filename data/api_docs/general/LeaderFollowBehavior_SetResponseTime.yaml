  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: SetResponseTime
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::SetResponseTime(int ms)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the response time delay for the leader follow behavior in milliseconds.
  description: The SetResponseTime method configures the delay period, measured in
    milliseconds, that a follower unit will wait before responding to a leader's movement
    commands or actions. This parameter directly affects how quickly the AI reacts
    to changes in leadership behavior, such as when the leader stops, moves, or initiates
    combat. The response time is crucial for creating realistic group dynamics in
    World of Warcraft scenarios where followers need to maintain proper distance and
    coordination with their leader. This method typically modifies internal state
    variables used by the AI system to control timing of follower actions.
  parameters:
  - name: ms
    description: The response time delay in milliseconds. Valid values are positive
      integers representing time intervals. Typical values range from 100ms to 2000ms
      depending on desired responsiveness and game context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Standard Response Time
    code: 'LeaderFollowBehavior* behavior = new LeaderFollowBehavior();

      behavior->SetResponseTime(500); // Set 500ms response delay'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting for Fast-Paced Combat
    code: 'LeaderFollowBehavior* combatBehavior = GetUnit()->GetAI()->GetLeaderFollowBehavior();

      combatBehavior->SetResponseTime(150); // Quick response for tactical movements'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal timing parameters used by the AI system. Changes
    take effect immediately on subsequent AI updates. The response time value should
    be carefully chosen to balance between responsiveness and performance, as very
    low values may cause excessive CPU usage due to frequent AI processing.
  warnings: Setting extremely low response times (below 50ms) may cause performance
    issues or unstable behavior in the AI system. This method should not be called
    from within critical AI update loops to avoid potential recursion or race conditions.
