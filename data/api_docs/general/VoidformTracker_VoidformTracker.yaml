documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the VoidformTracker class with default values.
  description: The VoidformTracker constructor initializes a new instance of the VoidformTracker
    class. This class is typically used to track the state and duration of voidform
    effects in the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation.
    The constructor sets up internal tracking variables such as the current voidform
    duration, whether the player is currently in voidform, and any associated cooldowns
    or modifiers. It ensures that all member variables are properly initialized to
    their default states before the object can be used for tracking voidform-related
    gameplay mechanics.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new VoidformTracker instance
    code: 'VoidformTracker tracker;

      // The tracker is now initialized with default values

      // and can be used to track voidform state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when creating a new VoidformTracker
    object. It does not perform any validation or initialization of external dependencies.
    The class assumes that the underlying game state will be managed by other systems
    such as the player's spell effect handlers.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly on an already initialized tracker
    instance, as it may lead to undefined behavior if internal state is not properly
    reset. Ensure proper memory management when using this class in dynamic allocation
    scenarios.
