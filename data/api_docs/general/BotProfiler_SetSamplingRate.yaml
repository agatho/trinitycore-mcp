documentation:
  brief: Sets the sampling rate for bot profiling data collection
  description: Configures the frequency at which bot performance metrics are recorded
    by the profiler. This value determines how often sample points are taken during
    bot execution, with higher rates providing more granular data but potentially
    impacting performance. The sampling rate is typically expressed in samples per
    second or as a time interval between measurements.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Sampling Rate to 100 Hz
    code: BotProfiler::SetSamplingRate(100.0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Configure High-Frequency Profiling
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      profiler.SetSamplingRate(500.0); // 500 samples per second'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely affects internal timer mechanisms and memory allocation
    for storing profiling data points. Changes to the sampling rate may require a
    restart of profiling sessions to take effect properly.
  warnings: Setting extremely high sampling rates may cause performance degradation
    or memory exhaustion in systems with limited resources. Ensure that the specified
    rate is appropriate for your hardware and profiling requirements.
