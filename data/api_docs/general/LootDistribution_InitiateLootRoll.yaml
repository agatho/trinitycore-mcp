  signature: void LootDistribution::InitiateLootRoll(Group * group, const LootItem
    & item)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a loot roll for a group member when an item is distributed.
  description: The InitiateLootRoll method starts the loot rolling process for a specific
    item within a group context. It is typically called when a loot item has been
    awarded to a group member and needs to be rolled for using the group's loot rules
    (such as round-robin or free-for-all). This method handles the necessary game
    state updates and broadcasts the roll request to all eligible group members. The
    function does not directly determine the winner; instead, it sets up the environment
    for players to roll and determines the outcome based on the rolling results.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object that will participate in the loot roll.
      Must be a valid group with at least one member.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing details about the
      item being rolled for, including item entry ID, stack size, and other relevant
      properties.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic loot roll initiation
    code: 'Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      LootItem item;

      item.itemid = 12345;

      item.count = 1;

      // Assume item is properly initialized

      lootDist->InitiateLootRoll(group, item);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group and item parameters are valid and properly
    initialized. The actual roll results are processed separately by the game's loot
    system after this call. It is intended to be used during the loot distribution
    phase of a group encounter or quest reward.
