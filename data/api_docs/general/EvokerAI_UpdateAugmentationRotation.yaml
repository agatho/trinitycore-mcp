  method: UpdateAugmentationRotation
  signature: void EvokerAI::UpdateAugmentationRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the evoker's augmentation rotation based on current target and spell
    availability.
  description: The UpdateAugmentationRotation method manages the core logic for an
    Evoker AI's spell rotation during combat. It evaluates the current target, checks
    for available spells in the augmentation rotation, and determines the optimal
    next spell to cast. This method is typically called during the AI update cycle
    and integrates with the evoker's overall combat strategy. The method considers
    factors such as spell cooldowns, target health, and positional requirements to
    make intelligent casting decisions. It updates internal state variables related
    to the current rotation sequence and ensures that the evoker maintains an effective
    damage or healing output.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the integer representing the target's ID or index in the
      combat system. This parameter identifies which entity the evoker should focus
      on during the rotation update.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI Loop
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n   \
      \     return;\n\n    int targetId = static_cast<int>(me->GetVictim()->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      \    UpdateAugmentationRotation(&targetId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Evoker's combat AI logic and should only be called
    when the evoker is actively engaged in combat. The target parameter must point
    to a valid combatant; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. The implementation
    assumes that spell availability and cooldowns are properly tracked by the AI system.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of a combat context as it relies on active
    target evaluation and spell state tracking. Passing an invalid or null pointer
    for the target parameter can lead to crashes or incorrect rotation behavior.
