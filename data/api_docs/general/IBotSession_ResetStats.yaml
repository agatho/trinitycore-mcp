documentation:
  brief: Resets all statistics and counters for the bot session to their initial values.
  description: The ResetStats method clears all accumulated statistics and counters
    within the bot session, restoring them to their default state. This includes resetting
    kill counts, quest progress, item collections, and any other tracked metrics that
    are specific to the bot's activity during the session. The method is typically
    invoked when starting a new simulation or when a bot needs to be reinitialized
    without restarting the entire system. It ensures clean state management for accurate
    performance tracking and prevents carry-over of data between different testing
    scenarios.

  notes: This method should be called before initiating a new bot simulation to ensure
    accurate statistics. It does not affect the bot's configuration or settings, only
    its runtime metrics.
