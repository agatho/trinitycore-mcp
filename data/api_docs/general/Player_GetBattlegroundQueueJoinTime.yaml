documentation:
  brief: Returns the timestamp when the player joined a battleground queue
  description: This method retrieves the time when a player first entered a specific
    battleground queue. It returns the Unix timestamp representing the moment the
    player joined the queue, which is useful for tracking queue participation duration
    and determining eligibility for rewards. The method is commonly used in battleground-related
    systems to monitor player activity and ensure proper timing of rewards distribution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the Unix timestamp when the player
    joined the battleground queue. This value represents the number of seconds since
    January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC, and can be used to calculate time differences or
    determine queue participation duration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 joinTime = player->GetBattlegroundQueueJoinTime(0);

      // joinTime now contains the timestamp when player joined the first battleground
      queue'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal battleground queue tracking system. It
    should be used in conjunction with other queue-related methods for complete queue
    management functionality. The returned value represents a Unix timestamp which
    can be converted to local time using standard time conversion functions.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining player eligibility for
    rewards without proper context, as it only provides the join time and not the
    actual reward eligibility status. It is recommended to use this method in combination
    with other queue tracking methods for accurate gameplay mechanics.
