  class: AuctionHouse
  method: GetAuctionSession
  signature: AuctionSession AuctionHouse::GetAuctionSession(uint32 sessionId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the auction session associated with the specified session ID.
  description: The GetAuctionSession method is used to fetch an AuctionSession object
    from the auction house system based on a given session identifier. This method
    allows access to the state and data of a specific auction session, which may include
    active auctions, bid information, or player-related auction activities. It is
    typically invoked when processing auction-related operations such as placing bids,
    listing items, or retrieving auction details for a particular user or session
    context. The method assumes that a valid session ID has been provided, and it
    will return the corresponding session object if found.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionId
    description: A unique identifier representing a specific auction session. This
      value is typically generated when a player initiates an interaction with the
      auction house system, such as opening the auction interface or starting a new
      auction transaction.
  returns: An AuctionSession object associated with the provided session ID. If no
    matching session exists, the method may return a default or invalid session object,
    depending on implementation details. The returned session can be used to access
    auction data and perform further operations within that specific session context.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Auction Session by Session ID
    code: "AuctionSession session = auctionHouse.GetAuctionSession(12345);\nif (session.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Process the auction session\n    std::cout << \"Session retrieved\
      \ successfully\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"Invalid or non-existent\
      \ session\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger auction house subsystem that manages
    multiple concurrent sessions. Developers should ensure that the session ID passed
    to this method is valid and corresponds to an active session; otherwise, unexpected
    behavior or errors may occur. The returned AuctionSession object might not be
    thread-safe, so access should be synchronized if used in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or uninitialized session ID could lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always validate the session ID before calling this method
    and check the validity of the returned AuctionSession object to prevent runtime
    errors.
