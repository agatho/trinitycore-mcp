  class: CellCache
  method: GetLastUpdateTime
  signature: uint32 CellCache::GetLastUpdateTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the last update time of the cell cache in milliseconds since server
    start.
  description: The GetLastUpdateTime method retrieves the timestamp of when the CellCache
    was last updated. This value represents the number of milliseconds elapsed since
    the server started, and it's used internally by the TrinityCore framework to track
    when cell data was last modified or refreshed. The method is typically used for
    synchronization purposes between different systems that rely on up-to-date cell
    information, such as object tracking, visibility calculations, or zone-based event
    management. This timestamp helps ensure that game entities are properly managed
    and that players see accurate representations of their surroundings based on the
    most recent data available.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of milliseconds since server startup
    when the cell cache was last updated. This value is typically used for time-based
    comparisons and synchronization within the game engine.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Cell Cache Update Time
    code: "uint32 lastUpdate = cellCache.GetLastUpdateTime();\nuint32 currentTime\
      \ = getMSTime();\nif (currentTime - lastUpdate > 5000) // 5 seconds\n{\n   \
      \ // Cell cache hasn't been updated in 5 seconds, refresh it\n    cellCache.Update();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a monotonic timestamp that is updated whenever the cell
    data changes. The value is stored as a simple uint32 and wraps around after approximately
    49 days of continuous server uptime (due to 32-bit integer overflow). For performance
    reasons, this method performs no locking or synchronization operations since it's
    typically called from within thread-safe contexts.
  warnings: Be aware that the returned value is a raw millisecond timestamp that may
    wrap around after ~49 days of server uptime. When comparing timestamps across
    long periods, consider using proper time difference calculations to handle potential
    overflow scenarios correctly.
