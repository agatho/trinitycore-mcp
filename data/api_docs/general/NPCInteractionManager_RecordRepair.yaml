  method: RecordRepair
  signature: void NPCInteractionManager::RecordRepair(uint32 cost)
documentation:
  brief: Records a repair transaction with the specified cost for the interacting
    NPC.
  description: The RecordRepair method is used to log or store the cost of a repair
    performed by an NPC for a player. This method likely updates internal tracking
    mechanisms within the NPCInteractionManager to maintain records of transactions,
    which may be used for quest progress, reputation changes, or other gameplay mechanics
    related to NPC interactions. The method does not perform the actual repair but
    rather logs the occurrence and cost of the repair event.
  parameters:
  - name: cost
    description: The gold amount deducted from the player's inventory for the repair
      transaction. Must be a non-negative integer representing the cost in copper
      coins.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Repair Recording
    code: 'NPCInteractionManager* interactionMgr = player->GetNPCInteractionManager();

      interactionMgr->RecordRepair(5000); // Records a repair costing 50 silver'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Repair After Item Repair
    code: "uint32 repairCost = player->GetRepairCostForItem(item);\nif (repairCost\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    interactionMgr->RecordRepair(repairCost);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called after a successful repair operation has been
    completed by an NPC. It's important to ensure that the cost parameter accurately
    reflects the amount deducted from the player's inventory, as this value may influence
    other systems like quest tracking or reputation calculations.
