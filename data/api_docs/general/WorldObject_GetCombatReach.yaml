documentation:
  brief: Returns the combat reach distance of the WorldObject
  description: The GetCombatReach method retrieves the combat reach distance of a
    WorldObject, which represents the maximum distance at which an object can engage
    in combat with other objects. This value is crucial for determining whether an
    object can attack another object based on their positioning. The method returns
    a float value representing the distance in yards, and it's typically used in conjunction
    with other combat-related calculations to determine if objects are within range
    of each other.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the combat reach distance in yards.
    This value is typically used to determine if objects are within combat range of
    each other, with values usually ranging from 0.0 to 10.0 depending on the object
    type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float reach = object->GetCombatReach();\nif (reach > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Do\
      \ something with combat reach\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the WorldObject class and is used primarily in combat
    calculations. The value returned represents the distance at which an object can
    engage in combat, and it's important to note that this value may vary based on
    the specific object type (player, creature, etc.) and their current state.
  warnings: This method should not be used for direct comparison with other objects'
    positions without considering the actual combat reach of both objects. The combat
    reach is not necessarily equal to the distance between two objects, and it's important
    to understand that this value represents a maximum distance rather than a precise
    measurement.
