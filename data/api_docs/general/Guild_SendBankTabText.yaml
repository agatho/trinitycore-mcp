  class: Guild
  method: SendBankTabText
  signature: void Guild::SendBankTabText(WorldSession * session, uint8 tabId) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends the text content of a specified bank tab to the player's session.
  description: The SendBankTabText method is responsible for transmitting the textual
    information associated with a specific bank tab within a guild to the client of
    the provided WorldSession. This typically includes the tab's name and any custom
    text set by the guild master or officers. The method ensures that the client receives
    updated or initial data about the bank tab's description, which may be displayed
    in the guild bank interface. It is commonly invoked when a player opens their
    guild bank or requests to view a specific tab's contents.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: A pointer to the WorldSession of the player who will receive the
      bank tab text. This session must be valid and associated with an active player
      in the game world.
  - name: tabId
    description: An 8-bit unsigned integer representing the index of the bank tab
      to send text for. Valid values are typically between 0 and the maximum number
      of tabs allowed per guild, usually up to 9 or more depending on server configuration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    WorldSession* session\
      \ = player->GetSession();\n    guild->SendBankTabText(session, 0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending Text for Multiple Tabs
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    WorldSession* session\
      \ = player->GetSession();\n    for (uint8 i = 0; i < MAX_GUILD_BANK_TABS; ++i)\n\
      \    {\n        guild->SendBankTabText(session, i);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild bank tab data structures
    to retrieve and format the text before sending it over the network. It should
    only be called when the session is valid and the player has appropriate permissions
    to view the guild bank. The actual packet sent may vary based on TrinityCore version
    and client compatibility.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided WorldSession is valid and not null, as passing
    a null pointer could lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Also, verify that
    tabId is within acceptable bounds to prevent out-of-bounds access in internal
    data structures.
