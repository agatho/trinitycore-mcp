  method: isMapLoadingEnabled
  signature: bool IVMapManager::isMapLoadingEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether map loading is enabled in the VMap manager.
  description: The isMapLoadingEnabled method determines if the VMap (Virtual Map)
    system is currently allowing map data to be loaded into memory. This functionality
    is crucial for dynamic terrain and object loading in World of Warcraft environments.
    The method returns a boolean value indicating the current state of the map loading
    flag, which can be used by other systems to decide whether to attempt loading
    additional map data or defer operations until loading is enabled.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if map loading is currently enabled, false otherwise. This
    indicates whether the VMap manager will process and load new map data when requested.
  examples:
  - title: Check Map Loading Status Before Loading
    code: "if (VMapManager2::instance()->isMapLoadingEnabled()) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with loading map data\n    sVMapManager->loadMap(\"world/maps\", 1234);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle case where loading is disabled\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL,\
      \ \"Map loading is currently disabled.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the VMap manager and related
    systems to control when map data can be loaded. It may be toggled on or off during
    server initialization or runtime based on system resources or configuration settings.
