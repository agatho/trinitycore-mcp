  class: BattlePetMgr
  method: SendUpdates
  signature: void BattlePetMgr::SendUpdates(int pets, bool petAdded)
documentation:
  brief: Sends battle pet update messages to the player's client.
  description: The SendUpdates method is responsible for transmitting battle pet status
    information to the connected player's client. This method typically handles synchronization
    of pet data such as pet IDs, levels, health, and other relevant attributes. It
    ensures that the client's UI accurately reflects the current state of the player's
    battle pets. The method may be invoked automatically when pets are added or removed,
    or manually during specific game events requiring synchronization. This functionality
    is crucial for maintaining a consistent gameplay experience in World of Warcraft's
    battle pet system.
  parameters:
  - name: pets
    description: An integer representing the number of pets to update or the pet index
      being modified. This parameter likely determines which specific pets should
      have their data sent to the client.
  - name: petAdded
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether a new pet was added. When true,
      this signals that the update message should include newly acquired pet information;
      when false, it typically updates existing pet data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: battlePetMgr->SendUpdates(1, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Existing Pets
    code: battlePetMgr->SendUpdates(3, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the WorldSession to send packets containing
    battle pet data. It's important to note that this method should only be called
    when there are actual changes to report, as unnecessary calls can cause performance
    overhead. The implementation may batch updates for efficiency.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context or validation might result
    in incorrect UI states or client-side errors. Ensure that pets exist and are properly
    initialized before sending update messages.
