  signature: void BotHealthCheck::TriggerSystemRecovery()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a system recovery process for the bot's health management system.
  description: The TriggerSystemRecovery method is responsible for activating a recovery
    mechanism within the bot's health checking subsystem. This function likely resets
    or reinitializes internal health monitoring states, clears any failed checks,
    and ensures that the bot's health status is properly synchronized with the game
    environment. It may also trigger notifications or logging to indicate that a recovery
    operation has been initiated. The method is typically called when the system detects
    inconsistencies in health tracking or when manual intervention is required to
    restore proper functionality.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotHealthCheck* healthCheck = new BotHealthCheck();

      healthCheck->TriggerSystemRecovery();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used cautiously as it may reset internal state and
    could potentially interrupt ongoing health monitoring operations. It is recommended
    to call this only when system integrity issues are detected or during controlled
    maintenance windows.
  warnings: Calling TriggerSystemRecovery while the bot is actively engaged in combat
    or critical tasks may cause temporary loss of health status updates, leading to
    unexpected behavior or performance degradation.
