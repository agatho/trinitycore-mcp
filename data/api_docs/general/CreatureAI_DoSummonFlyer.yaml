  class: CreatureAI
  method: DoSummonFlyer
  signature: Creature * CreatureAI::DoSummonFlyer(int entry, WorldObject * obj, float
    flightZ, float radius, int despawnTime, int summonType)
documentation:
  brief: Summons a flying creature at the specified location with optional flight
    height and despawn behavior.
  description: The DoSummonFlyer method is used by CreatureAI to summon a creature
    that will fly to a designated position. It creates a new creature instance of
    the specified entry type, positions it relative to the provided WorldObject, and
    sets its initial flight path. The summoned creature will automatically despawn
    after the specified time unless otherwise configured. This method is typically
    used for AI-driven summons such as flying enemies or summoned pets that need to
    follow a specific flight pattern.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The creature entry ID (from creature_template) of the type to summon.
      Must correspond to a valid creature template in the database.
  - name: obj
    description: The WorldObject (typically a Creature or Player) that serves as the
      reference point for summoning. The summoned creature will appear near this object.
  - name: flightZ
    description: The target Z-coordinate (height) for the flying creature to reach
      during its flight path. This determines how high above ground the creature will
      fly.
  - name: radius
    description: The maximum distance from the reference object where the summoned
      creature can appear. The creature will be placed within this radius.
  - name: despawnTime
    description: The time in milliseconds after which the summoned creature will automatically
      despawn. Use 0 for no automatic despawn.
  - name: summonType
    description: The summon type identifier that controls how the creature is summoned
      and behaves. Common values include SUMMON_TYPE_CREATURE, SUMMON_TYPE_GUARDIAN,
      etc.
  returns: A pointer to the newly created Creature instance if successful, or nullptr
    if the summon failed due to invalid parameters or other issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of DoSummonFlyer
    code: "Creature* summoned = me->DoSummonFlyer(12345, target, 10.0f, 5.0f, 30000,\
      \ SUMMON_TYPE_CREATURE);\nif (summoned)\n{\n    // Creature was successfully\
      \ summoned\n    summoned->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Summoning a flying guardian with custom flight height
    code: "Player* player = me->GetCharmerOrOwnerPlayerOrPlayerItself();\nif (player)\n\
      {\n    Creature* flyer = me->DoSummonFlyer(98765, player, 20.0f, 3.0f, 60000,\
      \ SUMMON_TYPE_GUARDIAN);\n    if (flyer)\n    {\n        flyer->SetOwnerGUID(player->GetGUID());\n\
      \        flyer->SetReactState(REACT_DEFENSIVE);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally uses the standard creature summoning system and respects
    all summon-related configurations in the database. The summoned creature will
    inherit properties from its template, including faction, level, and AI behavior.
    Flight path calculation is handled automatically by the core based on the provided
    parameters.
  warnings: Ensure that the entry ID corresponds to a valid creature template; invalid
    entries may cause crashes or undefined behavior. Be cautious with large radius
    values as they can result in summoning outside of expected boundaries. The despawnTime
    parameter should be carefully considered to avoid premature removal of summoned
    creatures during combat.
