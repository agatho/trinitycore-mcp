  signature: void Map::SendToPlayers(const WorldPacket * data) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a packet to all players within the map's active range.
  description: The SendToPlayers method broadcasts a WorldPacket to all Player objects
    currently present in the map. This method is typically used for sending updates
    or notifications that affect all players in a specific map instance, such as area-trigger
    effects, global announcements, or map-specific game events. The packet is only
    sent to players who are within the map's active range and have not yet been disconnected.
    This ensures efficient network usage by avoiding unnecessary transmissions to
    inactive or disconnected players.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Broadcasting a Custom Message to All Players
    code: 'WorldPacket data(SMSG_MESSAGE_CHAT, 100);

      data << uint8(CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM);

      data << uint32(0);

      data << uint64(0);

      data << uint32(0);

      data << "Server Message";

      map->SendToPlayers(&data);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the map's current player list and does not handle
    packet queuing or delayed delivery. It is designed to be called from within the
    map's context, typically during game loop updates or event processing. The method
    assumes that the provided WorldPacket is properly constructed and valid for transmission.
  warnings: Do not call this method with packets that are not properly initialized
    or contain invalid data, as it may cause client-side crashes or unexpected behavior.
    Avoid calling this method from within player update loops to prevent potential
    deadlocks or performance issues.
