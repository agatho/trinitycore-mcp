api:
  class: CommandResponse
  method: GetIcon
  signature: uint32 CommandResponse::GetIcon() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the icon ID associated with the command response for display in
    the user interface.
  description: The GetIcon method returns a unique identifier representing the graphical
    icon used to visually represent this command response in the game's user interface.
    This icon is typically used in chat messages, command outputs, or UI elements
    to provide visual feedback to players about the nature of the command result.
    The returned value corresponds to an entry in the game's icon database and should
    be interpreted as a display hint rather than functional data. This method does
    not perform any validation on the returned icon ID and assumes that the CommandResponse
    object has been properly initialized with valid icon data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the icon ID used for displaying this command
    response in the UI. The specific numeric value corresponds to an entry in the
    game's icon lookup table, where each number maps to a unique graphical asset displayed
    in the client.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CommandResponse response;

      uint32 iconId = response.GetIcon();

      // Use iconId to display appropriate UI element

      printf("Response icon ID: %u\n", iconId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Chat System
    code: 'CommandResponse response;

      response.SetIcon(12345); // Set an icon ID

      uint32 icon = response.GetIcon();

      // Pass icon to chat system for display

      ChatHandler->SendSysMessage("Command completed with icon " + std::to_string(icon));'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned icon ID may be used by the client to display specific graphical
    elements in the user interface. Developers should ensure that the icon IDs are
    valid entries within the game's asset database to avoid rendering issues or missing
    icons. This method is typically called during UI update cycles when displaying
    command results to players.
  warnings: This method does not validate whether the returned icon ID corresponds
    to an actual existing icon in the client assets. If an invalid or non-existent
    icon ID is returned, it may result in a missing or default icon being displayed
    instead of the intended visual element.
