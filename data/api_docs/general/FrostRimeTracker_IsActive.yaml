  method: IsActive
  signature: bool FrostRimeTracker::IsActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the FrostRime effect is currently active on the target.
  description: The IsActive method determines if a FrostRime tracker has an active
    effect applied to its target. This is typically used in spell or aura management
    systems within TrinityCore to verify the current state of a FrostRime debuff.
    The method performs a simple state check without modifying any internal data.
    It returns true if the effect is currently active and false otherwise, making
    it useful for conditional logic in gameplay mechanics such as preventing duplicate
    applications or determining when to apply effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the FrostRime effect is currently active on the target;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (frostRimeTracker->IsActive())\n{\n    // Apply additional effects or\
      \ modify behavior\n    target->AddAura(SPELL_FROST_RIME_EXTRA_DAMAGE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Effect Application
    code: "if (!frostRimeTracker->IsActive())\n{\n    // Only apply FrostRime if not\
      \ already active\n    target->AddAura(SPELL_FROST_RIME_AURA);\n    frostRimeTracker->SetIsActive(true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called in spell update handlers or periodic tick
    functions to determine the current state of a FrostRime effect. It's recommended
    to cache this value if it's checked multiple times per game tick for performance
    reasons.
  warnings: Ensure that the FrostRimeTracker object is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as calling IsActive on an uninitialized tracker may result
    in undefined behavior.
