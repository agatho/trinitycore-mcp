  signature: const PhaseShift & PhasingHandler::GetEmptyPhaseShift()
documentation:
  brief: Returns an empty PhaseShift object representing no active phase restrictions.
  description: The GetEmptyPhaseShift method provides a const reference to a pre-initialized,
    empty PhaseShift object. This object is used internally by the phasing system
    to represent scenarios where no phase restrictions are active for a given entity.
    The returned PhaseShift is typically used as a default or fallback value when
    no specific phase information needs to be applied. It's important to note that
    this method returns a constant reference, meaning the returned object should not
    be modified directly. This method is commonly used in phasing logic where a neutral
    or default state is required, such as during initialization or when clearing phase
    restrictions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const reference to an empty PhaseShift object that represents no active
    phase restrictions. This object can be used directly in phasing operations without
    modification.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Default Phasing
    code: 'PhasingHandler* handler = player->GetPhaseHandler();

      const PhaseShift& emptyPhase = handler->GetEmptyPhaseShift();

      // Use emptyPhase in phasing operations where no restrictions apply

      player->SetPhaseShift(emptyPhase);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing Active Phases with Empty Shift
    code: 'PhasingHandler* handler = player->GetPhaseHandler();

      // Clear any active phase restrictions by applying empty shift

      player->SetPhaseShift(handler->GetEmptyPhaseShift());

      // This effectively removes all phase restrictions for the player'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned PhaseShift object is a static or pre-constructed instance, so
    it's safe to return a const reference. This method does not perform any dynamic
    allocation and should be efficient to call. The empty PhaseShift object is typically
    initialized once and reused throughout the application lifecycle.
  warnings: Since this returns a const reference, do not attempt to modify the returned
    PhaseShift object directly. Any modifications would require creating a new PhaseShift
    instance rather than modifying the static one.
