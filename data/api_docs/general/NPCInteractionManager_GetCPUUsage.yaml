  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: GetCPUUsage
  signature: float NPCInteractionManager::GetCPUUsage() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current CPU usage percentage of the NPC interaction
    manager.
  description: The GetCPUUsage method provides a floating-point value representing
    the current CPU utilization by the NPCInteractionManager instance. This metric
    is typically used for performance monitoring and optimization purposes within
    the TrinityCore server environment. The returned value reflects the proportion
    of CPU time spent processing NPC interactions, with values ranging from 0.0 (no
    usage) to 1.0 (full utilization). The method performs internal calculations based
    on timing measurements and may include smoothing or averaging techniques to provide
    stable readings over time.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the CPU usage percentage,
    where 0.0 indicates no CPU activity and 1.0 indicates full CPU utilization by
    this manager instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic CPU Usage Monitoring
    code: "float cpuUsage = npcInteractionManager.GetCPUUsage();\nif (cpuUsage > 0.8f)\
      \ {\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_SERVER, \"High NPC CPU usage detected: %.2f%%\"\
      , cpuUsage * 100);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Logging with Thresholds
    code: "void LogNPCPerformance() {\n    float usage = npcInteractionManager.GetCPUUsage();\n\
      \    if (usage > 0.95f) {\n        sLog->outError(LOG_FILTER_SERVER, \"Critical\
      \ NPC CPU usage: %.2f%%\", usage * 100);\n    } else if (usage > 0.75f) {\n\
      \        sLog->outWarning(LOG_FILTER_SERVER, \"High NPC CPU usage: %.2f%%\"\
      , usage * 100);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called periodically for performance monitoring and
    may cache results to avoid expensive recalculations. The implementation likely
    uses high-resolution timers or performance counters to measure actual CPU time
    spent in NPC processing operations.
  warnings: The returned value represents instantaneous CPU usage which can fluctuate
    rapidly. For accurate long-term performance analysis, consider averaging multiple
    readings over time rather than relying on single measurements.
