  class: Unit
  method: KillSelf
  signature: void Unit::KillSelf(bool durabilityLoss, bool skipSettingDeathState)
documentation:
  brief: Kills the unit by setting its health to zero and triggering death state.
  description: The KillSelf method is used to immediately terminate a Unit object,
    typically a creature or player, by reducing its health to zero and initiating
    the death state. This method bypasses normal death mechanics and directly triggers
    the death process. It can be used for various purposes including NPC death, player
    death, or controlled destruction of units in game scenarios. The method is commonly
    used in scripting and AI implementations where immediate termination is required.
  parameters:
  - name: durabilityLoss
    description: When set to true, this parameter causes the unit to lose durability
      during death. This is typically used for player characters or creatures that
      should lose durability upon death.
  - name: skipSettingDeathState
    description: When set to true, this parameter skips setting the death state of
      the unit, which means it will not trigger the normal death animation or state
      changes. This is useful when you want to kill the unit without triggering death-related
      events.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* target = GetUnit();\n target->KillSelf();"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with parameters
    code: "Unit* target = GetUnit();\n target->KillSelf(true, false);\n // This will\
      \ cause the unit to lose durability and trigger death state"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it bypasses normal game mechanics.
    It is typically used in AI scripts or controlled scenarios where immediate death
    is required. The method may not properly handle all death-related events if skipSettingDeathState
    is set to true.
  warnings: Using this method without proper consideration can lead to unexpected
    behavior in game mechanics, especially when dealing with player characters. It
    should be used only when necessary as it bypasses normal death process.
