  brief: Determines whether the player is in ghost state after death
  description: The IsGhost method checks if the player character is currently in a
    ghost state, which occurs immediately after the player dies and before they respawn
    or teleport to a graveyard. This state is typically used to prevent normal gameplay
    actions while the player is in the process of respawning. The method returns true
    when the player is in this temporary ghost state, and false otherwise. In World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, this check is crucial for managing player
    transitions between alive and dead states during the death recovery process.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently in ghost state (after death but
    before respawn), false if the player is alive or has completed the respawn process
  examples:
  - title: Basic Ghost State Check
    code: "if (player->GetDeathRecoveryManager()->IsGhost()) {\n    // Handle ghost\
      \ state logic\n    SendGhostMessage();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic Based on Ghost State
    code: "void PlayerUpdate() {\n    DeathRecoveryManager* drm = player->GetDeathRecoveryManager();\n\
      \    if (drm->IsGhost()) {\n        // Disable normal movement\n        DisableMovement();\n\
      \        // Show ghost UI\n        ShowGhostUI();\n    } else {\n        //\
      \ Enable normal gameplay\n        EnableNormalGameplay();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other death recovery mechanisms
    to manage player state transitions. The ghost state is automatically cleared when
    the player respawns or teleports to a graveyard. This check should be performed
    frequently during update loops to ensure proper state management.
  warnings: Do not use this method to determine if a player has died - use DeathState
    checks instead. The ghost state may persist briefly after teleporting, so additional
    checks might be needed for precise state management.
