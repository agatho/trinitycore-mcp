  method: AddQuest
  signature: void Player::AddQuest(const Quest * quest, int * questGiver)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a quest to the player's quest log.
  description: The AddQuest method adds a specified quest to the player's quest log,
    enabling the player to track and complete the quest. This method is typically
    used during quest acceptance or when a player receives a new quest from a quest
    giver. The method handles the internal quest tracking mechanisms and updates the
    player's quest log accordingly. It may also trigger related game mechanics such
    as quest completion checks or quest-related events.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that is being added to the player's quest
      log. This parameter must be a valid pointer to a Quest object, otherwise the
      method will fail.
  - name: questGiver
    description: Pointer to an integer that represents the quest giver's ID or index.
      This parameter allows the system to track which NPC or object is giving the
      quest and may influence how the quest is handled internally.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Addition Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      Quest* quest = GetQuestById(12345);

      player->AddQuest(quest, nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Quest Addition with Quest Giver
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      Quest* quest = GetQuestById(12345);

      int questGiverId = 123;

      player->AddQuest(quest, &questGiverId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core quest system and should be used carefully
    to avoid duplicate or invalid quest entries. It does not directly handle quest
    completion checks but rather prepares the player for potential future completion.
    The method may internally call other related methods such as UpdatePlayerQuestLog.
  warnings: Improper handling of quest pointers can lead to memory access violations
    or incorrect quest tracking. Always ensure that quest objects are valid before
    calling this method. Additionally, using a null pointer for questGiver may cause
    unexpected behavior in the quest system.
