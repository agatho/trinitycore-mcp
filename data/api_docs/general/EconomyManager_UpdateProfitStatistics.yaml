  brief: Updates the profit statistics for the economy manager, recalculating and
    storing relevant financial data.
  description: The UpdateProfitStatistics method is responsible for recalculating
    and updating internal profit metrics within the EconomyManager class. This method
    typically aggregates transaction data, computes profit margins, and stores updated
    statistics for use in economic simulations or player financial tracking. It may
    be invoked periodically or upon significant economic events such as market changes
    or player transactions. The method does not take any parameters and performs its
    operations internally using cached or retrieved economic data.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'EconomyManager* economyMgr = sEconomyMgr;

      economyMgr->UpdateProfitStatistics();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database writes or updates to store recalculated
    profit statistics. It should be called with consideration for performance impact,
    especially in high-frequency scenarios. The method may lock internal data structures
    during execution.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper throttling can lead
    to performance degradation. Ensure that the economy manager is properly initialized
    before invoking this method.
