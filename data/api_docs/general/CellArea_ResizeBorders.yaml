  class: CellArea
  method: ResizeBorders
  signature: void CellArea::ResizeBorders(int & begin_cell, int & end_cell) const
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the begin and end cell coordinates to fit within valid bounds for
    the current CellArea.
  description: The ResizeBorders method modifies the provided begin_cell and end_cell
    integer references to ensure they fall within the valid range of cell coordinates
    for the given CellArea. This is typically used during spatial queries or area
    calculations where it's necessary to constrain cell indices to prevent out-of-bounds
    access. The method operates on the current instance's internal cell boundaries
    and adjusts the input parameters accordingly. It does not modify any internal
    state of the CellArea object itself, but rather updates the provided references
    to reflect valid coordinate ranges.
  parameters:
  - name: begin_cell
    description: Reference to an integer representing the starting cell coordinate.
      This value will be adjusted to ensure it falls within valid bounds for the current
      CellArea.
  - name: end_cell
    description: Reference to an integer representing the ending cell coordinate.
      This value will be adjusted to ensure it falls within valid bounds for the current
      CellArea.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ResizeBorders
    code: 'CellArea area;

      int begin = -5;

      int end = 20;

      area.ResizeBorders(begin, end);

      // begin and end are now adjusted to valid cell coordinates'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using ResizeBorders in spatial query context
    code: 'CellArea area;

      int x_begin = -10;

      int x_end = 30;

      int y_begin = -5;

      int y_end = 25;

      area.ResizeBorders(x_begin, x_end);

      area.ResizeBorders(y_begin, y_end);

      // Both x and y coordinates are now within valid range for the area'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's grid-based spatial indexing
    system to ensure that cell coordinate ranges remain valid when performing area
    queries or region calculations. The adjustment logic typically ensures that values
    do not exceed the maximum or fall below the minimum allowed cell indices for the
    current map or instance.
  warnings: Be aware that this method modifies the input parameters directly, so callers
    should ensure they have appropriate copies of their original values if needed
    after the call. Also, since this is a const method, it does not change the object's
    state but still affects the referenced variables.
