  class: CombatMovementStrategy
  method: IsInCorrectPosition
  signature: bool CombatMovementStrategy::IsInCorrectPosition(Player * player, const
    int & targetPosition, float tolerance) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is positioned correctly for combat movement
    based on target position and tolerance.
  description: The IsInCorrectPosition method evaluates if a given player's current
    positioning aligns with an expected target position within a specified tolerance.
    This functionality is typically used in AI behavior trees or movement strategies
    to ensure characters maintain appropriate positioning during combat scenarios.
    The method considers factors such as distance, orientation, and spatial alignment
    relative to the target position. It returns true when the player meets the positional
    criteria, and false otherwise. This check is crucial for maintaining realistic
    NPC behavior and proper tactical positioning in World of Warcraft's combat system.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose positioning is being evaluated.
      Must not be null.
  - name: targetPosition
    description: Integer representing the target position identifier or coordinate
      reference used for comparison. Value typically corresponds to a predefined position
      in combat strategy logic.
  - name: tolerance
    description: Floating-point value defining acceptable deviation from the target
      position. Higher values allow for greater positional flexibility during combat
      movement checks.
  returns: Boolean value indicating whether the player's current position meets the
    required criteria for combat movement. Returns true if the player is within the
    specified tolerance of the target position, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "if (strategy.IsInCorrectPosition(player, TARGET_POSITION_1, 2.0f)) {\n\
      \    // Player is in correct position, proceed with attack\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_ATTACK, true);\n} else {\n    // Move towards target position\n    strategy.MoveToTargetPosition(player,\
      \ TARGET_POSITION_1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Position Validation with Dynamic Tolerance
    code: "float dynamicTolerance = player->GetDistance(target) * 0.1f;\nif (strategy.IsInCorrectPosition(player,\
      \ TARGET_POSITION_2, dynamicTolerance)) {\n    // Execute precise combat maneuver\n\
      \    player->AddComboPoints(target);\n} else {\n    // Adjust positioning based\
      \ on combat state\n    strategy.AdjustCombatPosition(player, target, dynamicTolerance);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the CombatMovementStrategy class and relies on internal
    position tracking mechanisms. It performs distance calculations using standard
    WoW movement system functions. The targetPosition parameter should be validated
    against known valid positions in the combat strategy context to avoid undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. The tolerance value
    should be carefully chosen to balance between strict positioning requirements
    and realistic NPC movement flexibility.
