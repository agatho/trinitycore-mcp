  class: FlightPathMovementGenerator
  method: DoDeactivate
  signature: void FlightPathMovementGenerator::DoDeactivate(Player * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Deactivates the flight path movement generator for a player, stopping their
    flight animation and cleanup.
  description: The DoDeactivate method is responsible for cleaning up and deactivating
    a FlightPathMovementGenerator instance that has been assigned to a player. When
    invoked, this method typically stops the player's flight animation, resets movement
    state, and ensures any associated resources are properly released. This method
    is part of the movement generator system in TrinityCore, where different movement
    types (like walking, running, or flying) are handled by specific movement generators.
    The activation and deactivation cycle allows for smooth transitions between different
    movement states during gameplay, such as when a player lands from flight or switches
    to another movement type.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A pointer to the Player object whose flight path movement generator
      is being deactivated. This parameter must not be null and should represent a
      valid player instance currently using the flight path movement generator.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Deactivation Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      FlightPathMovementGenerator* flightGen = new FlightPathMovementGenerator();

      flightGen->DoDeactivate(player); // Deactivates the flight movement for the
      player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on a player who is currently under the
    control of a FlightPathMovementGenerator. Calling this method on a player not
    using a flight path movement generator may result in undefined behavior or errors.
    The method does not directly modify the player's position; it merely handles the
    internal state management of the movement generator.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to DoDeactivate is valid and not
    null, otherwise accessing invalid memory may occur. Also, avoid calling this method
    multiple times on the same movement generator without reactivation, as it may
    cause inconsistent states in the movement system.
