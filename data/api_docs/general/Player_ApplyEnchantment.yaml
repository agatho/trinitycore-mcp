  brief: Applies an enchantment to an item on the player's character
  description: The ApplyEnchantment method is used to apply or remove enchantments
    from items on a player's character. This method handles the application of enchantment
    effects to items, typically used during item creation, modification, or when applying
    enchantments to gear. It ensures that the enchantment is properly applied to the
    item and updates the player's stats accordingly. The method works with both positive

    false.

      This must be a valid item that exists in the player's inventory.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the enchantment from the item.
  returns: null

    may involve updating the player's stats or character sheet. It should be used
    carefully as it can affect gameplay balance and character progression.
  warnings: Improper use of this method could lead to incorrect item enchantment application,
    potentially causing game mechanics issues or invalid item states. Ensure that
