  signature: uint64 MovementRequest::GetSpatialTemporalHash() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a unique 64-bit hash value based on spatial and temporal
    coordinates of the movement request.
  description: The GetSpatialTemporalHash method computes a deterministic 64-bit hash
    that uniquely identifies a movement request based on its spatial (position) and
    temporal (time) components. This hash is used internally by TrinityCore to efficiently
    manage and track movement requests, particularly in scenarios involving pathfinding,
    collision detection, and synchronization across the game world. The method combines
    the object's current position coordinates with a time-based component to ensure
    that even minor changes in position or timing produce distinct hash values. It
    is commonly used for indexing, caching, and identifying specific movement states
    within the server's movement system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the computed spatial-temporal hash of the movement
    request. This hash uniquely identifies the combination of position and time for
    this specific movement request, enabling efficient lookup and management in internal
    data structures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Movement Hash
    code: 'MovementRequest request;

      // Assume request has been initialized with valid position and time data

      uint64 hash = request.GetSpatialTemporalHash();

      // Use the hash for indexing or comparison purposes'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Hash for Movement Request Identification
    code: "MovementRequest* req = GetPendingMovementRequest();\nuint64 currentHash\
      \ = req->GetSpatialTemporalHash();\n// Compare with previously stored hash to\
      \ detect movement changes\nif (prevHash != currentHash)\n{\n    // Movement\
      \ has changed, update tracking systems\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is designed to be deterministic, meaning that for the same input
    coordinates and time values, it will always return the same hash. This ensures
    consistency in movement tracking and state management. The implementation likely
    uses a combination of position components (X, Y, Z) and timestamp data to generate
    the final hash value.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a security mechanism or for cryptographic
    purposes since the hash generation is deterministic and predictable. Additionally,
    changes in precision of position coordinates or time values can result in significantly
    different hash outputs, which may affect caching strategies if not handled carefully.
