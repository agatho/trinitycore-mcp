documentation:
  brief: Initializes a dynamic object aura with specified spell properties and casting
    parameters.
  description: The DynObjAura constructor initializes a dynamic object aura instance
    using provided spell information, caster details, and casting context. This method
    sets up internal state for the aura that will be applied to targets within the
    dynamic object's area of effect. The initialization includes storing spell proto
    data, cast identifiers, effect masks, owner references, caster unit, difficulty
    settings, base amounts, item casting information, and GUIDs. It is typically invoked
    during the creation or application phase of a spell that uses dynamic objects
    such as traps, totems, or environmental effects.
  parameters:
  - name: spellproto
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure containing spell properties and
      configuration data.
  - name: castId
    description: Unique identifier for this specific cast instance, used for tracking
      and referencing.
  - name: effMask
    description: Bitmask indicating which effects of the spell are active or should
      be processed.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that owns or created this dynamic object
      aura.
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Unit that cast the spell creating this aura; may be
      null if not applicable.
  - name: castDifficulty
    description: Difficulty level of the cast, used for determining spell effectiveness
      or scaling.
  - name: baseAmount
    description: Pointer to an array of base effect amounts for each active spell
      effect.
  - name: castItem
    description: Pointer to the Item used to cast this spell, if applicable; may be
      null.
  - name: casterGUID
    description: Global unique identifier of the caster unit, used for tracking and
      reference purposes.
  - name: castItemGuid
    description: Global unique identifier of the item used to cast the spell, if applicable.
  - name: castItemId
    description: Internal ID of the item used to cast the spell, useful for item-specific
      logic.
  - name: castItemLevel
    description: Level or quality level of the casting item, used for scaling effects
      or calculations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic DynObjAura Initialization
    code: 'SpellInfo* spell = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(12345);

      Unit* caster = player;

      WorldObject* owner = player;

      int castId = 1;

      uint32 effMask = 1;

      int castDifficulty = 0;

      int32 baseAmount[8] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80};

      Item* castItem = nullptr;

      int casterGUID = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      int castItemGuid = 0;

      uint32 castItemId = 0;

      int32 castItemLevel = 0;


      DynObjAura aura(spell, castId, effMask, owner, caster, castDifficulty, baseAmount,
      castItem, casterGUID, castItemGuid, castItemId, castItemLevel);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the internal spell system and should not typically
    be called directly by external modules. It's used internally when creating dynamic
    object auras during spell casting or application. The method assumes all parameters
    are valid and properly initialized before invocation.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the effMask can lead to missing effects or incorrect
    behavior in aura application. Ensure that baseAmount array size matches expected
    number of effects from spellproto.
