documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the locale-specific text entry for a page text object.
  description: The GetPageTextLocale method fetches the localized text associated
    with a specific page text entry in the World of Warcraft database. This method
    is used to retrieve the appropriate text content based on the client's locale
    settings, allowing for internationalization of quest items, books, and other page-based
    content. The returned pointer points to an array of integers that represent the
    localized text data for the given entry ID. If no localization exists for the
    specified entry, the method may return a default or null value depending on implementation
    details.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an integer array representing the locale-specific page
    text data for the requested entry. Returns nullptr if no valid entry is found
    or if localization data is unavailable.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve localized page text
    code: "const int* pageText = sObjectMgr->GetPageTextLocale(12345);\nif (pageText\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process the localized page text data\n    for (int\
      \ i = 0; i < MAX_LOCALES; ++i)\n    {\n        printf(\"Locale %d: %d\\n\",\
      \ i, pageText[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with the ObjectMgr singleton
    to access localized content. The returned data structure may vary depending on
    how the localization system is implemented within TrinityCore's database schema.
  warnings: Ensure that the entry ID passed to this method corresponds to an existing
    page text record in the database, otherwise the behavior is undefined. Also note
    that the returned pointer should not be modified as it points to internal data
    structures.
