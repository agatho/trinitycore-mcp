  class: GroupCoordination
  method: HandleMemberDown
  signature: void GroupCoordination::HandleMemberDown(uint32 memberGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a group member's health drops to zero, triggering
    appropriate group coordination actions.
  description: The HandleMemberDown method is responsible for managing the consequences
    when a player within a group falls to zero health. This typically occurs during
    combat scenarios where a group member dies or becomes incapacitated. The method
    likely updates group state, triggers loot distribution adjustments, notifies other
    group members, and may initiate respawn or resurrection procedures depending on
    the game context. It serves as part of the group coordination system that maintains
    synchronization between group members' statuses and ensures proper gameplay flow
    during player deaths.
  parameters:
  - name: memberGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group member who has fallen to
      zero health. This value is used to locate and process the specific player within
      the group context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat scenario
    code: "void SomeCombatHandler::OnPlayerDeath(uint32 playerGuid) {\n    GroupCoordination*\
      \ coord = sGroupCoordination->GetGroupCoordination();\n    if (coord) {\n  \
      \      coord->HandleMemberDown(playerGuid);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely invoked from combat-related systems and may interact
    with group loot managers, respawn coordinators, or player status trackers. It's
    important to ensure that the memberGuid parameter corresponds to an actual group
    member to prevent invalid operations.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method could lead to desynchronization between
    group members' states, causing issues with loot distribution, respawn timing,
    or group UI updates. Always validate that the provided GUID belongs to a current
    group member before calling this function.
