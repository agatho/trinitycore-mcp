  class: GuardianDruid
  method: GuardianDruid
  signature: void GuardianDruid::GuardianDruid(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Guardian Druid AI bot with the specified player.
  description: The GuardianDruid constructor initializes a new instance of the GuardianDruid
    AI class, setting up internal state and configuration for a druid player that
    will act as a guardian. This method is typically called when creating or spawning
    a bot controlled by the AI system. It configures the bot's behavior, abilities,
    and combat strategies specific to the guardian druid role in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore environment. The method prepares the AI to respond to various game
    events and commands while maintaining proper druid-specific mechanics such as
    form switching, spell casting, and pet management.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object that represents the Guardian Druid bot.
      This parameter must be a valid player instance with druid class and appropriate
      AI settings enabled.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of Guardian Druid Bot
    code: 'Player* myDruidBot = new Player();

      // ... initialize player properties ...

      GuardianDruid druidAI(myDruidBot);

      // The AI is now ready to control the bot'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely initializes internal data structures for spell management,
    ability cooldown tracking, and combat decision-making logic specific to guardian
    druids. It may also set up event listeners or hooks necessary for the AI to respond
    to game state changes.
