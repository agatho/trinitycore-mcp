  method: EffectCreateTraitTreeConfig
  signature: void Spell::EffectCreateTraitTreeConfig()
documentation:
  brief: Creates a trait tree configuration for the spell's effect.
  description: The EffectCreateTraitTreeConfig method initializes and sets up a trait
    tree configuration associated with the current spell effect. This method is typically
    invoked during spell execution to configure player traits or abilities that are
    governed by trait systems. It handles the internal setup required for trait-based
    gameplay mechanics, such as determining which traits are available, their ranks,
    and how they interact with the spell's functionality. The method operates within
    the context of the spell's effect application and is part of the core spell handling
    system in TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell effect handler
    code: "void Spell::EffectCreateTraitTreeConfig()\n{\n    // Internal trait tree\
      \ configuration setup\n    // This method is called during spell effect application\n\
      \    // to configure trait-related data for the spell\n}\n\n// Example of how\
      \ it might be invoked\nSpell* spell = new Spell(caster, spellInfo, true);\n\
      spell->EffectCreateTraitTreeConfig();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is an internal implementation detail of the spell system and
    is not typically called directly by external code. It relies on the spell's context
    and effect parameters to properly configure trait trees. The method may interact
    with player data structures to ensure trait configurations are correctly applied.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the spell effect execution flow, as
    it depends on valid spell context and may cause undefined behavior if invoked
    improperly. Ensure that the spell's effect type is compatible with trait tree
    configuration before calling.
