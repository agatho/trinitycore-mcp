  signature: void Player::SetInviteForBattlegroundQueueType(int bgQueueTypeId, uint32
    instanceId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the battleground queue type for which a player has been invited.
  description: This method assigns a specific battleground queue type to a player,
    indicating that they have been invited to join a particular battleground queue.
    It is used primarily in the context of battleground matchmaking and queue management,
    where players are invited to participate in specific battleground types such as
    Alterac Valley, Warsong Gulch, or Eye of the Storm. The method allows developers
    to control which queue type a player is associated with for their invitation,
    typically used when handling player invitations during battleground queue operations.
  parameters:
  - name: bgQueueTypeId
    description: The battleground queue type ID that the player has been invited to
      join. This corresponds to specific battleground types such as 1 for Alterac
      Valley, 2 for Warsong Gulch, etc.
  - name: instanceId
    description: The instance ID of the battleground being invited to. This helps
      identify which specific instance of a battleground the player is being invited
      to participate in.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetInviteForBattlegroundQueueType(1, 12345);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: '// Assuming a player is being invited to a specific battleground

      // Set the queue type to 2 (Warsong Gulch)

      player->SetInviteForBattlegroundQueueType(2, 54321);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully in conjunction with other battleground
    queue management methods. It is typically called when a player is being invited
    to participate in a specific battleground queue, and the instance ID must match
    the actual battleground instance being referenced.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect queue assignments or
    player invitation errors. Care should be taken to ensure that bgQueueTypeId matches
    the intended battleground type and that instanceId corresponds to the correct
    instance.
