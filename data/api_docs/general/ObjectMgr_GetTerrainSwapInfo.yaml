  signature: const TerrainSwapInfo * ObjectMgr::GetTerrainSwapInfo(uint32 terrainSwapId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves terrain swap information for a specified terrain swap ID.
  description: The GetTerrainSwapInfo method retrieves a const pointer to a TerrainSwapInfo
    structure based on the provided terrain swap ID. This method is used in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore server to manage and access terrain swap configurations,
    which are typically used for handling area transitions or environment changes
    in specific zones. The returned pointer may be null if no terrain swap information
    exists for the given ID. This method is part of the ObjectMgr class, which serves
    as a central manager for various game objects and configurations within the server.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to a TerrainSwapInfo structure corresponding to the specified
    terrain swap ID, or nullptr if no such terrain swap information exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const TerrainSwapInfo* swapInfo = sObjectMgr->GetTerrainSwapInfo(12345);\n\
      if (swapInfo)\n{\n    // Use the terrain swap info\n    printf(\"Terrain Swap\
      \ ID: %u\\n\", swapInfo->Id);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during zone loading or area transition logic.
    It's important to check for null return values before using the returned pointer.
    The method is thread-safe as it only reads from a pre-loaded data structure.
  warnings: Always verify that the returned pointer is not null before dereferencing
    it. Using an invalid terrain swap ID could result in returning nullptr, which
    may cause crashes if not properly handled.
