  signature: bool Creature::IsIgnoringSanctuarySpellEffect() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature is ignoring sanctuary spell effects.
  description: This method checks if a creature is currently ignoring sanctuary spell
    effects, which means it can be attacked and targeted by players even while in
    sanctuary zones. This behavior is typically used for creatures that are not meant
    to be protected by sanctuary rules, such as those that are hostile or have special
    flags. The method returns true when the creature has been configured to ignore
    sanctuary effects, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is ignoring sanctuary spell effects, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->IsIgnoringSanctuarySpellEffect())\n{\n    // Creature can\
      \ be attacked in sanctuary zones\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other creature flags or
    behaviors to determine if a creature should be immune to sanctuary rules. It may
    be called during combat or when checking target eligibility.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with other methods that check for immunity
    to specific spell effects, as it specifically relates to sanctuary rules. Using
    this method inappropriately could lead to unexpected behavior in player vs. creature
    interactions.
