  class: TargetScanner
  method: AddToBlacklist
  signature: void TargetScanner::AddToBlacklist(int guid, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a target GUID to the scanner's blacklist for a specified duration.
  description: The AddToBlacklist method prevents a specific target from being considered
    by the TargetScanner for a given time period. This is commonly used in AI behavior
    to temporarily ignore certain units, such as when a creature is already engaged
    with them or when a target has been marked as invalid. The method takes a global
    unique identifier (GUID) of the target and a duration in milliseconds, after which
    the target will be automatically removed from the blacklist. This mechanism supports
    dynamic targeting logic where targets may be temporarily excluded based on game
    state or AI decision-making.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit to blacklist.
      This is typically a creature, player, or game object GUID.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the target should remain blacklisted.
      After this time, the target will be automatically removed from the blacklist.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'TargetScanner scanner;

      scanner.AddToBlacklist(12345, 5000); // Blacklist target with GUID 12345 for
      5 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: AI Behavior Example
    code: "void CreatureAI::OnTargetDied(Unit* target)\n{\n    // Temporarily ignore\
      \ the killer for 10 seconds\n    if (target && target->GetGUID())\n        me->GetAI()->GetTargetScanner().AddToBlacklist(target->GetGUID(),\
      \ 10000);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The blacklist is typically implemented using a map or set structure with
    expiration times. The method does not validate whether the GUID corresponds to
    an existing unit; it simply adds it to the internal tracking mechanism. Performance
    is generally O(1) for adding and removing entries, assuming standard hash table
    or map implementations.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed is valid and represents a real game object,
    otherwise behavior may be undefined. Be cautious when setting very long durations
    as this could lead to memory leaks if not properly managed. The method does not
    provide any feedback on whether the target was already blacklisted.
