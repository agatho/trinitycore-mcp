documentation:
  brief: Removes the oldest path entry from the cache to make room for new entries.
  description: The EvictOldest method is responsible for managing the size of the
    path cache by removing the least recently used or oldest path entry when the cache
    reaches its maximum capacity. This ensures that the cache does not grow indefinitely
    and maintains optimal performance. The method typically operates as part of a
    Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy, where entries are ordered based on
    access time, and the oldest entry is removed to accommodate new paths. This mechanism
    is crucial in pathfinding systems within TrinityCore to prevent memory bloat and
    maintain efficient lookup times for path calculations.

    code: "PathCache cache;\n// Add several paths to the cache\n// ... (path insertion\
      \ code)\n// Evict oldest entries if cache is full\nif (cache.IsFull()) {\n \
      \   cache.EvictOldest();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the PathCache class when adding
    new paths and the cache has reached its maximum size. It's important to understand
    that calling this method manually may disrupt normal cache management behavior
    unless done carefully. The implementation likely uses a data structure such as
    a queue or list to track entry order.
  warnings: Calling EvictOldest() manually without checking if the cache is actually
    full can lead to unnecessary evictions and potentially remove important path data.
    It's recommended to use this method only when necessary, typically in conjunction
    with checks for cache capacity.
