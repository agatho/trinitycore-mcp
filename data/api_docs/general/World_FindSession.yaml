documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a WorldSession object associated with the specified session ID.
  description: The FindSession method is used to locate and return a pointer to a
    WorldSession object within the World's session management system. This method
    allows subsystems and modules of the TrinityCore server to access active player
    sessions by their unique session identifier. The method performs a lookup in an
    internal session container, returning a valid session pointer if found or nullptr
    if no session exists with the given ID. It is commonly used during packet processing,
    player state management, and other operations that require access to a specific
    player's session context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the WorldSession object if a session with the specified ID
    exists; otherwise, returns nullptr if no matching session is found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Session Retrieval
    code: "WorldSession* session = sWorld->FindSession(12345);\nif (session != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Process the session\n    session->SendServerMessage(SERVER_MSG_STRING,\
      \ \"Hello World!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Session Access with Null Check
    code: "uint32 sessionId = player->GetSession()->GetId();\nWorldSession* session\
      \ = sWorld->FindSession(sessionId);\nif (session && session->GetPlayer())\n\
      {\n    // Ensure player is still connected and valid\n    session->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      Welcome to the zone!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup in a hash map or similar data structure, making
    it relatively efficient. However, frequent calls should be avoided in performance-critical
    code paths. The returned pointer is only valid as long as the session exists and
    has not been removed from the world's session list.
  warnings: Always check for nullptr return values before using the returned WorldSession
    pointer to avoid null pointer dereferences. Session IDs may become invalid if
    a player disconnects or logs out between the time of ID retrieval and session
    lookup.
