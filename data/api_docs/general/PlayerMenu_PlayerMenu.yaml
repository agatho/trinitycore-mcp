  brief: Moves a PlayerMenu object to another PlayerMenu object, transferring ownership
    of its resources.
  description: The PlayerMenu constructor taking an rvalue reference (PlayerMenu&&)
    is a move constructor that transfers ownership of resources from the source PlayerMenu
    object to the newly constructed object. This operation is typically used in scenarios
    where temporary or existing PlayerMenu objects need to be efficiently transferred
    without performing expensive deep copies. The source object becomes invalid after
    the move and should not be used afterward. In the context of TrinityCore's World
    of Warcraft server architecture, this constructor is likely utilized when managing
    player interaction menus, such as quest givers or vendors, where efficient resource
    management is critical for performance.

  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing a PlayerMenu
    code: 'PlayerMenu menu1;

      // ... populate menu1 with data ...

      PlayerMenu menu2 = std::move(menu1); // Move constructor called

      // menu1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This move constructor enables efficient resource transfer, avoiding unnecessary
    copying of internal data structures. It's important to understand that after moving,
    the source object should not be accessed or used as it may be left in an invalid
    state.
