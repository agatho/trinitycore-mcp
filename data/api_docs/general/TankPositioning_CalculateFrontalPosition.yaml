  class: TankPositioning
  method: CalculateFrontalPosition
  signature: int TankPositioning::CalculateFrontalPosition(Unit * target, float distance)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the frontal position relative to a target unit at
    a specified distance.
  description: The CalculateFrontalPosition method determines a positional offset
    in front of a given target unit at a defined distance. This is commonly used in
    game AI logic for positioning units, such as when a tank needs to maintain a specific
    distance from an enemy while facing it. The method takes into account the orientation
    and position of the target unit to compute the appropriate frontal location. It's
    typically employed in combat positioning systems where precise spatial relationships
    are required for tactical gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that serves as the reference point for
      calculating the frontal position. Must be a valid unit instance; null pointers
      will result in undefined behavior.
  - name: distance
    description: The distance in yards from the target unit's position where the frontal
      position should be calculated. Must be a positive value; negative values may
      produce unexpected results.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the calculated frontal position index or
    identifier. A return value of 0 typically indicates success, while negative values
    may indicate errors such as invalid parameters or failure to compute a valid position.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetVictim();\nint result = tankPositioning->CalculateFrontalPosition(target,\
      \ 5.0f);\nif (result >= 0) {\n    // Proceed with positioning logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "Unit* target = unit->GetTarget();\nif (!target) {\n    return -1; // No\
      \ target available\n}\nfloat distance = 3.0f;\nint positionIndex = tankPositioning->CalculateFrontalPosition(target,\
      \ distance);\nif (positionIndex < 0) {\n    // Handle error case\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to calculate frontal position\");\n    return -1;\n}\n// Use positionIndex\
      \ for further processing"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the target unit's current orientation and position
    data. Ensure that the target unit is valid and has up-to-date spatial information
    before calling this function. The returned integer may represent an index into
    a predefined array of positions or a unique identifier depending on internal implementation.
  warnings: Passing null pointers for the target parameter will lead to crashes or
    undefined behavior. Always validate input parameters before invoking this method.
    Negative distance values might not behave as expected and should be avoided in
    production code.
