documentation:
  brief: Activates the Demonic Metamorphosis ability for a Havoc Demon Hunter, enhancing
    their combat capabilities.
  description: The TriggerDemonicMetamorphosis method initiates the Demonic Metamorphosis
    ability specific to Havoc Demon Hunters in World of Warcraft. This ability transforms
    the demon hunter into a more powerful form, increasing their damage output and
    granting them temporary abilities such as increased movement speed and enhanced
    attack power. The method typically handles the visual effects, stat modifications,
    and cooldown management associated with this class ability. It is usually invoked
    during combat when the player has sufficient resources (such as Fury) to activate
    the ability. This method does not take any parameters and performs its function
    directly on the calling instance of the HavocDemonHunterRefactored class.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: 'HavocDemonHunterRefactored* player = ...;

      player->TriggerDemonicMetamorphosis();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the Demon Hunter has sufficient Fury
    resource to activate Demonic Metamorphosis. The ability may have a cooldown period
    that must be respected before reactivation. Implementation typically involves
    updating the player's aura state, modifying their stats temporarily, and triggering
    visual effects.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking for sufficient Fury or existing cooldowns
    could lead to unexpected behavior or client-server desynchronization in multiplayer
    environments. Ensure proper resource management before invoking this ability.
