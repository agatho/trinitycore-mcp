  brief: Converts an Object to a Player pointer if the object is a player, otherwise
    returns nullptr.
  description: The ToPlayer method is used to safely cast an Object to a Player pointer
    when the object represents a player character. This method is essential for accessing
    player-specific functionality and properties within the TrinityCore framework.
    It performs a dynamic_cast operation internally, ensuring that only objects which
    are actually player characters can be converted to Player pointers. If the object
    is not a player, the method returns nullptr, preventing potential runtime errors
    or undefined behavior. The method is commonly used in game mechanics where player-specific
    actions need to be performed on objects, such as in player interaction handling
    or when processing player-related events.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const Player pointer if the Object represents a player character,
    otherwise returns nullptr. This indicates that the object is not a player and
    cannot be cast to a Player type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Player* player = object->ToPlayer();\nif (player)\n{\n    // Object is\
      \ a player, perform player-specific actions\n    player->SetHealth(100);\n}\n\
      else\n{\n    // Object is not a player\n    // Handle non-player case\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with game event handling
    code: "Object* obj = GetWorldObject();\nPlayer* player = obj->ToPlayer();\nif\
      \ (player)\n{\n    // Player-specific logic\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      You are in a zone!\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Non-player object handling\n    //\
      \ Handle NPC or GameObject\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method requires careful handling as it involves dynamic casting which
    can be expensive. It should only be used when necessary, and developers should
    ensure that the object being cast is indeed a player before calling this method.
    Performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary casts in high-frequency
    operations.
  warnings: This method may return nullptr if the Object is not a Player, so developers
    must always check for null before using the returned pointer. Using the returned
    pointer without checking for null can lead to segmentation faults or undefined
    behavior.
