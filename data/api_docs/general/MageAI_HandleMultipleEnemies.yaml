documentation:
  brief: Manages Mage AI behavior when multiple enemies are present, adjusting spell
    selection and targeting strategies accordingly.
  description: The HandleMultipleEnemies method is responsible for modifying the Mage's
    artificial intelligence behavior when the player is engaged with more than one
    enemy target. This method evaluates the current combat situation and adjusts the
    mage's spell casting priorities, targeting logic, and overall strategy to optimize
    damage output or utility in multi-target scenarios. It typically involves selecting
    appropriate area-of-effect spells, managing threat distribution, and ensuring
    optimal positioning relative to multiple targets. The method is part of the MageAI
    class which governs AI decision-making for mage characters within the TrinityCore
    framework.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void MyMageAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->GetVictim()\
      \ && me->GetVictim()->IsAlive())\n    {\n        // Check number of enemies\n\
      \        int enemyCount = GetEnemyCount();\n        HandleMultipleEnemies(enemyCount);\n\
      \        \n        // Execute spell logic based on updated AI state\n      \
      \  CastSpellIfReady();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the AI's target selection system and may
    modify internal state variables such as spell priorities, cooldown tracking, or
    targeting preferences. It should be called during combat updates when enemy count
    changes or at regular intervals to maintain optimal behavior.
  warnings: The method assumes that the MageAI class has been properly initialized
    with valid references to the creature and its target information. Improper usage
    without checking for valid targets may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
