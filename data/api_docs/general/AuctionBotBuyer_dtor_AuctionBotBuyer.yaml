documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AuctionBotBuyer instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the AuctionBotBuyer class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the object's
    lifetime. In the context of TrinityCore's auction house system, this typically
    involves releasing references to auction items, clearing internal data structures,
    and ensuring no memory leaks occur when the buyer instance is removed from memory.
    This method is automatically invoked when an AuctionBotBuyer object goes out of
    scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of AuctionBotBuyer
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    AuctionBotBuyer buyer;\n    // ... use buyer\
      \ ...\n} // Destructor called automatically here"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of AuctionBotBuyer
    code: 'AuctionBotBuyer* buyer = new AuctionBotBuyer();

      // ... use buyer ...

      delete buyer; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing memory.
    It is typically invoked by the C++ runtime when objects go out of scope or are
    deleted. Ensure that any pointers to this object are invalidated after destruction
    to prevent dangling pointer issues.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke the destructor unless you're implementing custom
    memory management. Calling it multiple times on the same object will result in
    undefined behavior. Also, be cautious about virtual inheritance or complex class
    hierarchies where the destructor should be declared virtual.
