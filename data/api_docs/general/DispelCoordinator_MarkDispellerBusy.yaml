  class: DispelCoordinator
  method: MarkDispellerBusy
  signature: void DispelCoordinator::MarkDispellerBusy(int dispeller, uint32 busyTimeMs)
documentation:
  brief: Marks a dispeller as busy for a specified duration to prevent concurrent
    dispel operations.
  description: The MarkDispellerBusy method sets a dispeller identified by its index
    or identifier as temporarily unavailable for dispel actions. This prevents multiple
    dispels from being applied simultaneously, which could lead to game mechanics
    conflicts or performance issues. The busy state lasts for the specified time in
    milliseconds, after which the dispeller becomes available again. This mechanism
    is typically used in spell systems where dispel effects must be coordinated to
    avoid overlap or race conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: dispeller
    description: An integer identifier representing the dispeller (e.g., a spell ID,
      caster index, or internal dispeller handle) that should be marked as busy.
  - name: busyTimeMs
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the dispeller will remain
      busy and unavailable for new dispel operations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'DispelCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.MarkDispellerBusy(12345, 2000); // Mark dispeller with ID 12345
      as busy for 2 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Spell Processing Context
    code: "void ApplyDispel(Spell* spell) {\n    int dispellerId = spell->GetCaster()->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      \    uint32 cooldown = 1500; // 1.5 second cooldown\n    \n    if (dispellerId\
      \ >= 0) {\n        coordinator.MarkDispellerBusy(dispellerId, cooldown);\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal state tracking to manage busy dispellers.
    It's important that the dispeller identifier passed is valid and corresponds to
    an actual dispeller in the system. The busy time should be carefully chosen to
    match the expected duration of dispel effects or cooldowns.
  warnings: Passing invalid dispeller identifiers may result in undefined behavior
    or internal state corruption. Ensure that busyTimeMs is a reasonable value to
    prevent excessive blocking of dispel operations.
