  class: Battleground
  method: BlockMovement
  signature: void Battleground::BlockMovement(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Blocks movement for a specified player within the battleground.
  description: The BlockMovement method prevents a player from moving within the battleground
    environment. This functionality is typically used during specific battleground
    states such as pre-match countdowns, when players are being teleported, or during
    certain game mechanics that require player immobilization. The method likely modifies
    the player's movement flags or state to disable movement capabilities while maintaining
    other gameplay elements like combat and chat functionality.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose movement will be blocked. Must
      be a valid player instance that is currently participating in the battleground.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Blocking player movement during pre-match countdown
    code: "void Battleground::HandlePreMatchCountdown()\n{\n    for (auto& player\
      \ : m_players)\n    {\n        BlockMovement(player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Blocking specific player movement during teleportation
    code: "void Battleground::TeleportPlayer(Player* player)\n{\n    BlockMovement(player);\n\
      \    // Perform teleport logic here\n    // ... \n    // Re-enable movement\
      \ after teleport\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies the player's movement flags or uses a temporary
    state change to prevent movement. It should be called with proper synchronization
    to avoid race conditions in multi-threaded environments. The blocking effect is
    typically temporary and should be reverted when appropriate.
  warnings: Ensure that BlockMovement is properly paired with an unblocking mechanism
    to prevent players from being permanently stuck. Improper use may lead to player
    frustration or game state inconsistencies. This method should not be called on
    players who are not currently in the battleground.
