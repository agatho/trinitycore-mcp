  method: GetBotBehavior
  signature: int IBotSession::GetBotBehavior() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current behavior mode of the bot associated with this session.
  description: The GetBotBehavior method returns an integer value representing the
    active behavior mode or state of the bot within the session. This value typically
    corresponds to predefined constants or enums that define how the bot should act,
    such as idle, combat, looting, following, or patrolling. The returned value is
    used internally by the TrinityCore AI system to determine the bot's current operational
    context and guide its decision-making process. This method does not modify any
    state and is purely informational, allowing external systems or scripts to query
    the bot's behavior without altering it.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the bot's current behavior mode. Possible values
    are implementation-specific but generally correspond to defined constants like
    BOT_BEHAVIOR_IDLE, BOT_BEHAVIOR_COMBAT, BOT_BEHAVIOR_LOOTING, etc. A return value
    of -1 may indicate an error or invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Check Current Bot Behavior
    code: "int behavior = session->GetBotBehavior();\nif (behavior == BOT_BEHAVIOR_COMBAT)\n\
      {\n    // Bot is currently in combat mode\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot is in combat.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    behavior mode returned may change dynamically based on the bot's actions, environment,
    or player interactions. It is recommended to cache this value if frequent access
    is required for performance reasons.
  warnings: Do not assume that the return value will remain constant between calls;
    the bot's behavior can change at any time depending on game events or user input.
    Avoid making critical decisions based solely on this value without additional
    context checks.
