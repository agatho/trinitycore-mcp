  method: ProcessInitTask
  signature: InitResult AsyncBotInitializer::ProcessInitTask(InitTask task)
documentation:
  brief: Processes an initialization task for asynchronous bot initialization.
  description: The ProcessInitTask method handles the execution of a queued initialization
    task within the AsyncBotInitializer class. It manages the workflow of setting
    up bot-related systems, including loading configurations, initializing data structures,
    and preparing the environment for bot operations. This method is typically invoked
    asynchronously to avoid blocking the main game thread during startup or reinitialization
    phases. The method returns an InitResult indicating success, failure, or pending
    status of the initialization process.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an InitResult enum value that indicates the outcome of the initialization
    task processing. Possible values may include INIT_SUCCESS, INIT_FAILURE, or INIT_PENDING
    depending on whether the task completed, failed, or is still in progress.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "AsyncBotInitializer initializer;\nInitTask task = InitTask::LoadConfig;\n\
      InitResult result = initializer.ProcessInitTask(task);\nif (result == InitResult::INIT_SUCCESS)\
      \ {\n    // Bot initialization completed successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not be called concurrently
    with other initialization methods. It assumes that the AsyncBotInitializer has
    been properly constructed and initialized before calling.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the AsyncBotInitializer
    may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure all dependencies are loaded
    before invoking ProcessInitTask.
