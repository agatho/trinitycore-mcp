documentation:
  brief: Manages and updates the cooldown state of balance druid abilities.
  description: The HandleCooldowns method is responsible for processing and updating
    the cooldown timers associated with a balance druid's special abilities. This
    method typically iterates through the druid's active cooldowns, reducing their
    remaining time and handling the activation of abilities once their cooldowns expire.
    It ensures that abilities cannot be used until their respective cooldown periods
    have completed, maintaining game balance and preventing spamming of powerful spells.
    The method is usually called during the AI update cycle or when specific events
    occur that might affect cooldown states.

  - title: Basic cooldown handling invocation
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) override\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    HandleCooldowns();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the creature's AI update loop.
    It's important to ensure that cooldown management does not interfere with other
    AI behaviors or spell casting sequences. The implementation may involve checking
    for ability availability, updating internal timers, and potentially triggering
    callbacks when abilities become available.
