documentation:
  brief: Processes all pending bot character selection requests in the queue
  description: The ProcessPendingRequests method handles and executes all queued bot
    character selection operations. It iterates through the internal request queue,
    validates each pending request, and performs the appropriate character selection
    logic for each bot. This method is typically called during game loop updates or
    when batch processing of character selections is required. The method ensures
    that requests are processed in FIFO order and handles any necessary state transitions
    for the bot characters involved.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    botCharacterSelector->ProcessPendingRequests();\n\
      \    // ... continue game loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the main game update loop to ensure
    timely processing of bot character selection requests. The method is designed
    to be non-blocking and will process all available requests in a single call without
    causing game thread delays.
