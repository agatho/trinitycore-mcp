    const CalendarEvent & calendarEvent) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a calendar event packet to all relatives of the specified calendar
    event.
  description: This method broadcasts a given WorldPacket to all players who are related
    to a specific calendar event. It is typically used to inform participants, invited
    guests, or other relevant users about updates or changes to a calendar event.
    The method iterates through the event's associated users and sends the provided
    packet to each of them. This functionality supports the WoW calendar system by
    ensuring that all involved parties receive timely notifications regarding event
    modifications.
  parameters:
  - name: packet
    description: A pointer to the WorldPacket containing the data to be sent to event
      relatives. The packet should be properly formatted for calendar-related communications.
  - name: calendarEvent
    description: The CalendarEvent object that defines which users are considered
      'relatives' and will receive the packet. This includes invited players, organizers,
      and other associated users.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Send an update notification to all event relatives
    code: 'WorldPacket packet(SMSG_CALENDAR_EVENT_UPDATED, 0);

      // ... populate packet with data ...

      calendarMgr.SendPacketToAllEventRelatives(&packet, myCalendarEvent);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the CalendarEvent object has a valid list of related
    users. It is designed to be efficient by directly iterating over known relatives
    rather than performing complex lookups. The packet must be properly constructed
    before being passed to this method.
