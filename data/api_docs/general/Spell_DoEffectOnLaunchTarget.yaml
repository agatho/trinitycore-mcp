  method: DoEffectOnLaunchTarget
  signature: void Spell::DoEffectOnLaunchTarget(TargetInfo & targetInfo, float multiplier,
    const SpellEffectInfo & spellEffectInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a spell effect to the target specified in the launch target information.
  description: The DoEffectOnLaunchTarget method is responsible for executing a specific
    spell effect on a target that was designated as the launch target during spell
    casting. This method processes the effect parameters and applies them according
    to the spell's configuration, taking into account multipliers and other contextual
    data. It is typically invoked during the spell's execution phase when the spell's
    effects need to be applied to the target that was initially selected for the spell's
    launch. The method uses the provided TargetInfo structure to determine which target
    to affect and applies the effect using the given multiplier and spell effect information.
  parameters:
  - name: targetInfo
    description: Reference to the TargetInfo structure containing details about the
      target that will receive the spell effect. This includes target GUID, position,
      and other relevant targeting data.
  - name: multiplier
    description: A floating-point value used to scale the base effect of the spell.
      This multiplier can be used to adjust damage or healing amounts based on factors
      like spell power, critical hits, or other modifiers.
  - name: spellEffectInfo
    description: Reference to the SpellEffectInfo structure containing detailed information
      about the specific spell effect being applied, including effect type, base points,
      and other effect-specific parameters.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of DoEffectOnLaunchTarget
    code: 'Spell* spell = ...;

      TargetInfo targetInfo = ...;

      float multiplier = 1.0f;

      SpellEffectInfo effectInfo = spell->GetSpellEffectInfo(0);

      spell->DoEffectOnLaunchTarget(targetInfo, multiplier, effectInfo);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying a damage effect with modified multiplier
    code: "Spell* spell = player->GetCurrentSpell(CURRENT_GENERIC_SPELL);\nif (spell)\n\
      {\n    TargetInfo targetInfo = spell->GetTargetInfo(0);\n    float multiplier\
      \ = 1.2f; // 20% increase\n    SpellEffectInfo effectInfo = spell->GetSpellEffectInfo(0);\n\
      \    spell->DoEffectOnLaunchTarget(targetInfo, multiplier, effectInfo);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the spell system and should
    not be invoked directly in most cases. The targetInfo parameter must contain valid
    target data; otherwise, the effect may fail or apply to an incorrect target. The
    multiplier value can significantly alter the outcome of the spell effect, so it's
    important to ensure proper calculation before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or uninitialized TargetInfo data may
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the spell effect information
    is valid and corresponds to a real spell effect before invoking this method. Improper
    use of the multiplier parameter can lead to unexpected damage or healing values.
