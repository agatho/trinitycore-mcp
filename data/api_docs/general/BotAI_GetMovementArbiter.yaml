  method: GetMovementArbiter
  signature: const MovementArbiter * BotAI::GetMovementArbiter() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the movement arbiter instance used by the bot AI for pathfinding
    and movement decisions.
  description: The GetMovementArbiter method provides access to the MovementArbiter
    object that controls how the bot AI handles movement logic, including pathfinding,
    obstacle avoidance, and navigation decisions. This arbiter is responsible for
    determining the optimal movement behavior based on the current game state, terrain,
    and target positions. The returned pointer is const, indicating that the arbiter's
    state should not be modified through this interface. This method is typically
    called during AI update cycles to retrieve the current movement controller before
    making movement-related decisions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to the MovementArbiter object used by this BotAI instance.
    Returns nullptr if no movement arbiter has been initialized or assigned to the
    bot AI.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Movement Arbiter for Pathfinding
    code: "BotAI* botAI = ...;\nconst MovementArbiter* arbiter = botAI->GetMovementArbiter();\n\
      if (arbiter)\n{\n    // Use arbiter for movement decisions\n    Position targetPos\
      \ = arbiter->GetTargetPosition();\n    // Perform pathfinding operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The MovementArbiter returned by this method is managed internally by the
    BotAI class and should not be deleted or modified directly. This method is thread-safe
    as it only returns a const pointer to an existing object, but the arbiter itself
    may have its own thread safety considerations depending on implementation.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the MovementArbiter through the returned pointer,
    as it's marked as const. Accessing the arbiter after the BotAI instance has been
    destroyed results in undefined behavior. Ensure that the BotAI instance remains
    valid while using the returned arbiter reference.
