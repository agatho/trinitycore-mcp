  class: VendorInteraction
  method: TrackVendorInventory
  signature: void VendorInteraction::TrackVendorInventory(uint32 vendorGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Tracks the inventory of a vendor specified by GUID for interaction purposes.
  description: The TrackVendorInventory method initializes or updates tracking of
    a vendor's inventory in the context of player-vendor interactions. This functionality
    is typically used within the game's trading and shopping mechanics to ensure that
    the player's view of available items matches the current state of the vendor's
    stock. The method likely updates internal data structures or caches related to
    the vendor's inventory, ensuring that subsequent queries for item availability
    or pricing can be resolved efficiently. It may also handle synchronization of
    vendor stock with server-side data, particularly in multi-threaded environments
    where inventory changes might occur concurrently.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Vendor Inventory Tracking
    code: 'VendorInteraction interaction;

      uint32 vendorGuid = 12345;

      interaction.TrackVendorInventory(vendorGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system managing NPC vendor interactions
    and may be called automatically when a player opens a vendor window or manually
    when inventory updates are required. Implementation details may involve thread-safe
    operations to prevent race conditions during concurrent inventory modifications.
  warnings: Ensure that the vendorGuid parameter corresponds to an actual active vendor
    in the game world; otherwise, the method might not perform any meaningful action
    or could throw an exception depending on implementation.
