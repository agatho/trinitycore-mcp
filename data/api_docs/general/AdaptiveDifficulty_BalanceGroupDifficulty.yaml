documentation:
  brief: Adjusts group difficulty settings based on player and bot counts
  description: The BalanceGroupDifficulty method dynamically modifies the difficulty
    scaling for groups in adaptive difficulty systems. It takes into account both
    the number of players and bots within a group to determine appropriate challenge
    levels. This method is typically used in scenarios where group composition affects
    the overall difficulty balance, such as in raid encounters or battlegrounds. The
    function adjusts internal difficulty parameters without returning any value, making
    it a void operation that modifies state directly.
  parameters:
  - name: players
    description: The number of human players in the group. Must be a non-negative
      integer representing valid player count.
  - name: bots
    description: The number of bot-controlled characters in the group. Must be a non-negative
      integer representing valid bot count.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AdaptiveDifficulty difficultySystem;

      int playerCount = 5;

      int botCount = 3;

      difficultySystem.BalanceGroupDifficulty(playerCount, botCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment
    code: "void UpdateGroupDifficulty(int currentPlayers, int currentBots) {\n   \
      \ AdaptiveDifficulty diffSystem;\n    diffSystem.BalanceGroupDifficulty(currentPlayers,\
      \ currentBots);\n    // Additional logic to apply difficulty changes\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state related to group difficulty scaling.
    It's recommended to call this function after any change in player or bot composition
    within a group. The implementation likely uses heuristics to determine appropriate
    difficulty adjustments based on the ratio of players to bots.
  warnings: Ensure that both parameters are non-negative integers before calling this
    method, as negative values may lead to undefined behavior. This method should
    not be called during active combat or critical gameplay moments to avoid potential
    synchronization issues.
