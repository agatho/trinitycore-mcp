documentation:
  brief: Destroys the PlayerbotDatabaseConnection instance and releases associated
    resources.
  description: The destructor for the PlayerbotDatabaseConnection class is responsible
    for cleaning up any resources that were allocated during the object's lifetime.
    This includes closing database connections, releasing memory, and ensuring proper
    cleanup of internal data structures. In the context of TrinityCore's playerbot
    system, this method ensures that database handles are properly closed to prevent
    resource leaks and maintain database connection integrity. The destructor is automatically
    invoked when a PlayerbotDatabaseConnection object goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of PlayerbotDatabaseConnection
    code: 'PlayerbotDatabaseConnection* conn = new PlayerbotDatabaseConnection();

      // ... use the connection ...

      delete conn; // Destructor is called here'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic destruction with stack allocation
    code: "void function() {\n    PlayerbotDatabaseConnection conn;\n    // ... use\
      \ the connection ...\n    // Destructor automatically called when conn goes\
      \ out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a critical part of resource management in the playerbot
    system. It ensures that database connections are properly closed and that no memory
    leaks occur. Since this is a destructor, it should not be called directly by user
    code unless explicitly needed for custom cleanup scenarios.
