documentation:
  brief: Resets all runes for the player, making them available for use again.
  description: The ResetAllRunes method restores all cooldowns and availability states
    of the player's runes. This function is typically invoked when a player enters
    a specific game state such as zoning into a new area, respawning after death,
    or transitioning between different combat phases. It ensures that all rune cooldown
    timers are cleared and that each rune becomes immediately usable. The method operates
    on the RuneManager instance associated with a player character and affects all
    rune types (Blood, Frost, Unholy, Death).
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resetting Runes on Player Respawn
    code: "void Player::OnRespawn()\n{\n    RuneManager* runeMgr = GetRuneManager();\n\
      \    if (runeMgr)\n        runeMgr->ResetAllRunes();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during appropriate game state transitions
    to avoid unintended behavior. It is not thread-safe and must be executed in the
    main game thread context.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of valid game state transitions may cause
    inconsistent rune states or unexpected gameplay behavior. Ensure proper synchronization
    if used in multithreaded environments.
