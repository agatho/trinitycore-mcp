documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's fishing skill based on the specified expansion level
  description: The UpdateFishingSkill method adjusts a player's fishing proficiency
    according to the given expansion parameter. This method is typically invoked when
    a player successfully catches fish or performs fishing-related activities that
    contribute to skill progression. The expansion parameter determines which set
    of fishing skills and bonuses should be considered, such as classic WoW, The Burning
    Crusade, or Wrath of the Lich King content. The method returns true if the skill
    update was successful and false otherwise, indicating potential issues with skill
    calculation or player state.
  parameters:
  - name: expansion
    description: 'An integer value representing the expansion level that affects fishing
      skill progression. Valid values typically correspond to game expansions: 0 for
      Classic, 1 for The Burning Crusade, 2 for Wrath of the Lich King, etc. This
      parameter influences which fishing skills and bonuses are applied during the
      update process.'
  returns: Returns true if the fishing skill was successfully updated based on the
    expansion level; returns false if the update failed due to invalid parameters,
    player state issues, or other internal errors.
  examples:
  - title: Update Fishing Skill for Classic Expansion
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nbool success = player->UpdateFishingSkill(0);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Fishing skill updated successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Update Fishing Skill Based on Expansion Level
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nint32 expansionLevel = player->GetSession()->GetExpansion();\n\
      bool result = player->UpdateFishingSkill(expansionLevel);\nif (!result) {\n\
      \    // Handle failure case - possibly log error or notify user\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's skill database and may trigger
    updates to related fishing-related achievements or quests. It is important to
    ensure that the expansion parameter corresponds to valid expansion levels defined
    in the game's configuration files.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the expansion parameter
    may result in unexpected behavior or errors. Ensure that the expansion value is
    within expected bounds for the current game version.
