  class: PlayerbotGroupManager
  method: DisbandGroup
  signature: bool PlayerbotGroupManager::DisbandGroup(uint32 groupId)
documentation:
  brief: Disbands a specified player bot group and removes all members from the group.
  description: "The DisbandGroup method is responsible for completely dissolving a\
    \ player bot group identified by its unique group ID. When invoked, this method\
    \ will remove all player bots from the group, reset their group affiliations,\
    \ and clean up any associated data structures. The operation ensures that no player\
    \ bots remain in the disbanded group and that the group itself is properly removed\
    \ from the system. This method is typically used when a player bot leader wishes\
    \ to\u89E3\u6563 their group or when a group becomes invalid due to various conditions\
    \ such as all members leaving or being disconnected."
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: The unique identifier of the player bot group to be disbanded. This
      ID must correspond to an existing group in the system, otherwise the operation
      will fail and return false.
  returns: Returns true if the group was successfully disbanded, or false if the group
    could not be found or if there were issues during the disbanding process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Disbanding
    code: "uint32 groupId = 12345;\nif (PlayerbotGroupManager::instance()->DisbandGroup(groupId))\
      \ {\n    LOG_INFO(\"playerbots\", \"Group {} has been successfully disbanded.\"\
      , groupId);\n} else {\n    LOG_ERROR(\"playerbots\", \"Failed to disband group\
      \ {}.\", groupId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group exists and is valid. It performs cleanup
    operations including removing all player bots from the group, resetting their
    group affiliations, and freeing associated memory. The operation is synchronous
    and should not be called from within a critical section or during other concurrent
    operations.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-existent group ID will result in a failed
    operation and return false. Ensure that the groupId parameter corresponds to an
    active player bot group before invoking this method to avoid unnecessary error
    logging or invalid state transitions.
