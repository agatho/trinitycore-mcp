  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: SetEmergencyResponseEnabled
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::SetEmergencyResponseEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the emergency response behavior of the threat coordinator.
  description: The SetEmergencyResponseEnabled method controls whether the ThreatCoordinator
    will activate its emergency response mechanisms. When enabled, the coordinator
    may alter threat generation, targeting behavior, or other AI-related actions in
    response to specific combat conditions. This method is typically used to dynamically
    adjust AI behavior during encounters, particularly when dealing with high-threat
    situations or special event triggers. The change takes effect immediately and
    affects all subsequent threat calculations and responses.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether emergency response should be enabled
      (true) or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Emergency Response
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator* coordinator = unit->GetThreatCoordinator();

      coordinator->SetEmergencyResponseEnabled(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Emergency Response Based on Condition
    code: "if (boss->GetHealthPct() < 20.0f)\n{\n    ThreatCoordinator* coordinator\
      \ = unit->GetThreatCoordinator();\n    coordinator->SetEmergencyResponseEnabled(false);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the ThreatCoordinator
    and should be used carefully during active combat scenarios. Changes to emergency
    response status may immediately affect AI decision-making and threat distribution
    among nearby units.
  warnings: Calling this method during active combat can cause sudden changes in enemy
    behavior, potentially disrupting ongoing encounters or causing unexpected targeting
    shifts. Ensure that emergency response states are properly synchronized with encounter
    phases.
