  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: AnalyzeSpecializationPerformance
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::AnalyzeSpecializationPerformance()
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and records performance metrics for bot specializations within the
    TrinityCore framework.
  description: The AnalyzeSpecializationPerformance method evaluates the effectiveness
    and efficiency of different bot specializations by collecting and processing relevant
    gameplay data. This includes tracking performance indicators such as damage output,
    healing capacity, resource management, and combat efficiency across various specialization
    types. The method is designed to support analytics-driven improvements in bot
    behavior and decision-making algorithms within the World of Warcraft emulation
    environment. It typically runs during periodic performance checks or when specific
    events occur that warrant analysis of specialization effectiveness.

  notes: This method likely operates asynchronously or as part of a scheduled task
    to avoid performance impact during active gameplay. It may depend on data collected
    from previous bot simulations or live gameplay sessions.
