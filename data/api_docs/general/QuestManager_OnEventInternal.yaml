documentation:
  brief: Processes internal quest events for the player
  description: The OnEventInternal method handles internal quest-related events within
    the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically invoked when a quest event
    occurs that requires processing, such as quest completion, objective updates,
    or state changes. It serves as an internal callback mechanism for managing quest
    progression and synchronization between the client and server. The method operates
    on the provided event identifier to determine appropriate actions, ensuring proper
    quest state management and player feedback.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The internal event identifier that specifies which quest-related
      action needs to be processed. Valid values are typically defined constants representing
      specific quest events like QUEST_EVENT_COMPLETE, QUEST_EVENT_UPDATE, or QUEST_EVENT_START.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Processing
    code: "void MyQuestHandler::HandleQuestEvent(int eventId)\n{\n    // Process quest\
      \ event\n    questManager->OnEventInternal(eventId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Event-Based Quest Completion
    code: "void PlayerQuestManager::CompleteQuestWithEvent(Player* player, uint32\
      \ questId)\n{\n    // Mark quest as complete\n    player->CompleteQuest(questId);\n\
      \    \n    // Trigger internal event processing\n    OnEventInternal(QUEST_EVENT_COMPLETE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called internally by the TrinityCore quest
    system. It should not typically be invoked directly from external code unless
    implementing custom quest logic. The method assumes proper initialization of quest
    data structures and valid event identifiers.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid event identifiers may result in undefined
    behavior or quest state corruption. Ensure that all events passed to this method
    are valid constants defined within the TrinityCore quest system.
