  brief: Initializes a new instance of the ProfessionAuctionProfile class.
  description: The ProfessionAuctionProfile constructor initializes a new auction
    profile for a player's profession. This method sets up internal data structures
    and default values required for tracking auction house activities related to crafting
    professions. It prepares the object to store information about items, bids, and
    auction durations specific to the player's profession. The initialization ensures
    that subsequent operations on the auction profile can be performed without encountering
    uninitialized memory errors or invalid state conditions.

  returns: null

  - title: Creating a new ProfessionAuctionProfile instance
    code: 'ProfessionAuctionProfile profile;

      // The profile is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not require any parameters as it initializes default
    values internally. It should be called when a new auction profile needs to be
    created for a player's profession, typically during character loading or profession
    initialization.
