  signature: uint32 GroupEventBus::GetBatchSize() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum number of events that can be processed in a single batch
    operation within the group event bus.
  description: The GetBatchSize method retrieves the configured maximum batch size
    for processing group-related events. This value determines how many events are
    grouped together before being dispatched or handled by the event system. In TrinityCore's
    group management system, this batch size is crucial for optimizing performance
    during group operations such as member additions, removals, or synchronization
    updates. The method returns a constant value that defines the upper limit of events
    processed in one atomic operation to prevent excessive resource consumption and
    maintain system responsiveness. This setting is typically configured at startup
    or through server configuration files and remains static during runtime.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of events allowed in a single
    batch processing cycle. This value is always positive and defines the capacity
    limit for event batching operations within the group event bus system.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Batch Size for Performance Monitoring
    code: 'uint32 batchSize = groupEventBus.GetBatchSize();

      TC_LOG_INFO("group", "Current group event batch size: %u", batchSize);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Use Batch Size in Custom Group Event Handler
    code: "void CustomGroupEventHandler(GroupEventBus& bus) {\n    uint32 maxSize\
      \ = bus.GetBatchSize();\n    // Process events in chunks of maxSize to optimize\
      \ performance\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"group\", \"Processing group events in batches\
      \ of %u\", maxSize);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned batch size value is typically read-only and determined during
    system initialization. Modifying this value at runtime would require restarting
    the server or reinitializing the event bus components. This method is thread-safe
    as it only reads a pre-configured constant value.
