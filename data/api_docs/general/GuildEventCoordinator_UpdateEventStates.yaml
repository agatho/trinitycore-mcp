documentation:
  brief: Updates the state of all guild events managed by the coordinator.
  description: The UpdateEventStates method iterates through all active guild events
    and updates their current state based on internal logic and time-based conditions.
    This method is typically called periodically to ensure that guild events such
    as raids, tournaments, or other scheduled activities are properly tracked and
    managed within the game world. It may trigger state transitions, notify players
    of event changes, and update related data structures in the guild system. The
    method does not take any parameters and performs its operations internally using
    the coordinator's internal event management logic.

  returns: null

  notes: This method is usually invoked by the game's main update loop or a dedicated
    event scheduler. It is important to note that this method modifies internal state
    and should not be called concurrently from multiple threads without proper synchronization.
