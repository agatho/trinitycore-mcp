  method: GetContentTuningForArea
  signature: const ContentTuningEntry * DB2Manager::GetContentTuningForArea(const
    AreaTableEntry * areaEntry)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the ContentTuningEntry associated with a given AreaTableEntry.
  description: This method looks up and returns the ContentTuningEntry that corresponds
    to the provided AreaTableEntry. It is used in World of Warcraft's content tuning
    system, which allows for dynamic adjustment of difficulty and rewards based on
    player level and zone context. The method performs a lookup in internal DB2 data
    structures to find matching content tuning data for the specified area. This functionality
    is essential for proper dungeon and raid scaling mechanics within TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: areaEntry
    description: Pointer to an AreaTableEntry representing the area for which to retrieve
      content tuning data. Must not be null.
  returns: Pointer to a ContentTuningEntry if a matching entry is found; otherwise,
    returns nullptr if no content tuning data exists for the given area.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get content tuning for an area
    code: "const AreaTableEntry* area = sAreaTableStore.LookupEntry(1234);\nconst\
      \ ContentTuningEntry* contentTuning = sDB2Manager->GetContentTuningForArea(area);\n\
      if (contentTuning)\n{\n    // Use contentTuning data\n    uint32 level = contentTuning->PlayerLevelMin;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal DB2 storage and assumes that the AreaTableEntry
    passed has been properly loaded. The returned pointer is valid only as long as
    the DB2 data remains loaded and should not be cached across server sessions.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for areaEntry will likely result in undefined behavior
    or crash. Always validate that the input parameter is non-null before calling
    this method.
