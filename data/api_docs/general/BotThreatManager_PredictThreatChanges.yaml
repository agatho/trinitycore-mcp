documentation:
  brief: Predicts future threat changes for bot AI behavior based on specified time
    ahead.
  description: The PredictThreatChanges method calculates and updates predicted threat
    levels for a bot's target enemies over a given time period. This functionality
    is essential for bot AI decision-making, enabling the system to anticipate potential
    threat scenarios and adjust combat strategies accordingly. The method analyzes
    current combat state, enemy positions, and attack patterns to project how threat
    levels will evolve in the specified timeframe. It typically operates within the
    context of TrinityCore's bot AI subsystem, where accurate threat prediction enhances
    NPC behavior realism and tactical decision-making.

  - title: Basic Threat Prediction
    code: 'BotThreatManager threatManager;

      threatManager.PredictThreatChanges(5000); // Predict changes over 5 seconds
      ahead'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs calculations based on current target positions,
    attack speeds, and damage outputs to estimate future threat distribution. It may
    cache results for performance optimization and should be called regularly during
    active combat scenarios.
  warnings: The accuracy of predictions depends heavily on the bot's current state
    information and assumptions about enemy behavior patterns. Inaccurate predictions
    could lead to suboptimal AI decisions in combat situations.
