  class: DB2Manager
  method: GetCurveValueAt
  signature: float DB2Manager::GetCurveValueAt(CurveInterpolationMode mode, int points,
    float x) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a curve value at the specified point using the given
    interpolation mode and data points.
  description: The GetCurveValueAt method performs curve interpolation based on a
    provided interpolation mode and set of data points to determine a float value
    at a specific x-coordinate. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore for calculating dynamic values such as spell effects, loot probabilities,
    or animation timings that depend on curve-based data. The method supports various
    interpolation modes which define how the curve is calculated between known data
    points. It expects valid input parameters and will return a float representing
    the interpolated value at the specified point.
  parameters:
  - name: mode
    description: The CurveInterpolationMode enum that specifies the type of interpolation
      to use (e.g., linear, cubic, etc.). This determines how values are calculated
      between known data points.
  - name: points
    description: An integer representing the number of data points in the curve. This
      defines the size of the dataset used for interpolation.
  - name: x
    description: A float value indicating the x-coordinate at which to evaluate the
      curve. This is the point along the curve where the interpolated value will be
      returned.
  returns: Returns a float value that represents the calculated curve value at the
    specified x-coordinate using the given interpolation mode and data points. The
    result is typically used in game mechanics for dynamic calculations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GetCurveValueAt
    code: float value = sDB2Manager->GetCurveValueAt(CurveInterpolationMode::Linear,
      5, 2.5f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using curve value in spell effect calculation
    code: 'float damageMultiplier = sDB2Manager->GetCurveValueAt(CurveInterpolationMode::Cubic,
      10, spellLevel);

      float finalDamage = baseDamage * damageMultiplier;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the DB2Manager class and is intended for internal
    use within TrinityCore's database handling system. The interpolation modes and
    data point structure are defined by the game's DB2 files, which store curve-based
    data such as spell coefficients or loot tables. Ensure that the number of points
    matches the expected dataset size to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Incorrectly specifying the interpolation mode or providing an invalid
    number of points may lead to incorrect results or runtime errors. Always validate
    inputs before calling this method, especially when dealing with external data
    sources.
