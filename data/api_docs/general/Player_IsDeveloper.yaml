documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player has developer privileges
  description: The IsDeveloper method checks if the current player object has developer-level
    access permissions within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically
    used to verify if a player possesses special administrative rights that allow
    them to perform developer-specific actions such as accessing debug commands, modifying
    game objects, or bypassing normal gameplay restrictions. The method returns true
    when the player is assigned to the developer group or has been granted developer
    privileges through other means, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has developer privileges, false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsDeveloper()) {\n    // Player has developer privileges\n\
      \    // Perform developer actions here\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's account permissions and may be affected
    by server configuration settings. It typically checks against the player's account
    level or group membership rather than directly checking for a specific flag.
