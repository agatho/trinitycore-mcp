  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: OptimizeTravelRoute
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::OptimizeTravelRoute(Player * bot, int & questGiverGuids)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the travel route for a player bot to efficiently complete quest
    turn-ins.
  description: The OptimizeTravelRoute method calculates and updates the most efficient
    path for a player bot to visit all quest givers associated with active quests.
    This method is typically invoked during quest completion or when the bot needs
    to reorganize its travel plan to minimize travel time and resource usage. It modifies
    the internal travel route of the bot based on current quest data and available
    quest givers in the game world. The optimization considers factors such as distance,
    quest dependencies, and bot movement capabilities to determine the best sequence
    of locations.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will have
      its travel route optimized. Must be a valid player instance with active quests.
  - name: questGiverGuids
    description: Reference to an integer variable that stores the GUIDs of quest givers.
      This parameter is modified by the method to reflect updated or optimized quest
      giver locations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of OptimizeTravelRoute
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized

      int questGiverGuids = 0;

      questTurnIn->OptimizeTravelRoute(myBot, questGiverGuids);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player bot has already been assigned quests
    and that quest giver information is available. The optimization algorithm may
    vary depending on the bot's current location, quest dependencies, and available
    travel methods (e.g., taxi, walking). Performance impact is minimal as it only
    recalculates routes when necessary.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot object passed is valid and active before calling this
    method. Passing a null pointer or inactive player may result in undefined behavior.
    The questGiverGuids parameter should be initialized appropriately to avoid unexpected
    results.
