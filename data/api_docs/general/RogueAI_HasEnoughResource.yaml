  class: RogueAI

  signature: bool RogueAI::HasEnoughResource(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the rogue has sufficient energy or combo points to cast a specified
    spell
  description: The HasEnoughResource method evaluates whether the rogue AI character
    possesses adequate resources (typically energy or combo points) required to execute
    a given spell. This method is crucial for decision-making in the rogue's AI behavior,
    ensuring that spells are only attempted when the character can afford the resource
    cost. The method typically checks against the current energy level or combo point
    count depending on the spell type and the rogue's current state. It serves as
    a prerequisite validation before attempting to cast any ability, preventing invalid
    actions that would otherwise result in failed spell casts or wasted AI cycles.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The identifier of the spell to check resource requirements for. This
      should correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's spell database.
  returns: Returns true if the rogue has sufficient resources (energy or combo points)
    to cast the specified spell, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic resource check before casting
    code: "if (rogueAI->HasEnoughResource(1752)) {\n    // Proceed with casting Sinister\
      \ Strike\n    rogueAI->CastSpell(1752);\n} else {\n    // Find alternative action\n\
      \    rogueAI->ChooseNextAction();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource validation in AI decision loop
    code: "void RogueAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (HasEnoughResource(1752))\
      \ { // Sinister Strike\n        CastSpell(1752);\n    } else if (HasEnoughResource(14177))\
      \ { // Cold Blood\n        CastSpell(14177);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the rogue's current energy pool or combo
    point counter, and may also consider factors such as stealth status or special
    abilities that affect resource generation. The implementation details depend on
    how TrinityCore handles rogue-specific resource management.
  warnings: Ensure that spellId corresponds to a valid spell in the database; invalid
    IDs may cause undefined behavior or incorrect return values. This method should
    not be used outside of combat context without proper state checks.
