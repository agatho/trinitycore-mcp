documentation:
  brief: Initializes all cooldowns for the demonology warlock class
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up and resets all cooldown timers
    for a demonology warlock character. This method is typically called during character
    initialization or when switching to the demonology specialization. It ensures
    that all abilities, spells, and talents related to the demonology tree have their
    cooldowns properly initialized to their default states. The method handles internal
    state management for cooldown tracking and synchronization with the game's cooldown
    system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'DemonologyWarlockRefactored warlock;

      warlock.InitializeCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the character's lifecycle or
    when switching to demonology specialization. It directly interacts with the internal
    cooldown tracking system and may affect spell casting behavior immediately after
    execution.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper state management may
    lead to unexpected cooldown behaviors or synchronization issues with the game
    server. Ensure this is called at appropriate times during character setup.
