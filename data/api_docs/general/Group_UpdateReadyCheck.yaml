  method: UpdateReadyCheck
  signature: void Group::UpdateReadyCheck(int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the ready check status for all group members based on the time elapsed
    since the last update.
  description: The UpdateReadyCheck method is responsible for managing the ready check
    process within a World of Warcraft group. It iterates through all group members
    and updates their ready check status according to the time difference passed as
    a parameter. This method is typically called by the game loop to periodically
    check if players have responded to a ready check request. The method handles timing
    logic for when players are considered 'not ready' or 'ready' based on inactivity
    thresholds, ensuring that group activities like dungeons or raids can proceed
    only when all members are prepared.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      value determines how much time has passed and affects the ready check state
      calculations for each group member.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    static uint32 lastUpdateTime = getMSTime();\n \
      \   uint32 diff = getMSTime() - lastUpdateTime;\n    \n    if (Group* group\
      \ = player->GetGroup())\n    {\n        group->UpdateReadyCheck(diff);\n   \
      \ }\n    \n    lastUpdateTime = getMSTime();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game loop and should be called
    regularly to maintain accurate ready check states. It does not directly send network
    packets but modifies internal group state that may trigger updates to clients.
    The implementation relies on time-based logic to determine readiness, which means
    it's sensitive to system clock accuracy.
