  signature: void BehaviorManager::~BehaviorManager()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BehaviorManager instance and cleans up associated AI behavior
    resources.
  description: The destructor for the BehaviorManager class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated to manage AI behaviors within the TrinityCore
    server. This includes cleaning up any active behavior trees, stopping ongoing
    AI processes, and ensuring proper deallocation of behavior-related data structures.
    The destructor is automatically invoked when a BehaviorManager object goes out
    of scope or is explicitly deleted, making it an essential part of the class's
    resource management lifecycle. It ensures that no memory leaks occur and that
    all AI behaviors are properly terminated before the manager itself is destroyed.

  - title: Automatic destruction of BehaviorManager
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    BehaviorManager manager;\n    // ... use manager\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor called automatically here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing object
    lifetime. It is typically invoked by the C++ runtime when objects go out of scope
    or are deleted. BehaviorManager instances should be properly managed through smart
    pointers or stack allocation to ensure correct cleanup.
