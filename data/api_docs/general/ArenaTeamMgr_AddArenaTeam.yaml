documentation:
  brief: Adds an arena team to the global arena team manager list
  description: The AddArenaTeam method registers a new ArenaTeam object within the
    global arena team management system. This method is typically invoked when a new
    arena team is created and needs to be tracked by the server for matchmaking, statistics,
    and other arena-related functionality. The method ensures that the arena team
    is properly integrated into the server's internal data structures so it can participate
    in arena events and be accessible through various arena APIs. It performs no validation
    on the arena team itself, assuming the provided pointer is valid and properly
    initialized.
  parameters:
  - name: arenaTeam
    description: Pointer to the ArenaTeam object to be added to the manager's internal
      collection. Must not be null and should point to a valid, initialized arena
      team instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ArenaTeam* newTeam = new ArenaTeam();

      // ... initialize the team ...

      arenaTeamMgr->AddArenaTeam(newTeam);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Team After Creation
    code: "uint8 slot = 0;\nArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamByCaptain(playerGuid);\n\
      if (!team)\n{\n    team = new ArenaTeam();\n    team->SetCaptain(playerGuid);\n\
      \    team->SetType(ARENA_TEAM_2v2);\n    // ... additional initialization ...\n\
      \    sArenaTeamMgr->AddArenaTeam(team);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any automatic persistence or database synchronization.
    The arena team must be manually saved to the database if persistence is required.
    The method assumes thread safety from the caller, as it's likely used in a context
    where concurrent access to the arena team manager isn't handled internally.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method will result in undefined behavior
    or crash. Ensure that the ArenaTeam object is properly constructed and initialized
    before calling this method. The arena team instance must remain valid for as long
    as it's registered with the manager.
