  signature: bool PaladinAI::ShouldBuildHolyPower() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the paladin AI should attempt to build holy power based
    on current game state and spell availability.
  description: The ShouldBuildHolyPower method evaluates various conditions within
    the PaladinAI context to decide if it is appropriate for the paladin to generate
    holy power. This decision is typically made based on factors such as available
    spells, current resource levels, combat situation, and strategic gameplay requirements.
    The method returns true when building holy power aligns with optimal playstyle
    or tactical necessity, and false otherwise. It serves as a key component in the
    AI's decision-making process for resource management and spell prioritization.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the paladin AI should build holy power; otherwise returns
    false. The condition typically involves checking if holy power generation would
    be beneficial given current game state, available abilities, and strategic objectives.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision logic
    code: "if (paladinAI->ShouldBuildHolyPower()) {\n    // Execute logic to build\
      \ holy power\n    paladinAI->BuildHolyPower();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with spell selection logic
    code: "void PaladinAI::UpdateAI() {\n    if (ShouldBuildHolyPower()) {\n     \
      \   // Prioritize holy power generation\n        SelectSpell(HOLY_POWER_SPELL);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Continue with other AI behaviors\n        ExecuteNormalCombat();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PaladinAI's core decision-making framework and
    should be called frequently during AI update cycles. It may consider factors like
    cooldowns, mana levels, target health, and spell priority lists to make its determination.
