  signature: BotSpawner & BotSpawner::operator=(const BotSpawner & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one BotSpawner object to another, performing a deep
    copy of all managed resources and state.
  description: The assignment operator for the BotSpawner class performs a deep copy
    of all member variables from the source BotSpawner object to the destination object.
    This includes copying any dynamically allocated memory, internal data structures,
    and configuration settings that define the spawner's behavior. The operation ensures
    that both objects are independent copies after assignment, with no shared references
    to mutable data. In the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this method is crucial
    for duplicating spawner configurations when creating new instances or transferring
    spawn settings between different bot management systems. The assignment operator
    typically returns a reference to the assigned object to allow for chaining operations.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotSpawner object whose contents will be copied to this
      instance. This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid BotSpawner
      configuration.
  returns: A reference to the current BotSpawner object (this) after the assignment
    has been completed, enabling operator chaining such as spawner1 = spawner2 = spawner3;
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment
    code: 'BotSpawner sourceSpawner;

      // Configure sourceSpawner...

      BotSpawner targetSpawner = sourceSpawner; // Uses copy constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      targetSpawner = sourceSpawner; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment
    code: 'BotSpawner spawner1, spawner2, spawner3;

      // Configure all spawners...

      spawner1 = spawner2 = spawner3; // Chained assignment

      // All three spawners now have identical configurations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be implemented carefully to avoid shallow copying of pointers
    or references, which could lead to double-free errors or undefined behavior. The
    implementation must ensure proper memory management and deep copying of all contained
    objects. In TrinityCore's context, this may involve copying bot templates, spawn
    positions, faction settings, and other configuration data.
  warnings: Improper implementation of this operator can cause memory leaks or dangling
    pointer issues if member variables contain pointers to dynamically allocated memory.
    Always ensure that the assignment operator properly handles self-assignment and
    cleans up existing resources before copying new ones.
