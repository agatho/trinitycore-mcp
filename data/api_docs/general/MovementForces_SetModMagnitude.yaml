  class: MovementForces
  method: SetModMagnitude
  signature: void MovementForces::SetModMagnitude(float modMagnitude)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the magnitude modifier for movement forces applied to a unit.
  description: The SetModMagnitude method updates the scalar multiplier that modifies
    the overall strength or intensity of movement forces acting on a game object,
    such as a player or creature. This value is typically used in conjunction with
    other movement mechanics like speed adjustments, knockback effects, or gravitational
    pulls. The modification affects how quickly or forcefully the unit moves in response
    to external forces. This method does not directly alter the unit's position but
    influences the magnitude of force calculations during movement updates.
  parameters:
  - name: modMagnitude
    description: A floating-point value representing the new magnitude modifier for
      movement forces. Positive values increase force strength, while negative values
      may reverse or diminish the effect depending on implementation details.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Apply a 150% movement force multiplier
    code: 'MovementForces* forces = unit->GetMovementForces();

      forces->SetModMagnitude(1.5f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable movement force modifications temporarily
    code: 'MovementForces* forces = unit->GetMovementForces();

      forces->SetModMagnitude(0.0f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal movement system and should be used carefully
    to avoid unintended side effects in combat or gameplay mechanics. The modified
    magnitude may interact with other systems such as movement speed buffs, root effects,
    or environmental forces.
  warnings: Modifying the movement force magnitude directly can cause unpredictable
    behavior if not synchronized with related movement state updates. Avoid setting
    extreme values that could lead to clipping or invalid physics states.
