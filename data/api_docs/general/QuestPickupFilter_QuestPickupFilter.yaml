documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new QuestPickupFilter instance with default settings.
  description: The QuestPickupFilter constructor initializes a new instance of the
    QuestPickupFilter class. This filter is used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    to determine which quests should be considered for pickup by players based on
    various criteria such as quest level, player faction, and quest requirements.
    The constructor sets up default values for internal state variables that control
    filtering behavior. It does not perform any validation or processing of quest
    data directly; instead, it prepares the object for subsequent use in filtering
    operations within the game's quest system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new QuestPickupFilter instance
    code: 'QuestPickupFilter filter;

      // The filter is now initialized with default settings

      // Ready to be used in quest pickup validation logic'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not take any parameters, so the filter will use default
    filtering rules. Developers should ensure that any custom filtering logic is applied
    after construction using appropriate setter methods or by extending the class.
    The filter object should be properly managed to avoid memory leaks in long-running
    applications.
