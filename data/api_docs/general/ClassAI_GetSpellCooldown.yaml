api:
  class: ClassAI
  method: GetSpellCooldown
  signature: int ClassAI::GetSpellCooldown(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the remaining cooldown time for a specified spell in milliseconds.
  description: The GetSpellCooldown method returns the current cooldown duration remaining
    for a given spell ID. This value represents how many milliseconds are left before
    the spell can be cast again. The method is typically used within AI logic to determine
    spell availability and timing decisions. It's important to note that this function
    may return 0 if the spell is not on cooldown or if the spell ID is invalid. In
    a World of Warcraft TrinityCore environment, this method helps NPCs make intelligent
    casting decisions based on their current spell cooldown status.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell for which to retrieve the cooldown.
      This should correspond to a valid Spell ID used in the game's database.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the remaining cooldown time in milliseconds.
    A value of 0 indicates that the spell is not on cooldown or the spell ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int cooldown = ai->GetSpellCooldown(12345);\nif (cooldown == 0) {\n   \
      \ // Spell is available\n    ai->CastSpell(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Cooldown Check with Delay
    code: "int spellId = 98765;\nint cooldown = ai->GetSpellCooldown(spellId);\nif\
      \ (cooldown > 0) {\n    // Schedule next cast after cooldown\n    ai->AddEvent([this,\
      \ spellId]() {\n        this->CastSpell(spellId);\n    }, cooldown);\n} else\
      \ {\n    ai->CastSpell(spellId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the context of an AI instance and relies on internal
    spell tracking mechanisms. The returned value is in milliseconds, which aligns
    with standard TrinityCore time handling. Performance-wise, this call should be
    lightweight as it only accesses cached cooldown information.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided spellId corresponds to a valid spell in the game's
    database; otherwise, unexpected behavior may occur. This method does not validate
    the spell's existence or usability beyond checking its cooldown status.
