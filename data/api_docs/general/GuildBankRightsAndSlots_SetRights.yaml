  class: GuildBankRightsAndSlots
  method: SetRights
  signature: void GuildBankRightsAndSlots::SetRights(int8 _rights)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the rights level for a guild bank tab or slot.
  description: The SetRights method configures the access permissions for a specific
    guild bank tab or slot by assigning a rights value. This value determines which
    guild members can view, deposit, withdraw, or modify items in that particular
    bank tab. The rights level is typically represented as an integer value where
    different bit positions correspond to different permission types such as viewing,
    depositing, withdrawing, and updating. This method is crucial for managing guild
    bank security and access control within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: _rights
    description: An int8 value representing the rights level for the guild bank tab
      or slot. This value typically encodes multiple permission bits where each bit
      position corresponds to a specific access right (e.g., view, deposit, withdraw,
      update). Valid values are usually in the range of 0-255, though exact interpretation
      depends on the internal bit layout used by TrinityCore's guild bank system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Full Rights for a Guild Bank Tab
    code: 'GuildBankRightsAndSlots rightsAndSlots;

      rightsAndSlots.SetRights(7); // Sets all permissions (view, deposit, withdraw)

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Only View and Withdraw Rights
    code: 'GuildBankRightsAndSlots rightsAndSlots;

      rightsAndSlots.SetRights(5); // Binary: 101 - allows view and withdraw only

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal data structures within the GuildBankRightsAndSlots
    class to reflect the new rights configuration. The actual permission enforcement
    is handled by other methods in the guild bank system that check these rights values
    before allowing operations on bank items.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting rights values may lead to unexpected access control
    behavior or security vulnerabilities in guild bank management. Ensure that the
    rights value correctly encodes the intended permissions according to TrinityCore's
    internal bit layout.
