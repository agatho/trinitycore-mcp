documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of another AsyncBotInitializer object to this instance
  description: The assignment operator for AsyncBotInitializer performs a deep copy
    of all member variables from the source object. This method ensures that all internal
    state, including any asynchronous initialization data or configuration parameters,
    is properly transferred to the current instance. The operation returns a reference
    to the assigned object to allow for chaining assignments. In the context of TrinityCore's
    bot system, this operator is crucial for managing bot initialization states and
    ensuring proper resource handling during concurrent operations.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source AsyncBotInitializer object whose contents will be copied
      to this instance
  returns: A reference to the current AsyncBotInitializer object after assignment
    has been completed, enabling operator chaining
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Example
    code: 'AsyncBotInitializer bot1;

      AsyncBotInitializer bot2 = bot1; // Uses copy constructor

      bot2 = bot1; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Assignment Example
    code: 'AsyncBotInitializer bot1, bot2, bot3;

      bot1 = bot2 = bot3; // Chained assignments'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements deep copying to avoid shared references to
    internal data structures. It should be used carefully in multithreaded environments
    where synchronization may be required. The implementation typically handles memory
    management and ensures proper cleanup of existing resources before copying new
    ones.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning large objects as this operation may involve
    significant memory allocation and copying overhead. Avoid self-assignment scenarios
    without proper safeguards, though the compiler-generated implementation typically
    handles this case correctly.
