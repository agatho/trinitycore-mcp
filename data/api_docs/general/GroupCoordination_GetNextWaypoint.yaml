  signature: int GroupCoordination::GetNextWaypoint() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the index of the next waypoint in the group coordination path.
  description: The GetNextWaypoint method returns an integer representing the index
    of the next waypoint in a group coordination path. This method is typically used
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to manage movement coordination for
    groups of units, such as NPCs or players moving together along a predefined route.
    The returned index corresponds to the position in a waypoints array or list that
    defines the path. It is commonly used in conjunction with other group coordination
    methods to control group movement behavior and ensure synchronized positioning.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the index of the next waypoint in the group coordination
    path. Returns -1 if no valid next waypoint exists or if the group coordination
    state is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int nextWaypoint = groupCoordination->GetNextWaypoint();\nif (nextWaypoint\
      \ >= 0)\n{\n    // Proceed to the next waypoint\n    printf(\"Moving to waypoint\
      \ %d\\n\", nextWaypoint);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Movement Control
    code: "GroupCoordination* coord = player->GetGroup()->GetGroupCoordination();\n\
      int currentWP = coord->GetNextWaypoint();\nif (currentWP >= 0)\n{\n    // Get\
      \ the position of the next waypoint\n    Position wpPos = coord->GetWaypointPosition(currentWP);\n\
      \    // Move towards that position\n    player->MovePosition(wpPos);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often used in conjunction with pathfinding and movement AI
    systems. The returned waypoint index should be validated before use to ensure
    it's within the valid range of waypoints. In some implementations, this method
    may update internal state tracking the current position in the path.
  warnings: Calling this method on a null or uninitialized GroupCoordination object
    will likely result in undefined behavior. Ensure proper initialization and validation
    before calling this method in production code.
