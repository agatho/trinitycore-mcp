  class: BotSessionMgr
  method: ReleaseSession
  signature: void BotSessionMgr::ReleaseSession(uint32 bnetAccountId)
documentation:
  brief: Releases a bot session associated with the specified Battle.net account ID.
  description: The ReleaseSession method is responsible for terminating and cleaning
    up a bot session that was previously established for a specific Battle.net account.
    This function ensures that all resources allocated to the session are properly
    freed, including any associated memory, network connections, or game state data.
    It typically gets invoked when a bot session needs to be ended, such as during
    logout, account disconnection, or system shutdown. The method operates on the
    internal session management structure of the BotSessionMgr class and is crucial
    for maintaining proper resource lifecycle control within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: bnetAccountId
    description: The unique Battle.net account identifier for which the bot session
      should be released. This value corresponds to the account ID used by the Battle.net
      authentication system and is essential for identifying the correct session to
      terminate.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: BotSessionMgr::Instance()->ReleaseSession(123456789);
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Session Release
    code: "if (sessionExists) {\n    BotSessionMgr::Instance()->ReleaseSession(accountId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the session exists and is valid before attempting
    to release it. It's recommended to verify session existence prior to calling this
    method to prevent potential errors or undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling ReleaseSession with an invalid or non-existent Battle.net account
    ID may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks if not properly handled
    by internal checks within the implementation.
