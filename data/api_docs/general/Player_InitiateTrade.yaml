  brief: Initiates a trade between the player and another player.
  description: The InitiateTrade method starts a trade session between the current
    player and the specified trader. This method is used to begin the trading process
    where players can exchange items, gold, or other tradeable objects. It typically
    sets up the trade window and prepares both players for the trade interaction.
    The method requires that both players are within the same instance or zone and
    have the necessary permissions to initiate trades.
  parameters:
  - name: trader
    description: A pointer to another Player object representing the trading partner.
      This player must be in the same zone or instance as the current player, and
      both players must be able to interact for trade to occur.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Trade Initiation
    code: 'Player* targetPlayer = ObjectAccessor::GetObjectByType< Player >(ObjectGuid(12345));

      Player->InitiateTrade(targetPlayer);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method should only be called when both players are in a valid state for
    trading, such as being in the same zone or instance. It is recommended to check
    if the target player is in range before initiating trade.
  warnings: This method may fail silently if the target player is not in range or
    if the trade session cannot be established. Ensure that both players are able
    to interact before calling this method.
