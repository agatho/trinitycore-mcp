  class: UpdateData
  method: operator=
  signature: UpdateData & UpdateData::operator=(const UpdateData & right)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of another UpdateData object to this instance
  description: The operator= method performs a deep copy of all data contained in
    the right-hand UpdateData object, including movement updates, object updates,
    and any associated data structures. This assignment operator ensures that the
    current UpdateData instance becomes an independent copy of the source object,
    maintaining all update information necessary for sending packets to clients. The
    operation is commonly used when updating player or creature movement data in the
    World of Warcraft server environment.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The source UpdateData object whose contents will be copied to this
      instance
  returns: A reference to the current UpdateData object, allowing for chained assignment
    operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Example
    code: 'UpdateData data1;

      UpdateData data2 = data1; // Uses operator=

      // or

      UpdateData data3;

      data3 = data1; // Uses operator='
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'UpdateData data1, data2, data3;

      data3 = data2 = data1; // Chained assignment using operator='
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a deep copy operation which may have performance implications
    when dealing with large amounts of update data. The implementation ensures proper
    memory management and avoids shallow copying that could lead to dangling pointers
    or memory corruption.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning large UpdateData objects as this operation
    can be expensive in terms of memory allocation and copying time. Ensure that the
    source object remains valid throughout the assignment process.
