documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is currently in an arena match
  description: The InArena method checks if the player character is participating
    in an arena battleground or arena match. This method returns true when the player
    is in an active arena instance, and false when they are not. The method is commonly
    used to determine player engagement status during PvP activities and can be useful
    for implementing game logic that depends on arena participation. It is important
    to note that this method does not distinguish between different types of arenas
    (2v2, 3v3, or 5v5) but rather checks if the player is in any arena instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently in an arena match, false otherwise.
    The method returns false when the player is not in an arena instance or when they
    are in a non-arena battleground.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->InArena())\n{\n    // Player is in an arena\n    // Do something\
      \ specific to arena gameplay\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player is not in an arena\n\
      \    // Handle non-arena gameplay\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method relies on internal game state tracking
    and may be affected by server-side changes. Performance considerations: The method
    itself is lightweight but may involve checking multiple internal states. Thread
    safety: This method is thread-safe as it only reads from the player''s current
    state without modifying any shared resources.'
  warnings: 'This method does not distinguish between different arena types (2v2,
    3v3, or 5v5), so developers should be aware that the return value may not reflect
    specific arena type information. Common mistake: Using this method for determining
    specific arena type rather than general arena participation can lead to incorrect
    game logic.'
