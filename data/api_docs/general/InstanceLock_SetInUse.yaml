  class: InstanceLock
  method: SetInUse
  signature: void InstanceLock::SetInUse(bool inUse)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the in-use status of an instance lock to indicate whether it is currently
    being accessed.
  description: The SetInUse method updates the internal state of an InstanceLock object
    to reflect whether the associated instance is currently in use. This flag is typically
    used by the TrinityCore server to manage instance lifecycle and prevent concurrent
    access to the same instance by multiple players or groups. When set to true, it
    indicates that the instance is actively being used; when set to false, it signifies
    that the instance is available for use. The method does not perform any validation
    on the input parameter and directly assigns the provided boolean value to the
    internal in-use flag.
  parameters:
  - name: inUse
    description: A boolean value indicating whether the instance lock should be marked
      as in use (true) or available (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Marking an Instance as In Use
    code: 'InstanceLock* lock = new InstanceLock();

      lock->SetInUse(true);

      // The instance is now marked as in use'
    language: cpp
  - title: Releasing an Instance Lock
    code: "InstanceLock* lock = GetInstanceLockForPlayer(player);\nif (lock)\n{\n\
      \    lock->SetInUse(false);\n    // The instance is now available for other\
      \ players\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore instance management
    system. Developers should not directly call this method unless implementing custom
    instance locking logic. The in-use flag is used in conjunction with other instance
    management functions to ensure proper synchronization and prevent race conditions
    when accessing shared instances.
  warnings: Direct manipulation of the instance lock state may lead to inconsistent
    behavior if not properly coordinated with the instance management system. Improper
    use can result in players being unable to enter instances or instances remaining
    locked indefinitely.
