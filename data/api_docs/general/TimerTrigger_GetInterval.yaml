  class: TimerTrigger
  method: GetInterval
  signature: uint32 TimerTrigger::GetInterval() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the time interval in milliseconds at which the timer trigger executes.
  description: The GetInterval method retrieves the configured time interval for a
    TimerTrigger object. This interval determines how frequently the timer will fire
    or execute its associated action. The returned value is expressed in milliseconds
    and represents the delay between successive timer activations. In the context
    of TrinityCore's AI and event system, this method allows developers to query the
    timing configuration of a timer trigger, which is essential for managing periodic
    events, cooldowns, or scheduled actions within game systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the time interval in milliseconds. This value
    indicates how often the timer will trigger. A return value of 0 typically means
    the timer is disabled or not properly initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Timer Interval
    code: "TimerTrigger* trigger = new TimerTrigger(5000); // 5 second interval\n\
      uint32 interval = trigger->GetInterval();\n// interval will be 5000\nif (interval\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Timer is active and will fire every 'interval' milliseconds\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Interval in Game Event Logic
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override\n    {\n        if (m_timer)\n        {\n            uint32 interval\
      \ = m_timer->GetInterval();\n            if (interval > 0 && m_timer->GetTimer()\
      \ >= interval)\n            {\n                // Execute periodic action\n\
      \                DoSomething();\n                m_timer->Reset(); // Reset\
      \ timer after execution\n            }\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned interval value is typically set during the TimerTrigger's initialization
    or configuration. This method is thread-safe as it only reads a stored value without
    modifying internal state. It is commonly used in conjunction with other timer-related
    methods like Reset() or GetTimer() to manage periodic execution logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the TimerTrigger object has been properly initialized before
    calling this method, as retrieving an interval from an uninitialized object may
    return unexpected values. Also, be cautious when using very small intervals (e.g.,
    less than 10ms) as they can cause performance issues in game loops.
