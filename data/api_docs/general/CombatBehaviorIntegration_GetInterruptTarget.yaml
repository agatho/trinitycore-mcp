  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: GetInterruptTarget
  signature: Unit * CombatBehaviorIntegration::GetInterruptTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the target unit that is currently being interrupted by this combat
    behavior integration.
  description: The GetInterruptTarget method returns a pointer to the Unit object
    that represents the target currently under interruption within the combat behavior
    integration. This method is typically used in AI logic to determine which enemy
    or ally is currently affected by an interruptible spell or ability. The returned
    Unit pointer may be null if no target is currently being interrupted, or if the
    interrupt state has been cleared. This functionality is essential for maintaining
    proper combat flow and ensuring that interrupt effects are correctly applied to
    the intended targets.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Unit object representing the current interrupt target,
    or nullptr if no interrupt target exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Unit* target = combatBehavior->GetInterruptTarget();\nif (target != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Process the interrupted target\n    target->AddThreat(attacker, 100.0f);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Interrupt Target Before Action
    code: "Unit* interruptTarget = combatBehavior->GetInterruptTarget();\nif (interruptTarget\
      \ != nullptr && interruptTarget->IsAlive())\n{\n    // Perform actions on the\
      \ interrupted target\n    if (interruptTarget->HasAura(12345)) // Example aura\
      \ ID\n    {\n        interruptTarget->RemoveAura(12345);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within the context of combat behavior
    logic. The returned Unit pointer is valid only during the current execution cycle
    and may become invalid if the target dies or is removed from combat. Developers
    should always check for null before using the returned pointer.
  warnings: Never assume that the returned Unit pointer will remain valid beyond the
    current function call. If the interrupt target is removed from combat (e.g., killed,
    despawned), the pointer may become a dangling reference. Always validate the return
    value before dereferencing.
