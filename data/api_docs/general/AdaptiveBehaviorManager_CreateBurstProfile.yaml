documentation:
  brief: Creates a new burst profile for adaptive behavior management.
  description: The CreateBurstProfile method initializes and sets up a new burst profile
    within the AdaptiveBehaviorManager. This profile is designed to handle rapid,
    high-intensity behavior patterns in response to specific game events or triggers.
    The method likely configures parameters such as activation thresholds, cooldown
    periods, and intensity levels for burst behaviors. It is typically invoked when
    the system needs to dynamically adjust AI behavior to respond to sudden changes
    in combat situations or environmental stimuli.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AdaptiveBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = ...;

      behaviorManager->CreateBurstProfile();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before attempting to activate any burst behaviors.
    The created profile will persist until explicitly destroyed or replaced by another
    profile creation.
