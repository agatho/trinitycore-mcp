  method: ~BotSpawnOrchestrator
  signature: void BotSpawnOrchestrator::~BotSpawnOrchestrator()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BotSpawnOrchestrator instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotSpawnOrchestrator class is responsible for
    releasing all dynamically allocated memory and cleaning up any internal state
    or references held by the orchestrator. This method ensures that when a BotSpawnOrchestrator
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted, no memory leaks occur and all
    associated bot-related data structures are properly disposed of. In the context
    of TrinityCore's AI system, this destructor likely handles cleanup of bot spawn
    queues, pending spawn requests, and any internal tracking mechanisms used to manage
    automated bot creation and deployment within the game world.

  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of BotSpawnOrchestrator
    code: 'BotSpawnOrchestrator* orchestrator = new BotSpawnOrchestrator();

      // ... perform operations with the orchestrator ...

      delete orchestrator; // Triggers ~BotSpawnOrchestrator()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically invoked during object destruction. Developers
    should not manually call this method unless implementing custom memory management
    patterns. The cleanup process may involve iterating through internal lists of
    spawned bots and ensuring proper removal from the game world.
  warnings: Do not call this destructor directly in user code; it should only be invoked
    by the C++ runtime during object destruction. Improper manual invocation can lead
    to undefined behavior or double-free errors if the object has already been destroyed.
