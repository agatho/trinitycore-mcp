  class: PlayerChoiceScript
  method: PlayerChoiceScript
  signature: void PlayerChoiceScript::PlayerChoiceScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a PlayerChoiceScript with the specified name.
  description: The PlayerChoiceScript constructor initializes a new instance of the
    PlayerChoiceScript class with the provided name. This method sets up the internal
    state of the script, allowing it to be registered and executed within the TrinityCore
    framework. The name parameter is used to uniquely identify this specific player
    choice script in the system. This constructor is typically called when creating
    custom player choice interactions or quest choices that require specialized scripting
    behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated character string that serves as the unique identifier
      for this PlayerChoiceScript instance. This name is used internally by TrinityCore
      to manage and retrieve the script during player choice events.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic PlayerChoiceScript Initialization
    code: PlayerChoiceScript myChoice("MyCustomChoice");
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Script for Quest Choice
    code: "class QuestChoiceScript : public PlayerChoiceScript {\npublic:\n    QuestChoiceScript()\
      \ : PlayerChoiceScript(\"QuestChoice_001\") {}\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called during object initialization. The
    name parameter must be a valid, non-null string. The script instance will not
    be functional until properly registered with the TrinityCore system using appropriate
    registration methods.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor on already initialized objects as it may
    lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the name provided is unique within your
    module to avoid conflicts with other scripts.
