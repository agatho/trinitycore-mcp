documentation:
  brief: Retrieves and processes achievement member data for a guild.
  description: The HandleGuildGetAchievementMembers method is responsible for handling
    client requests to fetch information about guild members who have earned specific
    achievements. This method processes incoming packet data from the client, validates
    the request, and retrieves relevant achievement-related statistics or records
    associated with guild members. It typically involves querying the database for
    achievement progress of players within the guild context, formatting the data
    into a response packet, and sending it back to the requesting client. The method
    ensures that only authorized guild members can access this information based on
    their permissions and the guild's settings.
  parameters:
  - name: getAchievementMembers
    description: A reference to a GuildGetAchievementMembers packet containing the
      achievement ID and other relevant parameters for fetching member data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleGuildGetAchievementMembers(WorldPackets::Achievement::GuildGetAchievementMembers&\
      \ getAchievementMembers)\n{\n    // Validate the achievement ID\n    if (getAchievementMembers.AchievementID\
      \ == 0)\n        return;\n\n    // Fetch guild members who have earned this\
      \ achievement\n    // ... database query logic here ...\n\n    // Send response\
      \ packet back to client\n    WorldPackets::Achievement::GuildGetAchievementMembersResponse\
      \ response;\n    // ... populate response data ...\n    SendPacket(response.Write());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the achievement system integration within the guild
    framework. It requires proper authentication and authorization checks to ensure
    that only players with appropriate guild permissions can access member achievement
    data. The implementation may involve database queries that could impact performance
    if not optimized.
  warnings: Improper handling of the achievement ID parameter or lack of validation
    can lead to incorrect data retrieval or potential security vulnerabilities. Ensure
    that all incoming packet data is properly validated before processing.
