  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: IsObstacleTemporary
  signature: bool ObstacleAvoidanceManager::IsObstacleTemporary(const ObstacleInfo
    & obstacle)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given obstacle is temporary in nature.
  description: The IsObstacleTemporary method evaluates whether a specified obstacle,
    represented by an ObstacleInfo object, is classified as temporary. This classification
    affects how the AI or navigation system handles the obstacle during pathfinding
    and movement calculations. Temporary obstacles may be ignored or treated differently
    compared to permanent ones, especially in dynamic environments such as battlegrounds
    or areas with destructible terrain. The method likely checks internal flags or
    properties of the obstacle to make this determination.
  parameters:
  - name: obstacle
    description: A constant reference to an ObstacleInfo object that represents the
      obstacle being evaluated for temporary status.
  returns: Returns true if the obstacle is classified as temporary, false otherwise.
    A temporary obstacle may be one that will disappear or change state during gameplay.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an obstacle is temporary before pathfinding
    code: "ObstacleInfo obstacle;\n// ... populate obstacle with data ...\nif (obstacleAvoidanceManager.IsObstacleTemporary(obstacle))\
      \ {\n    // Handle temporary obstacle differently in pathfinding logic\n   \
      \ // e.g., skip it or treat it as a dynamic element\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the AI system to optimize movement
    decisions. It's important to understand that the classification of an obstacle
    as temporary may depend on game state, such as whether the obstacle is part of
    a destructible environment or a spell effect.
