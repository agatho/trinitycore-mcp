documentation:
  brief: Packs tile coordinates into a single 32-bit identifier for efficient map
    tile management.
  description: The packTileID method combines two 32-bit tile coordinates (tileX and
    tileY) into a single 32-bit integer value. This packing mechanism is used internally
    by the StaticMapTree system to uniquely identify and manage map tiles within the
    game world. The method typically packs the X and Y coordinates into a compact
    format suitable for use as keys in hash tables or other data structures that require
    a single identifier for tile lookup. This approach reduces memory overhead and
    improves performance when dealing with large numbers of map tiles during pathfinding
    and spatial queries.
  parameters:
  - name: tileX
    description: The X coordinate of the tile, typically representing horizontal position
      in the map grid. Valid values are usually within the range of 0 to 255 for standard
      map tile grids.
  - name: tileY
    description: The Y coordinate of the tile, typically representing vertical position
      in the map grid. Valid values are usually within the range of 0 to 255 for standard
      map tile grids.
  returns: A 32-bit unsigned integer containing the packed tile identifier. The upper
    16 bits represent the tileX coordinate, and the lower 16 bits represent the tileY
    coordinate. This packed value can be used as a key in tile lookup tables or for
    efficient storage and retrieval of tile data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Tile ID Packing
    code: 'uint32 packedId = staticMapTree.packTileID(10, 20);

      // Result: packedId will contain a value representing tile (10, 20)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Packed ID for Tile Lookup
    code: 'uint32 x = 5;

      uint32 y = 15;

      uint32 packedId = staticMapTree.packTileID(x, y);

      // Use packedId as key to retrieve or store tile data

      TileData* tile = tileLookupTable.find(packedId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that both tileX and tileY parameters are within the valid
    range for a 16-bit unsigned integer (0-65535). The packing scheme uses bit shifting
    to combine the two coordinates into one value, which means it's not suitable for
    coordinates outside this range. This implementation is optimized for performance
    and memory efficiency in the context of TrinityCore's map tile management system.
  warnings: Ensure that both input parameters are within valid ranges (typically 0-65535)
    to avoid unexpected behavior due to bit overflow. The method does not perform
    bounds checking on inputs, so invalid coordinates may produce incorrect packed
    values or undefined behavior.
