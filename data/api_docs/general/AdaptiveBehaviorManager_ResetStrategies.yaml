  method: ResetStrategies
  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::ResetStrategies()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all adaptive behavior strategies to their default states.
  description: The ResetStrategies method clears and reinitializes all active adaptive
    behavior strategies within the AdaptiveBehaviorManager. This operation typically
    occurs when a creature's AI state needs to be fully reset, such as after a combat
    encounter or when transitioning between different AI modes. The method ensures
    that all strategy configurations are restored to their initial values, effectively
    clearing any temporary or dynamic adjustments made during gameplay. It is commonly
    invoked during AI initialization, state transitions, or when resetting NPC behavior
    to baseline conditions.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Reset
    code: "void CreatureAI::Reset()\n{\n    m_adaptiveBehaviorManager.ResetStrategies();\n\
      \    // Additional reset logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage During Combat Reset
    code: "void BossAI::OnCombatEnd()\n{\n    // Reset all adaptive behaviors before\
      \ ending combat\n    m_adaptiveBehaviorManager.ResetStrategies();\n    // Reinitialize\
      \ default AI behavior\n    InitializeDefaultStrategies();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the AI system is in a stable state.
    Calling it during active strategy execution may lead to undefined behavior or
    inconsistent AI states. The reset operation is typically lightweight but may involve
    clearing internal caches and reinitializing strategy parameters.
  warnings: Avoid calling ResetStrategies during active combat or high-frequency AI
    updates as it may interrupt ongoing behavior calculations. Ensure that all dependent
    systems are properly synchronized before invoking this method to prevent race
    conditions or inconsistent AI states.
