documentation:
  brief: Applies active mitigation effects for the Blood Death Knight, reducing incoming
    damage based on specified conditions.
  description: The HandleActiveMitigation method is responsible for managing and applying
    active mitigation mechanics specific to the Blood Death Knight class. This function
    typically evaluates the current state of the player's abilities, such as whether
    certain talents or spells are active, and applies appropriate damage reduction
    effects to the character. It may interact with the player's health pool, cooldowns,
    and other defensive mechanisms that are part of the Blood Death Knight's gameplay
    style. The method is generally invoked during combat situations when damage is
    being taken, ensuring that mitigation effects are properly calculated and applied
    in real-time.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void MyBloodDK::OnDamageTaken(uint32 damage)\n{\n    // Apply active mitigation\
      \ before reducing health\n    HandleActiveMitigation();\n    // Proceed with\
      \ normal damage processing\n    // ... additional logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the core combat system during
    damage application. Developers should ensure that any custom mitigation logic
    implemented in this function does not conflict with existing TrinityCore mechanics
    or player state management.
