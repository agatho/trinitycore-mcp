  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: AssignRoles
  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::AssignRoles()
documentation:
  brief: Assigns appropriate roles to units within the adaptive behavior manager based
    on current game state and AI priorities.
  description: The AssignRoles method determines and assigns specific behavioral roles
    to units managed by the AdaptiveBehaviorManager. This process evaluates each unit's
    current state, including health, mana, threat level, and proximity to targets,
    to assign them roles such as tank, healer, or damage dealer. The assignment is
    dynamic and adapts to changing battlefield conditions. The method ensures optimal
    distribution of responsibilities among group members for efficient combat performance.
    It typically runs during AI update cycles and may be triggered manually in response
    to specific events like unit joining or leaving the group.

  - title: Basic Role Assignment
    code: 'AdaptiveBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = player->GetAI()->GetAdaptiveBehaviorManager();

      behaviorManager->AssignRoles();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system during update
    cycles. Developers should not call this method directly unless implementing custom
    behavior logic. The role assignment algorithm considers multiple factors including
    unit class, current combat state, and group composition.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of normal AI update cycles may cause unexpected
    behavior or disrupt existing role assignments. Ensure that units have valid AI
    contexts before calling this method.
