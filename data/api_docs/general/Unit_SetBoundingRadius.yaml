  class: Unit
  method: SetBoundingRadius
  signature: void Unit::SetBoundingRadius(float boundingRadius)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the bounding radius of the unit to define its collision boundaries.
  description: This method updates the bounding radius of a Unit object, which determines
    the spatial extent used for collision detection and movement calculations in the
    game world. The bounding radius affects how the unit interacts with other objects
    and terrain during movement, particularly in terms of avoiding obstacles and maintaining
    proper spacing. This value is crucial for ensuring accurate physical interactions
    and pathfinding behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: boundingRadius
    description: The new bounding radius value to set for the unit. This represents
      the distance from the unit's center to its outer boundary, influencing collision
      detection and movement constraints.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetBoundingRadius(1.5f);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetBoundingRadius(2.0f);

      // This would affect how the unit navigates through tight spaces

      // and interacts with other units during movement

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it directly affects collision detection
    and pathfinding behavior. Changes to bounding radius may require recalculating
    movement paths or updating related physics calculations.
  warnings: Modifying bounding radius can cause unexpected behavior in movement and
    collision detection if not properly handled. This method should only be used when
    the unit's physical properties need to be adjusted for gameplay reasons.
