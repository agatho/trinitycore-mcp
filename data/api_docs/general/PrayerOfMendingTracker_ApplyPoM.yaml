  class: PrayerOfMendingTracker
  method: ApplyPoM
  signature: void PrayerOfMendingTracker::ApplyPoM(int guid, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a Prayer of Mending effect to a target player with specified duration.
  description: The ApplyPoM method is used to initiate or refresh a Prayer of Mending
    buff on a target player. This method takes the target's GUID and a duration value
    to determine how long the buff will last. The Prayer of Mending is a healing spell
    that allows the caster to heal the target and then transfer that healing to other
    nearby allies over time. This method likely updates internal tracking structures
    within the PrayerOfMendingTracker class to manage the effect's lifecycle and ensure
    proper healing distribution. It may also handle synchronization with the game
    server to maintain consistency of the buff state across all connected clients.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target player who will receive
      the Prayer of Mending effect. This value must correspond to a valid player in
      the current world context.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the Prayer of Mending effect
      should remain active. This determines how long the healing transfer will occur
      between the target and nearby allies.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Application of Prayer of Mending
    code: 'PrayerOfMendingTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyPoM(123456, 10000); // Apply to player with GUID 123456 for 10
      seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Refreshing Prayer of Mending Duration
    code: 'PrayerOfMendingTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyPoM(789012, 15000); // Refresh existing PoM with new duration of
      15 seconds'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the TrinityCore's spell system and aura
    management to properly register and maintain the Prayer of Mending effect. The
    implementation may involve updating internal timers, tracking heal transfers,
    and ensuring proper synchronization with the game world state.
  warnings: The GUID parameter must reference a valid player object; otherwise, this
    method could cause undefined behavior or crash the server. Additionally, duration
    values should be within reasonable bounds to prevent excessive memory usage or
    performance degradation.
