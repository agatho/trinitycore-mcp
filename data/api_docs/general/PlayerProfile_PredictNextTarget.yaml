documentation:
  brief: Predicts the next target for the player based on candidate selections
  description: The PredictNextTarget method analyzes the current state of candidate
    targets and determines the most likely next target the player will select. This
    method is typically used in AI-driven targeting systems or combat logic to anticipate
    player behavior. The prediction takes into account various factors such as target
    priority, distance, threat level, and player's current focus. It returns an identifier
    representing the predicted target from the provided candidates list.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer identifier corresponding to the predicted next target.
    A value of -1 may indicate no valid prediction could be made or that the candidate
    list was empty.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int predictedTarget = playerProfile->PredictNextTarget(candidates);\nif\
      \ (predictedTarget != -1) {\n    // Use predictedTarget for AI decision making\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Predicted target ID: \" << predictedTarget << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other targeting logic to improve
    NPC or player AI behavior. The accuracy of predictions may depend on the quality
    and relevance of the candidate list provided.
  warnings: Ensure that the candidates parameter contains valid target identifiers
    before calling this method, as invalid inputs may lead to incorrect predictions
    or undefined behavior.
