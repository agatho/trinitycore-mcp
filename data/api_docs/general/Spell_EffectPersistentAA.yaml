documentation:
  brief: Applies persistent area effect to target units within the spell's range
  description: The EffectPersistentAA method handles the application of persistent
    area effects in TrinityCore's spell system. This method processes all targets
    within the spell's range and applies the appropriate aura effects, typically used
    for spells like 'Area of Effect' or 'Persistent Area' abilities. It ensures that
    the correct target selection is made and that the spell's effect is properly applied
    to all affected units. The method is commonly used in conjunction with other spell
    effects to manage area-based gameplay mechanics such as AoE damage, healing, or
    debuffs.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void Spell::EffectPersistentAA() {\n    // Implementation for handling\
      \ persistent area effects\n    // This method applies aura effects to all targets\
      \ in range\n    // Example: applying a debuff to all enemies within radius\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell execution when the spell requires
    persistent area effects. It's important to note that this method may be invoked
    multiple times per spell depending on the spell's effect type and target selection.
    Performance considerations include checking for valid targets and ensuring proper
    handling of multiple targets.
  warnings: The method should not be called directly by other methods without proper
    context; it's designed to be part of the spell execution flow. Care must be taken
    when implementing this method to avoid infinite loops or incorrect target selection.
