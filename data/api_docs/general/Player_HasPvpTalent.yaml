  signature: bool Player::HasPvpTalent(uint32 talentID, uint8 activeTalentGroup) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has a specific PvP talent in their active talent group.
  description: 'The HasPvpTalent method determines whether a player possesses a particular
    PvP talent within their current active talent group. This method is commonly used
    in PvP-related gameplay mechanics and can be essential for checking talent availability
    or performing conditional logic based on player''s talent composition. The method
    accepts two parameters: the talent ID to check for, and the active talent group
    to check within. It returns true if the talent exists in that specific group,
    false otherwise.'
  parameters:
  - name: talentID
    description: The unique identifier of the PvP talent being checked. This value
      corresponds to a specific talent in the game's talent system and is typically
      used to identify which talent is being queried.
  - name: activeTalentGroup
    description: The active talent group number (0-2) that determines which talent
      group is being checked. This parameter specifies which of the three talent groups
      is currently active, with 0 representing the first group, 1 the second, and
      2 the third.
  returns: Returns true if the specified PvP talent exists within the given active
    talent group, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->HasPvpTalent(12345, 0)) {\n    // Do something\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "bool hasTalent = player->HasPvpTalent(54321, 1);\nif (hasTalent) {\n  \
      \  // Perform actions based on talent presence\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be used in both player and non-player
    contexts. It is commonly used in PvP-related logic, such as checking for specific
    talents before allowing certain actions or conditions to be met.
  warnings: The talent ID must match the actual talent definition in the game's database;
    otherwise, incorrect results may occur. Be aware that this method only checks
    the active talent group, not all talent groups available.
