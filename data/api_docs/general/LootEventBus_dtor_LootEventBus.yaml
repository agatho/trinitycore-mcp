documentation:
  brief: Destroys the LootEventBus instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the LootEventBus class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the lifetime
    of the LootEventBus object. This method ensures proper resource deallocation when
    the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's
    loot system, this may involve unregistering event listeners, clearing internal
    data structures, or releasing references to loot templates and related game objects.
    The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when the object is
    destroyed, and it should not be called manually unless performing explicit cleanup
    in a custom destructor chain.

  - title: Automatic destruction of LootEventBus
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    LootEventBus eventBus;\n    // ... use eventBus\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor called automatically here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a critical part of the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
    pattern in C++. It ensures that all resources held by the LootEventBus are properly
    released, preventing memory leaks and maintaining system stability. Developers
    should not manually invoke this destructor unless implementing custom destruction
    logic.
