  class: Unit
  method: SetMeleeAnimKitId
  signature: void Unit::SetMeleeAnimKitId(uint16 animKitId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the melee animation kit ID for the unit, determining the combat stance
    animation used during melee attacks.
  description: This method assigns a specific melee animation kit ID to a Unit object,
    which controls the visual animation displayed when the unit performs melee attacks.
    The animation kit ID corresponds to predefined combat stance animations in the
    game's animation database. This method is typically used for setting custom combat
    stances or modifying existing ones during combat. The change takes effect immediately
    and affects all subsequent melee attacks performed by the unit.
  parameters:
  - name: animKitId
    description: The animation kit ID to assign to the unit. This value must correspond
      to a valid animation kit in the game's database, typically ranging from 0 to
      65535. Invalid values may cause display issues or no effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = new Unit();\n target->SetMeleeAnimKitId(1234);\n // Sets\
      \ the unit's melee animation kit to ID 1234"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Unit* player = new Unit();\n player->SetMeleeAnimKitId(5678);\n // Sets\
      \ the player's melee animation kit to ID 5678\n// This will affect all melee\
      \ attacks performed by this player"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method directly modifies the unit's combat stance animation without requiring
    additional setup or configuration. It is thread-safe and can be called from any
    thread context.
  warnings: Improper use of invalid animation kit IDs may result in visual glitches
    or incorrect animations during combat. Ensure that the provided ID corresponds
    to valid animation entries in the game database.
