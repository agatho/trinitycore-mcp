documentation:
  brief: Initializes default phases for the orchestrator configuration
  description: The InitializeDefaultPhases method sets up the default phase definitions
    and configurations used by the Orchestrator system. This method is typically called
    during system initialization to establish baseline phase behavior, including defining
    available phases, their priorities, and default activation conditions. The method
    ensures that all required phase data structures are properly initialized before
    any phase-based operations begin.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'OrchestratorConfig config;

      config.InitializeDefaultPhases();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during system initialization. Repeated
    calls may result in undefined behavior or data corruption. The method assumes
    that the underlying configuration storage is already allocated and ready for use.
  warnings: Do not call this method after phase operations have begun, as it may invalidate
    existing phase states. Ensure all dependent systems are properly initialized before
    invoking this method.
