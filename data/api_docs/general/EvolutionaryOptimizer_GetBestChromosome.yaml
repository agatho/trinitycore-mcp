documentation:
  brief: Returns the best chromosome from the evolutionary optimization process
  description: Retrieves the highest-fitness chromosome that has been identified during
    the evolutionary algorithm's operation. This method provides access to the optimal
    solution found so far, which represents the most effective strategy configuration
    within the population. The returned chromosome contains encoded parameters that
    define a specific strategy for behavior or decision-making in the game context.
    The method is typically called after the evolutionary process has completed or
    reached a defined stopping condition.
  parameters: []
  returns: A StrategyChromosome object representing the best solution found during
    the evolutionary optimization process. This chromosome contains encoded parameters
    that define an optimal strategy configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieving Best Chromosome After Evolution
    code: 'EvolutionaryOptimizer optimizer;

      // ... population initialized and evolved ...

      StrategyChromosome best = optimizer.GetBestChromosome();

      // Use the best chromosome to configure AI behavior

      std::cout << "Best fitness: " << best.GetFitness() << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that at least one chromosome exists in the optimization
    process. If called before any evolution has occurred, it may return an uninitialized
    or default chromosome. The returned chromosome is a copy and modifications to
    it will not affect the internal state of the optimizer.
  warnings: The method does not validate whether the evolutionary process has actually
    converged or completed. Calling this method immediately after initialization may
    return suboptimal results. Ensure that sufficient evolutionary iterations have
    been performed before retrieving the best chromosome.
