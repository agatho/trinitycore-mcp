  class: ConditionMgr
  method: addToGraveyardData
  signature: void ConditionMgr::addToGraveyardData(const ConditionId & id, int conditions)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Adds a condition identifier and its associated conditions data to the graveyard
    data structure.
  description: The addToGraveyardData method is responsible for registering a condition
    identifier along with its corresponding conditions value into the internal graveyard
    data storage managed by the ConditionMgr class. This functionality is typically
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to associate specific conditional requirements
    with graveyard locations, ensuring that certain game mechanics or events are properly
    gated by these conditions. The method operates on const data, indicating it does
    not modify the object's state but may update internal structures. It is part of
    the core condition system that allows for dynamic and flexible quest and spawn
    logic based on player states or environment conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier (ConditionId) representing a specific condition
      entry to be added to the graveyard data.
  - name: conditions
    description: An integer value representing the conditions associated with the
      given ConditionId, likely used for validation or lookup purposes in graveyard-related
      systems.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Graveyard Condition
    code: 'ConditionId id = { CONDITION_SOURCE_ENTITY, 12345 };

      int conditions = 100;

      ConditionMgr::getInstance()->addToGraveyardData(id, conditions);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system that manages condition-based
    logic in TrinityCore. It should be called during server initialization or when
    loading graveyard data from database files. The const keyword on the method signature
    implies that while it modifies internal state, it does not alter the logical state
    of the ConditionMgr instance itself.
  warnings: Ensure that the ConditionId and conditions values are valid before calling
    this method to prevent unexpected behavior in condition evaluation logic. Improper
    usage may lead to incorrect quest or spawn handling related to graveyards.
