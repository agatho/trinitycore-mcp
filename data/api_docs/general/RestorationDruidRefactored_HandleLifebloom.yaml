  method: HandleLifebloom
  signature: bool RestorationDruidRefactored::HandleLifebloom(const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Applies the Lifebloom spell effect to a target within the specified group.
  description: The HandleLifebloom method implements the core logic for the Druid's
    Lifebloom spell, which is a healing spell that applies a periodic healing effect
    to a target. This method determines whether the spell can be cast successfully
    based on various conditions such as mana availability, target validity, and spell
    cooldowns. It handles the application of the heal-over-time effect and manages
    the associated aura state. The method operates within the context of a group-based
    targeting system where the 'group' parameter specifies which group member to apply
    the effect to. The implementation ensures proper resource management and spell
    interaction with other Druid abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The group index specifying which group member to target with Lifebloom.
      Valid values are typically 0-23 representing individual group members, or -1
      for self-cast. The method uses this parameter to determine the target for spell
      application.
  returns: Returns true if the Lifebloom spell was successfully applied to the target,
    false otherwise. Failure conditions include insufficient mana, invalid target,
    spell cooldowns, or targeting restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Lifebloom Application
    code: "if (druid->HandleLifebloom(0)) {\n    // Lifebloom successfully applied\
      \ to group member 0\n    LOG_INFO(\"server\", \"Lifebloom applied to group member\
      \ 0\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to apply Lifebloom\n    LOG_ERROR(\"server\"\
      , \"Failed to apply Lifebloom to group member 0\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Group Targeting with Error Handling
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < MAX_GROUP_MEMBERS; ++i) {\n    if (!druid->HandleLifebloom(i))\
      \ {\n        LOG_DEBUG(\"server\", \"Could not apply Lifebloom to group member\
      \ {}\", i);\n        continue;\n    }\n    LOG_INFO(\"server\", \"Lifebloom\
      \ applied to group member {}\", i);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Druid's restoration specialization and relies
    on proper aura management. The spell requires the target to be within range and
    not already affected by Lifebloom. The implementation may interact with other
    Druid healing spells and cooldown systems. Performance considerations include
    checking target validity and mana costs before applying effects.
  warnings: The method assumes valid group indices are provided; invalid indices may
    cause undefined behavior or crashes. Care should be taken when calling this method
    in rapid succession to avoid mana depletion or spell interaction issues. The method
    does not validate target health status, so it may attempt to apply Lifebloom to
    dead targets.
