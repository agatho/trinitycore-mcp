documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new BehaviorProfile instance with default settings and empty
    behavior data.
  description: The BehaviorProfile constructor initializes a new behavior profile
    object, setting up internal data structures for managing AI behaviors. This method
    prepares the profile to store and execute various AI actions, conditions, and
    decision-making logic that governs NPC or creature behavior within the TrinityCore
    environment. The constructor ensures all necessary member variables are properly
    initialized before the profile can be used in gameplay scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new BehaviorProfile instance
    code: 'BehaviorProfile profile;

      // The profile is now initialized and ready to configure behaviors'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or load external
    behavior data. It only sets up the basic structure of the BehaviorProfile object.
    Actual behavior configuration should be done through dedicated setter methods
    or configuration loading functions after construction.
