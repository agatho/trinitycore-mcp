  class: BotHealthCheck
  method: IsErrorRateExcessive
  signature: bool BotHealthCheck::IsErrorRateExcessive() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot's health check error rate has exceeded a predefined
    threshold.
  description: The IsErrorRateExcessive method evaluates the current error rate of
    the bot's health checks and compares it against a configured maximum threshold.
    This method is typically used in automated systems or AI-driven bots to monitor
    system stability and trigger alerts or corrective actions when errors occur too
    frequently. The check may involve tracking recent failures over a specified time
    window, calculating an average or instantaneous rate, and comparing that rate
    to a defined limit. This functionality is particularly relevant in game automation
    contexts where maintaining consistent performance and avoiding detection by anti-cheat
    systems is important.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the calculated error rate exceeds the maximum allowed threshold;
    otherwise returns false. A return value of true indicates that the bot's health
    checks are failing at an excessive rate, potentially signaling system instability
    or detection issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (botHealthCheck.IsErrorRateExcessive()) {\n    // Handle excessive error\
      \ rate\n    LogError(\"Bot health check error rate is too high\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Health Monitoring Loop
    code: "void MonitorBotHealth() {\n    static BotHealthCheck healthCheck;\n   \
      \ \n    // Perform health checks\n    healthCheck.PerformChecks();\n    \n \
      \   if (healthCheck.IsErrorRateExcessive()) {\n        // Trigger emergency\
      \ protocol\n        TriggerEmergencyShutdown();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses a sliding time window or rolling average to calculate
    the error rate, which means it may not immediately reflect sudden spikes in errors.
    The threshold value for what constitutes 'excessive' is typically configurable
    and may vary based on bot type, game environment, or system requirements. Implementation
    details may include thread safety considerations if used in concurrent environments.
  warnings: This method should not be called excessively in performance-critical sections
    as it may involve calculations or data lookups that could impact frame rate or
    responsiveness. The threshold for 'excessive' error rates might need to be tuned
    based on the specific bot's behavior and the game environment to avoid false positives.
