  class: SimpleResource
  method: SimpleResource
  signature: void SimpleResource::SimpleResource(uint32 max, float regen, float decay)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a SimpleResource object with maximum value, regeneration rate,
    and decay factor.
  description: The SimpleResource constructor initializes a resource management object
    that tracks a quantity with configurable maximum, regeneration, and decay behaviors.
    This class is typically used for managing player resources such as mana, energy,
    or focus in World of Warcraft-style games. The max parameter sets the upper limit
    of the resource, regen controls how quickly the resource replenishes over time,
    and decay determines how quickly the resource depletes when not being regenerated.
  parameters:
  - name: max
    description: The maximum value the resource can reach. Must be a positive integer
      representing the upper bound of the resource quantity.
  - name: regen
    description: The regeneration rate of the resource per second. Can be a positive
      floating-point number indicating how much resource is restored each second.
  - name: decay
    description: The decay factor that determines how quickly the resource decreases
      when not being regenerated. Should be a non-negative floating-point number where
      higher values mean faster depletion.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize Mana Resource
    code: 'SimpleResource mana(1000, 5.0f, 2.0f);

      // Creates a mana resource with max 1000, regen 5 per second, decay 2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialize Energy Resource
    code: 'SimpleResource energy(100, 10.0f, 0.0f);

      // Creates an energy resource with max 100, regen 10 per second, no decay'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during object initialization and should be
    invoked before any resource operations are performed. The resource values are
    stored internally as floating-point numbers to allow for precise calculations
    during regeneration and decay cycles.
  warnings: Ensure that the max parameter is greater than zero to avoid undefined
    behavior. Setting regen or decay to negative values may produce unexpected results
    depending on implementation details.
