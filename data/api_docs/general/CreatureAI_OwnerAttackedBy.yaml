  class: CreatureAI
  method: OwnerAttackedBy
  signature: void CreatureAI::OwnerAttackedBy(int * attacker)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when the creature's owner is attacked by an entity.
  description: The OwnerAttackedBy method is invoked in CreatureAI to notify the AI
    that the creature's owner has been attacked. This method typically triggers defensive
    behaviors or alerts the creature to engage in combat. It is part of the AI system's
    response mechanism to protect the creature's owner, particularly relevant for
    summoned creatures or pets. The method does not return a value but may modify
    internal AI state or trigger actions based on the attacker information provided.
  parameters:
  - name: attacker
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the identifier of the entity that
      attacked the creature's owner. This could be a unit GUID or similar identifier
      used internally by TrinityCore.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in custom AI
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void OwnerAttackedBy(int*\
      \ attacker) override {\n        // Log the event\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Creature's owner was attacked by entity %d\", *attacker);\n        // Trigger\
      \ defensive behavior\n        AttackStart(GetOwner());\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the core AI logic when an event
    occurs that affects the creature's owner. Developers should ensure that any actions
    taken in this method are thread-safe and do not cause performance bottlenecks,
    especially if the AI is handling multiple creatures simultaneously.
  warnings: The attacker parameter must be a valid pointer to an integer; otherwise,
    dereferencing it may result in undefined behavior. Ensure that the AI logic does
    not cause infinite loops or excessive CPU usage during this event handler.
