  method: _Load
  signature: bool SpellScript::_Load(Spell * spell)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads spell script data for a given spell instance
  description: The _Load method is responsible for initializing and setting up the
    spell script environment for a specific spell. It performs necessary setup operations
    such as validating the spell reference, preparing internal data structures, and
    ensuring all required resources are available before the spell execution begins.
    This method is typically called during the spell creation or initialization phase
    within the TrinityCore spell system. The method returns true if the loading process
    was successful and false if there were any issues during initialization, which
    may prevent the spell from being properly executed.
  parameters:
  - name: spell
    description: Pointer to the Spell object that this script will be associated with.
      Must not be null for successful initialization.
  returns: Returns true if the spell script was successfully loaded and initialized,
    false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates a failure in setup
    operations or invalid spell reference.

    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    bool _Load(Spell*\
      \ spell) override\n    {\n        if (!spell)\n            return false;\n \
      \       \n        // Perform initialization tasks\n        return true;\n  \
      \  }\n};"

  - title: Spell Script Loading with Validation
    code: "class HealingSpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    bool _Load(Spell*\
      \ spell) override\n    {\n        if (!spell)\n            return false;\n \
      \       \n        // Validate spell type\n        if (spell->m_spellInfo->Id\
      \ != 2061)\n            return false;\n        \n        // Initialize script-specific\
      \ data\n        m_healAmount = spell->GetSpellInfo()->Effects[0].BasePoints;\n\
      \        \n        return true;\n    }\nprivate:\n    int32 m_healAmount;\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called internally by the TrinityCore spell system during spell
    initialization. Developers should ensure that any required spell data is properly
    validated and that all necessary resources are allocated before returning true.
    The spell parameter passed to this method will be valid for the duration of the
    spell's execution.
  warnings: Do not modify the spell object directly within this method unless absolutely
    necessary, as it may affect the spell's behavior during execution. Always validate
    the spell pointer and return false if initialization fails to prevent undefined
    behavior.
