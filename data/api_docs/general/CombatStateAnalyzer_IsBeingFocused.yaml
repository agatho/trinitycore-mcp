  method: IsBeingFocused
  signature: bool CombatStateAnalyzer::IsBeingFocused() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is currently under focused attack from a player
    or NPC.
  description: The IsBeingFocused method checks if the combat state of the unit indicates
    that it is being actively targeted and attacked by another entity, typically a
    player or NPC. This method evaluates the current focus status based on the unit's
    combat state and recent combat interactions. It returns true when the unit has
    an active focus target, indicating that it is currently receiving focused attention
    in combat, such as being the primary target of an enemy. The method does not consider
    indirect or passive targeting but specifically checks for direct focus engagement.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is currently being actively focused by another
    entity in combat; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a creature is being focused
    code: "if (combatAnalyzer.IsBeingFocused()) {\n    // Unit is currently under\
      \ focused attack\n    // Perform actions related to focused combat state\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal combat state tracking of the unit and
    may be affected by combat updates, target changes, or focus resets. The implementation
    typically checks for a valid focus target in the unit's current combat context.
