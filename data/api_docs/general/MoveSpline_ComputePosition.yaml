  class: MoveSpline
  method: ComputePosition
  signature: Location MoveSpline::ComputePosition(int32 time_offset) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current world position of a spline-based movement
    at a specified time offset.
  description: The ComputePosition method calculates the spatial coordinates (X, Y,
    Z) and orientation of an object moving along a spline path at a given time offset.
    This method is crucial for determining the precise location of units during animated
    or scripted movements such as flight paths, NPC movement patterns, or player teleportations.
    The returned Location includes both positional data and heading information necessary
    for accurate world positioning. The method operates on the internal spline data
    structure and uses interpolation to determine positions between key points in
    the path.
  parameters: []
  returns: A Location object containing the computed X, Y, Z coordinates and orientation
    (heading) of the spline at the specified time offset. The Location structure typically
    includes position data and a heading angle for proper orientation in the game
    world.
  examples:
  - title: Get current position during movement
    code: 'MoveSpline* spline = player->movespline;

      Location currentPos = spline->ComputePosition(500); // Get position after 500ms

      float x = currentPos.m_position.x;

      float y = currentPos.m_position.y;

      float z = currentPos.m_position.z;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs interpolation between spline waypoints to provide smooth
    movement tracking. The time_offset parameter represents milliseconds from the
    start of the spline animation. For accurate results, ensure the spline is properly
    initialized and active before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling ComputePosition on an inactive or uninitialized spline may return
    invalid coordinates. The method assumes valid internal spline state and does not
    perform bounds checking on the time_offset parameter.
