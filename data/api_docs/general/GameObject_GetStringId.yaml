documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the string identifier associated with a game object type.
  description: The GetStringId method returns the string identifier that corresponds
    to a specific game object type. This method is used to obtain the textual representation
    of a game object's type, which can be useful for identifying and categorizing
    different types of game objects within the TrinityCore framework. The returned
    string identifier typically represents the object's type in a format suitable
    for database lookup or display purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the string identifier associated with the
    game object type, which can be used to identify the specific type of object in
    database queries or other operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int type_id = gameObject->GetStringId(0); // Returns the string ID for a
      specific game object type
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other game object methods
    to determine object properties. Implementation details may vary depending on how
    the game object's type is defined internally.
  warnings: The method may return an invalid or zero value if the game object type
    does not have a valid string identifier assigned, which could lead to incorrect
    database queries or logic errors.
