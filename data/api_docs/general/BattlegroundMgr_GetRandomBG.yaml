documentation:
  brief: Returns a random battleground ID from the available battlegrounds.
  description: The GetRandomBG method retrieves a random battleground identifier from
    the list of available battlegrounds in the game. This method is typically used
    to select a random battleground for players who are not assigned to a specific
    one, such as during queue processing or when auto-assigning players to battlegrounds.
    The method ensures that only valid and active battlegrounds are considered when
    selecting a random battleground ID. It does not perform any validation on the
    input parameter, as it takes no parameters.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique identifier (ID) of a randomly selected
    battleground. If there are no available battlegrounds, the method may return -1
    or a default invalid ID value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int bgId = sBattlegroundMgr->GetRandomBG(0);\nif (bgId >= 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Process the selected battleground\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_BG_STARTED,\
      \ bgId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the battleground queue system to
    assign players to random battlegrounds. It may be called frequently during queue
    processing, so performance considerations should be taken into account if this
    method is invoked in a high-frequency context.
