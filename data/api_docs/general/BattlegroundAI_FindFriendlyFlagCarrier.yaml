  method: FindFriendlyFlagCarrier
  signature: int * BattlegroundAI::FindFriendlyFlagCarrier(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the GUID of the player who currently carries the friendly
    flag in a battleground.
  description: The FindFriendlyFlagCarrier method is used within the BattlegroundAI
    class to locate the player who is currently carrying the friendly flag. This functionality
    is essential for battlegrounds that involve flag capture mechanics, such as Warsong
    Gulch or Arathi Basin. The method searches through all players in the battleground
    to identify which one has the flag equipped or is carrying it. It returns a pointer
    to an integer representing the GUID of the player who carries the flag. If no
    player is found carrying the flag, it may return NULL or a default value depending
    on implementation details.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID (Global Unique Identifier)
    of the player who currently carries the friendly flag in the battleground. Returns
    NULL if no such player exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int* carrierGUID = bgAI->FindFriendlyFlagCarrier();\nif (carrierGUID !=\
      \ nullptr)\n{\n    // Process the carrier\n    Player* carrier = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(*carrierGUID));\n\
      \    if (carrier)\n    {\n        // Do something with the flag carrier\n  \
      \      sLog->outString(\"Friendly flag is carried by player: %s\", carrier->GetName().c_str());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in battleground AI logic to track flag status
    and update game state accordingly. The returned GUID should be used with ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer()
    to obtain the actual Player object for further processing.
  warnings: Ensure that the battleground context is valid before calling this method,
    as it may behave unexpectedly if called outside of a proper battleground environment.
    Also, note that the returned pointer may be NULL if no player is carrying the
    flag at the time of invocation.
