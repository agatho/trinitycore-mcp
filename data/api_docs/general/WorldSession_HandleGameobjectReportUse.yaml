  signature: void WorldSession::HandleGameobjectReportUse(WorldPackets::GameObject::GameObjReportUse
    & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a game object usage report sent by the client.
  description: The HandleGameobjectReportUse method handles incoming packets from
    players reporting the use of game objects, such as interacting with quest items,
    doors, or other interactive environment elements. This method is part of the WorldSession's
    packet handling system and typically triggers server-side logic related to object
    interaction, quest progression, or game state updates. It validates the reported
    game object and ensures proper handling within the context of the player's current
    session and world state.

  - title: Basic usage in packet handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleGameobjectReportUse(WorldPackets::GameObject::GameObjReportUse&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Process the game object interaction\n    if (packet.GameObjectGUID)\n\
      \    {\n        GameObject* go = GetPlayer()->GetMap()->GetGameObject(packet.GameObjectGUID);\n\
      \        if (go)\n        {\n            // Trigger game object use logic\n\
      \            go->Use(this->GetPlayer());\n        }\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the network packet processing
    pipeline in TrinityCore. It assumes that the packet has already been validated
    and parsed by the framework before reaching this handler. The method may trigger
    additional server-side events such as quest updates or object state changes.
