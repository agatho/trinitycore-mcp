  class: DamageInfo
  method: GetOriginalDamage
  signature: uint32 DamageInfo::GetOriginalDamage() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the original damage amount before any modifiers or reductions.
  description: The GetOriginalDamage method retrieves the initial damage value that
    was calculated before any damage adjustments, such as armor reduction, resistance,
    or other mitigation effects. This value represents the raw damage output from
    an attack or spell before it is modified by game mechanics. The method is typically
    used in damage calculation systems to maintain a reference to the base damage
    for logging, debugging, or applying certain game effects that require the unmodified
    damage value.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the original damage amount before any modifications
    were applied.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Damage Calculation
    code: 'uint32 originalDamage = damageInfo->GetOriginalDamage();

      uint32 finalDamage = damageInfo->GetDamage();

      // Log or process the difference between original and final damage

      printf("Original: %u, Final: %u\n", originalDamage, finalDamage);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Original Damage for Damage Modifiers
    code: "uint32 original = damageInfo->GetOriginalDamage();\nuint32 current = damageInfo->GetDamage();\n\
      if (original > 0)\n{\n    float damageRatio = (float)current / (float)original;\n\
      \    // Apply logic based on the ratio of modified to original damage\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after the initial damage calculation has been
    performed but before any mitigation effects are applied. It is important to note
    that the returned value may not reflect the actual damage dealt to a target if
    additional modifiers or reductions occur during the damage application phase.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called when the DamageInfo object contains
    valid original damage data. Calling it before damage calculation may result in
    incorrect or zero values.
