  signature: int SpellCastTargets::GetUnitTargetGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the GUID of the unit target from a spell cast.
  description: The GetUnitTargetGUID method returns the unique identifier (GUID) of
    the unit target associated with a spell cast. This method is typically used during
    spell execution to determine which unit the spell is targeting. The returned value
    represents the target's GUID, which can be used to retrieve the actual unit object
    from the game world. The method assumes that a valid unit target exists in the
    spell cast targets; otherwise, it may return an invalid or default GUID value.
    This functionality is essential for spell mechanics that require targeting specific
    units, such as damage spells, healing spells, or buff/debuff applications.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the unit target. If no valid unit target
    exists, the method may return zero or a default invalid GUID value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell logic
    code: "void MySpell::EffectExecute()\n{\n    if (SpellCastTargets* targets = GetSpellCastTargets())\n\
      \    {\n        int targetGUID = targets->GetUnitTargetGUID();\n        if (targetGUID\
      \ != 0)\n        {\n            Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*m_caster,\
      \ targetGUID);\n            // Proceed with spell effect on target\n       \
      \ }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SpellCastTargets class which manages all targets
    for a spell cast. The returned GUID should be validated before use to ensure it
    corresponds to an existing unit in the game world. Performance-wise, this method
    performs a simple lookup and should not introduce significant overhead.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell cast targets contain a valid unit target before
    calling this method. Calling it on a spell with no unit target may result in an
    invalid GUID being returned, which could lead to null pointer dereferences if
    not properly checked.
