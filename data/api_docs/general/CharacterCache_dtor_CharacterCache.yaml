  method: ~CharacterCache
  signature: void CharacterCache::~CharacterCache()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the CharacterCache instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~CharacterCache destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    and resources allocated by the CharacterCache class. This method is automatically
    invoked when a CharacterCache object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    It ensures proper deallocation of cached character data, preventing memory leaks
    within the TrinityCore server environment. The destructor typically handles cleanup
    of internal data structures such as maps, lists, or other containers that store
    character-related information.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of CharacterCache instance
    code: 'CharacterCache* cache = new CharacterCache();

      // ... use the cache ...

      delete cache; // Destructor is called here automatically'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic destruction via stack allocation
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    CharacterCache cache;\n    // ... use cache\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when function exits\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should be called only on properly constructed CharacterCache
    objects. It's important to ensure that no other threads are accessing the cache
    during destruction, as this could lead to undefined behavior. The destructor is
    typically not called directly by user code but rather through normal C++ object
    lifetime management.
  warnings: Do not call the destructor manually on stack-allocated objects; let C++
    handle automatic destruction. Avoid calling destructors on already destroyed objects
    or on objects that were not properly constructed.
