  class: ScriptMgr
  method: CreateBattlefield
  signature: Battlefield * ScriptMgr::CreateBattlefield(uint32 scriptId, Map * map)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a Battlefield instance for the specified script ID and
    map.
  description: The CreateBattlefield method is responsible for instantiating a Battlefield
    object based on a given script identifier and map context. This method serves
    as a factory function within the TrinityCore scripting system, allowing dynamic
    creation of battlefield instances that manage PvP zones with specific rules and
    behaviors. The method retrieves the appropriate battlefield template from the
    script registry and constructs a new instance bound to the provided map. It is
    typically invoked during map loading or when a player enters a battlefield area,
    ensuring that the correct battlefield logic is initialized for the given environment.
  parameters:
  - name: scriptId
    description: Unique identifier for the battlefield script template to be instantiated.
      This ID corresponds to registered battlefield scripts in the script registry.
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object where the battlefield will be created and
      managed. The map context determines the battlefield's location and environment.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the newly created Battlefield instance if successful,
    or nullptr if the script ID is invalid or the creation fails.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Battlefield Creation
    code: "Battlefield* bf = ScriptMgr::CreateBattlefield(1234, sMapMgr->FindMap(0,\
      \ 0));\nif (bf)\n{\n    // Use the battlefield instance\n    bf->Initialize();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Battlefield Creation with Error Handling
    code: "uint32 scriptId = 5678;\nMap* map = sMapMgr->FindMap(1, 0);\nBattlefield*\
      \ bf = ScriptMgr::CreateBattlefield(scriptId, map);\nif (!bf)\n{\n    sLog->outError(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL,\
      \ \"Failed to create battlefield with script ID %u on map %u\", scriptId, map\
      \ ? map->GetId() : 0);\n    return;\n}\n// Proceed with battlefield initialization\n\
      bf->Initialize();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the script registry being properly populated with valid
    battlefield templates. The returned Battlefield instance must be managed carefully
    to prevent memory leaks. The method does not perform any automatic registration
    of the created battlefield with the map's battlefield system.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-null return value guarantees a fully functional
    battlefield instance. Additional initialization steps may be required after calling
    this method. Passing an invalid scriptId or null map pointer will result in a
    nullptr return, which should always be checked for before use.
