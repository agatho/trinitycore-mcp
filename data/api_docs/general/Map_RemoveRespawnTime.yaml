  method: RemoveRespawnTime
  signature: void Map::RemoveRespawnTime(SpawnObjectType type, int spawnId, int dbTrans,
    bool alwaysDeleteFromDB)
documentation:
  brief: Removes respawn time for a specific spawn object from the map's respawn system.
  description: The RemoveRespawnTime method removes the respawn timer associated with
    a given spawn object of a specified type and ID from the map's internal respawn
    tracking system. This method is typically invoked when an object (such as a creature
    or game object) has been successfully spawned and should no longer be subject
    to automatic respawn behavior. The method may optionally remove the entry from
    the database depending on the 'alwaysDeleteFromDB' flag. It operates within the
    context of TrinityCore's map management system, which handles dynamic spawn and
    despawn logic for world entities.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type of the spawn object (e.g., Creature or GameObject) as defined
      by SpawnObjectType enum. Determines how the object is handled during respawn
      operations.
  - name: spawnId
    description: The unique identifier for the specific spawn instance within the
      map. This ID corresponds to a particular entry in the spawn system and identifies
      which object's respawn time should be removed.
  - name: dbTrans
    description: Database transaction handle used for managing database operations
      related to this removal. Allows for transactional consistency when updating
      or removing data from the database.
  - name: alwaysDeleteFromDB
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the respawn entry should be removed
      from the database regardless of other conditions. If true, the method ensures
      database cleanup even if the object is still tracked in memory.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove respawn time for a creature
    code: 'Map* map = ...;

      map->RemoveRespawnTime(SPAWN_TYPE_CREATURE, 12345, 0, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove respawn time with database transaction
    code: 'Map* map = ...;

      DatabaseTransaction trans = Database.GetTransaction();

      map->RemoveRespawnTime(SPAWN_TYPE_GAMEOBJECT, 67890, trans, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core respawn management logic in TrinityCore.
    It assumes that the spawn object has already been properly initialized and registered
    with the map's spawn system. The method does not perform any validation on the
    input parameters beyond basic type checking, so incorrect values may lead to undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the spawn object
    can result in inconsistent state or crashes. Always ensure that the spawn ID corresponds
    to an existing tracked object before calling this function. Incorrect use of the
    'alwaysDeleteFromDB' flag may cause data loss or inconsistencies in the database.
