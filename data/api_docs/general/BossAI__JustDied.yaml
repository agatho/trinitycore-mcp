  brief: Handles the death event of a boss creature in the game world
  description: The _JustDied method is a virtual callback function invoked when a
    BossAI-controlled creature dies. This method serves as the primary hook for implementing
    boss-specific death behaviors, such as spawning loot, triggering quest events,
    or initiating post-combat sequences. It is automatically called by the TrinityCore
    AI system upon creature death and should be overridden in derived boss classes
    to define custom death logic. The method executes within the context of the creature's
    AI thread and typically runs after all standard death processing has completed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

    code: "class BossGargamel : public BossAI\n{\npublic:\n    BossGargamel(Creature*\
      \ creature) : BossAI(creature) {}\n\n    void JustDied() override\n    {\n \
      \       // Spawn loot\n        me->SummonGameObject(GO_GARGAMEL_CHEST, 100.0f,\
      \ 100.0f, 100.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1);\n        \n        // Send\
      \ message to players\n        Talk(SAY_DEATH);\n        \n        // Complete\
      \ quest if needed\n        if (instance)\n            instance->SetData(DATA_BOSS_GARGAMEL_DEFEATED,\
      \ 1);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called after the creature's health reaches zero and all death-related
    AI processing has finished. It should not be used to perform actions that require
    immediate execution before the creature despawns. The method runs in the same
    thread as the AI system, so long-running operations may block other AI updates.
  warnings: Do not call the base class _JustDied() implementation unless explicitly
    required, as this can lead to unexpected behavior. Avoid performing database operations
    or complex calculations within this method to prevent performance issues.
