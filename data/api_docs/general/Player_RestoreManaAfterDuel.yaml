  brief: Restores player's mana after a duel ends
  description: This method restores the player's mana to its full amount after a duel
    has concluded. It is typically called automatically by the game engine when a
    duel ends, ensuring that players can continue playing without having their mana
    depleted during duels. The method does not take any parameters and performs no
    action if the player is not in a duel state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->RestoreManaAfterDuel();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal duel management system and should not
    be called directly by developers unless specifically required. The method ensures
    that mana is restored to full value, which may differ from the default behavior
    during a duel.
