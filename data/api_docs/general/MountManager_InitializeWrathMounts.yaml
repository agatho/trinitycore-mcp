  brief: Initializes Wrath of the Lich King expansion mounts for the MountManager
  description: The InitializeWrathMounts method sets up and registers all mount entries
    specific to the Wrath of the Lich King expansion within the MountManager system.
    This method is responsible for loading mount data, including their display IDs,
    spell IDs, and unlock requirements, ensuring that players can access and use Wrath-era
    mounts after the expansion's content is enabled. The method typically runs during
    server initialization or when the expansion content is activated, preparing the
    mount database with appropriate entries for the 4.0.1 expansion.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'MountManager* mountMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetMountManager();

      mountMgr->InitializeWrathMounts();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server startup or when expansion
    content is enabled. It modifies internal mount databases and may affect performance
    if called multiple times. The method assumes that Wrath of the Lich King expansion
    data is properly loaded in the game database.
  warnings: Calling this method after mounts have already been initialized may cause
    duplicate entries or undefined behavior. Ensure that expansion content is fully
    loaded before invoking this method.
