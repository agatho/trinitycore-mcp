  class: DelayedUnitRelocation
  method: DelayedUnitRelocation
  signature: void DelayedUnitRelocation::DelayedUnitRelocation(int & c, int & pair,
    int & map, float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a delayed unit relocation with specified parameters for map and
    radius.
  description: The DelayedUnitRelocation method is used to set up a delayed relocation
    process for a unit within the TrinityCore framework. It takes three integer references
    (c, pair, map) and a float radius parameter to configure the relocation context.
    This method likely prepares internal state or scheduling for a future unit movement
    operation, possibly related to pathfinding or zone updates. The parameters are
    typically used to define the relocation target coordinates or identifiers, while
    the radius may control the scope of the relocation effect. This method is part
    of the core game loop mechanics and is generally invoked during server processing
    when units need to be moved with a delay for performance or synchronization reasons.
  parameters:
  - name: c
    description: Reference to an integer representing a counter or identifier used
      in the relocation logic. Value may indicate iteration count, target index, or
      internal state.
  - name: pair
    description: Reference to an integer that likely represents a pairing identifier
      or coordinate pair index for the relocation operation.
  - name: map
    description: Reference to an integer specifying the map identifier where the unit
      will be relocated. Used to determine the target zone or instance.
  - name: radius
    description: Float value defining the radius of influence for the relocation.
      May control how far surrounding units are affected or how the relocation is
      calculated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int counter = 0;

      int pairId = 5;

      int mapId = 123;

      float relocationRadius = 10.0f;

      DelayedUnitRelocation(counter, pairId, mapId, relocationRadius);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system for managing delayed actions
    in the game world. It may be used in conjunction with other methods to schedule
    unit movements or updates. The parameters are passed by reference, so modifications
    to them inside the function will affect the original variables.
  warnings: Care must be taken when passing references to this method as changes made
    inside the function will modify the original values. Ensure that the input values
    for c, pair, and map are valid before calling to avoid unexpected behavior or
    errors in the relocation logic.
