documentation:
  brief: Updates the instance coordination state based on the elapsed time delta.
  description: The Update method in the InstanceCoordination class is responsible
    for processing and maintaining the internal state of instance coordination logic.
    It typically handles timed events, cooldowns, or synchronization tasks within
    an instance. The method accepts a time delta (diff) parameter that represents
    the milliseconds elapsed since the last update call, allowing it to perform time-based
    operations accurately. This method is commonly invoked from the game loop or update
    system to ensure that instance-specific coordination logic remains synchronized
    with the passage of time.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = sWorld->GetLastDiff();\n    instanceCoordination->Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly by the game update loop to maintain
    proper coordination state. The 'diff' parameter is crucial for accurate timing
    and should reflect real elapsed time in milliseconds.
