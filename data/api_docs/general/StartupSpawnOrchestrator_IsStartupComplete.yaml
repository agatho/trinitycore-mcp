  method: IsStartupComplete
  signature: bool StartupSpawnOrchestrator::IsStartupComplete() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the server's initial startup spawn process has completed.
  description: The IsStartupComplete method checks if the server has finished its
    initial object spawning and initialization sequence. This is typically used during
    server startup to ensure that all necessary game entities (creatures, game objects,
    etc.) have been properly spawned before allowing player connections or other gameplay
    operations. The method returns true once the startup spawn orchestrator has completed
    its task, indicating that the world is ready for normal operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the startup spawn process has completed successfully; otherwise,
    returns false if the process is still in progress or has not yet begun.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Startup Completion Before Allowing Player Login
    code: "if (StartupSpawnOrchestrator::instance().IsStartupComplete()) {\n    //\
      \ Allow player login\n    SendLoginResponse(true);\n} else {\n    // Queue player\
      \ or delay login\n    SendLoginResponse(false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization and may be used
    in conjunction with other startup synchronization mechanisms. It's important to
    note that the completion of this process does not necessarily mean all content
    is fully loaded, but rather that the initial spawn sequence has been processed.
