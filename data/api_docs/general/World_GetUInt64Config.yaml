  signature: uint64 World::GetUInt64Config(WorldInt64Configs index) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a 64-bit unsigned integer configuration value from the world configuration
    based on the provided index.
  description: The GetUInt64Config method is used to retrieve specific 64-bit unsigned
    integer configuration values stored within the World object. These configurations
    are typically defined in the WorldInt64Configs enumeration and represent various
    system-wide settings or thresholds that control gameplay behavior, server performance
    parameters, or other global game mechanics. The method performs a lookup using
    the provided index to fetch the corresponding configuration value from an internal
    configuration storage mechanism. This allows for dynamic adjustment of game settings
    without requiring code recompilation. The returned value is guaranteed to be valid
    for the specified configuration index and should not be used with invalid indices.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint64 value representing the requested configuration setting.
    The actual meaning of this value depends on the specific WorldInt64Configs enumeration
    value passed as the index parameter. Common uses include server limits, time-based
    thresholds, or global identifiers.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve maximum player count allowed on the server
    code: uint64 maxPlayers = sWorld->GetUInt64Config(WORLD_MAX_PLAYERS);
    language: cpp
  - title: Get the global timestamp for server startup
    code: uint64 serverStartTime = sWorld->GetUInt64Config(WORLD_START_TIME);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. The configuration
    values are typically initialized during server startup and may be updated dynamically
    through in-game commands or configuration files. It's important to ensure that
    the provided index is valid, as invalid indices could lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect configuration values.
  warnings: Do not use arbitrary integer values for the index parameter; always use
    valid WorldInt64Configs enumeration values. Using an invalid index may result
    in accessing uninitialized memory or returning incorrect data.
