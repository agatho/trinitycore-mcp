  signature: bool GroupCoordinator::NeedItem(uint32 itemId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a group needs a specific item based on loot distribution settings.
  description: The NeedItem method determines whether a group coordinator considers
    a specific item to be needed by the group. This typically occurs during loot distribution
    when items are marked as 'need' for specific players or roles within the group.
    The method evaluates the current group's loot settings, player needs, and item
    requirements to make this determination. It is commonly used in conjunction with
    loot distribution systems to manage how items are allocated among group members.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group coordinator determines that the specified item
    is needed by the group, false otherwise. The result depends on the group's current
    loot rules and individual player needs.
  examples:
  - title: Check if group needs a specific item
    code: "if (groupCoordinator->NeedItem(12345)) {\n    // Item is needed by the\
      \ group\n    // Proceed with need-based distribution logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal loot tracking systems and may
    be called during loot roll events. It's important to understand that 'need' status
    can change dynamically based on player roles, gear levels, or group composition.
