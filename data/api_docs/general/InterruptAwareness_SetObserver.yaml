  method: SetObserver
  signature: void InterruptAwareness::SetObserver(Player * observer)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player observer for interrupt awareness tracking
  description: The SetObserver method assigns a Player object as the observer for
    interrupt awareness events. This functionality is typically used in combat systems
    to track which player is currently observing or monitoring interrupt-related actions.
    The observer is stored internally and may be used to determine valid targets for
    interrupt mechanics, such as when a player attempts to interrupt another's spell
    casting. This method does not validate whether the provided player object is valid
    or active, so callers should ensure proper player state before invoking this method.
  parameters:
  - name: observer
    description: Pointer to the Player object that will serve as the interrupt observer.
      Must be a valid Player instance or nullptr.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SetObserver
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume this is a valid player

      InterruptAwareness awareness;

      awareness.SetObserver(player);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting observer to nullptr
    code: 'InterruptAwareness awareness;

      awareness.SetObserver(nullptr); // Clears the current observer'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger combat or interrupt system. The observer
    may be used in conjunction with other methods like GetObserver() or NotifyInterrupt().
    Ensure that the Player pointer remains valid for the duration of its use as an
    observer.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or deleted Player pointer to this method can lead to
    undefined behavior. Always verify player validity before calling SetObserver,
    especially if the player might be logging out or being destroyed.
