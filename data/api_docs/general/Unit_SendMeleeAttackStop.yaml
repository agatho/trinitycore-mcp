documentation:
  brief: Stops melee attack against a target unit
  description: This method sends a packet to the client to stop melee attacking a
    specific unit. It is used to interrupt the current melee attack when a unit stops
    attacking another unit, typically in response to a change in combat state or when
    the attacker's target becomes invalid. The method ensures that the attacking unit
    stops its melee attack and updates the client's UI accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: victim
    description: The target unit that the attacker is stopping their melee attack
      against. This parameter must be a valid Unit pointer, typically representing
      an enemy or target unit.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetVictim();

      Unit::SendMeleeAttackStop(target);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = GetVictim();\nif (target && target->IsInWorld())\n{\n  \
      \  Unit::SendMeleeAttackStop(target);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid target\
      \ case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat state changes, such as when
    a unit becomes invalid or when the attacker's target is removed from combat. It
    should be used carefully to avoid unnecessary packet sending and performance issues.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause client-side UI glitches or incorrect
    combat states. Ensure that the victim parameter is valid before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer may lead to undefined behavior.
