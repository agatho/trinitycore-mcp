  method: GetProfile
  signature: std::shared_ptr<PerformanceProfile> PerformanceOptimizer::GetProfile(uint32_t
    botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the performance profile associated with a specific bot GUID.
  description: The GetProfile method retrieves a shared pointer to a PerformanceProfile
    object that corresponds to the given bot GUID. This method is used in the context
    of performance optimization for AI-controlled bots within the TrinityCore framework,
    allowing access to detailed performance metrics and configurations for individual
    bots. The returned profile may contain data such as processing times, resource
    usage, or optimization settings specific to that bot instance. This method does
    not modify any internal state and is typically called during runtime to analyze
    or adjust bot behavior based on performance characteristics.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which to retrieve the
      performance profile. Must be a valid, non-zero GUID representing an existing
      bot in the system.
  returns: A std::shared_ptr<PerformanceProfile> pointing to the performance profile
    data for the specified bot. Returns nullptr if no profile exists for the given
    bot GUID or if the GUID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = 12345;\nstd::shared_ptr<PerformanceProfile> profile\
      \ = optimizer->GetProfile(botGuid);\nif (profile)\n{\n    // Use the profile\
      \ data\n    std::cout << \"Profile retrieved successfully\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Profile Data
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = 12345;\nstd::shared_ptr<PerformanceProfile> profile\
      \ = optimizer->GetProfile(botGuid);\nif (profile)\n{\n    // Example: Accessing\
      \ a hypothetical metric\n    float cpuUsage = profile->GetCpuUsage();\n    uint32_t\
      \ memoryUsed = profile->GetMemoryUsed();\n    // Perform actions based on these\
      \ values\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from multiple threads concurrently.
    The returned PerformanceProfile object should not be modified directly; instead,
    use appropriate setter methods or the optimizer's interface to update profile
    data. If no performance profile exists for a given bot GUID, the method returns
    a null pointer rather than throwing an exception.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID will return
    a nullptr, which must be checked before dereferencing the returned pointer. Failure
    to check for null may lead to segmentation faults or undefined behavior. Also,
    ensure that the PerformanceProfile object is not accessed after the bot has been
    destroyed, as this could result in dangling pointers.
