  class: LFGBotSelector
  method: CalculateBotPriority
  signature: uint32 LFGBotSelector::CalculateBotPriority(Player * bot, uint8 desiredRole,
    uint8 desiredLevel)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a priority value for a bot based on desired role and
    level.
  description: The CalculateBotPriority method determines a numerical priority score
    for a given bot player, taking into account the desired role and level requirements.
    This priority value is typically used by the LFG (Looking For Group) system to
    select appropriate bots for forming groups. The method evaluates how well the
    bot matches the specified criteria and assigns it a relative priority, where higher
    values indicate better suitability. The calculation may consider factors such
    as the bot's actual role, level, and compatibility with the desired group composition.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which the priority
      is being calculated
  - name: desiredRole
    description: The role that the LFG system desires for the group (e.g., tank, healer,
      damage dealer)
  - name: desiredLevel
    description: The desired level of the bot to match against the actual bot's level
  returns: A uint32 value representing the calculated priority. Higher values indicate
    better matching of the desired role and level criteria.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: uint32 priority = selector->CalculateBotPriority(botPlayer, ROLE_TANK, 80);
    language: cpp
  - title: Finding Best Bot for Healing Role
    code: "uint32 bestPriority = 0;\nPlayer* bestBot = nullptr;\nfor (auto& bot :\
      \ botList)\n{\n    uint32 priority = selector->CalculateBotPriority(bot, ROLE_HEALER,\
      \ 70);\n    if (priority > bestPriority)\n    {\n        bestPriority = priority;\n\
      \        bestBot = bot;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the LFG system to sort and select
    bots for group formation. The exact algorithm for calculating priority may vary
    based on implementation details, but it generally weights role matching more heavily
    than level matching. Performance-wise, this method should be efficient as it only
    operates on player data already available in memory.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter is not null before calling this method to
    avoid undefined behavior. The desiredRole and desiredLevel parameters should be
    validated against valid game constants or enums to prevent unexpected results.
