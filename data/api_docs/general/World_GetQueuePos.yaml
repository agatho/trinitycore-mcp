  class: World
  method: GetQueuePos
  signature: int32 World::GetQueuePos(WorldSession * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the position of a player's session in the login queue
  description: The GetQueuePos method determines and returns the current position
    of a given WorldSession within the server's login queue. This position is typically
    used to inform players about their estimated wait time before they can log into
    the game. The method takes a pointer to a WorldSession object as input and returns
    an integer representing the queue position, where 0 indicates the player is at
    the front of the queue and higher values indicate further back in the queue. This
    functionality is essential for managing server load and providing user feedback
    during high-traffic periods.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession object for which to retrieve the queue
      position
  returns: An int32 value representing the player's position in the login queue. A
    return value of 0 means the player is at the front of the queue and ready to log
    in. Higher positive values indicate how many players are ahead of this session
    in the queue. Negative values may indicate an error or that the session is not
    currently queued.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Queue Position Retrieval
    code: "WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();\nint32 queuePos = sWorld->GetQueuePos(session);\n\
      if (queuePos >= 0)\n{\n    ChatHandler(session->GetPlayer()->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Your position in the queue is: %d\", queuePos);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the login process to provide feedback
    to users about their expected wait time. The implementation may vary depending
    on how the server handles concurrent connections and authentication. It's important
    to note that this method only applies to the initial login queue, not to in-game
    queues or other types of waiting systems.
  warnings: The returned queue position is only valid at the moment of the call and
    may change rapidly as other players log in or out. Additionally, if a player disconnects
    while in the queue, the position value may become invalid or misleading.
