documentation:
  brief: Destroys an InstanceLock object and releases associated resources.
  description: The InstanceLock destructor is called when an InstanceLock object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper cleanup of any
    resources held by the instance lock, such as database connections, memory allocations,
    or internal tracking structures. In the context of TrinityCore's instance management
    system, this typically occurs when a player's instance lock is released after
    they leave an instance or when the lock times out. The destructor performs necessary
    cleanup operations to prevent resource leaks and maintain system stability.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of InstanceLock
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    InstanceLock lock; // InstanceLock is created\n\
      \    // ... perform operations with the lock ...\n} // InstanceLock destructor\
      \ called automatically here"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of InstanceLock
    code: 'InstanceLock* lock = new InstanceLock();

      // ... use the lock ...

      delete lock; // Destructor called here'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when an object
    goes out of scope or is deleted. Developers should not manually call destructors
    unless implementing custom memory management patterns. In TrinityCore, instance
    locks are typically managed through smart pointers or automatic scope management
    to ensure proper cleanup.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke destructors unless you're implementing custom memory
    management. The destructor handles critical cleanup operations that prevent resource
    leaks. Improper handling of instance locks can lead to database connection exhaustion
    or stale lock states in the server.
