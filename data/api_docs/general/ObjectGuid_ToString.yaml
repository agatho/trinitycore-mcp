documentation:
  brief: Converts the ObjectGuid instance into a human-readable string representation.
  description: The ToString method provides a convenient way to obtain a string representation
    of an ObjectGuid object. This is particularly useful for debugging, logging, or
    displaying GUIDs in user interfaces. The returned string typically follows a specific
    format that uniquely identifies the object within the game world. In TrinityCore,
    ObjectGuids are used extensively to track entities such as players, creatures,
    game objects, and items throughout the server's memory and database systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the formatted GUID representation. The format
    usually consists of a prefix indicating the type of object followed by a unique
    numeric identifier, e.g., 'Player-123456' or 'Creature-789012'.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Logging
    code: 'ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345);

      std::string guidStr = guid.ToString();

      TC_LOG_INFO("server", "Player GUID: %s", guidStr.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Debug Output
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("entities", "Processing creature with GUID: %s", creature->GetGUID().ToString().c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: The implementation internally uses a formatting function that respects the
    high and low bits of the ObjectGuid to determine its type and generate appropriate
    string prefixes. The method is non-blocking and thread-safe for read operations.
  warnings: Be aware that converting large numbers of GUIDs to strings can impact
    performance in high-frequency logging scenarios. Consider caching the string representation
    if it's used repeatedly.
