  signature: void LootDistribution::ProcessActiveLootRolls()
documentation:
  brief: Processes active loot rolls for items in the current loot distribution.
  description: The ProcessActiveLootRolls method handles the evaluation and resolution
    of active loot rolls within a loot distribution context. It iterates through all
    pending loot roll requests, determines the outcome based on roll values and player
    participation, and updates the loot state accordingly. This method is typically
    invoked during the loot distribution phase when players have made their individual
    rolls for items. The function ensures that loot is properly awarded to the winning
    player(s) according to the configured loot rules (e.g., need before greed, round-robin,
    etc.). It also manages cleanup of rolled items and updates relevant game state
    information.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Loot Processing
    code: 'LootDistribution lootDist;

      lootDist.ProcessActiveLootRolls();

      // This call processes all pending loot rolls for the current distribution.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the core loot system and should
    not typically be invoked directly by external code. It assumes that all relevant
    players have already made their rolls and that the loot distribution state is
    properly initialized. Performance considerations include iterating through potentially
    many active rolls, so it's optimized for minimal overhead.
  warnings: Calling this method while loot rolls are still in progress or without
    proper initialization may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect loot assignment.
    Ensure that all players have completed their rolls before invoking this function.
