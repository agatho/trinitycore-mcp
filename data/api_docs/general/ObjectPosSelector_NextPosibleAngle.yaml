  class: ObjectPosSelector
  method: NextPosibleAngle
  signature: bool ObjectPosSelector::NextPosibleAngle(float & angle)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the next possible angle for object positioning within
    a selector.
  description: The NextPosibleAngle method advances the internal state of the ObjectPosSelector
    to determine the next valid angular position. This is typically used in scenarios
    where objects need to be placed around a central point with specific angular constraints,
    such as during creature spawning or area-of-effect spell placement. The method
    updates the provided angle reference with the calculated value and returns true
    if a valid angle was found, false otherwise. It's commonly employed in pathfinding
    and positioning logic for game entities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a valid next possible angle was calculated and stored in
    the angle parameter; returns false if no more valid angles are available or if
    the selector has reached its limit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "ObjectPosSelector selector;\nfloat angle;\nif (selector.NextPosibleAngle(angle))\
      \ {\n    // Use the calculated angle for positioning\n    printf(\"Next angle:\
      \ %f\\n\", angle);\n} else {\n    // No more valid angles available\n    printf(\"\
      No more possible angles\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the ObjectPosSelector, so consecutive
    calls will yield different angles. The selector maintains an internal counter
    or iterator that advances with each call to this function.
