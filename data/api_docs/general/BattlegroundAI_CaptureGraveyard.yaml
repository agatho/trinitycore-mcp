  brief: Captures a graveyard for the battleground team
  description: The CaptureGraveyard method attempts to capture a graveyard object
    within the battleground environment. This method is typically used during battleground
    gameplay to control strategic locations and provide benefits to the capturing
    team. The method likely updates the graveyard's ownership state and may trigger
    related events or rewards. It returns true if the capture was successful, false
    otherwise. The implementation details depend on the specific battleground type
    and its rules for graveyard control.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the graveyard was successfully captured by the team, false
    if the capture failed or was not possible due to game state constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic graveyard capture usage
    code: "if (bgAI->CaptureGraveyard(nullptr)) {\n    // Handle successful capture\n\
      \    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_BG_CAPTURED_GRAVEYARD);\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ failed capture\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_BG_FAILED_CAPTURE_GRAVEYARD);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the battleground AI system and may be called
    internally by the battleground framework. The actual implementation details depend
    on the battleground type (e.g., Warsong Gulch, Arathi Basin) and its specific
    control mechanics.
