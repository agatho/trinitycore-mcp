  class: DispelCoordinator
  method: GetPurgeTarget
  signature: PurgeTarget DispelCoordinator::GetPurgeTarget() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the target object designated for purging within the dispel coordinator.
  description: The GetPurgeTarget method returns the PurgeTarget object that represents
    the current target designated for purging operations within the DispelCoordinator.
    This target is typically a GameObject or Unit that has been marked for removal
    or cleansing by a dispel effect. The method provides access to the target's properties
    and state, allowing other systems to determine whether the purge should proceed
    or if any conditions prevent it. The returned PurgeTarget object may contain information
    about the target's GUID, type, and current status in relation to ongoing dispel
    mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A PurgeTarget object representing the current target designated for purging.
    This object contains identifying information and state data about the target that
    can be used by the dispel system to determine appropriate actions during the purge
    process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GetPurgeTarget
    code: "PurgeTarget target = dispelCoordinator.GetPurgeTarget();\nif (target.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with purge logic\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"system\", \"Purging target\
      \ with GUID: {}\", target.GetGUID());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the execution of dispel effects to
    determine which object should be purged. The returned PurgeTarget may be null
    or invalid if no purge target has been set, so callers should always verify validity
    before using the result.
  warnings: The PurgeTarget returned by this method should not be modified directly
    as it is managed internally by the DispelCoordinator. Attempting to modify its
    state externally could lead to inconsistent dispel behavior and unexpected game
    mechanics.
