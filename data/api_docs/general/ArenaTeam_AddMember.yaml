documentation:
  brief: Adds a player to the arena team
  description: The AddMember method attempts to add a player to the arena team by
    their GUID. This method is typically used during arena team creation or when inviting
    players to join an existing team. The method checks if the player is eligible
    to join the team based on various criteria such as existing team membership, level
    requirements, and arena team size limits. It returns true upon successful addition,
    or false if the operation fails due to constraints or invalid state.
  parameters:
  - name: PlayerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to be added to the arena
      team. This must be a valid player GUID that exists in the database.
  returns: Returns true if the player was successfully added to the arena team, or
    false if the addition failed due to constraints such as team size limits, existing
    membership, or invalid player GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Adding a player to an arena team
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\nif (team)\n\
      {\n    bool result = team->AddMember(56789);\n    if (result)\n        ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Player added to arena team.\");\n    else\n        ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Failed to add player to arena team.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the player GUID is valid and that the arena team has
    not reached its maximum capacity. The actual addition may involve database updates
    and synchronization with the player's current team status.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the PlayerGuid or team
    state may result in undefined behavior or failed additions. Ensure that the player
    is not already a member of another arena team before calling this method.
