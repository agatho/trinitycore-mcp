  signature: void Channel::UnsetModerator(const Player * player, const std::string
    & newname)
documentation:
  brief: Removes moderator status from a specified player in the channel.
  description: The UnsetModerator method revokes moderator privileges from a given
    player within a channel. This action removes the player from the list of moderators
    and updates the channel's internal state accordingly. The method typically requires
    the caller to have sufficient permissions to modify channel membership, such as
    being a channel owner or having administrative rights. It ensures that the specified
    player no longer has elevated permissions within the channel context.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose moderator status is to be removed.
      Must not be null and must represent an active player in the channel.
  - name: newname
    description: String representing the name of the new moderator to be assigned.
      This parameter may be used for transitioning moderation roles or logging purposes,
      though its exact usage depends on internal implementation details.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove Moderator Status
    code: "Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"General\", player);\nif (channel)\n\
      {\n    Player* targetPlayer = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayerByName(\"TargetUser\"\
      );\n    if (targetPlayer)\n    {\n        channel->UnsetModerator(targetPlayer,\
      \ \"NewModeratorName\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal channel data structures and may broadcast
    a message to other channel members about the change in moderator status. It is
    expected to be called only when the calling player has sufficient privileges to
    modify channel membership.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or null player pointer can lead to
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the player exists and is currently a member of
    the channel before invoking this function.
