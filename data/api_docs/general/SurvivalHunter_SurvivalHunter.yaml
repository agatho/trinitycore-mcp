  brief: Initializes a Survival Hunter AI bot with the specified player character.
  description: The SurvivalHunter constructor initializes a hunter AI bot specifically
    designed for survival gameplay mechanics. This method sets up the bot's behavior
    patterns, ability usage, and tactical decisions based on survival-focused strategies.
    It configures the bot to prioritize resource management, efficient targeting,
    and optimal use of survival skills while maintaining combat effectiveness. The
    initialization process includes setting up default behaviors, assigning appropriate
    AI decision-making parameters, and preparing the bot for engagement in various
    game scenarios.

      // Bot is now initialized with survival-focused AI behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The player
    parameter must be a valid, initialized Player object before calling this constructor.
    The method does not perform any validation on the input player object and assumes
    it is properly configured.
  warnings: Calling this constructor with a null or improperly initialized player
    pointer will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure the player
    object has been fully constructed and configured before passing it to this constructor.
