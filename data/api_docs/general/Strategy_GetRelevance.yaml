  method: GetRelevance
  signature: float Strategy::GetRelevance(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the relevance score of a strategy for a given bot AI
    context.
  description: The GetRelevance method calculates and returns a float value representing
    how relevant or applicable the current strategy is to the provided BotAI instance.
    This score is typically used by the AI system to prioritize which strategies should
    be executed first, with higher scores indicating greater relevance. The method
    takes into account various factors such as the bot's current state, available
    resources, target conditions, and contextual game data. It serves as a core component
    in the decision-making process of the TrinityCore AI framework, allowing dynamic
    strategy selection based on real-time conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the relevance score of the strategy. Higher
    values indicate greater relevance to the current bot AI context. Values typically
    range from 0.0 (not relevant) to 1.0 (highly relevant), though implementations
    may vary.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in strategy evaluation
    code: "float relevance = myStrategy->GetRelevance(botAI);\nif (relevance > 0.7f)\
      \ {\n    // Execute high-relevance strategy\n    botAI->ExecuteStrategy(myStrategy);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using relevance for strategy prioritization
    code: "std::vector<std::pair<float, Strategy*>> strategiesWithRelevance;\nfor\
      \ (auto& strategy : allStrategies) {\n    float relevance = strategy->GetRelevance(botAI);\n\
      \    strategiesWithRelevance.emplace_back(relevance, strategy);\n}\nstd::sort(strategiesWithRelevance.begin(),\
      \ strategiesWithRelevance.end(),\n          [](const auto& a, const auto& b)\
      \ { return a.first > b.first; });"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during AI decision cycles, so
    implementations should be optimized for performance. The relevance score may be
    cached or recomputed depending on the strategy implementation and how often the
    context changes.
  warnings: The returned relevance value should not be assumed to be strictly between
    0.0 and 1.0; some strategies may return values outside this range based on their
    internal logic. Always validate or clamp results if strict bounds are required.
