  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: CoordinateResourceRecovery
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::CoordinateResourceRecovery(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates resource recovery for a group within an instance.
  description: The CoordinateResourceRecovery method manages and synchronizes resource
    recovery operations for players in a group within a World of Warcraft instance.
    This method ensures that group members' resources, such as health, mana, or other
    consumables, are properly restored according to instance-specific rules and group
    coordination policies. It handles the distribution and synchronization of recovery
    actions across all group members, maintaining consistency with the game's instance
    management system. The method typically triggers when a group member completes
    certain instance objectives or when a recovery event occurs that affects the entire
    group.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group for which resource
      recovery is being coordinated. Must be a valid group pointer, and the group
      must be actively participating in an instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Recovery Coordination
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    instanceCoordination->CoordinateResourceRecovery(myGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Recovery with Instance Context
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && player->GetInstanceId()\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    instanceCoordination->CoordinateResourceRecovery(group);\n  \
      \  // Additional logic for instance-specific recovery\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during instance events such as boss kills,
    phase transitions, or when group members complete objectives. It may involve synchronization
    with the server's instance management system to ensure proper resource state across
    all players in the group.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer is valid and that the group is actively
    participating in an instance before calling this method. Passing a null or invalid
    group pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
