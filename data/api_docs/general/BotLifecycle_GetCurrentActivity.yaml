  class: BotLifecycle
  method: GetCurrentActivity
  signature: BotActivity BotLifecycle::GetCurrentActivity() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current activity state of the bot.
  description: The GetCurrentActivity method returns the BotActivity enum value representing
    the current operational state of the bot. This method provides insight into what
    the bot is currently doing, such as moving, attacking, following, or idle. The
    returned value can be used to determine the bot's behavior and make decisions
    based on its current activity. This method does not modify any internal state
    of the bot and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A BotActivity enum value indicating the bot's current operational state.
    Possible values include IDLE, MOVING, ATTACKING, FOLLOWING, and others depending
    on the implementation. Returns IDLE if no specific activity is active.
  examples:
  - title: Check Current Bot Activity
    code: "BotActivity current = botLifecycle->GetCurrentActivity();\nif (current\
      \ == BotActivity::ATTACKING)\n{\n    // Handle attacking state\n    printf(\"\
      Bot is currently attacking\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and does not perform any locking operations. It
    provides a snapshot of the bot's activity at the time of call, which may change
    immediately after the method returns.
  warnings: The returned BotActivity value should not be used to modify the bot's
    behavior directly. Instead, it should be used for informational purposes or as
    a condition for other logic. The activity state may change rapidly during execution.
