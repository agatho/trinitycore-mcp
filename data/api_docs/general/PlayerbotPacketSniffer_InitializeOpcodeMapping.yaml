  brief: Initializes the opcode mapping for player bot packet sniffing functionality
  description: The InitializeOpcodeMapping method sets up the internal mapping of
    network opcodes used by the PlayerbotPacketSniffer class. This method prepares
    the sniffer to correctly interpret and process incoming game packets from players,
    establishing the necessary data structures and lookup tables required for packet
    analysis. It typically runs during the initialization phase of the packet sniffer
    component and ensures that all supported opcodes are properly registered for monitoring
    and handling.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'PlayerbotPacketSniffer sniffer;

      sniffer.InitializeOpcodeMapping();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization of the PlayerbotPacketSniffer
    instance. It is typically invoked automatically by the system when the packet
    sniffer is enabled, but may also be called manually in specific scenarios where
    reinitialization is required.
