  signature: bool RestorationHoTTracker::HasCenarionWard(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has the Cenarion Ward buff active.
  description: The HasCenarionWard method determines whether a specific player currently
    has the Cenarion Ward buff applied to them. This buff is a healing effect that
    periodically restores health to the affected player over time. The method typically
    checks internal tracking data within the RestorationHoTTracker class to verify
    if the specified GUID corresponds to a player with an active Cenarion Ward effect.
    It's commonly used in spell or ability logic to determine whether certain healing
    effects should be applied or modified based on the presence of this buff.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player with the specified GUID has an active Cenarion
    Ward buff; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Player Has Cenarion Ward
    code: "if (restorationHoTTracker.HasCenarionWard(playerGuid)) {\n    // Apply\
      \ additional healing or modify spell effect\n    ApplyExtraHealing();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of active HoTs (Heal over Time) and
    assumes that the GUID parameter refers to a valid player entity. The implementation
    likely uses a map or set structure to store active buff references for efficient
    lookup.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method is valid and refers to a player
    object, as invalid GUIDs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect return values.
    This method should not be called on non-player entities.
