  class: AuctionHouse
  method: GetAuctionHouseForPlayer
  signature: int * AuctionHouse::GetAuctionHouseForPlayer(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the auction house identifier associated with a given player.
  description: The GetAuctionHouseForPlayer method is used to determine which auction
    house a specific player is associated with. This is typically used in World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation to route auction-related actions
    to the correct auction house instance. The method takes a pointer to an integer
    representing the player's unique identifier (GUID) and returns a pointer to an
    integer that represents the auction house's unique identifier. This functionality
    is essential for maintaining proper auction house operations, ensuring that players
    can only interact with auction houses relevant to their character or location.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). The value pointed to should be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  returns: Returns a pointer to an integer that represents the auction house identifier
    (AHID) associated with the specified player. If no auction house is found or if
    the player is invalid, the method may return NULL or an invalid AHID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int playerGUID = 12345;\nint* playerPtr = &playerGUID;\nint* auctionHouseID\
      \ = auctionHouse->GetAuctionHouseForPlayer(playerPtr);\nif (auctionHouseID !=\
      \ nullptr) {\n    printf(\"Player's auction house ID: %d\\n\", *auctionHouseID);\n\
      } else {\n    printf(\"No auction house found for player.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves internal lookups or database queries to match
    players with their respective auction houses, which may have performance implications
    in high-traffic scenarios. The method assumes that the input player GUID is valid
    and corresponds to an existing character in the game world.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed to this method points to a valid
    player GUID; passing NULL or invalid pointers can lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes. This method should not be called with non-existent player identifiers
    as it may result in incorrect auction house associations.
