  method: StaticMapTree
  signature: void StaticMapTree::StaticMapTree(uint32 mapID, const int & basePath)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a static map tree for the specified map ID and base path.
  description: The StaticMapTree constructor initializes a static map tree data structure
    used by TrinityCore's collision detection system. This method sets up internal
    data structures required for efficient spatial queries and terrain collision detection.
    The mapID parameter identifies which map's tree to initialize, while the basePath
    provides the directory path where map-related data files are stored. This initialization
    is typically performed during server startup or when loading map data dynamically.
  parameters:
  - name: mapID
    description: The unique identifier of the map for which the static tree is being
      initialized. This corresponds to the Map ID used internally by TrinityCore.
  - name: basePath
    description: Reference to the base path string where map data files are located.
      This path is used to locate and load terrain and collision data files needed
      for the static map tree.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: StaticMapTree* mapTree = new StaticMapTree(1234, "/opt/trinity/data/");
    language: cpp
  - title: Server Startup Initialization
    code: "void InitializeMapTrees() {\n    for (uint32 i = 0; i < sMapStore.GetNumRows();\
      \ ++i) {\n        MapEntry const* entry = sMapStore.LookupEntry(i);\n      \
      \  if (entry && entry->IsMap()) {\n            new StaticMapTree(entry->ID,\
      \ \"./data/\");\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore system
    when loading maps. Developers should not normally instantiate StaticMapTree objects
    directly unless implementing custom map loading logic. The class uses a hierarchical
    bounding volume tree structure for efficient collision detection and spatial queries.
  warnings: Improper initialization of StaticMapTree with invalid map IDs or incorrect
    base paths can lead to runtime errors or missing collision data. Ensure that the
    basePath points to a valid directory containing required map data files before
    calling this constructor.
