  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::SetAchievementHunting(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables achievement hunting behavior in the advanced behavior
    manager.
  description: The SetAchievementHunting method controls whether the AdvancedBehaviorManager
    should actively pursue and track achievements for the associated NPC or creature.
    When enabled, the behavior manager will monitor progress toward specific achievements
    and potentially trigger events or actions based on achievement completion. This
    functionality is typically used in custom AI scripts to enhance gameplay by making
    NPCs more interactive with player accomplishments. The method does not validate
    the achievement state or check if achievements are actually obtainable; it simply
    toggles the hunting behavior flag within the manager.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Achievement Hunting
    code: 'AdvancedBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = creature->GetAI()->GetAdvancedBehaviorManager();

      behaviorManager->SetAchievementHunting(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Achievement Hunting
    code: 'AdvancedBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = creature->GetAI()->GetAdvancedBehaviorManager();

      behaviorManager->SetAchievementHunting(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only affects the internal behavior flag and does not directly
    interact with the achievement system. The actual achievement tracking must be
    implemented separately within the AI logic or through custom hooks. This method
    is typically called during initialization or state changes of an NPC's AI behavior.
