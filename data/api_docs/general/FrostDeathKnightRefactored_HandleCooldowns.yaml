  brief: Updates and manages cooldowns for Frost Death Knight abilities
  description: The HandleCooldowns method is responsible for processing and updating
    the cooldown states of all applicable abilities for a Frost Death Knight class
    character. This method typically iterates through the character's ability list,
    checks if any abilities are currently on cooldown, and updates their remaining
    cooldown time. It ensures that abilities cannot be used until their cooldown periods
    have fully expired, maintaining game balance and proper resource management. The
    method may also handle special cases such as reducing cooldowns based on talent
    modifications or class-specific effects.
