  class: BattlegroundMgr
  method: ToggleArenaTesting
  signature: bool BattlegroundMgr::ToggleArenaTesting(uint32 battlemasterListId)
documentation:
  brief: Toggles arena testing mode for a specified battleground.
  description: The ToggleArenaTesting method enables or disables arena testing mode
    for a specific battleground identified by its battlemaster list ID. This functionality
    is typically used during development or testing phases to allow players to participate
    in arena matches without affecting the official matchmaking system. The method
    checks if the specified battleground exists and can be toggled, returning true
    if successful or false otherwise. When enabled, arena testing mode allows for
    custom arena configurations and testing scenarios that would normally be restricted
    in live environments.
  parameters:
  - name: battlemasterListId
    description: The unique identifier of the battleground instance to toggle testing
      mode for. This ID corresponds to a specific battleground entry in the battlemaster
      list table.
  returns: Returns true if the arena testing mode was successfully toggled for the
    specified battleground, false otherwise. The method may return false if the battleground
    does not exist or if the operation fails due to internal validation checks.
  examples:
  - title: Enable Arena Testing
    code: "if (sBattlegroundMgr->ToggleArenaTesting(12345)) {\n    sWorld->SendServerMessage(SERVER_MSG_STRING,\
      \ \"Arena testing enabled for battleground 12345\");\n} else {\n    sWorld->SendServerMessage(SERVER_MSG_STRING,\
      \ \"Failed to enable arena testing\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Toggle Testing Mode with Error Handling
    code: "uint32 bgId = 54321;\nbool result = sBattlegroundMgr->ToggleArenaTesting(bgId);\n\
      if (result) {\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"bg.arena\", \"Successfully toggled arena testing\
      \ for battleground %u\", bgId);\n} else {\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"bg.arena\", \"\
      Failed to toggle arena testing for battleground %u\", bgId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for server administration and development
    purposes. The actual implementation likely involves checking internal battleground
    state flags and may require appropriate permissions or debug privileges to execute
    successfully. Performance impact should be minimal as it only modifies internal
    flags rather than performing heavy computations.
  warnings: Using this method in a live environment without proper safeguards could
    lead to unexpected behavior in battleground matchmaking and player experience.
    It's recommended to use this functionality only during development or with strict
    administrative controls in place.
