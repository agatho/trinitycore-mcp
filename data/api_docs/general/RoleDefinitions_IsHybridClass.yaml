  signature: bool RoleDefinitions::IsHybridClass(uint8 classId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified class ID represents a hybrid class in the
    World of Warcraft game system.
  description: The IsHybridClass method evaluates whether a given class ID corresponds
    to a hybrid class, which typically combines attributes or abilities from multiple
    base classes. In TrinityCore's implementation, this method likely checks against
    predefined class configurations that define which classes are considered hybrid.
    This functionality is essential for game mechanics such as character progression
    systems, skill interactions, and class-specific behaviors where hybrid classes
    may have unique rules or restrictions. The method does not require any additional
    context or state beyond the provided class ID parameter.
  parameters:
  - name: classId
    description: The unique identifier of the class to evaluate. Valid values are
      typically integers representing standard WoW class IDs (e.g., 1 for Warrior,
      2 for Paladin, etc.). This parameter must be a valid class ID defined within
      the game's class system.
  returns: Returns true if the specified class ID represents a hybrid class; otherwise
    returns false. A hybrid class in WoW typically refers to a class that combines
    characteristics of two or more base classes, such as the Shadow Priest (which
    combines Discipline and Holy priest mechanics) or certain custom class configurations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (RoleDefinitions::IsHybridClass(10)) {\n    // Handle logic for hybrid\
      \ class\n    printf(\"Class is a hybrid\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Class Check
    code: "uint8 playerClass = player->getClass();\nif (RoleDefinitions::IsHybridClass(playerClass))\
      \ {\n    // Apply special rules for hybrid classes\n    player->SetFlag(PLAYER_FLAGS,\
      \ PLAYER_FLAG_HYBRID_CLASS);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal class configuration tables or definitions
    within TrinityCore's database or codebase. Developers should ensure that the class
    ID passed to this method is valid and corresponds to a known class definition
    in the game system. The implementation may be optimized for performance by using
    precomputed lookup tables or bitmasks.
  warnings: Passing invalid or undefined class IDs could lead to unexpected behavior
    or incorrect results. Ensure all class IDs are validated before calling this method,
    especially when dealing with custom or modded class definitions that might not
    be recognized by default TrinityCore systems.
