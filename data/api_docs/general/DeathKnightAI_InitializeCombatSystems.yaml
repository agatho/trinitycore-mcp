  class: DeathKnightAI
  method: InitializeCombatSystems
  signature: void DeathKnightAI::InitializeCombatSystems()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes all combat-related systems and states for a Death Knight AI instance.
  description: The InitializeCombatSystems method sets up and configures all necessary
    combat mechanics, abilities, and state tracking for a Death Knight AI. This includes
    initializing cooldowns, setting up spell queues, configuring resource management
    systems (such as runic power), and preparing the AI's combat behavior tree or
    decision-making framework. The method ensures that the Death Knight is ready to
    engage in combat by establishing baseline states and system readiness. It is typically
    called during the AI initialization phase when a Death Knight NPC or player character
    enters combat mode.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: "void MyDeathKnight::OnEnterCombat()\n{\n    m_ai->InitializeCombatSystems();\n\
      \    // Combat systems are now ready\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the AI's lifecycle, typically
    at the start of combat. It is not intended to be called repeatedly during active
    combat as it may reset important state information.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times during a single combat session can
    lead to inconsistent AI behavior and potential resource management issues. Ensure
    that all combat systems are properly initialized before engaging in any combat-related
    activities.
