  signature: void Player::MoveItemFromInventory(uint8 bag, uint8 slot, bool update)
documentation:
  brief: Moves an item from inventory to a specified bag and slot.
  description: The MoveItemFromInventory method is used to transfer an item from the
    player's inventory to a specific bag and slot location. This method handles the
    movement of items within the player's inventory, including updating the item's
    position in the database and ensuring proper synchronization with the client.
    It is commonly used during item manipulation operations such as equipping items,
    moving items between bags, or when items are removed from the inventory for processing.
  parameters:
  - name: bag
    description: The bag identifier where the item should be moved to. Valid values
      range from 0 to 11, with 0 representing the backpack and 1-11 representing other
      bags.
  - name: slot
    description: The slot within the specified bag where the item should be placed.
      Valid values range from 0 to 36, depending on the bag type.
  - name: update
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether to update the item in the database.
      If true, the item's position will be updated in the database; if false, only
      the internal state is modified without database updates.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint8 bag = 1;

      uint8 slot = 0;

      bool update = true;

      player->MoveItemFromInventory(bag, slot, update);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other inventory manipulation
    methods like MoveItemToInventory or Item::SetPos. It should be called carefully
    to avoid inconsistencies between the client and server state. The method may trigger
    database updates depending on the update parameter, which can affect performance
    if used frequently.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause item duplication or loss, especially
    when dealing with stackable items. Care must be taken to ensure that the bag and
    slot parameters are valid for the player's inventory structure. Also, calling
    this method without proper update may lead to synchronization issues between client
    and server.
