  class: Guild
  method: HandleNewsSetSticky
  signature: void Guild::HandleNewsSetSticky(WorldSession * session, uint32 newsId,
    bool sticky)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the sticky status of a guild news item.
  description: The HandleNewsSetSticky method is responsible for toggling the sticky
    flag on a specified guild news item. When a news item is marked as sticky, it
    remains at the top of the guild's news list and is displayed prominently to all
    guild members. This functionality allows guild leaders or officers to ensure important
    announcements are always visible. The method operates within the TrinityCore framework
    and interacts with the WorldSession to process the request from a client. It validates
    that the requesting player has appropriate permissions to modify guild news items
    before applying the sticky status change.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession object representing the client connection
      making the request. Used to verify player permissions and send responses back
      to the client.
  - name: newsId
    description: Unique identifier of the guild news item to modify. Must correspond
      to an existing news entry in the guild's news database.
  - name: sticky
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to set or unset the sticky status.
      True enables sticky, false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a News Item as Sticky
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    guild->HandleNewsSetSticky(session,\
      \ 12345, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Unsetting Sticky Status on a News Item
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild && player->IsGuildLeader())\n\
      {\n    guild->HandleNewsSetSticky(session, 67890, false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method requires the calling player to have sufficient permissions within
    the guild. Typically, only guild leaders or officers with appropriate privileges
    can modify news item sticky status. The implementation likely involves database
    updates and synchronization across all connected clients.
  warnings: Attempting to set a non-existent news item ID will result in undefined
    behavior or silent failure. Ensure that the newsId parameter references a valid
    existing news entry before calling this method.
