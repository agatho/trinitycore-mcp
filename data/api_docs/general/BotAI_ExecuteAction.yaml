  signature: bool BotAI::ExecuteAction(const std::string & name, const ActionContext
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a named action within the bot's AI context with provided parameters
  description: The ExecuteAction method is responsible for triggering a specific action
    by name within the BotAI system. It takes an action name and a context object
    containing relevant data for the action to execute. The method processes the action
    according to the bot's current state and AI logic, returning true if the action
    was successfully initiated or executed, and false otherwise. This method serves
    as the core interface for executing AI behaviors in TrinityCore's bot system,
    allowing for dynamic decision-making and behavior execution based on game conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The string identifier of the action to execute. This should correspond
      to a registered action within the BotAI system's action registry.
  - name: context
    description: An ActionContext object containing all necessary data and parameters
      required for the action execution. This includes target information, environment
      data, and any other context-specific variables needed for the action.
  returns: Returns true if the action was successfully executed or initiated, false
    otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that the action name is invalid,
    the context is insufficient, or the action failed during execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Action Execution
    code: "if (botAI->ExecuteAction(\"attack_target\", context)) {\n    // Action\
      \ was executed successfully\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"AI\", \"Attack action initiated\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Failed to execute action\n    LOG_ERROR(\"AI\", \"Failed\
      \ to initiate attack action\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Action Execution
    code: "ActionContext context;\ncontext.SetTarget(bot->GetVictim());\ncontext.SetDistance(bot->GetDistance2d(bot->GetVictim()));\n\
      \nif (botAI->ExecuteAction(\"move_to_target\", context)) {\n    // Bot started\
      \ moving towards target\n    bot->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Could not move to target, try alternative action\n    botAI->ExecuteAction(\"\
      flee\", context);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the BotAI's main update loop
    or when specific game events occur. The ActionContext object should be properly
    populated before calling this method to ensure successful action execution. The
    method may perform internal state checks and validation of the provided context
    before attempting to execute the action.
  warnings: The method assumes that the action name exists in the bot's action registry.
    Calling with an invalid action name will likely result in a false return value
    without throwing exceptions. Ensure that all required context data is properly
    set before calling this method, as missing or invalid context data can cause execution
    failures.
