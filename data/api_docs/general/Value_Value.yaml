  method: Value
  signature: void Value::Value(const std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Value object with the specified name identifier.
  description: The Value constructor initializes a Value object by setting its internal
    name identifier to the provided string value. This method is typically used to
    create value objects that represent configurable parameters or data fields within
    the TrinityCore framework. The name parameter serves as a unique identifier for
    the value instance, allowing it to be referenced and managed within various subsystems
    such as configuration systems, script bindings, or game state management. The
    constructor does not perform any validation on the input name string, so developers
    should ensure that the provided name meets the requirements of the consuming system.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The string identifier to assign to this Value object. This name is
      used to uniquely identify the value within the system and may be used for configuration
      lookups, script access, or debugging purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Value Initialization
    code: 'Value healthValue("PlayerHealth");

      // Creates a new Value object with the name "PlayerHealth"'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Value in Configuration Context
    code: 'Value maxPlayers("MaxPlayersAllowed");

      Value serverName("ServerName");

      // These value objects could be used to store and retrieve configuration settings

      // or game state variables throughout the TrinityCore system'
    language: cpp
  notes: This appears to be a constructor method, not a regular member function. The
    implementation likely stores the provided name in an internal member variable
    for later retrieval. Since this is a constructor, it should only be called during
    object instantiation.
