  signature: bool BotPerformanceAnalytics::IsEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot performance analytics system is enabled.
  description: The IsEnabled method determines if the bot performance analytics subsystem
    is currently active within the TrinityCore server environment. This functionality
    allows administrators and developers to programmatically verify the operational
    status of performance tracking for AI-controlled bots. The method performs a simple
    boolean check against an internal flag that controls whether analytics data collection
    and reporting is active. When enabled, this system may collect metrics such as
    bot response times, decision-making efficiency, and resource utilization. The
    result of this method directly influences whether subsequent analytics operations
    will be executed or ignored.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot performance analytics system is currently enabled,
    false otherwise. This boolean value indicates the operational state of the analytics
    subsystem.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (botAnalytics.IsEnabled()) {\n    // Proceed with analytics operations\n\
      \    botAnalytics.LogPerformanceData();\n} else {\n    // Analytics are disabled,\
      \ skip logging\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot analytics disabled\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logging Based on Enable State
    code: "void CheckAndReportBotStats(BotPerformanceAnalytics& analytics) {\n   \
      \ if (analytics.IsEnabled()) {\n        auto stats = analytics.GetStatistics();\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Bot stats: %u bots, avg response time: %.2fms\",\
      \ \n                       stats.botCount, stats.avgResponseTime);\n    } else\
      \ {\n        sLog->outString(\"Performance analytics not enabled - skipping\
      \ report\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in performance-critical sections of code where
    analytics operations should only be performed when the system is actively tracking
    data. The internal state flag may be modified through configuration files or runtime
    commands, making this check essential for conditional execution. The implementation
    is expected to be thread-safe as it only reads a simple boolean flag.
  warnings: Developers should not assume that disabling analytics will automatically
    clean up existing data - separate cleanup mechanisms may be required. Additionally,
    calling this method in performance-sensitive contexts should be done carefully
    as it may involve synchronization primitives if the internal state is protected
    by mutexes.
