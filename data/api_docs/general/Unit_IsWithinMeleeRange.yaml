  signature: bool Unit::IsWithinMeleeRange(const Unit * obj) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a unit is within melee range of another unit.
  description: This method checks if the calling unit is within the melee range of
    the specified target unit. It evaluates the distance between the two units and
    returns true if they are within the standard melee range, false otherwise. The
    method considers both the physical distance and the combat mechanics that define
    melee range in World of Warcraft. This functionality is essential for determining
    whether a unit can perform melee attacks on another unit.
  parameters:
  - name: obj
    description: The target unit to check against. This parameter defines the unit
      whose position will be used to determine if the calling unit is within melee
      range.
  returns: Returns true if the unit is within melee range of the specified target
    unit, false otherwise. The method returns false when the target unit is null or
    when the distance exceeds the melee range threshold.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsWithinMeleeRange(target)) {\n    // Perform melee attack\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Unit* target = GetTarget();\nif (target && player->IsWithinMeleeRange(target))\
      \ {\n    // Execute melee attack logic\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically uses the standard melee range calculation which is
    approximately 5 yards in World of Warcraft. The implementation may vary based
    on specific game mechanics and unit types. Performance considerations include
    avoiding unnecessary calls when distance is known to be outside melee range.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a direct replacement for checking distance
    in all cases, as it may not account for special circumstances like stealth or
    certain spell effects that could affect melee range calculations. Also, the method
    does not consider the possibility of line-of-sight issues which might prevent
    melee attacks even if distance is within range.
