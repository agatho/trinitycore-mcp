  brief: Saves player customizations to database
  description: This method saves the player's customizations including appearance,
    faction, and other settings to the database. It is typically called during player
    logout or when changes are made to the character's customization options. The
    method ensures that all customizations are properly stored in the database for
    future reference upon login.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->_SaveCustomizations(0);

      // Saves customizations to database'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include saving player appearance, faction settings,
    and other customization data. Performance considerations involve database write
    operations which may impact server performance during high-volume login/logout
    scenarios.
  warnings: This method should not be called during active gameplay without proper
    synchronization to avoid data inconsistencies. Common mistake is calling this
    method multiple times in quick succession without proper delay.
