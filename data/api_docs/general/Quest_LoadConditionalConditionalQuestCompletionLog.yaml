documentation:
  brief: Loads conditional quest completion log data from database fields
  description: This method processes and loads conditional quest completion log information
    from database fields, typically used during quest loading operations to determine
    if a quest should be completed based on specific conditions. The method handles
    parsing of conditional data that may include various triggers such as player level
    requirements, item requirements, or quest completion status. It is part of the
    core quest system implementation in TrinityCore and ensures proper handling of
    conditional quest logic during database loading.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Quest* quest = new Quest();

      int fields[5] = {0};

      quest->LoadConditionalConditionalQuestCompletionLog(fields);

      // This method would typically be called during quest initialization'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally during quest loading process.
    It requires proper database field handling and may involve conditional logic parsing
    that could impact performance if not properly implemented. Thread safety depends
    on the broader context of quest loading operations.
  warnings: Improper handling of database fields can lead to incorrect quest completion
    status or missing conditional requirements. This method should only be called
    during quest initialization phase, not during runtime execution.
