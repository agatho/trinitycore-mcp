documentation:
  brief: Manages and processes population pressure effects on bot behavior and lifecycle
    within the TrinityCore environment.
  description: The HandlePopulationPressure method in BotLifecycleMgr is responsible
    for evaluating and applying game mechanics related to population pressure that
    affects AI-controlled bots. This method typically adjusts bot spawning rates,
    behavior patterns, or resource allocation based on current server conditions or
    player activity levels. It may trigger internal state changes or invoke other
    lifecycle management functions to maintain optimal bot population density and
    gameplay balance. The method operates as part of the broader bot lifecycle management
    system and is often called during periodic updates or in response to specific
    game events.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotLifecycleMgr* mgr = BotLifecycleMgr::Instance();

      mgr->HandlePopulationPressure();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely invoked periodically by the core game loop or through
    event handlers. It may interact with internal bot population counters, server
    load metrics, and configuration settings to determine appropriate pressure responses.
