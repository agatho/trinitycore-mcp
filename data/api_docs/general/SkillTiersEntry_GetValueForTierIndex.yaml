  class: SkillTiersEntry
  method: GetValueForTierIndex
  signature: uint32 SkillTiersEntry::GetValueForTierIndex(uint32 tierIndex) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the value associated with a specific tier index from the skill
    tiers entry.
  description: The GetValueForTierIndex method returns the numeric value corresponding
    to a given tier index within a SkillTiersEntry. This is typically used in World
    of Warcraft's skill and progression systems where different tiers of a skill or
    ability have associated values such as required levels, costs, or bonuses. The
    method assumes that the tier index is valid and within the bounds of available
    tiers for this entry. It does not perform any validation on the input parameter,
    so calling code must ensure the tierIndex is appropriate for the current entry.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the data associated with the specified tier
    index. The meaning of this value depends on the context of the SkillTiersEntry,
    such as a required skill level, cost in currency, or bonus amount.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve skill requirement for tier 3
    code: 'SkillTiersEntry* entry = sSkillTiersStore.LookupEntry(12345);

      uint32 requiredLevel = entry->GetValueForTierIndex(3);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a data structure that defines progression tiers
    for skills, spells, or abilities. It's important to note that tier indices are
    typically zero-based and correspond directly to the internal array or map structure
    used by the SkillTiersEntry.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid tierIndex (outside the valid range)
    may result in undefined behavior or incorrect data being returned. Always validate
    that the tier index is within expected bounds before calling.
