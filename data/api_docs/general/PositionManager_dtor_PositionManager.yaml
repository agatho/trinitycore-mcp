documentation:
  brief: Destroys the PositionManager instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the PositionManager class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were managed by this instance.
    In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, PositionManager likely
    handles positioning data for game entities such as players, creatures, or game
    objects. This destructor ensures proper cleanup when the manager object goes out
    of scope or is explicitly deleted. It typically involves releasing internal data
    structures, clearing cached position information, and ensuring no memory leaks
    occur during object destruction.

  - title: Basic Destructor Usage
    code: 'PositionManager* manager = new PositionManager();

      // ... use the manager ...

      delete manager; // Triggers ~PositionManager()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when a PositionManager object is
    destroyed. Developers should not manually call this destructor unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. The destruction process may involve cleanup
    of internal linked lists, hash tables, or other data structures that store position-related
    information.
