  class: TargetAssistAction
  method: CountAssistingMembers
  signature: uint32 TargetAssistAction::CountAssistingMembers(Unit * target, Group
    * group) const
documentation:
  brief: Counts the number of group members assisting a target unit in the World of
    Warcraft TrinityCore environment.
  description: The CountAssistingMembers method determines how many players within
    a specified group are currently assisting a given target unit. This functionality
    is typically used in AI behavior scripts to evaluate group dynamics and assistive
    actions. The method evaluates each group member's current state and whether they
    are actively engaged with the target, such as attacking or healing. It returns
    a count of all qualifying members who are considered to be actively supporting
    the target within the context of group-based combat mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is being assisted. This represents
      the target unit for which assisting members are counted.
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the members whose assistance
      is being evaluated. The group context is essential for determining which players
      are considered part of the assisting force.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the total number of group members who
    are currently assisting the specified target unit. A return value of zero indicates
    no active assistance from group members.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to count group members assisting a target
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nUnit* targetUnit = ai->GetTarget();\n\
      uint32 assistCount = TargetAssistAction::CountAssistingMembers(targetUnit, playerGroup);\n\
      if (assistCount > 0)\n{\n    // Perform action based on number of assisting\
      \ members\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal AI state tracking and group member engagement
    status. It may not account for all possible assistive actions, such as those performed
    by pets or summoned creatures unless explicitly included in the group evaluation
    logic.
  warnings: Ensure that both target and group parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method to avoid runtime errors. The method assumes that group members
    are properly initialized and in a valid game state for assistance tracking.
