  class: SmartGameObjectAI
  method: Permissible
  signature: int32 SmartGameObjectAI::Permissible(const GameObject * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether this SmartGameObjectAI instance can be used for a given
    game object.
  description: The Permissible method is used to evaluate if a SmartGameObjectAI instance
    is appropriate or permissible to handle a specific GameObject. This method typically
    returns a value indicating the level of suitability or compatibility, often used
    in AI selection logic where multiple AI types might be available for a given object
    type. In TrinityCore's context, this method helps the core system decide which
    AI implementation should manage a particular game object based on its properties
    and type.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A pointer to the GameObject that is being evaluated for AI suitability.
      This parameter represents the specific game object instance for which the Permissible
      check is performed.
  returns: Returns an int32 value indicating the level of permissibility. Positive
    values typically indicate strong suitability, zero indicates neutral or default
    handling, and negative values may indicate incompatibility or disallowance. The
    exact meaning can vary based on implementation details but generally follows standard
    TrinityCore AI permissible return conventions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Permissible Check Usage
    code: "int32 result = ai->Permissible(gameObj);\nif (result > 0) {\n    // This\
      \ AI is suitable for the game object\n    // Proceed with AI initialization\
      \ or activation\n} else if (result == 0) {\n    // Default handling, may fall\
      \ back to base AI\n} else {\n    // Not permissible, skip this AI implementation\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SmartGameObjectAI's interface contract and is
    typically called during AI initialization or object assignment phases. It allows
    for dynamic selection of appropriate AI behavior based on object characteristics
    without requiring explicit type checking or casting.
