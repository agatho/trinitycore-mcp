  brief: Sends a start roll packet to all players involved in the loot roll
  description: The SendStartRoll method is responsible for broadcasting a loot roll
    start message to all players who are eligible to participate in the rolling process.
    This method typically gets invoked when a loot item is ready to be distributed
    among group members, initiating the rolling phase where players can roll for the
    item. The packet sent includes information about the item being rolled for, the
    roll time duration, and the identifiers of players who can participate in the
    roll. This method ensures that all relevant players receive the necessary information
    to begin the loot distribution process according to the game's loot rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Loot Processing
    code: "void ProcessLootRoll(LootRoll* roll)\n{\n    // ... item preparation logic\
      \ ...\n    roll->SendStartRoll();\n    // ... continue with roll management\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the loot system when a new
    loot roll begins. It's important to ensure that all players who should be able
    to participate in the roll have been properly added to the roll's participant
    list before calling this method. The method does not perform any validation on
    whether the roll is actually valid or ready to start.
  warnings: Calling this method without properly initializing the roll participants
    may result in incorrect behavior where some players do not receive the roll notification.
    Additionally, calling this method multiple times for the same roll can cause duplicate
    notifications to be sent to players.
