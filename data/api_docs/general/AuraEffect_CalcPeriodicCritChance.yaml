  signature: float AuraEffect::CalcPeriodicCritChance(const Unit * caster) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the periodic critical strike chance for an aura effect based on
    the caster's properties.
  description: The CalcPeriodicCritChance method computes the probability that a periodic
    aura effect will trigger as a critical strike. This calculation takes into account
    various factors such as the caster's critical strike rating, spell school, and
    any applicable modifiers. The result is returned as a float value between 0.0
    and 1.0, representing the chance of a critical hit. This method is typically used
    in the context of periodic damage or healing effects that can critically strike,
    such as DoTs (Damage over Time) or HoTs (Heal over Time).
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the probability of a critical
    strike for the periodic aura effect.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Aura Application
    code: "float critChance = auraEffect->CalcPeriodicCritChance(caster);\nif (roll_chance_f(critChance))\
      \ {\n    // Apply critical strike effects\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the caster's current state and stats at the time of
    invocation. It may be called multiple times during an aura's lifetime, especially
    for effects that have dynamic crit chance calculations.
