  class: Quest
  method: MoneyValue
  signature: uint32 Quest::MoneyValue(const Player * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the monetary reward value for completing the quest.
  description: The MoneyValue method computes the gold amount that a player will receive
    as part of the quest's reward. This value is determined based on the quest's configuration
    in the database, including any modifiers or scaling factors that may apply. The
    method takes into account the player's level and other potential factors that
    influence quest rewards. It is typically used when processing quest completion
    rewards to determine how much gold should be awarded to the player.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the amount of gold (in copper units)
    that will be awarded to the player upon completing this quest. A return value
    of 0 indicates no monetary reward is configured for the quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);

      uint32 moneyReward = quest->MoneyValue(player);

      player->AddItem(ITEM_ID_GOLD_COINS, moneyReward);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Reward Before Awarding
    code: "Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\nuint32 reward = quest->MoneyValue(player);\n\
      if (reward > 0)\n{\n    player->ModifyMoney(reward);\n    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      You have been rewarded %u gold.\", reward / 10000);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not directly modify the player's money; it only calculates
    the value. The actual awarding of money should be handled separately using methods
    like Player::ModifyMoney() or similar reward distribution functions. The calculation
    may vary depending on server settings, quest scaling, and expansion-specific configurations.
  warnings: Ensure that the player parameter is valid and not null before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior. Also, note that this value represents
    only the base monetary reward and does not include any additional bonuses from
    achievements or other sources.
