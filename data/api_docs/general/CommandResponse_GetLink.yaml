  class: CommandResponse
  method: GetLink
  signature: const std::string & CommandResponse::GetLink() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the hyperlink string associated with the command response for display
    in the game client.
  description: The GetLink method retrieves the formatted hyperlink string that represents
    a command response, typically used to provide clickable links within in-game messages
    or chat. This allows players to interact with hyperlinks directly from the game
    interface, such as linking to specific locations, items, or other game entities.
    The returned string is formatted according to World of Warcraft's hyperlink syntax
    and can be safely inserted into chat messages or UI elements. The method does
    not modify any internal state and is purely a getter operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the formatted hyperlink
    text that can be displayed in the game client. This string follows the standard
    WoW hyperlink format, typically starting with |H followed by the link type and
    parameters, ending with |h and |r tags for proper formatting.

  - title: Basic Usage in Command Handler
    code: "void HandleTeleportCommand(ChatHandler* handler, const std::string& args)\n\
      {\n    CommandResponse response;\n    // ... populate response with data ...\n\
      \    std::string link = response.GetLink();\n    handler->PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Click this link: %s\", link.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Link in Chat Message
    code: 'CommandResponse resp;

      resp.SetType(COMMAND_RESPONSE_TYPE_ITEM);

      resp.SetId(12345);

      std::string itemLink = resp.GetLink();

      player->Say(itemLink, LANG_UNIVERSAL);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the CommandResponse object has been properly initialized
    with valid link data. The returned string is a reference to internal storage and
    should not be modified directly. If no link data exists in the response, an empty
    string will be returned.
  warnings: Ensure that the CommandResponse object has been correctly populated with
    link information before calling this method. Improperly initialized objects may
    return malformed or empty hyperlink strings that could cause display issues in
    the client.
