  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: SetHealerThreatThreshold
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::SetHealerThreatThreshold(float percent)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the threat threshold percentage for healer units in the threat coordinator
    system.
  description: The SetHealerThreatThreshold method configures the percentage value
    that determines when a healer unit will begin to reduce or manage its threat level
    towards targets. This is used within the threat coordination system to ensure
    healers do not inadvertently pull aggro from tanks by maintaining excessive threat.
    The threshold value typically represents a percentage of maximum threat allowed
    before defensive actions are triggered. This method modifies internal state within
    the ThreatCoordinator class and affects how healer AI behavior responds to threat
    generation.
  parameters:
  - name: percent
    description: A float value representing the threat threshold as a percentage (0.0
      to 100.0). Values below 0 are treated as 0, and values above 100 are treated
      as 100.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.SetHealerThreatThreshold(75.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Minimum Threshold
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.SetHealerThreatThreshold(10.0f); // Very low threshold for aggressive
      threat management'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal threat management settings of
    the ThreatCoordinator. It should be called during initialization or configuration
    phases, not during active combat scenarios where immediate changes could disrupt
    ongoing threat dynamics.
  warnings: Setting this value too low may cause healers to frequently reduce their
    threat even when they are not generating significant amounts, potentially leading
    to inefficient healing behavior. Setting it too high might allow healers to accumulate
    dangerous levels of threat without intervention.
