  brief: Identifies and processes meta shift behaviors within the AI adaptation system
  description: The IdentifyMetaShift method is responsible for detecting and handling
    meta shift events in the BehaviorAdaptation class. This method analyzes current
    behavioral patterns and adapts the AI's decision-making process to accommodate
    significant changes in player behavior or environmental conditions. It typically
    involves evaluating various behavioral metrics, comparing them against predefined
    thresholds, and triggering appropriate adaptive responses. The method plays a
    crucial role in maintaining dynamic and responsive AI behavior that can adjust
    to changing game states or player actions.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void AIUpdate()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    m_behaviorAdaptation->IdentifyMetaShift();\n\
      \    // ... continue with adapted behavior ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles and may involve performance
    considerations when processing complex behavioral data. The implementation likely
    uses internal state tracking to determine when significant behavioral shifts have
    occurred.
  warnings: Care should be taken when calling this method frequently as it may involve
    computationally expensive operations for analyzing behavioral patterns. Ensure
    proper synchronization if used in multi-threaded contexts.
