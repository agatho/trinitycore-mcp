  signature: int BfGraveyard::GetControlTeamId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the team ID controlling the graveyard.
  description: The GetControlTeamId method retrieves the team identifier of the faction
    currently controlling the graveyard. In World of Warcraft's Battle for Azeroth
    and related battleground systems, graveyards are strategic points that can be
    captured by either the Alliance or Horde teams. This method allows code to determine
    which faction currently controls a specific graveyard, enabling logic for graveyard-based
    gameplay mechanics such as respawn point assignment, capture progress tracking,
    and team-based objectives. The returned value typically corresponds to either
    0 (Alliance) or 1 (Horde), though the exact mapping may depend on internal team
    ID conventions within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the controlling team's ID. Typically returns 0
    for Alliance, 1 for Horde, or -1 if no team controls the graveyard. The method
    does not return null as it is a primitive type.
  examples:
  - title: Check Control Team of Graveyard
    code: "BfGraveyard* graveyard = sBfMgr->GetGraveyardById(5);\nint teamId = graveyard->GetControlTeamId();\n\
      if (teamId == 0)\n{\n    // Alliance controls the graveyard\n}\nelse if (teamId\
      \ == 1)\n{\n    // Horde controls the graveyard\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No team\
      \ controls the graveyard\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in battleground and world PvP systems where
    graveyard control affects gameplay. The implementation likely caches the current
    control state to avoid expensive lookups. It's important to note that this method
    only returns the team ID and does not provide additional information such as capture
    progress or time remaining.
  warnings: The return value of -1 may indicate an error condition or a neutral state,
    but it's not guaranteed to always mean no control. Ensure proper handling of all
    possible return values in your code logic. This method should only be called on
    valid graveyard objects that have been properly initialized.
