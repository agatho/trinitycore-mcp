  class: QuestCompletion
  method: FindObjectiveTarget
  signature: bool QuestCompletion::FindObjectiveTarget(Player * bot, QuestObjectiveData
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and targets the objective for a quest completion.
  description: The FindObjectiveTarget method is responsible for identifying and setting
    up the target required to complete a specific quest objective. It takes a player
    character and a quest objective data structure as inputs, and attempts to locate
    the appropriate game object or NPC that fulfills the objective requirements. This
    method is typically used in automated quest completion systems or AI-driven bot
    behavior within the TrinityCore framework. The method performs checks to ensure
    the target is valid and accessible before returning a success or failure status.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character attempting
      to complete the quest objective.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing information
      about the specific quest objective to be completed.
  returns: Returns true if a valid target was successfully found and set for the quest
    objective, false otherwise. The method may return false if no suitable target
    exists in the current environment or if the target is not accessible to the player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nQuestObjectiveData questObj = ...;\nbool success\
      \ = QuestCompletion::FindObjectiveTarget(player, questObj);\nif (success) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with quest completion logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Completion Logic
    code: "void CompleteQuestObjective(Player* player, uint32 questId) {\n    QuestObjectiveData\
      \ objective;\n    // Initialize objective data for the specified quest\n   \
      \ if (QuestCompletion::FindObjectiveTarget(player, objective)) {\n        //\
      \ Target found, proceed to interact with it\n        player->GetSession()->HandleQuestConfirmAccept(&objective);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Handle failure case\n        player->SendNotification(\"\
      Could not find quest objective target.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the automated quest completion system and relies on
    proper initialization of QuestObjectiveData structures. It may perform database
    lookups or world object searches which could impact performance in high-frequency
    scenarios. The method assumes that the player's current location and environment
    are valid for the quest objective being processed.
  warnings: The method may fail if the target is not within the player's current zone
    or if the objective data is improperly initialized. Ensure that QuestObjectiveData
    contains valid information before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior
    or crashes.
