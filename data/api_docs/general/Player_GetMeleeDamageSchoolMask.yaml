  signature: int Player::GetMeleeDamageSchoolMask(int attackType) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the damage school mask for melee attacks.
  description: This method retrieves the damage school mask associated with melee
    attacks for the player. It is used to determine the type of damage dealt by melee
    attacks, which affects how damage is processed and applied in combat mechanics.
    The method returns an integer representing the damage type (e.g., physical, holy,
    fire, nature, etc.), allowing developers to understand the attack's elemental
    properties. This functionality is essential for implementing proper combat system
    logic and understanding attack behavior in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the damage school mask for melee attacks.
    The value corresponds to different damage types such as physical (0), holy (1),
    fire (2), nature (3), frost (4), shadow (5), and arcane (6). This value is used
    to determine how damage is processed in combat mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int damageType = player->GetMeleeDamageSchoolMask(0);\nif (damageType ==\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Handle physical damage\n}\nelse if (damageType == 1)\n{\n  \
      \  // Handle holy damage\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Player class and should be used carefully in combat-related
    logic. It's important to note that the return value depends on the attack type
    being considered, which may vary based on player class or specialization.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it might not always return a valid
    damage type depending on the context. Ensure proper handling of edge cases where
    the attack type is invalid or undefined.
