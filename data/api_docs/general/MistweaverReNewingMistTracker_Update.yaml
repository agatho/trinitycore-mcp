  method: Update
  signature: void MistweaverReNewingMistTracker::Update()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the state and tracking of the Renewing Mist ability for Mistweaver
    monks.
  description: The Update method is responsible for managing the internal state of
    the Renewing Mist tracker, which monitors the application, duration, and healing
    effects of the Renewing Mist spell. This method typically handles the logic for
    updating the mist's heal-over-time effect, checking for expiration, recalculating
    healing amounts based on the monk's stats, and ensuring proper synchronization
    with the game's combat system. It is usually called during each tick of the spell's
    duration or when relevant events occur such as player actions or damage taken.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'MistweaverReNewingMistTracker tracker;

      tracker.Update();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be invoked regularly during the active duration of the
    Renewing Mist spell to maintain accurate tracking and healing calculations. The
    implementation likely involves checking for target status, updating internal timers,
    and potentially triggering additional effects or events related to the spell's
    mechanics.
