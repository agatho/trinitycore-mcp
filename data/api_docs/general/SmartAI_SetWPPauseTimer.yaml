  class: SmartAI
  method: SetWPPauseTimer
  signature: void SmartAI::SetWPPauseTimer(uint32 time)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the waypoint pause timer for the SmartAI instance.
  description: The SetWPPauseTimer method configures the duration (in milliseconds)
    that a creature will pause at a waypoint when using SmartAI behavior. This timer
    controls how long the AI remains stationary before proceeding to the next waypoint
    in its path. The pause timer is typically used in conjunction with waypoint-based
    movement patterns to create natural pauses or delays during NPC movement sequences.
    This method directly affects the internal timing mechanism of the SmartAI system
    and should be called before initiating waypoint movement.
  parameters:
  - name: time
    description: The pause duration in milliseconds to set for the waypoint. Valid
      values are positive integers representing time intervals. A value of 0 effectively
      disables the pause timer.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Waypoint Pause Timer Setup
    code: "void OnSpawn()\n{\n    // Set a 2-second pause at each waypoint\n    me->GetAI()->SetWPPauseTimer(2000);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Waypoint Pause Timer Based on NPC State
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_pauseTimer <= 0)\n    {\n    \
      \    // Set different pause times based on NPC state\n        if (IsInCombat())\n\
      \            me->GetAI()->SetWPPauseTimer(500);  // Short pause during combat\n\
      \        else\n            me->GetAI()->SetWPPauseTimer(3000); // Long pause\
      \ when idle\n        \n        m_pauseTimer = 1000; // Reset timer\n    }\n\
      \    else\n    {\n        m_pauseTimer -= diff;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The waypoint pause timer is reset each time a new waypoint is reached. This
    method only affects the current SmartAI instance and does not persist across AI
    resets or creature respawns. The internal timer resolution may vary depending
    on the game's tick rate.
  warnings: Setting very large values for the pause timer may cause noticeable delays
    in NPC movement behavior, potentially affecting quest progression or encounter
    timing. Ensure that pause times are reasonable for the intended gameplay experience.
