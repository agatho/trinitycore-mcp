  class: LootItem
  method: GetAllowedLooters
  signature: const int & LootItem::GetAllowedLooters() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the allowed looters count for the loot item.
  description: The GetAllowedLooters method retrieves the number of players who are
    permitted to loot this item. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, loot items can
    have specific restrictions on who may loot them, such as when an item is bound
    to a player or when it's part of a group loot system. This method returns a constant
    reference to an integer representing the count of allowed looters. The value returned
    should be interpreted as the number of players who are eligible to receive this
    loot item directly from the container or corpse.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const reference to an integer that represents the number of players allowed
    to loot this item. This value typically corresponds to the size of a list or set
    of player identifiers who have permission to take the item.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "LootItem* lootItem = ...;\nconst int& allowedLooters = lootItem->GetAllowedLooters();\n\
      if (allowedLooters > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with loot logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a const reference, meaning the value should not be modified
    directly. The actual implementation likely involves accessing internal data structures
    that track player permissions for specific loot items. Since this is a core part
    of TrinityCore's loot system, performance is important and the method is expected
    to be fast.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned reference in contexts where modification
    might occur, as it's marked as const. Also, ensure that the LootItem object is
    valid before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
