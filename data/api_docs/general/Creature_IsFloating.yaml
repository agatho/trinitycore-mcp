  class: Creature
  method: IsFloating
  signature: bool Creature::IsFloating() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature is currently floating in the air.
  description: The IsFloating method checks if a creature is in a floating state,
    which occurs when the creature is not standing on the ground but rather suspended
    in the air. This typically happens during certain animations, movement states,
    or when the creature has been knocked off its feet by environmental effects. The
    method returns true when the creature is in a floating state and false otherwise.
    This functionality is essential for determining the creature's current physical
    state and can be used to control behavior during combat or movement.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is currently floating, false otherwise. The
    value indicates whether the creature's position is not on the ground but rather
    suspended in air.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->IsFloating()) {\n    // Handle floating state\n    // Do\
      \ something specific to floating creatures\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with movement and animation
    logic. It may be affected by various game mechanics including knockback effects,
    gravity, and movement states that can cause creatures to become airborne.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a direct replacement for checking if
    a creature is on ground; instead it should be used to determine floating state
    during specific gameplay scenarios such as combat or movement.
