api:
  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: MeetsQuestRequirements
  signature: bool DynamicQuestSystem::MeetsQuestRequirements(const Quest * quest,
    Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player meets all requirements to accept and progress
    through a specified quest.
  description: The MeetsQuestRequirements method evaluates if a given Player character
    satisfies all conditions necessary to take and advance in a specific Quest. This
    includes checking level requirements, previous quest completions, faction standing,
    item inventory, and any other prerequisite conditions defined by the quest. The
    method is typically used internally by the dynamic quest system to validate quest
    eligibility before allowing players to interact with quest-related actions such
    as accepting, turning in, or progressing through objectives. It ensures that game
    balance and logical progression are maintained within the questing system.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: A pointer to the Quest object that contains the requirements to be
      checked against the player. Must not be null.
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the character whose quest
      eligibility is being evaluated. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if all quest requirements are met by the player, otherwise
    returns false. If either parameter is invalid (null), behavior is undefined and
    may result in a crash.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if player can accept a quest
    code: "if (dynamicQuestSystem->MeetsQuestRequirements(quest, player)) {\n    //\
      \ Proceed with quest acceptance logic\n    player->AddQuest(quest);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Inform player they cannot take the quest\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You do not meet the requirements for this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage in a custom quest validation system
    code: "bool CanPlayerAcceptQuest(Player* player, Quest* quest) {\n    // Perform\
      \ additional checks beyond basic requirement validation\n    if (!player ||\
      \ !quest) return false;\n    \n    // Custom logic for faction or reputation\
      \ requirements\n    if (quest->GetRequiredFaction() && player->GetReputation(quest->GetRequiredFaction())\
      \ < quest->GetRequiredReputation()) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    \n\
      \    // Use the core system to validate standard requirements\n    return dynamicQuestSystem->MeetsQuestRequirements(quest,\
      \ player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal quest data structures and may involve database
    lookups or cached values depending on how the DynamicQuestSystem is implemented.
    It should be called only when necessary to avoid performance degradation during
    frequent checks. The method assumes that both parameters are valid pointers and
    does not perform null checks internally.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null pointer for either parameter will likely
    cause undefined behavior or a crash. Ensure that all quest and player objects
    are properly initialized before invoking this method. Additionally, changes to
    quest data during runtime may affect the validity of cached results if the system
    uses caching mechanisms.
