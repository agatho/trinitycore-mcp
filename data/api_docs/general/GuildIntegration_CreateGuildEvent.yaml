    & eventType)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a guild event for the specified player based on the given event type.
  description: The CreateGuildEvent method is responsible for generating and initializing
    a guild event within the TrinityCore framework. This method takes a pointer to
    a player identifier and an event type string to determine what kind of guild-related
    activity should be initiated. The method likely interacts with internal guild
    management systems to register the event, assign appropriate permissions, and
    notify guild members. It is typically invoked when a guild leader or officer triggers
    a specific guild action such as a raid invitation, meeting, or other organized
    activities. The event type parameter controls how the system processes and handles
    the guild event, ensuring proper integration with existing game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) within the TrinityCore system. This value must be a valid player GUID
      or the method may fail or produce undefined behavior.
  - name: eventType
    description: String specifying the type of guild event to create. Valid values
      are typically predefined constants or strings that map to specific guild activities
      such as 'raid', 'meeting', 'pvp', etc. The exact valid values depend on the
      game's implementation and configuration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Event Creation
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.CreateGuildEvent(&playerId, "raid");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Meeting Event
    code: 'int playerId = 67890;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.CreateGuildEvent(&playerId, "meeting");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely requires the player to be part of a guild and may have
    internal checks for guild permissions. The event type string is expected to match
    predefined values in the game's configuration or database. Performance-wise, this
    method may involve database operations and network communication to update guild
    state across the server.
  warnings: Passing an invalid player GUID or an unrecognized eventType string could
    lead to undefined behavior or runtime errors. Ensure that the player is properly
    authenticated and has sufficient guild permissions before calling this method.
