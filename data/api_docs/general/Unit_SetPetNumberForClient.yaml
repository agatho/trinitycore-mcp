  signature: void Unit::SetPetNumberForClient(uint32 petNumber)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the pet number for client display purposes.
  description: This method assigns a unique identifier to a pet that is used for client-side
    display and tracking. The pet number is typically used in conjunction with the
    pet's GUID to distinguish between different pets owned by the same player. It
    allows the game client to properly identify and display the pet's information,
    including its name, status, and visual representation. This method is commonly
    used when setting up or updating pet information for players during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: petNumber
    description: The unique identifier number assigned to the pet for client-side
      display. This number typically corresponds to the pet's index in the pet's inventory
      or database and must be within valid range for the game mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetPetNumberForClient(12345);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetPet();

      unit->SetPetNumberForClient(unit->GetPetNumber());

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other pet-related methods
    to ensure proper client-side display. The pet number should be consistent with
    the pet's GUID and must be unique within the player's pet list.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect pet display or confusion
    in the game client, especially if the pet number is not properly synchronized
    with the pet's GUID.
