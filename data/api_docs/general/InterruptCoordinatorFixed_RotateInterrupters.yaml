  class: InterruptCoordinatorFixed
  method: RotateInterrupters
  signature: void InterruptCoordinatorFixed::RotateInterrupters()
documentation:
  brief: Rotates the list of interrupters in the coordinator, updating their order
    for interrupt processing.
  description: The RotateInterrupters method reorders the internal list of interrupters
    managed by the InterruptCoordinatorFixed class. This rotation ensures that different
    interrupters are processed in a cyclic manner, which can be important for balancing
    interrupt handling across multiple potential interrupt sources. The method typically
    updates an internal index or iterator to point to the next interrupter in sequence,
    allowing fair distribution of interrupt processing responsibilities. This functionality
    is commonly used in AI systems where multiple entities may interrupt a spell or
    action, and a round-robin approach helps prevent starvation of any particular
    interrupter.

    code: 'InterruptCoordinatorFixed coordinator;

      coordinator.RotateInterrupters();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of a larger interrupt handling loop
    or system update cycle. It modifies internal state and should be invoked in a
    thread-safe context if used in multi-threaded environments.
