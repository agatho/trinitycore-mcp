documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the next transport rotation entry based on the provided time value
    for animation progression.
  description: The GetNextAnimRotation method is used to determine the appropriate
    transport rotation entry that should be applied at a given point in time during
    a transport's animation cycle. This method is typically invoked by the transport
    system to manage smooth movement and orientation changes of game objects such
    as boats, zeppelins, or other moving transports within World of Warcraft. It uses
    internal timing logic to interpolate between defined rotation points and returns
    a pointer to the relevant entry that represents the current or next animation
    state. The method assumes that the transport's animation data has been properly
    initialized and loaded.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a TransportRotationEntry object which defines the rotation
    parameters for the transport at the specified time. Returns nullptr if no valid
    rotation entry can be determined, typically due to invalid internal state or missing
    animation data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Transport Update Loop
    code: "void UpdateTransport()\n{\n    int currentTime = GetGameTime();\n    const\
      \ TransportRotationEntry* nextRotation = m_transportAnimation.GetNextAnimRotation(currentTime);\n\
      \    if (nextRotation)\n    {\n        ApplyTransportRotation(nextRotation);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal time tracking and assumes that the transport
    animation data is correctly initialized. The returned pointer is only valid for
    the lifetime of the TransportAnimation object and should not be stored or used
    beyond the scope where it was retrieved.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned pointer will always be valid; always check
    for null before using the result. Improper handling of the returned entry may
    lead to incorrect transport movement or crashes if the animation data is corrupted
    or improperly configured.
