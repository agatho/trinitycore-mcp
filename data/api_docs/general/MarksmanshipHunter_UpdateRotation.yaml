  class: MarksmanshipHunter
  method: UpdateRotation
  signature: void MarksmanshipHunter::UpdateRotation(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the marksmanship hunter's rotation based on the current target and
    combat state.
  description: The UpdateRotation method is responsible for determining and executing
    the appropriate ability sequence for a marksmanship hunter during combat. It evaluates
    the current target, available resources, and tactical situation to decide which
    abilities should be used next in the rotation. This method typically integrates
    with the AI system to make real-time decisions about spell casting, aiming for
    optimal damage output while respecting cooldowns and resource management. The
    method is called regularly during combat to ensure the hunter maintains an efficient
    rotation.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the current target. This
      parameter defines the enemy or creature that the hunter will focus on during
      the rotation update.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void MyMarksmanshipAI::Update()\n{\n    if (Unit* target = GetVictim())\n\
      \    {\n        UpdateRotation(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom AI Logic
    code: "void MarksmanshipHunter::UpdateRotation(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (!target\
      \ || !target->IsAlive())\n        return;\n\n    // Check for available resources\
      \ and cooldowns\n    if (HasSpellCooldown(SpellId::AimedShot))\n    {\n    \
      \    // Use other abilities in rotation\n        CastSpell(SpellId::ChimeraShot);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        CastSpell(SpellId::AimedShot);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the AI system at regular intervals during
    combat. It assumes that the target is valid and alive when called. The implementation
    may vary depending on the specific version of TrinityCore and the hunter's current
    gear or talent configuration.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is not null before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. Improper handling of spell cooldowns or resource
    checks can lead to inefficient rotations or potential game state inconsistencies.
