  class: GroupFormation
  method: SetMemberFlexibility
  signature: void GroupFormation::SetMemberFlexibility(uint32 memberGuid, bool isFlexible)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the flexibility flag for a group member, determining whether they can
    be moved during formation updates.
  description: The SetMemberFlexibility method configures whether a specific group
    member is allowed to be repositioned during dynamic group formation adjustments.
    This functionality is typically used in scenarios where certain players should
    remain fixed in their positions (e.g., tanks or healers) while others may be adjusted
    for optimal positioning. The method operates on a per-member basis and affects
    how the group's formation logic behaves when recalculating member placements.
    It is commonly utilized in battlegrounds, raids, or other group-based content
    where strategic positioning is crucial.
  parameters:
  - name: memberGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group member whose flexibility
      setting will be modified. This must correspond to a valid player within the
      current group.
  - name: isFlexible
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the member is flexible (true) or
      fixed (false) in their position during formation updates.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set a player as flexible
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = ...;

      formation->SetMemberFlexibility(123456789, true); // Allow player with GUID
      123456789 to be moved during formation updates'
    language: cpp
  - title: Set a player as fixed
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = ...;

      formation->SetMemberFlexibility(987654321, false); // Prevent player with GUID
      987654321 from being moved during formation updates'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly influences group positioning logic and should be used
    carefully to avoid unintended consequences in dynamic group scenarios. The flexibility
    setting is typically reset or updated when the group formation changes or when
    members join/leave.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting a player as flexible when they should remain fixed
    can lead to undesirable positioning during combat or movement mechanics. Ensure
    that GUIDs passed are valid and correspond to actual group members.
