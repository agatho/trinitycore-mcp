api:
  class: ArenaAI
  method: IsUsingPillarEffectively
  signature: bool ArenaAI::IsUsingPillarEffectively(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the arena AI is effectively utilizing a pillar mechanic
    for the specified player.
  description: The IsUsingPillarEffectively method evaluates if the ArenaAI instance
    is currently employing a pillar-based strategy or effect for a given player within
    an arena environment. This typically involves checking conditions such as whether
    the player has sufficient health, positioning, or cooldowns to make effective
    use of a pillar mechanic. The method returns true if the AI determines that using
    the pillar is beneficial and feasible; otherwise, it returns false. This functionality
    is crucial in arena combat AI logic where strategic use of environmental features
    can significantly impact battle outcomes.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player index or identifier
      within the arena. The value should correspond to a valid player in the current
      arena context.
  returns: Returns true if the AI considers using the pillar mechanic effectively
    for the specified player, false otherwise. A return of true implies that the conditions
    are favorable for utilizing the pillar strategy.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "int playerId = 1;\nif (arenaAI.IsUsingPillarEffectively(&playerId)) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with pillar-based actions\n    printf(\"Player %d is effectively\
      \ using the pillar\\n\", playerId);\n} else {\n    // Alternative strategy\n\
      \    printf(\"Player %d should avoid using the pillar now\\n\", playerId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal AI state tracking and arena-specific
    mechanics. Developers should ensure that the player parameter points to a valid
    arena participant before calling this function to prevent undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring the player is part of an active arena
    match may lead to incorrect results or crashes. The method assumes proper initialization
    of the ArenaAI instance and valid player context.
