  class: RuneResource
  method: SpendRunicPower
  signature: bool RuneResource::SpendRunicPower(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Spends the specified amount of runic power from the RuneResource.
  description: The SpendRunicPower method consumes a given amount of runic power from
    the RuneResource object. This method is typically used in World of Warcraft's
    combat system to deduct runic power when abilities or spells that require it are
    cast. The method checks whether sufficient runic power is available before spending
    it. If the requested amount exceeds the available runic power, the operation will
    fail and return false. This method is essential for managing the resource consumption
    of death knights and other classes that utilize runic power mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified amount of runic power was successfully spent;
    otherwise, returns false if there was insufficient runic power to fulfill the
    request.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (player->GetRuneResource()->SpendRunicPower(25)) {\n    // Successfully\
      \ spent 25 runic power\n    // Proceed with ability execution\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Not enough runic power\n    // Handle insufficient resource case\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Before Spending
    code: "RuneResource* runeResource = player->GetRuneResource();\nuint32 requiredPower\
      \ = 50;\nif (runeResource->GetRunicPower() >= requiredPower) {\n    if (runeResource->SpendRunicPower(requiredPower))\
      \ {\n        // Execute ability that costs 50 runic power\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal runic power state of the RuneResource.
    It should be used carefully in performance-critical sections, as it may trigger
    resource updates or UI refreshes. The method assumes that the RuneResource object
    is valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Do not call this method without first verifying that sufficient runic
    power is available to avoid unexpected behavior. Calling SpendRunicPower with
    a zero or negative value may lead to undefined behavior depending on implementation
    details.
