    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a word list group for a specified language and word length from
    the language manager.
  description: The FindWordGroup method retrieves a const pointer to a WordList object
    that contains words of a specific language and word length. This method is typically
    used in the context of language processing or text generation within TrinityCore's
    game systems, particularly when dealing with localized content or linguistic data
    structures. The method performs a lookup based on the provided language identifier
    and word length parameters, returning a pointer to the corresponding word group
    if found, or nullptr if no matching group exists. This functionality supports
    dynamic language handling and text processing in multilingual game environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to a WordList object representing the word group for the
    specified language and word length. Returns nullptr if no matching word group
    is found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const WordList* wordGroup = sLanguageMgr->FindWordGroup(LANG_ENGLISH, 5);\n\
      if (wordGroup)\n{\n    // Process the word group\n    printf(\"Found word group\
      \ with %zu words\\n\", wordGroup->size());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling
    code: "const WordList* group = sLanguageMgr->FindWordGroup(12345, 3);\nif (!group)\n\
      {\n    printf(\"No word group found for language 12345 with length 3\\n\");\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Use the group\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with language-specific data
    structures and requires that the LanguageMgr has been properly initialized with
    word lists for various languages. The returned WordList pointer should not be
    modified as it points to internal read-only data structures.
  warnings: The returned pointer may be null if no matching word group exists for
    the specified parameters, so always check for nullptr before using the result.
    This method assumes that language identifiers and word lengths are valid and within
    expected ranges.
