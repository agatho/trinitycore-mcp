  class: QuestPOIBlobPoint
  method: QuestPOIBlobPoint
  signature: void QuestPOIBlobPoint::QuestPOIBlobPoint(int32 x, int32 y, int32 z)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a QuestPOIBlobPoint object with specified x, y, and z coordinates.
  description: The QuestPOIBlobPoint constructor initializes a point in the quest
    point of interest (POI) system with given x, y, and z coordinates. This class
    is used to define locations within the game world that are associated with specific
    quests or objectives. The coordinates represent positions in the 3D world space,
    typically used for marking quest-related locations such as NPC spawn points, item
    collection spots, or destination markers. The POI system helps players navigate
    through quests by highlighting important locations on their minimap and world
    map.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: The x-coordinate of the point in 3D world space
  - name: y
    description: The y-coordinate of the point in 3D world space
  - name: z
    description: The z-coordinate of the point in 3D world space
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new QuestPOIBlobPoint
    code: 'QuestPOIBlobPoint poiPoint(1234, 5678, 9012);

      // Creates a POI point at coordinates (1234, 5678, 9012)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using QuestPOIBlobPoint in quest data initialization
    code: "void InitializeQuestPOIs()\n{\n    QuestPOIBlobPoint point1(100, 200, 300);\n\
      \    QuestPOIBlobPoint point2(400, 500, 600);\n    // These points would be\
      \ used to define quest objectives\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when processing quest POI data from database entries. The coordinates are usually
    stored in the database as part of quest POI definitions and are used to render
    visual markers on the player's map. The class likely serves as a data structure
    for storing and managing quest-related location information.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by custom scripts or addons
    unless you understand the underlying POI system architecture. Incorrect coordinate
    values may result in POI markers appearing at invalid locations in the game world.
