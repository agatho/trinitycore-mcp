documentation:
  brief: Records a successful bot spawn event in the performance monitoring system.
  description: The RecordSuccessfulSpawn method logs a successful bot spawn event
    within the TrinityCore's BotPerformanceMonitor class. This method is typically
    invoked when a bot has been successfully created and initialized within the game
    world, allowing the system to track spawn success rates and performance metrics
    for bot-related operations. The method updates internal counters or logging mechanisms
    to reflect this successful spawn event, which can be used for debugging, performance
    analysis, or administrative monitoring of bot behavior in the game environment.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      monitor.RecordSuccessfulSpawn();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger performance monitoring system designed
    to track bot behavior and system efficiency. It may increment internal counters
    or write entries to performance logs, but the exact implementation details are
    not provided in the source code.
