  method: GetGlobalTradeMetrics
  signature: TradeMetrics TradeSystem::GetGlobalTradeMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves comprehensive global trade statistics and metrics from the trading
    system.
  description: The GetGlobalTradeMetrics method aggregates and returns detailed trade
    data across the entire game world. This includes information such as total transactions,
    revenue generated, item types traded most frequently, and other high-level trading
    analytics. The returned TradeMetrics object encapsulates these values in a structured
    format for use in reporting, monitoring, or administrative functions within the
    TrinityCore framework. This method is typically used by game administrators, developers,
    or monitoring systems to gain insights into global economic activity.
  parameters: []
  returns: A TradeMetrics object containing aggregated trade statistics including
    transaction counts, total value, most traded items, and other relevant metrics
    across the entire game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'TradeMetrics globalMetrics = tradeSystem.GetGlobalTradeMetrics();

      std::cout << "Total Transactions: " << globalMetrics.totalTransactions << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Total Revenue: " << globalMetrics.totalRevenue << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Metrics for Reporting
    code: "TradeMetrics metrics = tradeSystem.GetGlobalTradeMetrics();\nif (metrics.totalTransactions\
      \ > 0) {\n    float avgTransactionValue = metrics.totalRevenue / metrics.totalTransactions;\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Average Transaction Value: \" << avgTransactionValue <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve significant computation and database access to aggregate
    global trade data. It should be called sparingly in performance-critical sections
    of code. The returned metrics are snapshots at the time of the call and may not
    reflect real-time trading activity.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently can cause performance degradation due to
    its potential for heavy data aggregation. Avoid using it in high-frequency loops
    or per-player update contexts. The TradeMetrics object should be copied rather
    than referenced if used across different threads.
