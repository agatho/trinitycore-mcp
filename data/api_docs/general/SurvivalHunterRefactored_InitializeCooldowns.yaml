documentation:
  brief: Initializes cooldown tracking for all hunter abilities and talents.
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up the internal cooldown tracking
    system for a Survival Hunter character. This method is typically called during
    character initialization or when switching to the Survival talent tree. It ensures
    that all relevant abilities, including basic attacks, pet actions, and specialized
    hunter skills, have their cooldown states properly initialized. The method configures
    default cooldown values for abilities like Aimed Shot, Steady Shot, and other
    survival-oriented talents, ensuring accurate tracking of when each ability can
    be used again. This initialization is crucial for maintaining proper gameplay
    balance and preventing incorrect ability usage during combat scenarios.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'SurvivalHunterRefactored hunter;

      hunter.InitializeCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the hunter's initialization
    phase. Repeated calls may result in unexpected cooldown behavior or reset existing
    cooldown timers. The method internally manages all cooldown states and does not
    require external parameter input.
  warnings: Do not call this method during active combat as it may interfere with
    ongoing cooldown tracking. This method should only be invoked when the hunter
    is in a non-combat state to ensure proper initialization of cooldown values.
