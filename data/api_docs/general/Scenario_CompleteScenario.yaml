documentation:
  brief: Completes the current scenario for the player, rewarding achievements and
    updating quest progress.
  description: The CompleteScenario method finalizes the active scenario by marking
    it as completed for the player. This action typically triggers reward distribution
    including experience points, currency, and item rewards. The method ensures that
    all scenario-related objectives are properly accounted for and updates the player's
    scenario completion statistics. It also handles cleanup of scenario-specific data
    and may trigger related quest events or achievements. This method should only
    be called when a scenario is genuinely finished and all required conditions have
    been met.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Scenario Completion
    code: "void Player::OnScenarioComplete()\n{\n    if (m_activeScenario)\n     \
      \   m_activeScenario->CompleteScenario();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally handles the synchronization of scenario data with
    the player's database records. It is recommended to call this only after verifying
    that all scenario objectives have been successfully completed by the player. The
    method may also trigger additional events such as updating the player's achievement
    progress and sending scenario completion messages to the client.
  warnings: Calling CompleteScenario without proper validation of scenario completion
    conditions may result in inconsistent game state or missing rewards. This method
    should not be invoked during active scenario progression as it may interfere with
    ongoing quest tracking or objective updates.
