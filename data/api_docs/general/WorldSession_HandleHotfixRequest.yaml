documentation:
  brief: Processes a hotfix request packet from the client to synchronize game data.
  description: The HandleHotfixRequest method is responsible for processing incoming
    hotfix requests from players' clients. In World of Warcraft, hotfixes are used
    to update game data dynamically without requiring a full client or server restart.
    This method receives a HotfixRequest packet containing information about which
    data the client needs updated and responds by sending the appropriate hotfixed
    data back to the player. The method typically handles requests for various game
    systems such as spell definitions, item templates, creature data, and other dynamic
    content that may be modified through hotfixes.
  parameters:
  - name: hotfixQuery
    description: A reference to a WorldPackets::Hotfix::HotfixRequest packet containing
      the client's request for specific game data updates. This packet includes identifiers
      for the type of data being requested and any relevant context information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic hotfix request handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleHotfixRequest(WorldPackets::Hotfix::HotfixRequest&\
      \ hotfixQuery)\n{\n    // Process the hotfix request\n    SendHotfixData(hotfixQuery.GetHotfixId());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's dynamic data synchronization system.
    It should only be called when a valid hotfix request packet is received from the
    client. The implementation typically involves checking if the requested hotfix
    data exists and then sending it back to the player using appropriate network packets.
  warnings: Improper handling of hotfix requests may lead to data inconsistencies
    or client disconnections. Ensure that all hotfix data sent to clients is valid
    and properly formatted according to the game's data structures.
