  class: LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter
  method: SpawnBot
  signature: bool LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter::SpawnBot(const int & request)
documentation:
  brief: Spawns a legacy bot using the provided request identifier.
  description: The SpawnBot method attempts to create and initialize a legacy bot
    instance within the game world based on the specified request parameter. This
    method is typically used in automated testing or bot management systems within
    TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft servers. It handles the allocation of necessary
    resources, configuration of bot attributes, and integration into the server's
    active player list. The method returns true upon successful spawning and false
    if the operation fails due to invalid parameters, resource constraints, or other
    internal errors.
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: An integer identifier that specifies which bot configuration to use
      for spawning. This value typically corresponds to a predefined bot template
      or profile index within the legacy bot system.
  returns: True if the bot was successfully spawned and initialized; false otherwise.
    Failure may occur due to invalid request ID, insufficient memory, or server-side
    restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Spawning
    code: "LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter spawner;\nbool success = spawner.SpawnBot(42);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Bot successfully spawned\n} else {\n    // Handle spawning\
      \ failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Bot Spawning
    code: "LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter spawner;\nint botRequestID = GetNextBotRequest();\n\
      if (botRequestID > 0) {\n    bool result = spawner.SpawnBot(botRequestID);\n\
      \    if (!result) {\n        sLog->outError(\"Failed to spawn bot with request\
      \ ID: %d\", botRequestID);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter has been properly initialized
    and configured before use. It may perform blocking operations during resource
    allocation, so it should be called carefully in performance-sensitive contexts.
    The request parameter must map to a valid bot configuration defined within the
    server's legacy bot system.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the spawner adapter
    or with invalid request IDs can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure
    that all required dependencies and configurations are loaded before invoking this
    method.
