  class: SpellScript
  method: IsInHitPhase
  signature: bool SpellScript::IsInHitPhase() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell script is currently in the hit phase of execution.
  description: The IsInHitPhase method checks if the current spell script execution
    is occurring during the hit phase, which typically happens after the spell has
    been cast and before damage or effects are applied. This phase is crucial for
    spell scripts that need to modify or react to the outcome of a successful hit.
    The method returns true when the script is executing within this specific phase,
    and false otherwise. It's commonly used in custom spell implementations where
    timing-sensitive logic must be executed only during the hit processing stage.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell script is currently executing within the hit
    phase; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell script
    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleHit()\n\
      \    {\n        if (IsInHitPhase())\n        {\n            // Execute logic\
      \ specific to hit phase\n            PreventHit();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used within the context of spell script execution
    and should only be called from within a SpellScript implementation. The hit phase
    occurs after initial spell validation but before actual damage application or
    effect processing.
