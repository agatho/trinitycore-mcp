  class: BalanceDruid
  method: UpdateCooldowns
  signature: void BalanceDruid::UpdateCooldowns(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown timers for Balance Druid abilities.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method is responsible for managing and updating
    the cooldown states of all applicable abilities for a Balance Druid character.
    This method is typically called during each update cycle to decrement active cooldown
    timers and reset them when they expire, ensuring proper ability usage mechanics
    within the game. It handles the internal tracking of cooldowns and ensures that
    abilities become available again once their cooldown periods have elapsed. The
    method operates on the provided time delta (diff) to accurately progress cooldown
    states.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time delta in milliseconds since the last update cycle, used
      to advance cooldown timers proportionally.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void WorldSession::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Player* player = GetPlayer())\n\
      \    {\n        if (player->GetClass() == CLASS_DRUID && player->GetSubClass()\
      \ == SUBCLASS_DRUID_BALANCE)\n        {\n            BalanceDruid* druid = static_cast<BalanceDruid*>(player);\n\
      \            druid->UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be invoked regularly, typically every game tick or update
    cycle, to ensure accurate cooldown progression. It's important that the diff parameter
    accurately reflects elapsed time for proper cooldown behavior.
  warnings: Do not call this method without a valid player context or with incorrect
    time deltas, as it may cause unexpected cooldown behavior or ability unavailability.
