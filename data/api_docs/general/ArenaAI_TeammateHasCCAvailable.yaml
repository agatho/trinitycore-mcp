  signature: bool ArenaAI::TeammateHasCCAvailable(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if any teammate in the arena has a crowd control ability available.
  description: The TeammateHasCCAvailable method determines whether any player on
    the same team as the AI-controlled unit has an available crowd control (CC) ability.
    This is used in arena combat to help the AI make strategic decisions about when
    to use abilities or avoid certain actions. The method iterates through teammates
    and evaluates their current state to determine if they possess usable CC abilities.
    It returns true if at least one teammate has a CC ability that can be used, and
    false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for arena AI behavior and team
    coordination strategies.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if any teammate has an available crowd control ability; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Arena Combat
    code: "if (arenaAI->TeammateHasCCAvailable()) {\n    // Avoid using CC abilities\
      \ or prepare for counter-CC\n    unit->CastSpell(target, SPELL_COUNTER_CC, true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Strategic Decision Making
    code: "if (!arenaAI->TeammateHasCCAvailable()) {\n    // Proceed with aggressive\
      \ strategy since no team CC available\n    arenaAI->AttackStart(target);\n}\
      \ else {\n    // Wait for better opportunity or reposition\n    arenaAI->DoNotAttack();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in arena AI logic to make tactical decisions.
    It may not account for cooldowns or specific spell restrictions beyond basic availability
    checks. The implementation likely relies on internal team state tracking and ability
    availability flags.
  warnings: The method assumes that teammates are properly initialized and tracked
    within the AI system. If called before proper initialization, it may return incorrect
    results. Also, this method does not consider the actual cooldown or mana cost
    of abilities, only their availability in the player's current state.
