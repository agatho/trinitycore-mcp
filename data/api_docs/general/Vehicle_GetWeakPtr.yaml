documentation:
  brief: Returns the weak pointer identifier of the vehicle
  description: The GetWeakPtr method retrieves the weak pointer value associated with
    the vehicle instance. In TrinityCore's object management system, vehicles are
    tracked using both strong and weak pointers to manage object lifecycle and prevent
    memory leaks. This method specifically returns the weak pointer identifier which
    is used internally by the framework for reference tracking and cleanup operations.
    The returned value typically represents an internal index or handle used by the
    core engine to identify and manage vehicle objects within its object registry.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the weak pointer identifier of the vehicle instance.
    This value serves as an internal handle used by TrinityCore's object management
    system for tracking vehicle references and ensuring proper cleanup during object
    destruction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve vehicle weak pointer
    code: 'Vehicle* vehicle = ...; // Assume vehicle is initialized

      int weakPtr = vehicle->GetWeakPtr();

      // weakPtr now contains the internal weak pointer identifier for this vehicle'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by TrinityCore's object management
    system. The returned integer value should not be used for direct manipulation
    or comparison outside of the core framework. It's designed to support reference
    counting and garbage collection mechanisms within the engine.
