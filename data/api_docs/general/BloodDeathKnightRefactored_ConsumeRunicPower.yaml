  class: BloodDeathKnightRefactored
  method: ConsumeRunicPower
  signature: void BloodDeathKnightRefactored::ConsumeRunicPower(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes the specified amount of runic power from the Blood Death Knight's
    resource pool.
  description: The ConsumeRunicPower method reduces the current runic power of a Blood
    Death Knight by the specified amount. This is typically used when executing abilities
    that require runic power consumption, such as Blood Strike or Blood Boil. The
    method ensures that the player cannot consume more runic power than is currently
    available, and will not allow negative runic power values. This method directly
    affects the character's resource management system within the context of Death
    Knight gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of runic power to consume from the Death Knight's resource
      pool. Must be a non-negative integer value representing the runic power cost
      of an ability or effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Runic Power Consumption
    code: 'BloodDeathKnightRefactored* dk = ...;

      dk->ConsumeRunicPower(10);

      // Consumes 10 runic power from the Death Knight'
    language: cpp
  - title: Consuming Runic Power Before Ability Execution
    code: "BloodDeathKnightRefactored* dk = ...;\nif (dk->GetRunicPower() >= 25)\n\
      {\n    dk->ConsumeRunicPower(25);\n    // Execute Blood Strike ability\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the Death Knight has sufficient runic
    power available. The implementation likely includes bounds checking to prevent
    negative runic power values. This method is part of the core resource management
    system for Death Knights in TrinityCore.
  warnings: Calling this method with an amount greater than the current runic power
    will not result in error, but will consume all available runic power. Ensure proper
    validation before calling to avoid unintended behavior in ability execution logic.
