  signature: int ClassAIFactory::CreateMonkAI(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a new Monk AI instance for a bot character.
  description: The CreateMonkAI method is responsible for instantiating a new Monk
    AI behavior controller for a bot character within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method allocates memory for the AI component, sets up the necessary configuration
    parameters, and initializes the AI's core functionality specific to the Monk class.
    The method returns an integer status code indicating success or failure of the
    operation. It is typically invoked during bot creation or when switching class
    roles for a bot character. The AI implementation follows World of Warcraft's class-specific
    mechanics including ability usage, combat strategies, and resource management
    tailored for Monk gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot identifier or index in
      the system. This parameter is used to associate the newly created AI with a
      specific bot instance.
  returns: Returns 0 on successful creation of the Monk AI, or a non-zero error code
    indicating failure during the AI initialization process. Possible error codes
    may include memory allocation failures, invalid bot identifiers, or class-specific
    configuration errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Monk AI Creation
    code: "int botId = 5;\nint result = factory->CreateMonkAI(&botId);\nif (result\
      \ == 0) {\n    printf(\"Monk AI created successfully for bot %d\\n\", botId);\n\
      } else {\n    printf(\"Failed to create Monk AI, error code: %d\\n\", result);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monk AI Creation with Error Handling
    code: "int botId = 10;\nint* botPtr = &botId;\nint status = factory->CreateMonkAI(botPtr);\n\
      \nswitch (status) {\n    case 0:\n        printf(\"Monk AI successfully initialized\
      \ for bot %d\\n\", *botPtr);\n        break;\n    case -1:\n        printf(\"\
      Invalid bot identifier provided\\n\");\n        break;\n    case -2:\n     \
      \   printf(\"Memory allocation failed for Monk AI\\n\");\n        break;\n \
      \   default:\n        printf(\"Unknown error occurred during Monk AI creation:\
      \ %d\\n\", status);\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot identifier passed in the 'bot' parameter
    is valid and corresponds to an existing bot instance. The AI implementation may
    require additional setup or configuration after calling this method, particularly
    for class-specific abilities and spell selection. Performance considerations include
    memory allocation overhead during AI creation, which should be taken into account
    when creating multiple bots simultaneously.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null pointer for the 'bot' parameter will likely
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the bot identifier is valid
    and that sufficient system resources are available before invoking this method.
    The returned status code must be checked to ensure proper AI initialization before
    attempting to use the AI functionality.
