documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a Paladin AI for the specified bot player
  description: The CreatePaladinAI method is responsible for instantiating and setting
    up a Paladin-specific artificial intelligence behavior for a given bot player
    within the TrinityCore framework. This method likely configures the bot's combat
    tactics, spell usage patterns, and role-specific actions tailored to the Paladin
    class. The method operates within the EnhancedBotAI system which extends standard
    AI capabilities for NPC bots in World of Warcraft. It may involve initializing
    various Paladin-specific subsystems such as holy power management, defensive abilities,
    and offensive spells. The method returns an integer status code indicating success
    or failure of the AI creation process.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value where 0 typically indicates successful AI creation,
    while non-zero values may represent various error conditions such as invalid player
    reference, unsupported class, or resource allocation failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Paladin AI Creation
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Get reference to bot player\nint result = factory->CreatePaladinAI(bot);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // AI successfully created for the paladin bot\n   \
      \ // Bot can now perform Paladin-specific actions\n} else {\n    // Handle AI\
      \ creation failure\n    // Log error or retry logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the EnhancedBotAI system which extends TrinityCore's
    standard AI capabilities. The implementation likely involves complex state machine
    management for Paladin-specific abilities including judgment, divine protection,
    and holy light usage. Developers should ensure that the Player object passed is
    valid and represents a bot with a Paladin class before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-bot player or a player without the Paladin
    class may result in undefined behavior or crashes. The method assumes proper initialization
    of the AI subsystem and may fail if required resources are not available. Always
    validate the return value to ensure successful AI creation before attempting to
    use the bot's enhanced AI capabilities.
