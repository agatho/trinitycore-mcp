  class: GuildBankManager
  method: DepositDuplicateEquipment
  signature: void GuildBankManager::DepositDuplicateEquipment(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Deposits duplicate equipment from a player's inventory into the guild bank.
  description: The DepositDuplicateEquipment method transfers any duplicate items
    (items that exist in both the player's inventory and the guild bank) from the
    player's personal inventory into the guild bank storage. This function is typically
    invoked when a player attempts to deposit items into the guild bank, ensuring
    that only unique items are added while duplicates are handled according to guild
    banking rules. The method operates on a single player identified by the provided
    pointer and modifies both the player's inventory and the guild bank contents accordingly.
    It does not return any value but may trigger internal state changes within the
    GuildBankManager class.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter identifies which player's inventory will be processed
      for duplicate item deposits.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildBankManager bankManager;

      bankManager.DepositDuplicateEquipment(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player's inventory and guild bank state are
    consistent. It is expected to be called during a player's interaction with the
    guild bank interface, such as when they attempt to deposit items. The actual logic
    for determining duplicates and transferring items may involve internal checks
    against item GUIDs or other identifiers.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed is valid and points to an active
    player object; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. This method should only
    be called in contexts where guild banking operations are permitted and the guild
    bank is properly initialized.
