  class: ObstacleUtils
  method: WillPathsIntersect
  signature: bool ObstacleUtils::WillPathsIntersect(const int & start1, const int
    & end1, const int & start2, const int & end2, float & intersectionTime)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether two paths will intersect within a specified time frame.
  description: The WillPathsIntersect method evaluates if two linear paths, defined
    by their start and end points, will intersect at some point in time. It calculates
    the intersection time and returns true if the paths intersect within a valid timeframe,
    otherwise false. This functionality is commonly used in AI pathfinding and obstacle
    avoidance systems to predict collisions or interactions between moving entities
    in the game world. The method assumes constant velocity along each path and uses
    vector mathematics to compute the intersection point and time.
  parameters:
  - name: start1
    description: The starting point of the first path (typically x-coordinate)
  - name: end1
    description: The ending point of the first path (typically x-coordinate)
  - name: start2
    description: The starting point of the second path (typically x-coordinate)
  - name: end2
    description: The ending point of the second path (typically x-coordinate)
  - name: intersectionTime
    description: Output parameter that receives the calculated intersection time if
      paths intersect; undefined if they do not intersect
  returns: True if the two paths will intersect within a valid timeframe, false otherwise.
    The intersection time is returned in the output parameter when true.
  examples:
  - title: Basic path intersection check
    code: 'int start1 = 0, end1 = 10;

      int start2 = 5, end2 = 15;

      float intersectionTime;

      bool result = ObstacleUtils::WillPathsIntersect(start1, end1, start2, end2,
      intersectionTime);

      // Result will be true if paths intersect

      // intersectionTime contains the time of intersection'
    language: cpp
  - title: Path intersection with collision avoidance
    code: "int playerStart = 0, playerEnd = 100;\nint enemyStart = 50, enemyEnd =\
      \ 150;\nfloat collisionTime;\nif (ObstacleUtils::WillPathsIntersect(playerStart,\
      \ playerEnd, enemyStart, enemyEnd, collisionTime)) {\n    // Handle potential\
      \ collision\n    printf(\"Potential collision at time: %f\\n\", collisionTime);\n\
      } else {\n    // No collision expected\n    printf(\"No collision expected\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simplified 1D intersection calculation. For accurate
    2D or 3D path intersections, additional coordinate handling would be required.
    The implementation assumes linear movement with constant velocity along each path
    segment.
  warnings: The method may return false positives or negatives if the paths are not
    truly linear or if entities move non-uniformly. Ensure that start and end points
    represent valid coordinates for your use case. The intersectionTime parameter
    is only valid when the method returns true.
