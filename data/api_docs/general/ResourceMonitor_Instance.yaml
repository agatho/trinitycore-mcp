documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the ResourceMonitor class
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the ResourceMonitor
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the monitor exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method provides global access to the resource monitoring functionality,
    which tracks various system resources such as memory usage, CPU load, and performance
    metrics. The returned reference allows direct manipulation and querying of the
    resource monitor's state without requiring explicit instantiation. This is commonly
    used in TrinityCore for system diagnostics, performance optimization, and resource
    management across different subsystems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the single instance of the ResourceMonitor class. This reference
    can be used to access all public methods and properties of the monitor without
    creating additional instances.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Resource Monitor for Performance Query
    code: 'ResourceMonitor& monitor = ResourceMonitor::Instance();

      uint32 memoryUsage = monitor.GetMemoryUsage();

      uint32 cpuLoad = monitor.GetCPULoad();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Resource Monitor in Server Maintenance Context
    code: "ResourceMonitor& monitor = ResourceMonitor::Instance();\nif (monitor.GetMemoryUsage()\
      \ > 800000000) // 800MB threshold\n{\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_SERVER_LOADING,\
      \ \"High memory usage detected: %u MB\", monitor.GetMemoryUsage() / 1024 / 1024);\n\
      \    // Trigger cleanup or alert mechanisms\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it uses a static instance that's initialized
    once during program startup. The singleton pattern ensures consistent access to
    resource monitoring data across all threads and subsystems. Developers should
    be aware that modifying the monitor's state through this reference affects global
    resource tracking throughout the application.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, excessive reliance on global state can make
    code harder to test and maintain. Avoid creating multiple instances or storing
    references to the singleton in multiple locations as it may lead to unexpected
    behavior when monitoring data changes.
