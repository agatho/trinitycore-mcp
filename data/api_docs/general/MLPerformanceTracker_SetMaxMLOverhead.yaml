  class: MLPerformanceTracker
  method: SetMaxMLOverhead
  signature: void MLPerformanceTracker::SetMaxMLOverhead(float percentCPU)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum allowed CPU overhead percentage for machine learning operations
    within the performance tracker.
  description: The SetMaxMLOverhead method configures the upper limit of CPU resources
    that can be consumed by machine learning processes tracked by this MLPerformanceTracker
    instance. This value represents a percentage of total CPU time and is used to
    enforce resource limits and prevent excessive utilization of system resources
    during ML computations. The method updates an internal threshold that may be checked
    during performance monitoring or when scheduling ML tasks. This setting is particularly
    relevant in TrinityCore's context where performance tracking and resource management
    are critical for maintaining server stability and player experience quality.
  parameters:
  - name: percentCPU
    description: The maximum CPU overhead percentage allowed for machine learning
      operations. Valid values are typically between 0.0 and 100.0, where 0.0 disables
      ML processing and 100.0 allows full CPU utilization. Values outside this range
      may be clamped or cause undefined behavior.
  returns: None
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum ML Overhead to 25%
    code: 'MLPerformanceTracker tracker;

      tracker.SetMaxMLOverhead(25.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disabling ML Overhead Limitation
    code: 'MLPerformanceTracker tracker;

      tracker.SetMaxMLOverhead(100.0f); // Allow full CPU usage for ML'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates an internal configuration value that affects how
    the performance tracker monitors and controls machine learning workload. The actual
    enforcement of this limit may depend on other system components or policies within
    TrinityCore's architecture.
  warnings: Setting this value too high may cause performance degradation or instability
    in the server due to excessive CPU consumption by ML processes. Setting it to
    zero effectively disables all ML operations tracked by this instance.
