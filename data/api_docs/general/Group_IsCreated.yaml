  method: IsCreated
  signature: bool Group::IsCreated() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the group has been fully initialized and is ready for
    use.
  description: The IsCreated method checks if a Group object has been properly initialized
    and is in a valid state for operations. This typically means that the group has
    been created with proper parameters, its internal data structures are set up correctly,
    and it can safely be used for player management, communication, or other group-related
    functionality. The method returns true when the group is fully functional and
    false if it's in an uninitialized or invalid state. This check is important in
    TrinityCore's group management system to prevent operations on malformed group
    objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group has been successfully created and initialized,
    allowing safe use of its methods. Returns false if the group is not yet initialized
    or is in an invalid state, indicating that operations on this group should be
    avoided until it's properly created.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Group Creation Status
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && group->IsCreated()) {\n\
      \    // Safe to perform group operations\n    sWorld->SendGlobalGMSysMessage(\"\
      Group is ready for use.\");\n} else {\n    // Group not yet created or invalid\n\
      \    sWorld->SendGlobalGMSysMessage(\"Group is not ready.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore's group management
    system to validate group state before performing operations. It may check internal
    flags or member variables that indicate whether the group object has completed
    its construction process and has valid data.
