  class: MovementRequest
  method: SetAllowInterrupt
  signature: MovementRequest & MovementRequest::SetAllowInterrupt(bool allow)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the movement request allows interruption by other actions.
  description: The SetAllowInterrupt method configures whether a MovementRequest can
    be interrupted by external events or actions during execution. This is commonly
    used in AI behavior systems where certain movements should not be disrupted, such
    as while casting spells or performing critical actions. The method returns a reference
    to the current MovementRequest object to enable method chaining. This setting
    affects how the movement system handles priority and interruption logic for the
    associated movement action.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current MovementRequest object, enabling method chaining.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MovementRequest request;

      request.SetAllowInterrupt(false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Method Chaining
    code: 'MovementRequest request;

      request.SetAllowInterrupt(true).SetSpeed(3.5f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with movement AI logic where
    interruption control is important for maintaining consistent behavior during complex
    actions. The setting may influence how the server handles movement priority queues
    and whether other systems can preempt this movement request.
