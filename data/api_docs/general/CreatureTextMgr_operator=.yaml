  signature: CreatureTextMgr & CreatureTextMgr::operator=(CreatureTextMgr && param0)
documentation:
  brief: Moves ownership of a CreatureTextMgr object to another CreatureTextMgr object.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment operation on the CreatureTextMgr
    class, transferring all resources and state from the source object (param0) to
    the current object. This is a standard C++ move semantics implementation that
    efficiently transfers ownership without deep copying. The method is typically
    used when assigning one CreatureTextMgr instance to another, particularly in scenarios
    involving temporary objects or when optimizing resource management. In the context
    of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server implementation, this allows efficient
    handling of creature text managers during object lifecycle management and resource
    cleanup.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to another CreatureTextMgr object whose resources
      will be moved to the current object. This parameter represents the source of
      the move operation.
  returns: A reference to the current CreatureTextMgr object after the move assignment
    has been completed, enabling chained assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'CreatureTextMgr manager1;

      CreatureTextMgr manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Uses operator=

      // manager1 is left in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Function Return with Move
    code: "CreatureTextMgr createManager() {\n    CreatureTextMgr mgr;\n    // ...\
      \ populate manager ...\n    return mgr; // Move semantics used for return\n\
      }\n\nCreatureTextMgr mainManager = createManager(); // Uses operator= for assignment"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method implements move semantics which is crucial for performance optimization
    in C++ when dealing with objects that manage resources. The moved-from object
    (param0) should not be used after the operation, as its state becomes valid but
    unspecified. This is a standard pattern in modern C++ and follows the rule of
    five principles.
  warnings: After calling this operator, the source object (param0) should not be
    accessed or used, as it has been moved from and is left in a valid but unspecified
    state. Using the moved-from object may lead to undefined behavior.
