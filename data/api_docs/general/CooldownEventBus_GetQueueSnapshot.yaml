  class: CooldownEventBus
  method: GetQueueSnapshot
  signature: int CooldownEventBus::GetQueueSnapshot() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current number of cooldown events queued for processing in
    the CooldownEventBus.
  description: The GetQueueSnapshot method provides a snapshot of the current size
    of the internal queue used by the CooldownEventBus to manage cooldown-related
    events. This method is typically used for debugging, performance monitoring, or
    to determine if the system is under heavy load from cooldown events. The returned
    integer represents the count of pending cooldown events that have not yet been
    processed. It's important to note that this value is a snapshot at the moment
    of calling and may change immediately after the method returns. This method does
    not modify any internal state and is safe to call from any thread, assuming proper
    synchronization mechanisms are in place for the CooldownEventBus itself.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of cooldown events currently queued
    for processing. A return value of zero indicates no pending cooldown events, while
    a positive integer indicates the count of queued events.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Queue Size
    code: "int queueSize = cooldownEventBus.GetQueueSnapshot();\nif (queueSize > 100)\n\
      {\n    // Log warning about high queue load\n    sLog->outString(\"Cooldown\
      \ event queue is high: %d events\", queueSize);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Queue Size for Performance Tuning
    code: "void MonitorCooldownQueue()\n{\n    static uint32 lastLogged = 0;\n   \
      \ uint32 now = getMSTime();\n    if (now - lastLogged > 5000) // Log every 5\
      \ seconds\n    {\n        int snapshot = sCooldownEventBus->GetQueueSnapshot();\n\
      \        if (snapshot > 500)\n        {\n            sLog->outString(\"High\
      \ cooldown queue load detected: %d events\", snapshot);\n        }\n       \
      \ lastLogged = now;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a non-blocking read of the queue size and should not
    be used for synchronization purposes. The CooldownEventBus may internally use
    thread-safe data structures, but calling this method does not guarantee atomicity
    with other operations on the same bus. For performance-critical applications,
    consider caching this value or using it sparingly to avoid overhead.
  warnings: This method returns a snapshot and is not guaranteed to reflect real-time
    queue status after the call. If you are using this for decision-making logic,
    be aware that the actual queue size may have changed by the time your code processes
    the result. Also, in high-frequency scenarios, frequent calls to this method might
    introduce unnecessary overhead.
