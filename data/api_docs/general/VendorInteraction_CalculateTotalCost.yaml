  class: VendorInteraction
  method: CalculateTotalCost
  signature: uint32 VendorInteraction::CalculateTotalCost(Player * bot, const int
    & items) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the total cost of items a player intends to purchase from a vendor.
  description: The CalculateTotalCost method computes the cumulative gold cost for
    all items a player wishes to buy from a vendor. It takes into account item prices,
    vendor sell factors, and any applicable discounts or taxes. This method is typically
    used during vendor interactions to determine how much gold the player needs to
    pay for their selected purchases. The method operates on a list of items identified
    by their unique identifiers and returns the total cost in copper coins.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or player interacting
      with the vendor.
  - name: items
    description: Reference to an integer value that identifies the items being purchased.
      This parameter likely represents a bitmask or index of items in the vendor's
      inventory.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the total cost in copper coins required
    to purchase all specified items from the vendor.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: uint32 totalCost = vendorInteraction.CalculateTotalCost(playerBot, itemIndex);
    language: cpp
  - title: Calculating Cost for Multiple Items
    code: "int itemsToBuy = 0x0F; // Example bitmask for 4 items\nuint32 totalCost\
      \ = vendorInteraction.CalculateTotalCost(playerBot, itemsToBuy);\nif (totalCost\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    playerBot->ModifyMoney(totalCost);\n    // Proceed with purchase\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may internally access vendor item data structures and player
    currency information. It assumes that the player has sufficient funds to cover
    the cost, though it does not validate this condition directly. The items parameter
    might be interpreted as a bitfield or array index depending on internal implementation
    details.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'items' parameter correctly maps to valid vendor inventory
    entries; invalid indices may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect calculations.
    This method should only be called during active vendor interaction sessions.
