  signature: float LearningAnalytics::GetConvergenceProgress(uint32_t botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the convergence progress percentage for a specified
    bot.
  description: The GetConvergenceProgress method computes the convergence progress
    of a learning bot identified by its GUID. Convergence progress represents how
    close the bot's learning process is to reaching a stable or optimal state, typically
    measured as a percentage value between 0.0 and 1.0. This metric is crucial for
    monitoring the effectiveness and efficiency of AI learning processes within the
    TrinityCore framework. The method performs internal calculations based on training
    data, neural network weights, and learning algorithm states to determine this
    progress value.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the convergence progress
    of the specified bot. A value of 0.0 indicates no progress made, while 1.0 indicates
    full convergence or completion of the learning process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'LearningAnalytics analytics;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      float progress = analytics.GetConvergenceProgress(botGuid);

      printf("Bot convergence progress: %.2f%%\n", progress * 100.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Learning Progress
    code: "LearningAnalytics analytics;\nuint32_t botGuid = 12345;\nfloat currentProgress\
      \ = analytics.GetConvergenceProgress(botGuid);\nif (currentProgress >= 0.95f)\
      \ {\n    printf(\"Bot has nearly converged.\\n\");\n} else if (currentProgress\
      \ >= 0.75f) {\n    printf(\"Bot is making good progress.\\n\");\n} else {\n\
      \    printf(\"Bot learning is in early stages.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot with the specified GUID exists and has an
    active learning process. The convergence calculation may involve complex mathematical
    operations including gradient descent metrics, loss function values, or other
    machine learning performance indicators. Performance of this method depends on
    the complexity of the bot's learning model and the amount of training data processed.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid is valid and corresponds to an existing
    learning bot in the system. Invalid GUIDs may result in undefined behavior or
    incorrect progress values. The convergence progress value should not be used as
    a direct indicator of learning quality, only as a measure of how far along the
    learning process has progressed.
