  signature: bool BotChatCommandHandler::ParseCommand(const std::string & message,
    CommandContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Parses a chat message to determine and execute a bot command.
  description: The ParseCommand method processes an incoming chat message to identify
    if it matches a recognized bot command. It analyzes the message structure, extracts
    relevant parameters, and invokes the appropriate command handler. This method
    is essential for enabling bot functionality within the TrinityCore framework by
    interpreting user input and translating it into actionable commands. The method
    returns true if a valid command was parsed and executed, or false if no matching
    command was found or an error occurred during processing.
  parameters:
  - name: message
    description: The chat message string to be parsed for bot commands. This should
      contain the full text of the command as entered by the user.
  - name: context
    description: The command execution context that provides information about the
      sender, target, and environment where the command is being executed.
  returns: Returns true if a valid bot command was successfully parsed and executed;
    otherwise returns false if no matching command was found or an error occurred
    during processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Command Parsing
    code: 'std::string message = "!help";

      CommandContext context;

      bool result = botChatHandler.ParseCommand(message, context);

      // Returns true if !help command is recognized and executed'
    language: cpp
  - title: Command with Parameters
    code: 'std::string message = "!move 100 200";

      CommandContext context;

      bool result = botChatHandler.ParseCommand(message, context);

      // Parses and executes a move command with coordinates as parameters'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the chat handling system when a message
    is received. It assumes that the message has already been validated for proper
    formatting and that the context contains valid sender information. The implementation
    may cache parsed command structures for performance optimization.
  warnings: Ensure that the CommandContext object passed to this method is properly
    initialized with valid sender data, as incorrect context can lead to unexpected
    behavior or security issues. Avoid passing malformed messages that could cause
    parsing errors.
