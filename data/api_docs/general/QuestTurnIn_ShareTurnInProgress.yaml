  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: ShareTurnInProgress
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::ShareTurnInProgress(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Shares quest turn-in progress with a group of players.
  description: The ShareTurnInProgress method broadcasts the current quest turn-in
    status to all members of the specified group. This functionality is typically
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to synchronize quest completion
    data among party or raid members. The method ensures that when one player completes
    a quest turn-in, other group members are notified and can update their local quest
    progress accordingly. It handles the communication aspect of shared quest progression
    within grouped gameplay scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing players who should receive
      the quest turn-in progress update. Must be a valid group instance; null pointer
      will result in undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest completion handler
    code: "void OnQuestComplete(Player* player, Quest* quest)\n{\n    Group* group\
      \ = player->GetGroup();\n    if (group)\n    {\n        QuestTurnIn turnIn;\n\
      \        turnIn.ShareTurnInProgress(group);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely sends network packets to update client-side quest data
    for all group members. It should only be called when the group is valid and contains
    players. The implementation may involve checking group member states and filtering
    out disconnected players.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer will cause a crash. Ensure
    that the group parameter is properly validated before calling. This method does
    not validate whether the quest turn-in actually succeeded; it only broadcasts
    the progress update.
