  signature: bool GroupCoordinator::IsGroupBalanced() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the group's player distribution is considered balanced
    according to game rules.
  description: The IsGroupBalanced method evaluates the current state of a group within
    TrinityCore to determine if it meets the criteria for being considered 'balanced.'
    This typically involves checking that players are distributed across appropriate
    roles (tank, healer, damage dealer) and levels in a way that maintains optimal
    gameplay dynamics. The method does not consider individual player performance
    but rather the overall composition and distribution of the group. It is commonly
    used by the GroupCoordinator to make decisions about group formation, raid allocation,
    or balancing mechanics during instance encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group's composition is considered balanced according
    to internal game logic; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Group Management
    code: "if (groupCoordinator->IsGroupBalanced()) {\n    // Proceed with normal\
      \ raid operations\n    sLog->outString(\"Group is balanced, proceeding with\
      \ encounter.\");\n} else {\n    // Attempt to rebalance or warn players\n  \
      \  sLog->outString(\"Warning: Group composition is unbalanced.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks on player class distribution, level ranges,
    and role assignments. It may also consider the presence of required roles such
    as tanks and healers. The exact criteria for balance are defined within the core
    TrinityCore logic and may be configurable via server settings.
