documentation:
  brief: Destroys the PlayerbotDatabaseManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the PlayerbotDatabaseManager class is responsible
    for properly cleaning up all allocated resources and ensuring that database connections
    are closed. This method is automatically invoked when a PlayerbotDatabaseManager
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures that any pending
    database transactions are committed or rolled back, and that all associated memory
    is freed to prevent memory leaks. In the context of TrinityCore's playerbot system,
    this destructor plays a critical role in maintaining clean state management for
    bot-related database operations.

  - title: Automatic destruction of PlayerbotDatabaseManager
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    PlayerbotDatabaseManager dbManager;\n    //\
      \ ... use dbManager ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when dbManager\
      \ goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and should not be
    invoked manually. It's important to ensure that all database operations are completed
    before the object is destroyed to avoid data inconsistency. The destructor may
    perform blocking operations while closing database connections.
