documentation:
  brief: Returns the text content of the item's book, if it is a book.
  description: The GetText method retrieves the textual content associated with an
    item that is classified as a book. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft
    to access the text content of books such as quest books or spell books. The returned
    string represents the full text content of the book, which may include multiple
    lines or paragraphs depending on the book's design. It is important to note that
    this method only applies to items with a specific item type (e.g., books) and
    will return an empty string for non-book items.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const reference to a std::string containing the full text content
    of the book item. If the item is not a book, the method returns an empty string.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(0, 0);\nif (item && item->GetText() !=\
      \ \"\") {\n    std::cout << \"Book text: \" << item->GetText() << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other item-related methods
    to determine if an item is a book and to retrieve its text content. It is thread-safe
    as long as the item object itself is not modified during execution.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method on items that are not known to be books,
    as it may return empty strings or cause undefined behavior if used incorrectly.
    Also, ensure that the item's type is checked before calling this method to avoid
    unnecessary overhead.
