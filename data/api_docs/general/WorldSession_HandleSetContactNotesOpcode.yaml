  brief: Sets notes for a contact in the player's social list
  description: Handles the client-side packet sent when a player wants to assign or
    modify notes associated with a specific contact in their social list. This method
    processes the incoming packet and updates the corresponding contact entry in the
    player's database record. The functionality allows players to add personal annotations
    to their friends, ignored players, or other contacts for easier identification.
    This operation typically occurs when a user right-clicks on a contact in the social
    panel and selects 'Set Note'.

  - title: Basic usage of setting contact note
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSetContactNotesOpcode(WorldPackets::Social::SetContactNotes&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Process the packet to update contact notes\n    Player*\
      \ player = GetPlayer();\n    if (!player)\n        return;\n    \n    // Retrieve\
      \ contact GUID and note from packet\n    ObjectGuid contactGuid = packet.Contact;\n\
      \    std::string note = packet.Note;\n    \n    // Update the contact note in\
      \ database\n    player->GetSocial()->SetContactNote(contactGuid, note);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the social system's database layer to
    persist contact notes. It assumes that the packet has been validated by the network
    layer and contains valid GUID and note data. The implementation should handle
    cases where the contact does not exist in the player's social list gracefully.
