  class: InRangeCheckCustomizer
  method: InRangeCheckCustomizer
  signature: void InRangeCheckCustomizer::InRangeCheckCustomizer(const int & obj,
    float range)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a custom range check for an object within a specified distance.
  description: The InRangeCheckCustomizer method sets up a custom range checking mechanism
    for a given object, allowing developers to define specific distance thresholds
    for interaction or visibility. This functionality is commonly used in World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to manage NPC behavior, player interactions,
    and object detection within game world boundaries. The method configures internal
    parameters that determine how the system evaluates whether an object falls within
    the specified range, which can be crucial for AI decision-making, quest triggers,
    or combat mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: obj
    description: Reference to the object identifier (typically a GUID) that will be
      checked against the range. This parameter specifies which object's proximity
      is being evaluated.
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance in yards within which the object is considered
      to be in range. Values should be positive floating-point numbers representing
      game world units.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Range Check Initialization
    code: 'InRangeCheckCustomizer customizer;

      ObjectGuid playerGuid = player->GetGUID();

      float checkRange = 10.0f;

      customizer.InRangeCheckCustomizer(playerGuid, checkRange);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with NPC AI for Detection
    code: "class CustomNPCAI : public ScriptedAI\n{\npublic:\n    void InitializeRangeCheck(Unit*\
      \ target)\n    {\n        InRangeCheckCustomizer customizer;\n        customizer.InRangeCheckCustomizer(target->GetGUID(),\
      \ 25.0f);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal state variables used by the range checking
    system. It should be called during initialization or when changing detection parameters.
    The range value is interpreted in game world units (yards), and values must be
    positive to ensure proper behavior.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the range parameter may lead to unexpected behavior
    in AI systems or object interactions. Ensure that the obj parameter refers to
    a valid existing object, as invalid GUIDs could cause undefined behavior or crashes.
