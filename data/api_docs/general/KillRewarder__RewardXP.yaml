  method: _RewardXP
  signature: void KillRewarder::_RewardXP(Player * player, float rate)
documentation:
  brief: Rewards experience points to a player based on kill-related criteria and
    rate multiplier.
  description: 'The _RewardXP method is responsible for calculating and distributing
    experience points to a Player object following a successful kill. It takes into
    account various factors such as the difficulty of the target, the player''s level,
    and a configurable rate multiplier. This method ensures that players receive appropriate
    XP rewards that align with game balance mechanics. The method modifies the player''s
    experience state directly without returning any value. Precondition: The Player
    pointer must be valid and the player must be in a state where XP can be awarded
    (e.g., not in a disabled zone or during a PvP cooldown). Postcondition: The player''s
    experience is updated according to the calculated reward.'
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object that will receive the experience points.
      Must be a valid, non-null pointer to an active player character.
  - name: rate
    description: A floating-point multiplier that adjusts the base XP reward amount.
      Values greater than 1 increase rewards, while values less than 1 decrease them.
      Typical values range from 0.5 to 3.0 depending on game context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic XP Reward Usage
    code: 'Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Assume valid player pointer

      float rewardRate = 1.5f;

      KillRewarder rewarder;

      rewarder._RewardXP(targetPlayer, rewardRate);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional XP Reward Based on Difficulty
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player pointer\nfloat difficultyMultiplier\
      \ = 2.0f;\nif (player->GetLevel() > 60)\n{\n    difficultyMultiplier = 1.2f;\n\
      }\nKillRewarder rewarder;\nrewarder._RewardXP(player, difficultyMultiplier);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine upon successful
    creature or player kills. It integrates with TrinityCore's experience system and
    may interact with quest completion checks or achievement systems. The actual XP
    calculation logic is not exposed in this method but is handled internally based
    on target type, player level, and server configuration.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null player pointer will result in undefined
    behavior or crash. Ensure that the player object is valid and active before calling
    this method. Using extremely high rate multipliers may cause unbalanced gameplay
    or overflow issues if not properly constrained by server settings.
