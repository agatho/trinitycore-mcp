  class: BotPacketRelay
  method: Shutdown
  signature: void BotPacketRelay::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Stops all active bot packet relays and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The Shutdown method terminates all ongoing bot packet relay operations
    within the BotPacketRelay system. It ensures that any active connections, pending
    packets, or background threads are properly terminated and cleaned up. This method
    is typically called during server shutdown or when deactivating bot functionality
    to prevent memory leaks and ensure clean resource deallocation. The method performs
    no parameter validation as it operates on the instance state and does not require
    external inputs.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'BotPacketRelay* relay = new BotPacketRelay();

      // ... perform bot packet relay operations ...

      relay->Shutdown();

      delete relay;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when no other threads are actively using
    the BotPacketRelay instance. Calling Shutdown while active relays are in progress
    may result in data loss or undefined behavior. The method assumes that all dependent
    resources have been properly managed by the calling code.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown on a BotPacketRelay instance that is currently processing
    packets may lead to incomplete packet delivery or corrupted state. Ensure all
    bot operations are suspended before invoking this method.
