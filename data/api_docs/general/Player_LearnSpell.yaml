documentation:
  brief: Teaches a player a spell, with optional dependencies and skill linking.
  description: The LearnSpell method allows a player to learn a specific spell from
    the game database. It supports various options including dependent spell learning,
    skill linking, and messaging suppression. The method handles both regular and
    dependent spells, and can be used to teach spells that are linked to skills or
    other dependencies. This functionality is essential for character progression
    and spell acquisition in World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: spell_id
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to be learned. This must correspond
      to a valid spell entry in the database.
  - name: dependent
    description: If true, the spell will be marked as dependent and may require other
      spells to be learned first. If false, the spell is learned directly without
      dependency consideration.
  - name: fromSkill
    description: Optional parameter indicating which skill the spell is linked to.
      If set to -1, no skill linking occurs. If set to 0 or higher, the spell will
      be linked to that skill.
  - name: suppressMessaging
    description: If true, no in-game messages are sent to the player when the spell
      is learned. If false, a message is displayed to inform the player of the new
      spell acquisition.
  - name: trait
    description: Optional parameter indicating which trait the spell belongs to. If
      set to -1, no trait assignment occurs. If set to 0 or higher, the spell will
      be assigned to that specific trait.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Learning Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->LearnSpell(12345, false, -1, false, -1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Spell Learning with Skill Linking
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->LearnSpell(67890, true, 123, true, 456);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method internally handles spell learning through the player's spellbook.
    It is important to note that this method does not check if the spell has already
    been learned by the player; it simply adds it to the player's known spells. The
    method also supports multiple spell types including passive and active spells,
    and can be used for both regular and dependent spell learning.
  warnings: This method should not be used to learn spells that are already known
    or that would cause conflicts with existing learned spells. It is recommended
    to verify spell existence before calling this method to avoid potential game crashes
    or unexpected behavior.
