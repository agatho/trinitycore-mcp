documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the internal recursive mutex used for thread-safe
    cache access in the ResourceCalculator.
  description: The GetCacheMutex method provides external access to the internal std::recursive_mutex
    that protects the ResourceCalculator's cache data structures. This mutex is essential
    for ensuring thread safety when multiple threads attempt to read from or write
    to the calculator's cached resource values. The returned reference allows callers
    to acquire and release the lock as needed, enabling safe concurrent access to
    shared resources. This method is typically used in scenarios where fine-grained
    control over locking is required, such as during complex calculations or when
    implementing custom cache management logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the std::recursive_mutex that guards access to the ResourceCalculator's
    internal cache. This mutex can be used to synchronize access to shared data structures
    within the calculator.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Mutex Usage
    code: 'ResourceCalculator calculator;

      std::lock_guard<std::recursive_mutex> lock(calculator.GetCacheMutex());

      // Critical section: safe access to cached resources

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Custom Cache Management
    code: "class CustomResourceHandler {\npublic:\n    void UpdateCache(ResourceCalculator&\
      \ calc) {\n        std::lock_guard<std::recursive_mutex> lock(calc.GetCacheMutex());\n\
      \        // Perform cache update operations safely\n        // Access and modify\
      \ cached values\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned mutex is a recursive mutex, which means it can be locked multiple
    times by the same thread without causing a deadlock. This is particularly useful
    in complex resource calculation scenarios where nested locking might occur. The
    mutex should only be used for protecting access to the calculator's internal cache
    and not for general-purpose synchronization.
  warnings: Using this method incorrectly can lead to race conditions or deadlocks.
    Always ensure proper lock acquisition and release patterns. Never hold the returned
    mutex for extended periods as it may block other threads from accessing cached
    resources. Be cautious when using recursive locking in complex call stacks.
