  method: _InitHit
  signature: void SpellScript::_InitHit()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes hit-related data for spell scripts.
  description: The _InitHit method prepares internal state variables and data structures
    required for processing spell hits. It is typically called during the spell execution
    phase to ensure that all necessary hit calculations and effects are properly initialized
    before the spell's main logic executes. This method sets up critical hit flags,
    damage multipliers, and other relevant parameters that influence how a spell interacts
    with its target. The initialization occurs at a specific point in the spell lifecycle,
    ensuring consistency across different spell implementations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Script
    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void _InitHit()\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Initialize hit data for custom spell logic\n \
      \       SpellScript::_InitHit();\n        // Additional custom initialization\
      \ can be added here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal spell script lifecycle and should not
    be called directly by custom spell implementations unless specifically required.
    It is automatically invoked during spell execution by the TrinityCore framework.
  warnings: Do not override or modify this method's behavior without understanding
    its impact on spell hit calculations. Incorrect handling may lead to inconsistent
    spell effects or unexpected gameplay behavior.
