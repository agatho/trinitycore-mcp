  class: RoleAssignment
  method: GetMissingRoles
  signature: int RoleAssignment::GetMissingRoles(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the number of missing roles in a group based on current
    role assignments.
  description: The GetMissingRoles method determines how many roles are currently
    unassigned within a specified group. It evaluates the existing role assignments
    and identifies any roles that are required but not yet filled. This method is
    typically used during group composition or role reassignment processes to ensure
    optimal team balance and functionality. The method does not modify the group's
    role assignments directly, but rather provides a count of missing roles for further
    processing or decision-making. It requires a valid Group pointer as input and
    will return zero if all roles are properly assigned or if the group is invalid.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of roles that are currently unassigned
    within the group. Returns 0 if all roles are filled, or if the provided group
    pointer is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Role Availability
    code: "Group* myGroup = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(groupId);\nif (myGroup)\n{\n \
      \   int missingRoles = roleAssignment.GetMissingRoles(myGroup);\n    if (missingRoles\
      \ > 0)\n    {\n        // Handle case where roles are missing\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      %d roles are missing in the group.\", missingRoles);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that role definitions and assignments follow standard
    TrinityCore group management conventions. The implementation may depend on internal
    role tracking mechanisms within the Group class. Performance is generally O(n)
    where n is the number of roles in the group.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed to this method is valid and not null,
    as passing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This
    method should only be called when the group state is stable and role assignments
    are expected to be consistent.
