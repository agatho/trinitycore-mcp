  method: Delayed
  signature: void Spell::Delayed()
documentation:
  brief: Pauses spell execution and schedules delayed processing for later completion.
  description: The Delayed method is used to temporarily suspend a spell's execution
    and schedule it for delayed processing, typically when a spell requires a delay
    before continuing its execution. This method is commonly used in spell handling
    logic where spells need to be postponed due to various game mechanics such as
    cooldowns, channeling, or other timing requirements. The method ensures that the
    spell's execution is properly deferred until the appropriate time, allowing for
    proper synchronization with game events and player actions.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Spell Delay Example
    code: "void Spell::Delayed()\n{\n    // Pause spell execution\n    // Schedule\
      \ delayed processing\n    // Continue after delay\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    to manage timing and execution flow. It may be called during spell casting or
    channeling processes where delays are required.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect spell execution timing,
    potentially causing game mechanics issues or player behavior anomalies.
