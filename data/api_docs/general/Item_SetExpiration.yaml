  signature: void Item::SetExpiration(uint32 expiration)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the expiration time for an item.
  description: This method configures the expiration duration for an item, determining
    how long the item will remain active before it expires. The expiration is typically
    measured in seconds and affects items with limited duration such as temporary
    enchantments or consumable items. This method is commonly used in conjunction
    with item creation and management within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: expiration
    description: The expiration time in seconds, representing how long the item will
      remain active before it expires.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set expiration for a temporary enchantment
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SetExpiration(3600); // Sets expiration to 1 hour'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method directly modifies the item's expiration time without affecting
    its actual functionality. It should be used carefully when dealing with items
    that have specific expiration behaviors, such as temporary enchantments or consumables.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to items that expire unexpectedly
    or remain active longer than intended. Care must be taken when setting expiration
    values for items that are part of a player's inventory or quest rewards.
