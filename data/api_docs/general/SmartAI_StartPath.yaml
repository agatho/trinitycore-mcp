  class: SmartAI
  method: StartPath
  signature: void SmartAI::StartPath(uint32 pathId, bool repeat, Unit * invoker, uint32
    nodeId, int param4)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates execution of a specified path for the SmartAI instance, optionally
    repeating it and invoking from a specific node.
  description: The StartPath method begins execution of a predefined path within the
    SmartAI system. It allows for controlling how the path is executed, including
    whether it should repeat after completion and from which node to start. The invoker
    parameter specifies the unit that triggered the path execution, which can be used
    for context-aware behavior. This method is typically used in conjunction with
    path data defined in the database or through scripting systems within TrinityCore's
    AI framework.
  parameters:
  - name: pathId
    description: Identifier of the path to start. Must correspond to a valid path
      defined in the database or script system.
  - name: repeat
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the path should loop after reaching
      its end. True enables looping, false disables it.
  - name: invoker
    description: Pointer to the Unit that triggered this path execution. Can be null
      if no specific invoker is provided.
  - name: nodeId
    description: Starting node ID within the path. If set to 0, the path starts from
      the beginning.
  - name: param4
    description: Additional parameter for custom behavior or context-specific logic.
      Meaning depends on implementation details of the specific path or AI script.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Start
    code: smartAI->StartPath(12345, false, nullptr, 0, 0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Looping Path with Invoker
    code: 'Unit* player = ...; // Get a reference to a player

      smartAI->StartPath(67890, true, player, 1, 42);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the path data is already loaded and available in
    the system. The behavior may vary depending on how the path was defined in the
    database or script files. Ensure that the pathId corresponds to an existing path,
    otherwise the method might silently fail or behave unexpectedly.
  warnings: Passing an invalid pathId can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always
    validate path existence before calling StartPath. Be cautious when using repeat=true
    with paths that do not have a clear end condition as it may cause infinite loops.
