  method: IsDangerous
  signature: bool TargetScanner::IsDangerous(Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a target unit poses a threat or danger to the scanner's
    current context.
  description: The IsDangerous method evaluates whether a given Unit target presents
    a significant risk or threat within the context of the TargetScanner's current
    state. This typically involves checking factors such as the target's aggro level,
    combat status, threat modifiers, and potential for harmful actions. The method
    is commonly used in AI decision-making processes to prioritize targets that are
    more likely to cause harm or require immediate attention. It serves as a key component
    in determining threat assessment and targeting behavior for NPC characters and
    creatures within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target unit is considered dangerous based on current
    threat assessment criteria, false otherwise. The evaluation considers factors
    like target's combat readiness, threat level, and potential offensive capabilities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Assessment
    code: "if (scanner.IsDangerous(targetUnit)) {\n    // Handle dangerous target\n\
      \    AI->SetTarget(targetUnit);\n    AI->Attack();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Target Selection
    code: "Unit* dangerousTarget = nullptr;\nfor (auto& target : targetList) {\n \
      \   if (scanner.IsDangerous(target)) {\n        dangerousTarget = target;\n\
      \        break;\n    }\n}\nif (dangerousTarget) {\n    scanner.SetTarget(dangerousTarget);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely integrates with the creature's threat table and aggro
    system. It may consider target faction, combat state, and current threat level.
    The implementation might be context-sensitive and could vary based on the scanner's
    role (e.g., melee vs ranged AI).
  warnings: The method should not be used in performance-critical sections without
    proper caching of results, as threat calculations can involve multiple subsystems.
    Ensure that target units are valid before calling this method to avoid potential
    crashes.
