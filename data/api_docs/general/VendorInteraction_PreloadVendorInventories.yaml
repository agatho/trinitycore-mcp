documentation:
  brief: Preloads vendor inventories for a player to optimize item retrieval during
    interaction.
  description: The PreloadVendorInventories method prepares and loads all relevant
    item data for a specified player's vendor interactions. This includes fetching
    items from the database, caching them in memory, and ensuring that the player's
    vendor session has access to up-to-date inventory information without requiring
    additional database queries during active trading. The method is typically invoked
    before a vendor interaction begins to reduce latency and improve performance.
    It ensures that all items available for purchase or sale are pre-fetched and ready
    for immediate access.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      VendorInteraction vendorInteraction;

      vendorInteraction.PreloadVendorInventories(player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initiating any vendor interaction to
    ensure optimal performance. It internally handles database queries and caching
    logic, so developers do not need to manually manage inventory data retrieval.
