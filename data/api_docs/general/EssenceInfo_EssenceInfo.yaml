documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new EssenceInfo object with default values.
  description: The EssenceInfo constructor initializes a new instance of the EssenceInfo
    class, setting up internal data structures and default state values. This method
    is typically called when creating a new essence information object to be used
    in World of Warcraft's spell or item systems. The constructor ensures that all
    member variables are properly initialized before the object is used in gameplay
    mechanics such as essence-based abilities, legendary items, or class-specific
    powers.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new EssenceInfo instance
    code: 'EssenceInfo myEssence;

      // The object is now initialized with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is automatically called when an EssenceInfo object is instantiated.
    It's important to note that while this method initializes the object, it does
    not populate it with specific essence data - that would typically be done through
    other methods or assignment operators.
