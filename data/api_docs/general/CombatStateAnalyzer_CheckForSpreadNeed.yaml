  signature: bool CombatStateAnalyzer::CheckForSpreadNeed() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the combat state requires spreading out to avoid area-of-effect
    damage or crowd control.
  description: The CheckForSpreadNeed method evaluates the current combat state of
    a unit to determine if spreading out is necessary. This typically occurs when
    the unit is under threat from area-of-effect abilities, such as AoE spells or
    abilities that cause crowd control effects. The method analyzes factors like proximity
    to other units, incoming damage types, and environmental conditions to decide
    whether moving apart would improve survivability or effectiveness. It is commonly
    used in AI decision-making processes for positioning strategies during combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current combat state indicates that spreading out is
    needed to avoid harmful effects or improve tactical positioning; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "if (analyzer.CheckForSpreadNeed()) {\n    unit->MoveOutOfCombat();\n  \
      \  // Logic to spread out from other units\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Unit AI Loop
    code: "void UnitAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (combatAnalyzer.CheckForSpreadNeed())\
      \ {\n        DoSpreadOut();\n    }\n    // Continue with normal AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat state updates and may be influenced
    by unit-specific traits such as spell resistance, movement speed, or ability to
    cast defensive spells. The decision-making process considers both immediate threats
    and potential future damage patterns.
  warnings: The method assumes that the combat state has been properly initialized
    and updated before being called. Calling this method without a valid combat context
    may lead to incorrect decisions or undefined behavior.
