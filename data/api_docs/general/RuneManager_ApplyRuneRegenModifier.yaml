  signature: void RuneManager::ApplyRuneRegenModifier(float modifier)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a modifier to rune regeneration rate for the player.
  description: The ApplyRuneRegenModifier method adjusts the rate at which runes regenerate
    for a player character. This method is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework to modify the base rune regen speed based on buffs, debuffs, or other
    game mechanics. The modifier value is applied multiplicatively to the current
    rune regeneration rate, allowing for both increases and decreases in regeneration
    speed. This functionality is crucial for class-specific abilities, talents, and
    temporary effects that influence how quickly a player's runes recharge.
  parameters:
  - name: modifier
    description: A floating-point value representing the multiplier applied to rune
      regeneration rate. A value of 1.0 represents no change, values greater than
      1.0 increase regeneration speed, and values less than 1.0 decrease it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Increase Rune Regeneration by 50%
    code: 'RuneManager* runeMgr = player->GetRuneManager();

      float modifier = 1.5f;

      runeMgr->ApplyRuneRegenModifier(modifier);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Apply Temporary Slowdown Effect
    code: 'RuneManager* runeMgr = player->GetRuneManager();

      float modifier = 0.75f;

      runeMgr->ApplyRuneRegenModifier(modifier);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal rune regeneration state of a player's RuneManager
    instance. It should be called whenever a buff or debuff affecting rune regeneration
    is applied or removed. The modifier is typically calculated based on spell effects,
    talents, or other game mechanics that influence rune regen speed.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect rune regeneration behavior.
    Ensure that modifiers are properly reset when effects expire to prevent permanent
    changes to player rune regen rates.
