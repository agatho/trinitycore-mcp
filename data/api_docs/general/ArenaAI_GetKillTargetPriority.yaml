  class: ArenaAI
  method: GetKillTargetPriority
  signature: int ArenaAI::GetKillTargetPriority(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines the priority level for targeting a player as a kill target in
    arena combat.
  description: The GetKillTargetPriority method evaluates and returns an integer priority
    value for a specified player target within an arena environment. This priority
    is used by the ArenaAI system to determine which opponent should be targeted for
    elimination based on various factors such as threat level, health status, and
    proximity. The method takes a pointer to a player object and assesses its suitability
    as a kill target, returning a numerical value that indicates how high or low the
    priority is. A higher return value typically signifies a more favorable target
    for attack, while a lower value suggests less urgency or desirability. This functionality
    is integral to the AI's decision-making process during arena battles.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the potential kill target.
      Must not be null for valid evaluation.
  returns: An integer value indicating the priority level of targeting the specified
    player. Higher values represent higher priority targets, while lower or negative
    values may indicate low priority or invalid targets.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Arena AI Context
    code: "int priority = arenaAI->GetKillTargetPriority(&targetPlayer);\nif (priority\
      \ > 50) {\n    // Target is highly prioritized for attack\n    arenaAI->AttackTarget(targetPlayer);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterating Through Multiple Targets
    code: "Player* bestTarget = nullptr;\nint highestPriority = -1;\nfor (auto& player\
      \ : arenaPlayers) {\n    int priority = arenaAI->GetKillTargetPriority(&player);\n\
      \    if (priority > highestPriority) {\n        highestPriority = priority;\n\
      \        bestTarget = &player;\n    }\n}\nif (bestTarget && highestPriority\
      \ > 0) {\n    arenaAI->SetTarget(bestTarget);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal AI logic for arena combat and relies
    on various game state variables such as player health, distance, and threat level.
    It's important to note that this method does not perform any direct actions but
    rather evaluates targets for strategic purposes.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null; passing an invalid pointer may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This
    method should only be called during active arena combat scenarios where target
    evaluation is relevant.
