documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific quest has been completed by the player.
  description: This method determines whether a given quest has been completed by
    the player character. It returns true if the quest is marked as completed in the
    player's quest log, and false otherwise. The method operates on the player's internal
    quest completion bitset, which tracks the status of quests that have been completed.
    This functionality is essential for determining quest progress and managing quest-related
    game mechanics such as quest rewards, quest completion checks, and related quest
    interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified quest has been completed by the player, false
    otherwise. The method returns false when the quest ID does not exist in the player's
    quest log or when the quest is not marked as completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: bool completed = player->IsQuestCompletedBitSet(12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional check with quest completion
    code: "if (player->IsQuestCompletedBitSet(12345)) {\n    // Quest is completed,\
      \ proceed with reward logic\n}\nelse {\n    // Quest not completed, handle accordingly\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's internal quest completion tracking system.
    It does not perform any database operations or checks against external quest data
    sources. The method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a direct replacement for checking quest
    status in the player's quest log, as it only returns true if the quest has been
    completed. It does not indicate whether the quest is active or available for completion.
