documentation:
  brief: Loads player bot migration data from the database into memory
  description: This method retrieves all player bot migration records from the database
    and populates internal data structures for use during runtime. It is typically
    called during server startup or when migration data needs to be refreshed. The
    method ensures that all migration states are properly loaded and validated before
    returning control to the calling code. This functionality is crucial for maintaining
    consistent player bot behavior across different game versions and updates.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all migration records were successfully loaded from the
    database, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate database connection
    issues, missing tables, or corrupted data in the migration records.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "PlayerbotMigrationMgr* migrationMgr = PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance();\n\
      bool success = migrationMgr->LoadMigrationsFromDatabase();\nif (success)\n{\n\
      \    // Migration data loaded successfully\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"playerbots\",\
      \ \"Player bot migrations loaded successfully\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ load failure\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"playerbots\", \"Failed to load player bot\
      \ migrations from database\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database operations and may block execution until all
    records are retrieved. It should typically be called during server initialization
    or maintenance windows. The method assumes that the database connection is already
    established and valid.
  warnings: Calling this method after data has already been loaded may result in duplicate
    entries or inconsistent state. Ensure that this method is only called once during
    application lifecycle or when explicitly required to refresh migration data.
