  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: GetPlayersAtObjective
  signature: int BattlegroundAI::GetPlayersAtObjective(const int & objLocation, float
    range) const
documentation:
  brief: Counts the number of players within a specified range of a given objective
    location in a battleground.
  description: The GetPlayersAtObjective method determines how many players are positioned
    within a defined radius around a specific objective location within the battleground.
    This is commonly used for determining control status, scoring conditions, or triggering
    events based on player proximity to objectives such as flags, capture points,
    or doors. The method iterates through all players in the battleground and checks
    their distance to the provided objective coordinate. It's an essential utility
    for implementing battleground mechanics that depend on player positioning relative
    to key locations.
  parameters:
  - name: objLocation
    description: The index or identifier of the objective location within the battleground.
      This typically corresponds to a predefined constant or array index representing
      a specific point like a flag position, capture point, or door location.
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance from the objective location within which players
      are considered to be 'at' the objective. Players must be within this radius
      to be counted in the return value.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the total number of players currently located
    within the specified range of the given objective. Returns zero if no players
    are found within range or if the objective index is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Check players near flag position
    code: "int playersNearFlag = bgAI->GetPlayersAtObjective(BG_FLAG_POSITION, 10.0f);\n\
      if (playersNearFlag > 0)\n{\n    // Trigger event or update score\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine control of a capture point
    code: "int playersAtPoint = bgAI->GetPlayersAtObjective(BG_CAPTURE_POINT_1, 5.0f);\n\
      if (playersAtPoint >= 3)\n{\n    // Set control to team with players\n}\nelse\
      \ if (playersAtPoint == 0)\n{\n    // Reset control\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through all players in the battleground,
    so performance may degrade in large battlegrounds with many players. The objLocation
    parameter should correspond to valid predefined objective indices used by the
    specific battleground implementation. The range value is typically measured in
    yards in World of Warcraft's coordinate system.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in frequently called functions as it
    iterates through all players. Avoid calling it excessively during high-frequency
    events like movement updates or combat calculations. Ensure that objLocation values
    are valid to prevent undefined behavior or crashes.
