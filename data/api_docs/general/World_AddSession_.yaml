documentation:
  brief: Adds a new session to the world's session list for managing client connections.
  description: The AddSession_ method is responsible for registering a new WorldSession
    object within the global session management system of the TrinityCore server.
    This internal method ensures that newly established client connections are properly
    tracked and managed by the world server. It typically gets invoked during the
    authentication process when a player successfully logs in, allowing the server
    to maintain an up-to-date list of active sessions. The method is part of the internal
    session handling mechanism and should not be called directly from external code
    without proper context.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Session Registration During Login
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogin(WorldSession* session)\n{\n    // After successful\
      \ authentication\n    sWorld->AddSession_(session);\n    // Session is now tracked\
      \ by the world server\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is an internal method and should not be called directly by other subsystems.
    It's typically invoked automatically during the login process when a client connects
    successfully. The method likely performs thread-safe operations to manage concurrent
    session additions.
  warnings: Do not call this method manually unless you understand the complete session
    lifecycle management. Incorrect usage can lead to memory leaks or inconsistent
    session tracking.
