  class: LootEventBus
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: const Statistics & LootEventBus::GetStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current statistics for loot events within the LootEventBus.
  description: The GetStatistics method returns a constant reference to the internal
    Statistics object that tracks various metrics related to loot distribution events.
    This includes data such as total loot items generated, successful and failed loot
    attempts, and other relevant performance or event counters. The returned Statistics
    object is read-only and provides insight into how loot systems are behaving within
    the game environment. This method does not modify any internal state and can be
    called safely during gameplay without side effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a Statistics object containing accumulated metrics
    about loot events, such as counts of items generated, success/failure rates, and
    other relevant data points.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Loot Statistics
    code: 'const auto& stats = lootEventBus.GetStatistics();

      uint32 totalLootItems = stats.total_items_generated;

      uint32 successfulLoots = stats.successful_loot_attempts;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The Statistics object returned is a snapshot of the current state at the
    time of the call. If the underlying loot system is actively processing events,
    these statistics may change between calls. The method is thread-safe and can be
    safely invoked from different threads without requiring external synchronization.
