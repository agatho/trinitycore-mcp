documentation:
  brief: Resets the combat AI state and clears all active combat-related flags and
    timers.
  description: The Reset method in CombatAI is responsible for returning the AI behavior
    to its initial state, clearing any active combat flags, resetting timers, and
    ensuring that the creature's AI is properly initialized for a new combat encounter.
    This method is typically invoked when a creature enters combat or when the AI
    needs to be reinitialized after an interruption or reset event. It ensures clean
    state management within the AI system by clearing previous combat data and preparing
    the AI for fresh engagement.

  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: "void OnCombatBegin()\n{\n    // Reset AI before starting new combat\n \
      \   me->GetAI()->Reset();\n    // Begin combat logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly called internally by the core AI system when transitioning
    between different AI states or when a creature's combat state needs to be fully
    reset. It should not be called manually unless specifically needed for custom
    AI behavior.
