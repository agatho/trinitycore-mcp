  signature: int MailSender::GetSenderId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the mail sender entity
  description: The GetSenderId method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) associated
    with the mail sender. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this
    identifier typically represents either a player character, an NPC, or a game object
    that is sending mail. The returned value is used internally by the mail system
    to track and manage mail senders, ensuring proper attribution and handling of
    mail messages. This method is commonly called when processing mail operations
    to determine the origin of a message.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the mail
    sender. This GUID can correspond to a player character (typically > 0), an NPC
    (also > 0), or potentially a special system entity (possibly 0 or negative values
    in certain edge cases).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "MailSender sender;\nint senderId = sender.GetSenderId();\nif (senderId\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process player mail sender\n    printf(\"Mail sent by player\
      \ with GUID: %d\\n\", senderId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Mail System Context
    code: "void HandleMailSend(MailSender& sender)\n{\n    int id = sender.GetSenderId();\n\
      \    if (id == 0)\n    {\n        // System-generated mail\n        printf(\"\
      System-generated mail\\n\");\n    }\n    else if (id > 0)\n    {\n        //\
      \ Player or NPC mail\n        printf(\"Mail from entity with ID: %d\\n\", id);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is marked as const, indicating it does not modify the MailSender
    object's state. The returned identifier may be used to query additional information
    about the sender through other TrinityCore APIs such as ObjectAccessor or PlayerCache
    systems.
  warnings: Be cautious when interpreting negative or zero return values as they might
    indicate special system mail or invalid sender states. Always validate the returned
    ID before using it in database queries or object lookups.
