  signature: void TransportMgr::LoadTransportSpawns()
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes all transport spawns from the database into memory
    for use in the game world.
  description: The LoadTransportSpawns method is responsible for retrieving all transport-related
    spawn data from the database and constructing the necessary transport objects
    within the game world. This includes loading waypoints, schedules, and associated
    creature or game object templates that define how transports move and behave.
    The method typically executes during server startup or map loading phases to ensure
    all transports are properly initialized before players can interact with them.
    It handles parsing of transport data including spawn positions, movement patterns,
    and any associated scripting or AI behavior.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeTransports()\n{\n    sTransportMgr->LoadTransportSpawns();\n\
      \    // Transports are now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    reloading transport data. It's typically invoked after database connections are
    established but before the world is fully started. The method may block execution
    while reading from the database, so it's recommended to call it during appropriate
    loading phases rather than runtime.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can result in
    duplicate transport entries or memory leaks. Avoid calling this method during
    active gameplay as it may disrupt existing transport states and cause unexpected
    behavior for players currently aboard transports.
