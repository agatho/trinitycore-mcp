  class: CriteriaMgr
  method: LoadCriteriaData
  signature: void CriteriaMgr::LoadCriteriaData()
documentation:
  brief: Loads all criteria data from the database into memory for active use in the
    game world.
  description: The LoadCriteriaData method initializes and populates the internal
    data structures of the CriteriaMgr class with criteria definitions stored in the
    database. This method is typically invoked during server startup or when reloading
    criteria-related data dynamically. It ensures that all criteria types, their conditions,
    and associated rewards are properly loaded and available for evaluation during
    player progress tracking and achievement validation. The method performs necessary
    database queries to fetch criteria information and processes it into an optimized
    in-memory format for fast access during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeCriteria()\n{\n    sCriteriaMgr->LoadCriteriaData();\n\
      \    // Criteria data is now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    a full criteria reload is required. It's not thread-safe and must be executed
    on the main thread. The method may cause temporary performance degradation during
    execution as it processes potentially large amounts of database records.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate data entries. Avoid invoking this method during high-traffic
    periods as it blocks the main thread and may impact server responsiveness.
