  class: Unit
  method: EnterVehicle
  signature: void Unit::EnterVehicle(Unit * base, int8 seatId)
documentation:
  brief: Enters a vehicle on the specified seat.
  description: The EnterVehicle method allows a unit to board a vehicle at a specific
    seat position. This method is typically used during vehicle enter mechanics where
    the unit (such as a player or creature) enters a vehicle with a defined seat ID.
    The method handles the vehicle boarding process, including setting up proper positioning
    and seat assignment. It's commonly used in conjunction with vehicle exit methods
    to manage vehicle interactions during combat or movement.
  parameters:
  - name: base
    description: The target unit that represents the vehicle being entered. This is
      typically a player or creature that acts as the vehicle.
  - name: seatId
    description: The seat ID on which to enter the vehicle. This determines where
      on the vehicle the unit will be positioned. Valid values are typically between
      -1 and 7, where -1 indicates the default seat, and positive values represent
      specific seat positions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vehicle Entry Example
    code: 'Unit* player = new Unit;

      Unit* vehicle = new Unit;

      player->EnterVehicle(vehicle, 0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Vehicle Entry with Seat ID
    code: 'Unit* player = new Unit;

      Unit* vehicle = new Unit;

      player->EnterVehicle(vehicle, -1);

      // This will enter the vehicle at the default seat position'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method may require the unit to be in a valid state for vehicle entry.
    It's important to ensure that the base unit is properly initialized before calling
    this method. The method typically sets up the vehicle seat assignment and handles
    positioning within the vehicle.
  warnings: This method should not be called during combat or when the unit is already
    in a vehicle, as it may cause unexpected behavior or errors. Ensure that the vehicle
    has proper seat assignments before calling this method.
