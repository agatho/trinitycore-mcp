  class: LootDistribution
  method: ShouldConsiderFairnessAdjustment
  signature: bool LootDistribution::ShouldConsiderFairnessAdjustment(Group * group,
    Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a fairness adjustment should be considered for loot distribution
    within a group.
  description: The ShouldConsiderFairnessAdjustment method evaluates if the current
    loot distribution scenario warrants applying fairness adjustments to ensure equitable
    distribution among group members. This typically involves checking conditions
    such as group size, player levels, and loot type to determine if standard distribution
    rules need modification. The method is used internally by the loot system to maintain
    balance in item allocation across players.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group of players involved
      in loot distribution. Must not be null.
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the fairness adjustment is
      being evaluated. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if a fairness adjustment should be considered based on group
    and player conditions, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Loot Distribution Context
    code: "if (lootDist->ShouldConsiderFairnessAdjustment(group, player)) {\n    //\
      \ Apply fairness adjustments to loot distribution\n    AdjustLootForFairness(group,\
      \ player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal loot distribution logic and may be called
    frequently during loot rolling. It's designed to be lightweight and efficient
    for real-time gameplay scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that both group and player parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method, as null pointer dereferences can occur if not properly validated.
