  class: CollectionMgr
  method: AddTemporaryAppearance
  signature: void CollectionMgr::AddTemporaryAppearance(const int & itemGuid, const
    ItemModifiedAppearanceEntry * itemModifiedAppearance)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a temporary appearance to an item in the player's collection.
  description: The AddTemporaryAppearance method assigns a temporary visual appearance
    to a specific item identified by its GUID. This appearance is typically used for
    cosmetic effects that do not persist permanently, such as transmogrification effects
    or temporary enchantments. The method takes an ItemModifiedAppearanceEntry which
    defines the visual properties of the appearance. This functionality is commonly
    used in World of Warcraft's transmogrification system where players can temporarily
    change the look of their gear without altering its stats.
  parameters:
  - name: itemGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the item to which the temporary appearance
      will be applied. This should correspond to a valid item in the player's inventory
      or bank.
  - name: itemModifiedAppearance
    description: A pointer to an ItemModifiedAppearanceEntry that defines the visual
      properties of the temporary appearance. This includes the appearance ID, which
      determines how the item looks, and other related visual modifiers.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Apply Temporary Appearance to an Item
    code: "ItemModifiedAppearanceEntry* appearance = sItemModifiedAppearanceStore.LookupEntry(12345);\n\
      if (appearance)\n{\n    collectionMgr->AddTemporaryAppearance(itemGuid, appearance);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the item's appearance in memory only and does not persist
    changes to the database unless explicitly saved. The temporary appearance will
    be removed when the player logs out or when the item is re-equipped with a different
    appearance.
  warnings: Ensure that the itemGuid corresponds to an actual item owned by the player,
    otherwise the method may have no effect or cause undefined behavior. Also, be
    aware that multiple temporary appearances on the same item may overwrite each
    other.
