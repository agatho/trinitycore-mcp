  signature: void BaselineRotationManager::InitializeDeathKnightBaseline()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the baseline rotation for Death Knights with default spell priorities
    and cooldown management.
  description: The InitializeDeathKnightBaseline method sets up the core rotation
    logic for Death Knights within the TrinityCore framework. This method configures
    the initial state of the Death Knight's ability priority system, establishing
    default spell sequences and cooldown tracking mechanisms that are essential for
    optimal gameplay performance. It typically runs during character initialization
    or when switching to a Death Knight specialization, ensuring that all necessary
    data structures are properly set up before the AI begins making tactical decisions.
    The method does not require any external parameters as it initializes internal
    state variables and prepares the rotation manager for subsequent calls to execute
    rotation logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'BaselineRotationManager rotationManager;

      rotationManager.InitializeDeathKnightBaseline();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per character instance during initialization.
    It modifies internal state variables and prepares the rotation manager for subsequent
    execution of rotation logic. The method assumes that the character object has
    already been properly initialized with Death Knight-specific data.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times on the same instance may result in
    undefined behavior or corrupted internal state. Ensure that this method is called
    only during appropriate initialization phases and not during active combat scenarios.
