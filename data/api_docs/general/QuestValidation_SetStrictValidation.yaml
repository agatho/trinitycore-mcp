  class: QuestValidation
  method: SetStrictValidation
  signature: void QuestValidation::SetStrictValidation(bool strict)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the strict validation mode for quest completion checks in TrinityCore.
  description: The SetStrictValidation method enables or disables strict validation
    for quest progress and completion within the TrinityCore framework. When strict
    validation is enabled, the system performs more rigorous checks on quest requirements,
    including item counts, player levels, and objective fulfillment. This ensures
    that quests are completed according to exact game rules rather than lenient interpretations.
    The method affects how quest data is validated during runtime, particularly in
    scenarios involving quest gating, reward distribution, and progression tracking.
  parameters:
  - name: strict
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether strict validation should be enabled
      (true) or disabled (false). When true, all quest validations will enforce exact
      matching of requirements; when false, more lenient validation is applied.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Strict Quest Validation
    code: 'QuestValidation::SetStrictValidation(true);

      // All subsequent quest validations will be strict'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Strict Quest Validation
    code: 'QuestValidation::SetStrictValidation(false);

      // Quest validations will use lenient rules'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during server configuration or quest development
    to ensure consistency in how quest requirements are enforced. The change takes
    effect immediately for all new quest validation operations, but does not retroactively
    affect already validated quests.
