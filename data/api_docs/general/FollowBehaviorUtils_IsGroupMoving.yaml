  method: IsGroupMoving
  signature: bool FollowBehaviorUtils::IsGroupMoving(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified group is currently in motion.
  description: The IsGroupMoving method evaluates if any member of the provided group
    is currently moving. This utility function checks the movement state of all players
    within the group and returns true if at least one player is actively moving, indicating
    that the group's collective position is changing. The method is commonly used
    in AI behavior systems to determine when a group should continue following a path
    or adjust their movement strategy. It relies on internal movement tracking mechanisms
    within the TrinityCore framework to accurately assess player states.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if any member of the group is currently moving; otherwise,
    returns false. A return value of true indicates that at least one player in the
    group has active movement state, while false means all players are stationary
    or not actively moving.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Group Movement
    code: "if (FollowBehaviorUtils::IsGroupMoving(playerGroup)) {\n    // Handle case\
      \ where group is moving\n    sLog->outString(\"Group is currently moving.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Handle case where group is stationary\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Group is stationary.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lightweight check on player movement states and should
    not introduce significant performance overhead. It is designed to be used in frequent
    AI decision-making loops where group movement status is critical for behavior
    selection.
