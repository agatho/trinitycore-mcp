  class: RogueAI
  method: ExecuteFinisher
  signature: bool RogueAI::ExecuteFinisher(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a finisher ability for the rogue AI, returning true if successful.
  description: The ExecuteFinisher method is responsible for performing a finisher
    ability within the RogueAI context. This method typically evaluates whether the
    rogue can and should execute a finisher move against a target, considering factors
    such as energy levels, target health, and combat state. It returns true if the
    finisher was successfully executed, and false otherwise. The method may also update
    internal AI state and perform necessary cleanup or setup for subsequent actions.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's ID or index. This
      parameter is used to determine which enemy to apply the finisher ability against.
  returns: Returns true if the finisher ability was successfully executed on the target,
    false otherwise. The method may return false due to insufficient resources, invalid
    target, or inability to perform the action.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecuteFinisher
    code: "int targetId = 42;\nbool success = rogueAI->ExecuteFinisher(&targetId);\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Finisher executed successfully\n    printf(\"Finisher\
      \ executed on target %d\\n\", targetId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Failed to execute\
      \ finisher\n    printf(\"Failed to execute finisher on target %d\\n\", targetId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the rogue's current energy state and target
    health to determine if a finisher can be used. It may also update internal AI
    decision-making flags or cooldown timers.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    dereferencing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior. The method
    assumes that the rogue has sufficient energy and that the target is within range
    for the finisher ability.
