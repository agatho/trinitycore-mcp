documentation:
  brief: Updates the enhancement shaman's defensive abilities and cooldowns based
    on current game state.
  description: The UpdateDefensives method manages the internal state of defensive
    abilities for an Enhancement Shaman class. This includes updating cooldown timers,
    checking if defensive spells are available, and ensuring proper activation of
    defensive mechanics such as Shield of the Storm or other defensive cooldowns.
    The method is typically called during combat updates or when specific conditions
    are met to maintain optimal defensive readiness. It ensures that defensive abilities
    are properly tracked and can be used according to game rules and class limitations.

  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the core combat system during
    regular update cycles. Developers should not call this method directly unless
    implementing custom behavior or debugging. The method may internally check for
    spell availability, mana costs, and cooldown states.
