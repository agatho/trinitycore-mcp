  class: GroupModel
  method: GetTriangles
  signature: const int & GroupModel::GetTriangles() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the internal triangle count of the GroupModel.
  description: The GetTriangles method provides access to the number of triangles
    stored within the GroupModel instance. This value represents the total count of
    triangular facets that make up the grouped model geometry, which is essential
    for rendering and collision detection in the game world. The method returns a
    constant reference to an integer, ensuring that the triangle count cannot be modified
    through this interface. This count is typically used by the rendering system to
    determine how many triangles need to be processed when drawing the model or by
    physics systems to calculate collision boundaries.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the total number of triangles
    in the GroupModel. The returned value reflects the current state of the model's
    geometry and should not be modified directly.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Triangle Count for Rendering
    code: "GroupModel* model = GetGroupModel();\nconst int& triangleCount = model->GetTriangles();\n\
      if (triangleCount > 0)\n{\n    // Use triangleCount to allocate rendering buffers\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Model has \" << triangleCount << \" triangles\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to an internal member variable of the GroupModel
    class. Since it's a const reference, modifications to the triangle count through
    this method are not possible, ensuring data integrity. The value is typically
    set during model initialization or loading and remains constant throughout the
    object's lifetime.
