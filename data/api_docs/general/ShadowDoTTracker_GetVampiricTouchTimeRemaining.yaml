  signature: uint32 ShadowDoTTracker::GetVampiricTouchTimeRemaining(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the time remaining for Vampiric Touch DoT on a target.
  description: The GetVampiricTouchTimeRemaining method retrieves the duration left
    for the Vampiric Touch spell's damage-over-time effect applied to a specific target.
    This method is typically used by shadow priests to track the status of their Vampiric
    Touch debuff, which deals periodic damage and drains mana from the target. The
    returned value represents the time in milliseconds until the DoT effect expires.
    This functionality is essential for spell rotation management and cooldown optimization
    in raid and dungeon environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the time remaining (in milliseconds)
    for the Vampiric Touch DoT effect on the specified target. If no Vampiric Touch
    is active on the target, it returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Check Vampiric Touch Duration
    code: "uint32 remainingTime = shadowDotTracker.GetVampiricTouchTimeRemaining(targetGuid);\n\
      if (remainingTime > 0)\n{\n    // Vampiric Touch is active, print time left\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Vampiric Touch has \" << remainingTime << \" ms remaining\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Vampiric Touch is not active\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Vampiric Touch is not active on target\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ShadowDoTTracker instance maintains internal
    state tracking of all active DoTs. The method signature suggests it takes a GUID
    parameter, but the provided signature shows no parameters; this discrepancy may
    indicate an error in the provided signature or that the method is intended to
    operate on a stored target context.
  warnings: Ensure that the target GUID corresponds to a valid unit in the current
    environment, as invalid GUIDs could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
    The returned time value should be interpreted carefully in relation to game tick
    intervals and spell casting delays.
