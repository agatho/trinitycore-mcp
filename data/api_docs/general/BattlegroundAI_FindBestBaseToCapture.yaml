  signature: int BattlegroundAI::FindBestBaseToCapture(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines the optimal base to capture for the battleground AI.
  description: The FindBestBaseToCapture method evaluates the current state of the
    battleground and determines which base should be targeted for capture by the AI.
    This method considers factors such as base ownership, player proximity, and strategic
    importance to select the most beneficial target. It is typically used during battleground
    AI decision-making processes to prioritize objectives. The method returns an identifier
    representing the chosen base, or -1 if no suitable base is available. This function
    is part of the battleground AI logic and is called internally by the system to
    make tactical decisions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer identifier representing the base to capture. A value
    of -1 indicates that no suitable base was found or that the operation failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "int baseId = bgAI->FindBestBaseToCapture();\nif (baseId != -1)\n{\n   \
      \ // Proceed with capturing the identified base\n    bgAI->CaptureBase(baseId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other battleground AI methods
    to determine overall strategy. It may be called repeatedly during gameplay to
    reassess tactical priorities based on changing battlefield conditions.
