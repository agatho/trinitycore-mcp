documentation:
  brief: Prioritizes rage-spending abilities for the warrior AI based on current combat
    state and target.
  description: The PrioritizeRageSpenders method evaluates available rage-spending
    abilities for a warrior AI unit and determines their priority order based on factors
    such as target health, available rage, and combat efficiency. This method is typically
    invoked during the AI's decision-making cycle to select the most effective ability
    to use next when the warrior has sufficient rage. It ensures optimal resource
    utilization by considering damage output, threat generation, and cooldown states
    of various rage-spending abilities.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n  \
      \      return;\n\n    PrioritizeRageSpenders(mVictim);\n    // ... rest of AI\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the warrior's combat decision-making process and should
    be called regularly during the AI update cycle. It assumes that a valid target
    exists and that the warrior has sufficient rage to perform any of its rage-spending
    abilities.
