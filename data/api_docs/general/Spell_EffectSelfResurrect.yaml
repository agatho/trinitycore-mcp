documentation:
  brief: Resurrects the caster from death, restoring health and mana.
  description: This method handles the self-resurrection effect of a spell, allowing
    the caster to be restored from death state. It typically occurs when a player
    is resurrected by their own spell or when a spell explicitly triggers a self-resurrection
    mechanism. The method restores the caster's health and mana to their maximum values,
    and removes any death state effects such as ghost state or soul state. This functionality
    is commonly used in spells like 'Resurrection' or 'Self Resurrection' where the
    player can be brought back to life without requiring external assistance.

    code: "void Spell::EffectSelfResurrect()\n{\n    // Implementation\n    // Restore\
      \ caster's health and mana\n    // Remove death state effects\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called only when the spell is in a valid state where
    the caster is dead or in a death state. The implementation typically involves
    restoring the player's health and mana to full values, and removing any temporary
    death-related effects such as ghost or soul state.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly without proper validation of the
    spell's state. Using it on players who are not actually dead can lead to unexpected
    behavior or errors in game mechanics.
