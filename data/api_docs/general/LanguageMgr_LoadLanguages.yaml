documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads all available language data into the game's language
    management system.
  description: The LoadLanguages method is responsible for initializing the language
    management system by loading all supported languages from the database or configuration
    files. This method typically executes during server startup or when language data
    needs to be refreshed. It populates internal data structures with language information
    such as language IDs, names, and associated properties. The method ensures that
    all language-related functionality within TrinityCore is properly initialized
    before gameplay begins. This method should only be called once during the server's
    initialization phase.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n\
      \    LanguageMgr::Instance()->LoadLanguages();\n    // Continue with other initialization...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically during server startup. Developers
    should not need to invoke this method manually unless performing specific language
    data refresh operations. The method performs database queries to retrieve language
    information and may have performance implications during server startup.
  warnings: Calling LoadLanguages multiple times can lead to duplicate entries in
    internal language data structures. This method should only be invoked once during
    the server's lifecycle, preferably during initialization. Avoid calling this method
    from within high-frequency game loops or concurrent threads without proper synchronization.
