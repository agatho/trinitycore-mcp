  class: AuctionBotBuyer
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool AuctionBotBuyer::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the AuctionBotBuyer component, setting up internal data structures
    and preparing it for auction bidding operations.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the AuctionBotBuyer class for operation
    by loading configuration settings, initializing internal state variables, and
    establishing necessary connections or references to the auction system. This method
    must be called before any other bidding operations can be performed. It typically
    reads from database tables or configuration files to determine bidding behavior,
    such as maximum bid amounts, item categories to target, and frequency of auction
    scans. The initialization process may also validate that required resources are
    available and that the bot is properly configured for the current server environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if initialization was successful and all required components
    were properly set up; returns false if initialization failed due to missing configuration,
    invalid settings, or resource unavailability.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "AuctionBotBuyer buyer;\nbool success = buyer.Initialize();\nif (success)\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with auction bidding logic\n    buyer.StartBidding();\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed\
      \ to initialize AuctionBotBuyer\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of an AuctionBotBuyer
    instance. Repeated calls may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. The
    method performs blocking operations during database reads and configuration parsing,
    so it's recommended to call this during server startup or initialization phases
    rather than in high-frequency contexts.
  warnings: Do not call other AuctionBotBuyer methods before Initialize() returns
    true, as the object may be left in an uninitialized state. Failure to properly
    initialize can result in crashes or incorrect bidding behavior. Ensure that all
    required database tables and configuration entries exist before calling this method.
