  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: SetAnalyticsEnabled
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::SetAnalyticsEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables bot performance analytics collection and reporting.
  description: The SetAnalyticsEnabled method controls whether the BotPerformanceAnalytics
    system collects and reports performance data for AI bots in the game. When enabled,
    this functionality tracks various metrics such as bot response times, decision-making
    efficiency, and resource usage. The setting is typically used during development
    or debugging to monitor bot behavior without affecting gameplay. This method does
    not validate the input parameter; it directly applies the boolean value to control
    analytics state.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: Boolean flag that determines if analytics should be active. True
      enables analytics collection, false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Analytics for Debugging
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics::SetAnalyticsEnabled(true);

      // Start collecting performance data for all AI bots'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Analytics in Production
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics::SetAnalyticsEnabled(false);

      // Stop collecting performance data to reduce overhead'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on a global flag that affects all bots within the system.
    Changes take effect immediately without requiring a restart or reinitialization
    of bot instances. The analytics data is typically stored in memory and may be
    flushed to disk periodically depending on implementation.
