  class: ChannelMgr
  method: GetChannelForPlayerByGuid
  signature: Channel * ChannelMgr::GetChannelForPlayerByGuid(int channelGuid, Player
    * playerSearcher)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a channel instance for a specific player by its unique identifier.
  description: The GetChannelForPlayerByGuid method searches through the internal
    channel management system to locate and return a Channel object that matches the
    provided channel GUID for the specified player. This method is typically used
    in the context of World of Warcraft's communication systems, where players can
    join various channels such as general chat, trade, or guild channels. The method
    ensures that only channels accessible to the given player are returned, respecting
    permissions and membership rules. It acts as a lookup utility within the ChannelMgr
    class to facilitate channel-based messaging and communication.
  parameters:
  - name: channelGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the channel to search for. This value
      corresponds to the internal representation of a channel in the TrinityCore database.
  - name: playerSearcher
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who is requesting
      access to the channel. Used to verify player permissions and membership.
  returns: A pointer to the Channel object if a matching channel exists and the player
    has permission to access it; otherwise, returns nullptr if no such channel is
    found or if access is denied.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Channel* channel = channelMgr->GetChannelForPlayerByGuid(12345, player);\n\
      if (channel != nullptr) {\n    // Player can access the channel\n    channel->SendToPlayer(\"\
      Hello world!\", player);\n} else {\n    // Channel not found or access denied\n\
      \    player->SendNotification(\"You do not have access to this channel.\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Channel Access Before Sending Message
    code: "uint32 channelId = 54321;\nChannel* ch = channelMgr->GetChannelForPlayerByGuid(channelId,\
      \ player);\nif (ch && ch->HasPlayer(player)) {\n    ch->SendToPlayer(\"Message\
      \ sent via channel.\", player);\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid or unauthorized\
      \ access\n    player->SendNotification(\"Cannot send message: Invalid channel\
      \ or no permission.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup in the internal channel registry, which is
    maintained by the ChannelMgr singleton. It's important to note that this method
    does not create new channels; it only retrieves existing ones. The returned pointer
    should be checked for null before use to avoid potential crashes.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method without checking for null returns,
    as attempting to dereference a nullptr can cause segmentation faults. Also, ensure
    the player object passed is valid and not destroyed before the channel access
    check completes.
