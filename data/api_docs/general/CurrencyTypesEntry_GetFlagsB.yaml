  class: CurrencyTypesEntry
  method: GetFlagsB
  signature: int CurrencyTypesEntry::GetFlagsB() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flags bitmask associated with the currency type entry.
  description: The GetFlagsB method returns an integer value representing the flags
    bitmask for a specific currency type entry. This bitmask contains various boolean
    flags that define the behavior and properties of the currency within the game
    system. The returned value can be used to check specific attributes of the currency
    by performing bitwise operations against known flag constants. This method is
    typically used when evaluating how a currency should behave in different contexts
    such as during loot distribution, vendor transactions, or quest rewards.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the flags bitmask for the currency type entry.
    Each bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific property or behavior
    of the currency. Common flag values may include indicators for whether the currency
    can be traded, is bound to account, or has special restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a currency is tradeable
    code: "CurrencyTypesEntry* entry = sCurrencyTypesStore.LookupEntry(1234);\nif\
      \ (entry)\n{\n    int flags = entry->GetFlagsB();\n    if (flags & 0x01) //\
      \ Assuming 0x01 represents tradeable flag\n        printf(\"Currency is tradeable\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The exact meaning of each bit in the returned bitmask depends on the internal
    definitions within TrinityCore's currency system. Developers should consult the
    game's source code or documentation to determine which bits correspond to specific
    behaviors. This method is read-only and does not modify any internal state.
  warnings: Be cautious when using bitwise operations on the returned value without
    verifying the correct flag constants. The meaning of individual bits may change
    between different versions of TrinityCore or patches, so ensure compatibility
    when relying on specific bit positions.
