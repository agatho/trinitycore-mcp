  class: PathfindingAdapter
  method: Shutdown
  signature: void PathfindingAdapter::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the pathfinding adapter, releasing all associated resources and
    terminating active pathfinding operations.
  description: The Shutdown method is responsible for gracefully terminating the pathfinding
    adapter's functionality. It ensures that all ongoing pathfinding calculations
    are properly canceled, resources are released, and any internal state is cleaned
    up. This method should be called during system shutdown or when the pathfinding
    service needs to be temporarily disabled. The method does not take any parameters
    and returns nothing. It is typically invoked by the core game loop or service
    manager to ensure clean termination of pathfinding operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'PathfindingAdapter* adapter = new PathfindingAdapter();

      // ... perform pathfinding operations ...

      adapter->Shutdown();

      delete adapter;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the pathfinding adapter is no longer
    needed. Calling Shutdown multiple times may result in undefined behavior or crashes
    if not properly handled by the implementation. The shutdown process is expected
    to be thread-safe, but developers should ensure proper synchronization if calling
    from multiple threads.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown on an already shut down adapter may lead to memory corruption
    or access violations. Always verify the adapter's state before calling this method.
    Do not call Shutdown while pathfinding operations are actively running unless
    you're certain that all operations will be properly terminated.
