documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new EquipmentManager instance with default equipment state.
  description: The EquipmentManager constructor initializes a new instance of the
    EquipmentManager class, setting up internal data structures to manage player or
    creature equipment. This method is typically called during object creation and
    prepares the manager to handle equipment-related operations such as item equipping,
    unequipping, and inventory synchronization. The initialization process ensures
    that all equipment slots are properly configured with default values and that
    the manager is ready to receive subsequent equipment modification requests.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating an EquipmentManager instance
    code: 'EquipmentManager* mgr = new EquipmentManager();

      // The manager is now initialized and ready to manage equipment'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when creating player or creature objects. Developers should not directly instantiate
    EquipmentManager objects unless implementing custom game mechanics that require
    manual management of equipment state.
