api:
  class: CreatureAI
  method: Talk
  signature: void CreatureAI::Talk(int id, const WorldObject * whisperTarget)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a creature's talk or emote sequence with an optional whisper target.
  description: The Talk method triggers a creature's AI to perform a specific talk
    or emote action identified by the provided ID. This method is typically used in
    conjunction with database-defined text entries or emotes that are associated with
    a creature's AI behavior. The optional whisperTarget parameter allows the creature
    to whisper its message directly to a specific WorldObject, such as a player. If
    no whisper target is specified, the creature will speak normally to nearby units
    within its communication range. This method does not block execution and relies
    on the underlying AI system to manage timing and display of the text or emote.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: An integer identifier that corresponds to a specific text or emote
      entry in the creature's AI configuration. This ID typically maps to entries
      in the `creature_text` table or similar database structures.
  - name: whisperTarget
    description: A pointer to a WorldObject (such as a Player) that will receive the
      whispered message. If NULL, the message is broadcast normally to nearby creatures
      or players within communication range.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Creature Talk
    code: "void BasicTalkExample(Creature* creature)\n{\n    creature->AI()->Talk(12345);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Creature Whisper to Player
    code: "void WhisperExample(Creature* creature, Player* targetPlayer)\n{\n    creature->AI()->Talk(12346,\
      \ targetPlayer);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the creature's AI has been properly initialized and
    that the specified ID corresponds to valid text or emote entries in the database.
    The whisper functionality requires the whisperTarget to be within communication
    range of the creature.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided ID exists in the creature_text table or related
    database entries, otherwise the talk will not display any message. Using a NULL
    whisperTarget with a creature that has no default communication behavior may result
    in silent execution.
