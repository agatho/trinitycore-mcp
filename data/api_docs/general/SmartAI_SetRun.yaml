  class: SmartAI
  method: SetRun
  signature: void SmartAI::SetRun(bool run)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the running state of the AI-controlled creature.
  description: The SetRun method enables or disables the running movement state for
    a creature controlled by SmartAI. When enabled, the creature will move at run
    speed instead of walk speed. This method directly affects the creature's movement
    behavior and can be used to control how NPCs traverse the world. The change takes
    effect immediately and influences all subsequent movement commands issued to the
    creature.
  parameters:
  - name: run
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      running movement state for the creature.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Running Movement
    code: "void OnCombatEnter(Unit* who)\n{\n    me->GetAI()->SetRun(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Running Movement After Combat
    code: "void OnCombatExit()\n{\n    me->GetAI()->SetRun(false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the creature's movement speed and should be used carefully
    to avoid unexpected behavior. The running state is maintained until explicitly
    changed again, even if other movement commands are issued.
