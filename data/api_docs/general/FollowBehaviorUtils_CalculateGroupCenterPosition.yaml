  class: FollowBehaviorUtils
  method: CalculateGroupCenterPosition
  signature: int FollowBehaviorUtils::CalculateGroupCenterPosition(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the central position of a group's members in the world.
  description: The CalculateGroupCenterPosition method determines the geometric center
    point of all active members within a specified group. It iterates through each
    group member, retrieves their current world position, and computes an average
    position that represents the group's collective center. This functionality is
    commonly used in AI behavior systems to determine where a group should move or
    gather. The method assumes that the provided Group object is valid and contains
    at least one member; otherwise, it may return an error code or undefined behavior.
    The calculated position is typically used for group movement decisions, formation
    maintenance, or positioning logic within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the success status of the calculation.
    A return value of 0 typically indicates success, while non-zero values may indicate
    errors such as empty groups or invalid member data. The actual computed center
    coordinates are usually stored in internal variables or passed via reference parameters
    (not shown in signature).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nint result = FollowBehaviorUtils::CalculateGroupCenterPosition(myGroup);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // Center position has been calculated successfully\n\
      \    // Use the stored center coordinates for group movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger follow behavior system and may be used in
    conjunction with other group positioning utilities. It's important to ensure that
    all group members are valid and present in the world before calling this function.
    The implementation likely uses floating-point arithmetic for position averaging,
    which can introduce minor precision errors in very large groups.
  warnings: Calling this method on a null or invalid Group pointer will likely result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify that the group exists and contains
    members before invoking this function. Additionally, if group members are in different
    zones or instances, the calculation may produce incorrect results due to coordinate
    system differences.
