  signature: const int * DB2Manager::GetSpecializationSpells(uint32 specId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the list of spells associated with a given specialization ID from
    the DB2 database.
  description: The GetSpecializationSpells method fetches an array of spell identifiers
    that are linked to a specific specialization in the World of Warcraft game data.
    This function is typically used by the TrinityCore server to retrieve spell information
    for class specializations, such as retrieving the set of spells available to a
    particular talent tree or specialization. The returned pointer points to an internal
    static array that contains the spell IDs; callers must not modify or free this
    memory. The method assumes valid specId input and returns NULL if no data is found
    for the given ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const int* pointing to an array of spell IDs associated with the specified
    specialization. Returns NULL if no spells are found for the given specId or if
    the input is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and iterate through specialization spells
    code: "const int* spells = sDB2Manager->GetSpecializationSpells(123);\nif (spells\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    for (int i = 0; spells[i] != 0; ++i)\n    {\n        printf(\"\
      Spell ID: %d\\n\", spells[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses data from the DB2 file format which is preloaded into
    memory during server startup. The returned array is null-terminated and should
    be treated as read-only. Performance is optimized for frequent lookups, but repeated
    calls with different specIds may cause cache misses if not batched.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify or free the memory pointed to by the returned
    pointer. Ensure that the specId parameter corresponds to a valid specialization
    ID in the game database; otherwise, the function will return NULL without error
    reporting.
