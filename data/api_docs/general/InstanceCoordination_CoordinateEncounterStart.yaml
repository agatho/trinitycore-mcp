  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: CoordinateEncounterStart
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::CoordinateEncounterStart(Group * group, uint32
    encounterId)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates the start of a dungeon encounter for a group of players.
  description: The CoordinateEncounterStart method initiates the synchronization process
    for starting a specific dungeon encounter within an instance. It ensures that
    all players in the provided group are properly aligned with the encounter's start
    conditions, including proper positioning, quest state updates, and potential cooldown
    resets. This method is typically invoked when a group enters a dungeon or begins
    a specific encounter, ensuring that all members of the group are synchronized
    to the same encounter state. The method handles coordination between the client
    and server to maintain consistency across all players in the group during the
    encounter.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group of players initiating
      the encounter. Must be a valid group with at least one member, and all members
      must be within the same instance.
  - name: encounterId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific dungeon encounter being started.
      This ID corresponds to the encounter definition in the database and determines
      which encounter mechanics are activated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Encounter Start Coordination
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (playerGroup && playerGroup->GetMembersCount()\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    InstanceCoordination::CoordinateEncounterStart(playerGroup, 12345);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Encounter Start with Validation
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && group->IsLeader(player))\n\
      {\n    uint32 encounterId = sObjectMgr->GetDungeonEncounterIdForMapAndPosition(\n\
      \        player->GetMapId(), player->GetPositionX(), player->GetPositionY());\n\
      \    if (encounterId)\n    {\n        InstanceCoordination::CoordinateEncounterStart(group,\
      \ encounterId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the instance coordination system and relies on proper
    group management. It assumes that all players in the group are already within
    the same instance map. The method may trigger additional events or updates to
    synchronize player states across the network. Performance considerations include
    avoiding frequent calls during active encounters, as this could cause unnecessary
    synchronization overhead.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid group pointer or a non-existent encounterId
    can lead to undefined behavior or client desynchronization. Ensure that all players
    in the group are valid and within the same instance before calling this method.
    This method should not be called during active encounters without proper state
    management.
