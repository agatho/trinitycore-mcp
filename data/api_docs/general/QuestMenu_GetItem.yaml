  method: GetItem
  signature: const QuestMenuItem & QuestMenu::GetItem(uint16 index) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a specific quest menu item from the quest menu by its index.
  description: The GetItem method retrieves a const reference to a QuestMenuItem object
    at the specified index within the QuestMenu. This method is typically used when
    iterating through available quests or accessing specific quest options presented
    to a player. The index parameter should be within valid range, otherwise behavior
    is undefined. QuestMenu items are usually populated when a player interacts with
    an NPC that offers quests. The returned reference allows access to quest details
    such as quest ID, icon, and other metadata without modifying the underlying data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const reference to the QuestMenuItem at the specified index. This reference
    provides read-only access to the quest menu item's properties including quest
    identifier, icon type, and other quest-related information.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing a specific quest from the quest menu
    code: 'QuestMenu& questMenu = player->GetPlayerMenu();

      const QuestMenuItem& questItem = questMenu.GetItem(0);

      uint32 questId = questItem.QuestId;

      uint8 icon = questItem.Icon;

      // Use questId and icon as needed'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs no bounds checking on the index parameter, so calling
    it with an invalid index may result in undefined behavior. The returned reference
    is only valid while the QuestMenu object remains alive and unmodified. This method
    is commonly used during quest interaction handling in the TrinityCore core.
  warnings: Using an out-of-bounds index will lead to memory corruption or undefined
    behavior. Always ensure that the index is within the valid range of items returned
    by GetMenuItemCount() before calling this method.
