  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: GetGroupTarget
  signature: Unit * GroupCoordinator::GetGroupTarget() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the target unit that the group coordinator is currently focused
    on.
  description: The GetGroupTarget method returns a pointer to the Unit object that
    represents the current target of the group coordinator. This target is typically
    the unit that the group's leader or coordinator is focusing on for tactical purposes,
    such as during boss encounters or coordinated attacks. The returned Unit pointer
    may be null if no valid target exists or if the group coordinator has not yet
    selected a target. This method is commonly used in group-based AI logic to determine
    what enemy or object the group should prioritize engaging.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Unit object representing the current group target, or
    nullptr if no target is set or available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Unit* target = groupCoordinator->GetGroupTarget();\nif (target != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Perform actions on the target\n    DoSomethingWithTarget(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Target Validity Before Use
    code: "Unit* target = groupCoordinator->GetGroupTarget();\nif (target && target->IsAlive())\n\
      {\n    // Only proceed if target exists and is alive\n    AttackTarget(target);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case where no valid target exists\n    FindNewTarget();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any locking or thread safety checks. It should
    be used in contexts where the group coordinator's state is guaranteed to be consistent,
    such as within the same thread or under appropriate synchronization mechanisms.
    The returned Unit pointer is only valid while the target unit remains in the world
    and has not been destroyed.
  warnings: The returned Unit pointer may become invalid if the target unit is removed
    from the world or destroyed. Always check for null before using the returned pointer
    to prevent access violations. Avoid storing the returned pointer for extended
    periods as it may point to a destroyed object.
