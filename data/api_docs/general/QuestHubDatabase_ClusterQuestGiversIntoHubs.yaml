documentation:
  brief: Clusters quest givers into logical hubs based on proximity and quest relationships.
  description: The ClusterQuestGiversIntoHubs method organizes quest givers within
    the game world into clusters or 'hubs' to optimize quest distribution and player
    experience. This process groups NPCs that are geographically close together and
    share common quest relationships, reducing clutter in the user interface and improving
    navigation for players seeking quests. The method analyzes the spatial positioning
    of quest givers and their associated quests to form logical groupings. It typically
    runs during server initialization or when quest data is updated to ensure optimal
    clustering. This functionality supports the World of Warcraft's quest hub system
    which helps players identify nearby quest givers more efficiently.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the total number of quest hubs created
    or updated by this operation. A return value of zero indicates no new hubs were
    formed, while any positive integer reflects the count of successfully clustered
    quest giver groups.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 hubCount = sQuestHubDatabase->ClusterQuestGiversIntoHubs();\nif\
      \ (hubCount > 0)\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"quest\", \"Successfully clustered %u\
      \ quest hubs\", hubCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server startup or when quest data
    changes to maintain up-to-date clustering. The clustering algorithm considers
    both physical proximity and quest relationship data to determine optimal groupings.
    Performance may be impacted on servers with a large number of quest givers due
    to the computational complexity of spatial analysis.
  warnings: Calling this method while players are actively engaged in quests might
    lead to temporary inconsistencies in quest hub display until the clustering process
    completes. Avoid frequent calls to this method during active gameplay sessions
    to prevent potential UI flickering or incorrect quest giver associations.
