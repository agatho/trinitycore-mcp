api:
  class: BotPopulationManager
  method: GetAllZonePopulations
  signature: int BotPopulationManager::GetAllZonePopulations() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total population count across all zones managed by the bot
    population manager.
  description: The GetAllZonePopulations method aggregates and returns the cumulative
    number of bots currently active or registered within all zones under the management
    of the BotPopulationManager. This method is typically used to monitor overall
    bot activity levels across the game world, which can be useful for balancing server
    resources, tracking player engagement, or implementing dynamic difficulty adjustments
    based on population density. The returned value represents a summation of individual
    zone populations and does not account for any filtering or categorization of bots
    by type or status.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of bots across all managed zones.
    A return value of zero indicates no active bots in any zone, while positive integers
    reflect the cumulative population count.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Bot Population
    code: "int totalPopulation = botPopulationManager->GetAllZonePopulations();\n\
      if (totalPopulation > 100)\n{\n    // Trigger high-population event\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(\"\
      High bot population detected!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve iterating through internal zone data structures and
    could have performance implications if called frequently in tight loops. It is
    recommended to cache the result when the population data does not change often.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotPopulationManager instance is properly initialized
    before calling this method, as accessing an uninitialized or destroyed manager
    may lead to undefined behavior. The returned value reflects only bots managed
    by this specific instance and may not include global bot counts from other systems.
