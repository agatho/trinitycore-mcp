documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the dungeon encounter entry associated with the boss for a given
    difficulty level.
  description: This method returns a pointer to the DungeonEncounterEntry that corresponds
    to the current boss and the specified difficulty. It is used primarily in the
    context of raid encounters to determine which specific encounter data should be
    used for a given difficulty setting. The returned entry contains information about
    the encounter such as its ID, associated creature entries, and other relevant
    metadata needed for handling encounter-specific mechanics. This method does not
    perform any validation on the input difficulty; it is expected that the caller
    provides a valid difficulty value that corresponds to an existing dungeon encounter.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a const DungeonEncounterEntry object if a matching encounter
    exists for the specified difficulty, or nullptr if no such encounter is found.
    The returned pointer remains valid for the lifetime of the BossInfo instance and
    should not be freed by the caller.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve encounter data for a specific difficulty
    code: "BossInfo* boss = ...;\nDifficulty diff = DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_HEROIC;\nconst\
      \ DungeonEncounterEntry* encounter = boss->GetDungeonEncounterForDifficulty(diff);\n\
      if (encounter)\n{\n    // Use encounter data\n    uint32 encounterId = encounter->ID;\n\
      \    // Process encounter logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during the initialization or setup phase of
    a raid encounter to fetch the correct encounter data based on the selected difficulty.
    The implementation likely relies on internal mappings between bosses and their
    respective encounters for each difficulty level, which are defined in the game's
    database or configuration files.
  warnings: The returned pointer may be null if no dungeon encounter is defined for
    the specified difficulty. Always check for null before using the returned value
    to avoid dereferencing a nullptr. Additionally, ensure that the provided difficulty
    parameter is valid and corresponds to an actual encounter in the game's data structure.
