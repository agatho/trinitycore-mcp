documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the account name associated with the current WorldSession.
  description: The GetAccountName method returns a constant reference to a std::string
    containing the account name linked to the current WorldSession. This method is
    typically used during authentication and session management to identify the player's
    account. The returned string represents the login identifier used to authenticate
    the user in the TrinityCore system. This value is populated during the login process
    when the session is established and should remain consistent throughout the session's
    lifetime. The method does not perform any validation or modification of the account
    name; it simply provides access to the stored value.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the account name associated
    with this WorldSession. The string is guaranteed to be valid and non-empty for
    authenticated sessions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogin(WorldSession* session)\n{\n    const std::string&\
      \ accountName = session->GetAccountName();\n    sLog->outString(\"Player logging\
      \ in with account: %s\", accountName.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Account Name Validation
    code: "bool ValidateSessionAccount(WorldSession* session)\n{\n    const std::string&\
      \ accountName = session->GetAccountName();\n    if (accountName.empty())\n \
      \   {\n        return false;\n    }\n    // Additional validation logic here\n\
      \    return true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as long as the WorldSession object itself is not
    being modified concurrently. The returned string reference is valid only for the
    lifetime of the WorldSession object and should not be stored or used after the
    session has been destroyed. The account name is typically set during the login
    process and reflects the username used to authenticate with the authentication
    server.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned string reference as it points to internal session
    data. Attempting to modify this value may cause undefined behavior. Ensure that
    the session is properly authenticated before calling this method, as unauthenticated
    sessions might return empty or invalid account names.
