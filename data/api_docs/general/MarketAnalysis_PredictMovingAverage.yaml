  brief: Predicts the moving average price of an item in the auction house
  description: The PredictMovingAverage method calculates and returns a predicted
    moving average price for a specified item in the auction house. This prediction
    is based on historical price data and market trends, using a moving average algorithm
    to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term patterns. The
    method takes an item ID and a time horizon (in hours) to forecast the average
    price over that period. It's commonly used for market analysis and helps players
    make informed decisions about buying or selling items. The prediction is updated
    regularly based on new auction data and market conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item in the auction house database.
      Must correspond to a valid item entry in the game's item database.
  - name: hoursAhead
    description: The number of hours into the future for which to predict the moving
      average price. Valid range is typically 1-24 hours, though implementation may
      vary.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the predicted moving average price of
    the specified item. The value represents the expected average price in gold coins.
    Returns 0.0 if the item has insufficient historical data or if an error occurs
    during calculation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: float predictedPrice = marketAnalysis->PredictMovingAverage(18732, 6); //
      Predict price for item ID 18732 6 hours ahead
    language: cpp
  - title: Market Analysis with Error Handling
    code: "float result = marketAnalysis->PredictMovingAverage(34567, 12);\nif (result\
      \ > 0.0f)\n{\n    printf(\"Predicted moving average price: %.2f gold\\n\", result);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"Insufficient data for prediction\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on historical auction house data which may not always
    be available or up-to-date. The accuracy of predictions decreases with longer
    time horizons. Implementation uses a simple moving average algorithm and may be
    enhanced with more sophisticated forecasting techniques in future versions.
  warnings: The prediction is based on historical trends and may not account for sudden
    market disruptions, events, or external factors affecting item prices. Results
    should be used as guidance only and not as absolute price forecasts.
