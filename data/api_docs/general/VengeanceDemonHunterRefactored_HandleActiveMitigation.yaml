  signature: void VengeanceDemonHunterRefactored::HandleActiveMitigation()
documentation:
  brief: Applies active mitigation effects for the Vengeance Demon Hunter class.
  description: The HandleActiveMitigation method manages the application and logic
    of active mitigation abilities specific to the Vengeance Demon Hunter specialization.
    This method typically handles the activation, duration, and effects of defensive
    abilities such as Vengeance's damage reduction mechanics or other mitigation cooldowns.
    It ensures that the player's mitigation state is properly updated based on game
    rules and class-specific mechanics. The method may interact with the player's
    current health, incoming damage calculations, and ability cooldown tracking systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void MyDemonHunterAI::OnDamageTaken(Unit* attacker, uint32& damage)\n{\n\
      \    // Apply active mitigation before damage is processed\n    m_vengeanceHandler.HandleActiveMitigation();\n\
      \    // Continue with normal damage processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during combat events when mitigation effects
    need to be evaluated. It may internally check for ability availability, player
    state, and cooldowns before applying any mitigation. The method is likely part
    of a larger AI or combat system that manages class-specific abilities.
  warnings: Ensure this method is only called in appropriate contexts (e.g., during
    combat events) to avoid unintended behavior. Improper invocation may cause incorrect
    mitigation application or performance issues.
