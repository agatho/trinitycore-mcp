documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the ObjectGuid represents a pet entity.
  description: The IsPet() method checks if the current ObjectGuid refers to a pet
    creature in the World of Warcraft game world. This method examines the type bits
    within the GUID to identify if it belongs to the pet category, which includes
    both player pets and guardian pets such as summoned creatures or companions. The
    check is performed using the internal GUID structure and does not require additional
    database lookups or network calls. This functionality is commonly used in AI logic,
    combat systems, and pet management code within TrinityCore's core.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ObjectGuid represents a pet entity; otherwise returns
    false. A pet GUID has specific type bits set that distinguish it from other object
    types like players, creatures, game objects, or items.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pet GUID Check
    code: "ObjectGuid petGuid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Pet>(12345);\nif (petGuid.IsPet())\
      \ {\n    printf(\"This is a pet GUID\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"This is\
      \ not a pet GUID\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsPet in Combat Logic
    code: "void HandleCombat(Unit* attacker, Unit* target) {\n    if (target->GetGUID().IsPet())\
      \ {\n        // Special handling for pet targets\n        attacker->AddThreat(target,\
      \ 10.0f);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on the internal structure of ObjectGuid where type information
    is encoded in specific bits. It's important to note that this check only validates
    the GUID's type and does not verify if the actual object still exists in the world
    or is valid. The implementation is optimized for performance and uses bit manipulation
    rather than string comparisons.
  warnings: Be aware that IsPet() returns false for all non-pet GUIDs, including player
    GUIDs, creature GUIDs, and item GUIDs. This method should not be used as a substitute
    for checking if an object actually exists in the world or is currently active.
    Also, when working with dynamic GUIDs, ensure proper synchronization if accessed
    from multiple threads.
