  class: Unit
  method: GetFlightCapabilityID
  signature: int32 Unit::GetFlightCapabilityID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the flight capability ID that determines the player's ability to
    fly in specific zones.
  description: The GetFlightCapabilityID method retrieves the unique identifier associated
    with a unit's flight capabilities, which governs whether the unit can fly in certain
    areas or regions. This value is typically used by the game engine to determine
    if a player has access to flying capabilities within a specific zone or if they
    are restricted from flying due to various conditions such as level requirements,
    faction restrictions, or zone-specific flight rules. The method returns an integer
    that corresponds to a specific flight capability ID in the game's database, which
    can be used for checking against known flight capability IDs to determine if a
    unit is allowed to fly.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the flight capability ID. This value typically
    corresponds to a specific entry in the game's flight capability database and may
    be used to determine whether a unit can fly in certain zones or regions based
    on their current flight capabilities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int32 flightCapabilityID = unit->GetFlightCapabilityID();\nif (flightCapabilityID\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Unit can fly in the specified zone\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other flight-related methods
    to determine if a unit has access to flying capabilities. The returned value may
    be compared against known flight capability IDs to validate whether a unit is
    allowed to fly in certain zones.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with other
    flight-related APIs, as incorrect usage could lead to inappropriate flight restrictions
    or allow unauthorized flying access.
