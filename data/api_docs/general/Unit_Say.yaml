  class: Unit

  signature: void Unit::Say(uint32 textId, const int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Makes the unit speak a specified text ID aloud
  description: The Say method allows a Unit (such as a player or NPC) to speak a specific
    text ID in the game world. This method is commonly used for emotes, dialogue,
    or announcements within the TrinityCore framework. The textId parameter refers
    to a predefined text entry in the database, and the target parameter specifies
    the intended audience for the message. The method does not return any value but
    can be used to trigger in-game events or display messages to players.
  parameters:
  - name: textId
    description: The unique identifier for a text entry in the database, typically
      used to reference predefined messages or emotes.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target player or object that will receive the message.
      If NULL, the message is broadcast to all players within range.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->Say(12345, NULL);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      Player* target = new Player();

      unit->Say(12345, target);

      // This will send the message to a specific player'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: The method internally uses the WorldPacket system
    to send messages to players. Performance considerations: This method should be
    used carefully in high-frequency scenarios as it may affect server performance
    if not handled properly.'
  warnings: 'Common mistakes: Using invalid textId values can cause server crashes
    or undefined behavior. Dangerous edge cases: If target is NULL, the message will
    broadcast to all players within range, which may result in spamming multiple players
    with the same message.'
