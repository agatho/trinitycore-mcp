  class: AccountScript

  signature: void AccountScript::OnPasswordChange(uint32 accountId)
documentation:
  brief: Called when an account password is changed, allowing scripts to perform custom
    actions.
  description: The OnPasswordChange method is a virtual callback function in the AccountScript
    class that is invoked whenever an account's password is successfully modified.
    This method provides a hook for custom script implementations to execute additional
    logic, such as logging the change, sending notifications, or updating related
    data structures when a player modifies their account password. The method receives
    the unique identifier of the affected account and does not return any value. It
    is part of TrinityCore's scripting system that allows developers to extend default
    behavior without modifying core game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: The unique identifier of the account whose password has been changed.
      This value corresponds to the 'id' field in the 'account' table of the TrinityCore
      database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Implementation Example
    code: "class MyAccountScript : public AccountScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnPasswordChange(uint32\
      \ accountId) override\n    {\n        // Log password change to custom table\
      \ or send notification\n        std::cout << \"Password changed for account\
      \ ID: \" << accountId << std::endl;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called after the password has been successfully updated in
    the database, so any modifications to account data should be safe. It is executed
    synchronously during the password change process and may affect performance if
    heavy operations are performed.
  warnings: Ensure that no sensitive data is logged or exposed within this callback,
    as it may be triggered by any password change operation. Avoid performing blocking
    operations in this method to prevent delays in the account password update process.
