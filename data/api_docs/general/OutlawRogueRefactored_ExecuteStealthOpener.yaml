  class: OutlawRogueRefactored
  method: ExecuteStealthOpener
  signature: void OutlawRogueRefactored::ExecuteStealthOpener(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the stealth opener ability for an Outlaw rogue, applying stealth
    and initiating a damaging combo point generator.
  description: The ExecuteStealthOpener method represents a core combat action for
    Outlaw rogues in TrinityCore's implementation. This method activates the rogue's
    stealth state, typically using the Stealth ability, followed by an immediate application
    of a high-damage combo point generator such as Ambush or Garrote. The method is
    designed to be called during combat when the rogue has sufficient energy and is
    in a position to benefit from the stealth advantage. It assumes that the rogue
    is already in a combat-ready state with appropriate target selection and positioning.
    This action is typically used at the beginning of an encounter or as a response
    to specific tactical situations where stealth provides a significant advantage.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target unit that will be affected by the stealth opener.
      The target must be valid and within combat range for the ability to execute
      properly.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecuteStealthOpener
    code: 'OutlawRogueRefactored rogue;

      Unit* target = player->GetVictim();

      rogue.ExecuteStealthOpener(&target);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with error checking
    code: "OutlawRogueRefactored rogue;\nif (player->IsInCombat() && player->GetVictim())\
      \ {\n    Unit* target = player->GetVictim();\n    rogue.ExecuteStealthOpener(&target);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle invalid state\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the rogue has sufficient energy and that the target is
    valid. The implementation should handle cases where stealth cannot be applied
    due to environmental or game state constraints. Performance considerations include
    checking for valid targets and ensuring proper cooldown management.
  warnings: The method may fail if called outside of combat or when the rogue lacks
    sufficient resources. Calling this method without a valid target pointer can result
    in undefined behavior. Ensure that the target is within appropriate range before
    execution.
