documentation:
  brief: Destroys a PlayerbotResultSet object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the PlayerbotResultSet class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the object's lifetime. This includes releasing any internal data structures, freeing
    memory pools, and ensuring no dangling pointers remain after the object is destroyed.
    In the context of TrinityCore's playerbot AI system, this method ensures proper
    cleanup of result sets that contain bot action recommendations or query outcomes.
    The destructor is automatically invoked when a PlayerbotResultSet object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of PlayerbotResultSet
    code: 'PlayerbotResultSet* resultSet = new PlayerbotResultSet();

      // ... use the result set ...

      delete resultSet; // Triggers ~PlayerbotResultSet()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic destruction via stack allocation
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    PlayerbotResultSet resultSet;\n    // ... use\
      \ resultSet ...\n    // Destructor automatically called when function exits\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly virtual in the base class, ensuring proper cleanup
    of derived classes. It's important to note that this destructor should not be
    called directly unless you're managing memory manually. The destruction process
    typically involves cleaning up internal collections and releasing any held references
    to other objects.
  warnings: Do not call this destructor explicitly unless you are implementing custom
    memory management. Also, ensure that no other objects hold references to the PlayerbotResultSet
    before it is destroyed to prevent dangling pointer issues.
