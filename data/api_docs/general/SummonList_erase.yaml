  method: erase
  signature: iterator SummonList::erase(iterator i)
documentation:
  brief: Removes the element at the specified iterator position from the summon list
    and returns an iterator to the next element.
  description: The erase method removes a specific element from the SummonList container
    at the position indicated by the provided iterator. It invalidates the iterator
    passed as an argument, but returns an iterator pointing to the next element in
    the list. This operation is typically used when managing summoned creatures or
    game objects within the TrinityCore framework, where summons are tracked in lists
    for cleanup and management purposes. The method ensures proper removal of the
    summon from internal tracking structures while maintaining list integrity.
  parameters: []
  returns: An iterator pointing to the element that follows the removed element. If
    the removed element was the last element in the list, the returned iterator will
    be equal to end().
  examples:
  - title: Removing a Summon from List
    code: 'SummonList summonList;

      // ... populate summonList with summons ...

      auto it = summonList.begin();

      ++it; // Point to second summon

      it = summonList.erase(it); // Remove second summon and get iterator to third'
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Removal in Loop
    code: "for (auto it = summonList.begin(); it != summonList.end();) {\n    if (shouldRemove(*it))\
      \ {\n        it = summonList.erase(it); // erase returns next valid iterator\n\
      \    } else {\n        ++it;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method operates in O(1) time complexity for the removal operation, as
    it's a standard doubly-linked list implementation. The returned iterator is guaranteed
    to be valid and points to the next element after the erased one. When working
    with summons, ensure that any associated resources are properly cleaned up before
    calling erase.
  warnings: Modifying a SummonList while iterating through it without proper handling
    of the returned iterator can lead to undefined behavior or skipped elements. Always
    use the returned iterator for subsequent operations in loops. Be cautious when
    erasing elements that may be referenced elsewhere in the codebase.
