documentation:
  brief: Executes AI behavior when the creature first appears in the world
  description: The JustAppeared method is a callback function invoked by SmartAI when
    a creature or game object first becomes visible in the world. This method is typically
    used to initialize AI behaviors, set up initial states, or trigger events that
    should occur only once upon appearance. It's called during the creature's initial
    spawn or respawn sequence, before any other AI updates begin. The method serves
    as an entry point for custom AI logic that needs to execute immediately when the
    entity becomes active in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic JustAppeared Implementation
    code: "void SmartAI::JustAppeared()\n{\n    // Set initial AI state\n    SetCombatMovement(false);\n\
      \    \n    // Play initial animation or sound\n    if (GetCreature()->GetEntry()\
      \ == 12345)\n        GetCreature()->PlayEmote(EMOTE_STATE_READY);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced JustAppeared with Conditional Logic
    code: "void SmartAI::JustAppeared()\n{\n    // Initialize based on spawn conditions\n\
      \    if (GetCreature()->IsSummon())\n    {\n        // Set up summoned creature\
      \ behavior\n        SetReactState(REACT_PASSIVE);\n        SetCombatMovement(false);\n\
      \        GetCreature()->SetFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS, UNIT_FLAG_NON_ATTACKABLE);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Regular creature setup\n        SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n\
      \        SetCombatMovement(true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called only once per creature appearance, not on every respawn.
    It's typically invoked after the creature has been fully initialized in the world
    but before any AI tick processing begins. The method should be used for one-time
    initialization rather than repeated behavior.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy operations or database queries within JustAppeared
    as it may block the main thread during creature spawn. Do not call methods that
    modify the creature's state in ways that might conflict with other AI systems.
