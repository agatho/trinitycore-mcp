    spell needs to be interrupted due to various game mechanics such as being stunned,

    of interrupt events between the caster and the target's owner, ensuring proper
    game state tracking and synchronization.

    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(caster, spellId);

      spell->SendSpellInterruptLog(victim, spellId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically called when a spell interrupt occurs during gameplay.
    It ensures that the victim's owner receives proper notification about the spell
    interruption event.
  warnings: This method should only be called when a spell actually interrupts, not
    when it simply fails or is canceled. Improper usage may lead to incorrect game
    state tracking.
