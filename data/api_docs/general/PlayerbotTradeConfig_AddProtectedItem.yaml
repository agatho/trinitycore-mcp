  class: PlayerbotTradeConfig
  method: AddProtectedItem
  signature: void PlayerbotTradeConfig::AddProtectedItem(uint32 itemEntry)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a specified item entry to the player bot's protected items list for
    trading.
  description: The AddProtectedItem method adds a given item entry ID to the internal
    list of protected items within the PlayerbotTradeConfig class. This configuration
    determines which items a player bot will not trade away, regardless of other trading
    rules or conditions. The method is typically used in player bot AI logic to ensure
    certain valuable or essential items remain in the bot's inventory during trading
    operations. Items added via this method are usually considered non-tradable by
    the bot's trading system and will be excluded from any automatic trading decisions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Protect a Common Item
    code: 'PlayerbotTradeConfig tradeConfig;

      tradeConfig.AddProtectedItem(12345); // Protects item with entry ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Protect Multiple Items in Loop
    code: "PlayerbotTradeConfig tradeConfig;\nstd::vector<uint32> protectedItems =\
      \ {12345, 67890, 54321};\nfor (uint32 item : protectedItems)\n{\n    tradeConfig.AddProtectedItem(item);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the PlayerbotTradeConfig object.
    It is recommended to call this during bot initialization or configuration setup
    rather than during active trading operations to avoid potential race conditions
    or inconsistent behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that item entry IDs passed to this method are valid and exist in
    the game's item database; invalid entries may cause unexpected behavior or errors
    during bot operation.
