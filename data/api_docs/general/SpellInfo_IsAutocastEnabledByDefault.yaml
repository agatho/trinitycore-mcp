  brief: Determines whether a spell is enabled for automatic casting by default.
  description: This method checks if a spell has automatic casting enabled by default,
    meaning it will automatically cast without player intervention. The method returns
    true if the spell is configured to auto-cast, false otherwise. This functionality
    is commonly used for spells that are designed to be cast automatically when certain
    conditions are met, such as self-casting or passive effects. The behavior of this
    method depends on the spell's configuration in the database and its associated
    flags.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell is enabled for automatic casting by default,
    false otherwise. This indicates whether the spell will automatically cast without
    player intervention.

      \    // Perform actions accordingly\n}"

  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
