  class: RiptideTracker
  method: RemoveRiptide
  signature: void RiptideTracker::RemoveRiptide(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a Riptide aura from the specified unit identified by its GUID.
  description: The RemoveRiptide method is responsible for removing the Riptide spell
    effect from a target unit within the World of Warcraft environment. This method
    is typically invoked when the Riptide aura expires, is dispelled, or is intentionally
    removed through game mechanics such as talent changes or ability overrides. The
    method operates on the internal tracking system that manages active Riptide effects
    and ensures proper cleanup of associated data structures. It is commonly used
    in conjunction with other healing spell management systems to maintain accurate
    state tracking for player and NPC units.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the unit from which the Riptide aura
      should be removed. This GUID must correspond to a valid GameObject, Creature,
      or Player object within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'RiptideTracker tracker;

      tracker.RemoveRiptide(12345); // Removes Riptide from unit with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Spell Effect Handling
    code: "void HandleRiptideRemoval(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (target)\n    {\n  \
      \      RiptideTracker tracker;\n        tracker.RemoveRiptide(target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GUID provided corresponds to a unit that currently
    has an active Riptide aura. If called with an invalid or non-existent GUID, it
    may result in undefined behavior or silent failure. The internal implementation
    likely involves checking if the specified unit is tracked and removing its entry
    from the active aura list.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the target unit actually has
    an active Riptide aura may lead to incorrect state management. Additionally, ensure
    thread safety when calling this method from different execution contexts, as it
    may interact with shared data structures.
