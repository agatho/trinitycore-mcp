  method: GetMapIdForSpawning
  signature: int32 TransportBase::GetMapIdForSpawning() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the map ID associated with the transport's spawning location.
  description: The GetMapIdForSpawning method returns the unique identifier of the
    map where the transport object is set to spawn. This value determines the game
    world context in which the transport will be initialized and managed. The returned
    map ID is crucial for proper transport placement within the game environment,
    ensuring that transports appear on the correct maps and interact with the appropriate
    zone data. This method does not perform any validation or modification of internal
    state; it simply retrieves a pre-configured map identifier used during object
    initialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int32 value representing the map ID where this transport should spawn.
    A negative value may indicate an invalid or uninitialized state, while positive
    values correspond to valid map identifiers in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "TransportBase* transport = ...;\nint32 mapId = transport->GetMapIdForSpawning();\n\
      if (mapId > 0)\n{\n    // Transport is configured for a valid map\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Transport spawns on map %d\", mapId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Spawn Logic
    code: "void InitializeTransport(TransportBase* transport)\n{\n    int32 spawnMapId\
      \ = transport->GetMapIdForSpawning();\n    if (spawnMapId <= 0)\n    {\n   \
      \     sLog->outError(\"Invalid spawn map ID for transport %u\", transport->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with spawning logic using the map ID\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during transport initialization and object
    creation. The returned value should be treated as read-only and is usually set
    during the transport's construction or configuration phase. It's important to
    note that this ID may not necessarily match the current map where the transport
    is located if it has been moved or relocated after spawning.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned map ID corresponds to the actual current
    map of the transport instance, as transports can be moved between maps during
    runtime. Always validate the return value before using it in critical game logic
    paths.
