  method: IsFormationLeader
  signature: bool FormationManager::IsFormationLeader() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current unit is the leader of a formation.
  description: The IsFormationLeader method checks if the calling unit is designated
    as the leader within its formation. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    formations are used to manage group behavior where units follow a specific leader.
    This method returns true if the unit is the formation leader, and false otherwise.
    The check typically involves examining internal formation data structures that
    track leadership relationships between units.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is the formation leader; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check formation leadership
    code: "if (unit->GetFormationManager()->IsFormationLeader()) {\n    // Unit is\
      \ the formation leader\n    // Perform leader-specific actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a combat behavior logic
    code: "void UnitAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (me->GetFormationManager()\
      \ && me->GetFormationManager()->IsFormationLeader()) {\n        // Execute leader-specific\
      \ AI behaviors\n        DoLeaderBehavior();\n    } else {\n        // Follow\
      \ formation rules as follower\n        FollowFormation();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in AI implementations to differentiate between
    leader and follower units within a formation. The method does not perform any
    complex calculations but relies on cached formation state information for performance
    reasons.
