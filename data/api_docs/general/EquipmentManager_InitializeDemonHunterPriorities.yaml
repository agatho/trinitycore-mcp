  brief: Initializes equipment priorities for Demon Hunter specializations
  description: Configures and sets up the default equipment priority rules for Demon
    Hunters within the game. This method establishes the ordering and weighting of
    gear items based on specialization requirements, ensuring that Demon Hunters receive
    optimal equipment recommendations during gameplay. The initialization process
    typically occurs during character creation or when switching to a Demon Hunter
    class, setting up internal data structures that influence item evaluation and
    recommendation algorithms.

  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'EquipmentManager* mgr = sObjectMgr->GetEquipmentManager();

      mgr->InitializeDemonHunterPriorities();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically during character initialization
    for Demon Hunters. It sets up internal priority tables that are used by the equipment
    manager's evaluation system to determine optimal gear choices based on specialization.
