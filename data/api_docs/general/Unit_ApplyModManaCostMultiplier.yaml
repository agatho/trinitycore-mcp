documentation:
  brief: Applies a multiplier to the mana cost of spells and abilities.
  description: This method modifies the mana cost of spells and abilities by applying
    a multiplier factor. It is commonly used in World of Warcraft to adjust mana costs
    for different classes, talents, or effects. The method can be used to increase
    or decrease mana costs based on the multiplier value provided. When applied, it
    affects all spells and abilities that use mana as their resource, including those
    with direct mana cost or those affected by mana cost modifiers.
  parameters:
  - name: manaCostMultiplier
    description: The multiplier factor to apply to mana costs. A value of 1.0 means
      no change, values less than 1.0 reduce mana cost, and values greater than 1.0
      increase mana cost.
  - name: apply
    description: If true, the multiplier is applied; if false, the multiplier is removed
      or reset to default state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying Mana Cost Multiplier
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetUnit();

      unit->ApplyModManaCostMultiplier(1.5f, true);

      // This increases mana cost by 50% for all spells

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell modifiers or
    effects to adjust mana costs dynamically. It may be applied during specific events
    like talent points or class abilities, and should be used carefully to avoid unintended
    side effects on gameplay balance.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unbalanced gameplay, especially
    if applied without proper consideration of game mechanics. Care should be taken
    when applying multipliers to ensure they align with intended gameplay behavior.
