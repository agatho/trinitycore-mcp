  signature: bool SpellInfo::CheckTargetCreatureType(const Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the spell target is of the correct creature type.
  description: This method verifies whether the target unit matches the creature type
    specified in the spell's target requirements. It is commonly used in spell validation
    to ensure that the target meets the necessary criteria for the spell to be cast
    successfully. The method evaluates the target's creature type against the spell's
    defined target creature type, returning true if they match and false otherwise.
    This functionality is crucial for maintaining game balance and ensuring proper
    spell execution.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Unit object representing the target of the spell.
      This parameter must be valid and cannot be nullptr. The target unit's creature
      type determines whether the spell can be cast successfully.
  returns: Returns true if the target creature type matches the spell's required creature
    type, false otherwise. This indicates whether the spell can proceed with the given
    target or not.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spellInfo->CheckTargetCreatureType(target)) {\n    // Spell can proceed\n\
      } else {\n    // Spell cannot proceed\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during spell validation and execution checks.
    It should be called with a valid target unit pointer to avoid undefined behavior.
    The method performs a simple creature type comparison, making it efficient for
    use in performance-critical code sections.
  warnings: This method requires that the target parameter is not nullptr. Passing
    nullptr will result in undefined behavior or crashes. Additionally, this method
    should only be used when the spell's target requirements are properly set up and
    validated.
