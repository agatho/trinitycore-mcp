  class: LfgPlayerData
  method: SetTeam
  signature: void LfgPlayerData::SetTeam(uint8 team)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's current LFG team assignment.
  description: The SetTeam method assigns a player to a specific LFG (Looking for
    Group) team within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically used during
    group matching processes or when a player joins or leaves a group. The team parameter
    specifies which team the player belongs to, usually represented as a numeric identifier.
    This assignment affects the player's visibility in LFG queues and their ability
    to join specific group activities. The method does not validate the team ID against
    predefined team definitions, so it's important that valid team values are passed
    to avoid unexpected behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: team
    description: The team identifier to assign the player to. This is typically a
      uint8 value representing a specific LFG team (e.g., 0 for none, 1-255 for different
      team assignments). Valid values should align with the internal LFG team definitions
      used by the TrinityCore system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Assign Player to Team 1
    code: 'LfgPlayerData playerData;

      playerData.SetTeam(1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Set Player to No Team
    code: 'LfgPlayerData playerData;

      playerData.SetTeam(0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal player data structures related to
    LFG team assignments. It should be called only when the player's team membership
    needs to be updated, such as during group creation or reassignment. The method
    does not trigger any additional side effects or notifications; other systems must
    handle the propagation of team changes.
  warnings: Passing invalid team IDs (e.g., values outside expected range) may lead
    to undefined behavior or incorrect LFG queue matching. Ensure that team values
    are validated before calling this method, especially when dealing with user input
    or dynamic team assignments.
