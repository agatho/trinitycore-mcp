documentation:
  brief: Resets all statistics tracked by the GroupEventBus instance.
  description: The ResetStatistics method clears all accumulated statistical data
    within the GroupEventBus object. This includes resetting counters, timers, and
    any other metrics that may have been collected since the bus was initialized or
    last reset. The method is typically used to prepare the event bus for a new tracking
    period or to clear stale data before performing specific operations. It ensures
    that subsequent event handling starts with clean statistical state without affecting
    the core functionality of the group event system.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GroupEventBus* eventBus = new GroupEventBus();

      // ... perform some events and gather statistics ...

      eventBus->ResetStatistics(); // Clear all collected stats'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not affect the active event listeners or the operational
    state of the GroupEventBus. It only resets internal statistical tracking variables.
    The operation is thread-safe if the underlying implementation supports concurrent
    access.
