  signature: int FormationUtils::CalculateFormationCenterFromMembers(const int & members)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the formation center point based on the positions
    of group members.
  description: The CalculateFormationCenterFromMembers method determines the central
    position of a group or formation by analyzing the locations of all active members.
    This utility is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to
    manage group positioning, such as when players form a circle or line for raid
    mechanics, battleground strategies, or quest-related formations. The method processes
    member positions and computes an average or weighted center point that represents
    the collective location of the group. It assumes that all members are within a
    reasonable proximity and that their positions are valid for calculation purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated formation center.
    This typically corresponds to a unique identifier (GUID) or coordinate value used
    internally by the game engine to reference or position the group's central point
    in the world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int centerGuid = FormationUtils::CalculateFormationCenterFromMembers(members);\n\
      if (centerGuid != 0)\n{\n    // Use the returned GUID to position or reference\
      \ the formation center\n    // For example, setting a summon point or visual\
      \ marker\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger formation management system and may
    be used in conjunction with other methods such as GetMemberPositions() or SetFormationCenter().
    The calculation might involve averaging coordinates or using more complex algorithms
    depending on the specific game mechanics implemented. Performance-wise, this function
    should be lightweight since it only processes existing member data.
  warnings: Ensure that all members passed to this method have valid positions before
    calling; otherwise, the result may be inaccurate or undefined. Also, be aware
    that if no members are present in the group, the method might return an invalid
    value or throw an error depending on implementation details.
