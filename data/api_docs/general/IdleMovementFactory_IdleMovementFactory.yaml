documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the IdleMovementFactory class for managing
    idle movement behaviors in AI.
  description: The IdleMovementFactory constructor initializes the factory object
    responsible for creating and managing idle movement behaviors for creatures or
    NPCs within the TrinityCore world. This factory is typically used by the AI system
    to generate appropriate idle movement patterns such as wandering, standing still,
    or performing minor animations while not engaged in combat or active tasks. The
    initialization process sets up internal data structures and configurations required
    for generating these idle movements. This method does not require any parameters
    and performs no direct operations on game objects; instead, it prepares the factory
    for subsequent usage through other methods like CreateIdleMovement().
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating an IdleMovementFactory instance
    code: 'IdleMovementFactory factory;

      // The factory is now initialized and ready to create idle movement behaviors

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the AI subsystem when
    a creature's AI behavior needs to be initialized with idle movement capabilities.
    Developers should not directly instantiate this class unless implementing custom
    AI logic that requires idle movement generation.
