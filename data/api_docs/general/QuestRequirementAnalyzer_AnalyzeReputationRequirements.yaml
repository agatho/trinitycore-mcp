  class: QuestRequirementAnalyzer
  method: AnalyzeReputationRequirements
  signature: void QuestRequirementAnalyzer::AnalyzeReputationRequirements(const Quest
    * quest, Player * bot, int & issues)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes reputation requirements for a quest and updates the issue counter
    for the bot player.
  description: The AnalyzeReputationRequirements method evaluates whether a given
    quest's reputation prerequisites are met by the specified player bot. It checks
    if the player has sufficient standing with the required factions to accept and
    complete the quest. The method modifies the issues parameter to reflect any reputation-related
    problems that would prevent the bot from taking the quest. This functionality
    is essential for automated questing systems in TrinityCore-based emulators, ensuring
    bots only attempt quests they are qualified for based on faction standings.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object containing reputation requirements to
      be analyzed
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose reputation
      is being checked against quest requirements
  - name: issues
    description: Reference to an integer that will be incremented if reputation-related
      issues are found preventing quest acceptance
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reputation Analysis
    code: "Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\nPlayer* bot = ...;\
      \ // Bot player object\nint issueCount = 0;\nquestAnalyzer.AnalyzeReputationRequirements(quest,\
      \ bot, issueCount);\nif (issueCount > 0) {\n    // Handle reputation issues\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in automated questing logic where bots need
    to evaluate their eligibility for quests before attempting them. The method does
    not perform any actions on the player or quest objects themselves, but rather
    evaluates the relationship between them. It's important that the bot player object
    has valid faction data loaded for accurate analysis.
  warnings: The method assumes that both the quest and bot parameters are valid non-null
    pointers. Passing null pointers will result in undefined behavior. The issues
    parameter is modified by reference, so ensure it's initialized appropriately before
    calling this method.
