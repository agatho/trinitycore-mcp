  brief: Checks for and handles stalled bots in the game world
  description: The CheckForStalledBots method performs periodic health checks on all
    active bot instances to detect and manage bots that have become unresponsive or
    stuck. It evaluates each bot's current state, including movement patterns, action
    queues, and response times to determine if a bot has stalled. When a stalled bot
    is detected, the method initiates appropriate cleanup procedures such as resetting
    the bot's state, clearing its action queue, or marking it for reinitialization.
    This functionality is crucial for maintaining server performance and preventing
    resource leaks from non-functional bot instances.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other updates ...\n\
      \    botHealthCheck.CheckForStalledBots(getMSTime());\n    // ... other updates\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the game loop with a reasonable
    frequency to ensure timely detection of stalled bots. The method internally uses
    time-based comparisons to determine staleness, so it's important that the currentTime
    parameter accurately reflects the current game time. Performance is optimized
    through efficient bot state tracking and minimal memory allocations during checks.
  warnings: Calling this method too infrequently may result in delayed detection of
    stalled bots, potentially leading to resource exhaustion. Avoid calling this method
    from multiple threads simultaneously without proper synchronization as it may
    cause race conditions in bot state management.
