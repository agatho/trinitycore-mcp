  class: MonkAI
  method: OptimizeFormManagement
  signature: void MonkAI::OptimizeFormManagement(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes form management for the Monk AI by determining the most effective
    combat stance or form based on target conditions.
  description: The OptimizeFormManagement method in the MonkAI class evaluates the
    current combat situation and determines the optimal form or stance for the monk
    character to assume. This method considers various factors such as target health,
    distance, threat level, and available abilities to make an informed decision about
    which form (e.g., Tiger Form, Bear Form, or other monk stances) will provide maximum
    effectiveness in the current scenario. The method is typically called during AI
    decision-making processes to ensure that the monk character maintains the most
    advantageous form for dealing damage, tanking, or supporting allies. It may also
    adjust form transitions based on cooldowns and resource management.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's current state or
      condition. This value is used to evaluate which form would be most beneficial
      for the monk AI to enter.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Monk AI Decision Loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (me->GetVictim())\n    {\n        int\
      \ targetState = GetTargetHealthPercentage();\n        OptimizeFormManagement(&targetState);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Form Transition Logic
    code: "void MonkAI::OptimizeFormManagement(int* target)\n{\n    if (*target <\
      \ 30) // Target is low health\n        ChangeToTigerForm();\n    else if (*target\
      \ > 70) // Target is high health\n        ChangeToBearForm();\n    else // Moderate\
      \ health\n        ChangeToMistForm();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI decision-making logic and should be invoked
    regularly during combat updates. The target parameter must be properly initialized
    before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior. Performance-wise, this
    method should execute quickly as it's called frequently in combat loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer passed to this method is valid and points
    to a meaningful value; otherwise, incorrect form transitions may occur. Do not
    call this method outside of combat contexts unless specifically designed for non-combat
    scenarios.
