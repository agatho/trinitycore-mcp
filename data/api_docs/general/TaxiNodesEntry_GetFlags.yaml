  signature: int TaxiNodesEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flag bits associated with a taxi node entry.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitmask
    flags for a taxi node. These flags define various properties and behaviors of
    the taxi node, such as whether it is a flight master, if it requires a specific
    quest to be accessible, or if it has special restrictions. The returned value
    can be used in bitwise operations to check for specific flag states. This method
    provides access to the internal flag configuration that determines how the taxi
    node behaves within the game's transportation system.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the bitmask flags for this taxi node entry. Each
    bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific property or restriction of
    the taxi node, such as accessibility conditions, flight master status, or special
    requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Check if taxi node is a flight master
    code: "TaxiNodesEntry* node = sTaxiNodesStore.LookupEntry(12345);\nif (node &&\
      \ (node->GetFlags() & 0x1)) {\n    // Node is a flight master\n    printf(\"\
      This node is a flight master\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check multiple taxi node flags
    code: "TaxiNodesEntry* node = sTaxiNodesStore.LookupEntry(54321);\nint flags =\
      \ node->GetFlags();\nif (flags & 0x2) {\n    // Node requires a quest to be\
      \ accessible\n    printf(\"Quest required for access\\n\");\n}\nif (flags &\
      \ 0x4) {\n    // Node is only available during certain conditions\n    printf(\"\
      Conditional access\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flag values are defined by the game's internal taxi node database and
    may vary between different versions of TrinityCore. Developers should consult
    the relevant database schema or documentation to understand the meaning of specific
    flag bits. The returned value is a direct copy of the internal flags field and
    should not be modified directly.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned flag value directly as it represents the original
    data in the database. Always use bitwise operations when checking for specific
    flag states rather than comparing against raw values, as new flags may be added
    in future updates.
