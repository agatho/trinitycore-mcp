documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new ObjectGuid instance with an empty or null GUID value.
  description: The ObjectGuid constructor initializes a new ObjectGuid object, typically
    setting it to an empty or invalid GUID state. This default constructor is used
    when creating ObjectGuid instances without providing an initial GUID value. In
    TrinityCore's context, ObjectGuid represents unique identifiers for game objects,
    players, creatures, and other entities within the world. The initialized GUID
    will have a value that indicates it is not associated with any valid object until
    explicitly set. This constructor is essential for declaring ObjectGuid variables
    that will be assigned later in the code.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic ObjectGuid Initialization
    code: "ObjectGuid guid;\n// Creates a new ObjectGuid with empty/invalid GUID value\n\
      if (guid.IsEmpty()) {\n    // Handle empty GUID case\n    printf(\"GUID is not\
      \ set\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating ObjectGuid in Class Member
    code: "class Player {\nprivate:\n    ObjectGuid m_guid;\npublic:\n    Player()\
      \ : m_guid() { /* Default constructor initializes empty GUID */ }\n    void\
      \ SetPlayerGUID(ObjectGuid guid) { m_guid = guid; }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The default ObjectGuid constructor creates an object with a value that represents
    an invalid or empty GUID. This is different from a zero-value GUID, which may
    have specific meaning in certain contexts within TrinityCore. Developers should
    always check if a GUID is valid before using it for lookups or operations.
  warnings: Using an uninitialized ObjectGuid (created with default constructor) in
    operations that require a valid GUID can lead to undefined behavior or runtime
    errors. Always validate GUIDs before use, especially when dealing with database
    lookups or object references.
