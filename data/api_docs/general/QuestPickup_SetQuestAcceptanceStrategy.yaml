  class: QuestPickup
  method: SetQuestAcceptanceStrategy
  signature: void QuestPickup::SetQuestAcceptanceStrategy(uint32 botGuid, QuestAcceptanceStrategy
    strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the quest acceptance strategy for a specified bot GUID.
  description: Configures how a bot should handle quest acceptance based on a provided
    strategy. This method allows developers to define whether the bot will automatically
    accept quests, require manual confirmation, or follow specific conditional logic.
    The strategy determines the behavior during quest interaction and can influence
    bot performance and quest completion rates in automated gameplay scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which the quest acceptance
      strategy is being set. Must be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  - name: strategy
    description: The quest acceptance strategy to apply to the specified bot. This
      value determines how the bot will respond when presented with a quest, such
      as accepting automatically or requiring confirmation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Automatic Quest Acceptance
    code: QuestPickup::SetQuestAcceptanceStrategy(123456, QUEST_ACCEPTANCE_AUTO);
    language: cpp
  - title: Configure Manual Quest Acceptance
    code: QuestPickup::SetQuestAcceptanceStrategy(789012, QUEST_ACCEPTANCE_MANUAL);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in bot AI implementations where automated quest
    handling needs to be customized. It's important to ensure that the provided GUID
    corresponds to an active bot instance within the game world.
  warnings: Setting an invalid strategy value may result in undefined behavior or
    prevent the bot from accepting quests properly. Always validate the bot GUID before
    calling this method.
