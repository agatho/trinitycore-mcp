documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the interaction manager, cleaning up resources and stopping all
    active interactions.
  description: The Shutdown method is responsible for gracefully terminating all ongoing
    interactions managed by the InteractionManager class. It ensures that any active
    interactions are properly closed, resources are released, and internal state is
    reset. This method is typically called during server shutdown or when the interaction
    manager needs to be temporarily disabled. The method does not take any parameters
    and performs no return operations. It is designed to be thread-safe and should
    be invoked before the InteractionManager instance is destroyed to prevent resource
    leaks.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'InteractionManager* manager = new InteractionManager();

      // ... perform interactions ...

      manager->Shutdown();

      delete manager;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when no other threads are actively using
    the InteractionManager. It is recommended to ensure all pending interactions have
    completed before calling Shutdown to avoid potential race conditions.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown while interactions are still in progress may result in
    undefined behavior or resource leaks. Ensure that all interaction operations are
    properly synchronized and completed before invoking this method.
