  signature: void Group::SubGroupCounterIncrease(int subgroup)
documentation:
  brief: Increments the subgroup counter for the specified subgroup within the group.
  description: The SubGroupCounterIncrease method is used to increment a counter associated
    with a specific subgroup within a Group object. This functionality is typically
    utilized in World of Warcraft's grouping system to track various metrics or states
    related to individual subgroups, such as player counts, loot distribution statistics,
    or role assignments. The method modifies internal state data and ensures that
    the counter for the given subgroup is properly incremented. It is generally called
    during group operations like member additions, role changes, or when tracking
    subgroup-specific activities.
  parameters:
  - name: subgroup
    description: The index of the subgroup within the group whose counter should be
      incremented. Subgroup indices are typically zero-based and correspond to the
      internal structure of the group's subgroup organization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Incrementing a SubGroup Counter
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    int subgroupIndex\
      \ = 0; // Example: increment first subgroup\n    group->SubGroupCounterIncrease(subgroupIndex);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal counters that are used for group management
    and synchronization. It should only be called when the group is valid and the
    subgroup index is within acceptable bounds to prevent undefined behavior.
