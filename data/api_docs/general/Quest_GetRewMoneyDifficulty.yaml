  signature: uint32 Quest::GetRewMoneyDifficulty() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the money reward amount for the quest based on difficulty level.
  description: The GetRewMoneyDifficulty method retrieves the monetary reward value
    associated with a quest, taking into account the player's current difficulty level.
    This method is essential for determining how much gold a player will receive when
    completing a quest, especially in instances where quest rewards vary based on
    difficulty settings. The returned value represents the base amount of money that
    would be awarded to the player upon completion of the quest, assuming no additional
    modifiers or bonuses are applied.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the monetary reward amount for the
    quest. This value corresponds to the base gold reward that would be given to the
    player based on their current difficulty level, and can be zero if the quest has
    no monetary reward.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 reward = quest->GetRewMoneyDifficulty();\nif (reward > 0)\n{\n \
      \   // Player will receive reward gold\n    // Do something with the reward\
      \ value\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest reward methods
    to determine the complete reward structure for a quest. It should be noted that
    this value may not reflect the final amount received by players, as additional
    modifiers such as quest reward multipliers or player level differences can affect
    the actual reward.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with other
    reward methods, as the actual reward may differ from what is returned due to game
    mechanics like quest reward scaling and player level differences. Also note that
    this method returns zero for quests that do not have monetary rewards.
