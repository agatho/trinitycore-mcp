documentation:
  brief: Consumes a stack from the Feral Bloodtalons tracker, reducing its count by
    one.
  description: The ConsumeStack method is responsible for decrementing the internal
    stack count of the Feral Bloodtalons tracker. This functionality is typically
    used in conjunction with abilities or effects that require consuming a certain
    number of stacks to trigger their full effect. The method does not return any
    value and modifies the state of the tracker object directly. It's commonly found
    in gameplay mechanics related to feral druid talents, particularly those involving
    Bloodtalons or similar stacking effects.

  notes: This method assumes that the tracker has at least one stack available to
    consume. If called when no stacks remain, it may result in undefined behavior
    or silently fail depending on implementation details.
