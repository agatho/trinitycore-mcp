documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one StrategyFactory object to another, performing
    a deep copy of its internal strategy mappings and configurations.
  description: The operator= method implements the assignment operator for the StrategyFactory
    class. It performs a deep copy of all internal data members from the source StrategyFactory
    object to the target object. This includes copying any registered strategies,
    their configurations, and associated metadata. The method ensures that after assignment,
    both objects are independent copies with identical state. This is particularly
    important in AI systems where strategy factories manage different behavioral patterns
    for NPCs or players. The assignment operation returns a reference to the assigned
    object to allow for chaining operations.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source StrategyFactory object whose contents will be copied to
      this object
  returns: A reference to the current StrategyFactory object after assignment has
    been completed, enabling operator chaining such as factory1 = factory2 = factory3;
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment
    code: 'StrategyFactory factory1;

      StrategyFactory factory2;

      // ... populate factory1 with strategies ...

      factory2 = factory1; // Assigns all strategies from factory1 to factory2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment
    code: 'StrategyFactory factory1, factory2, factory3;

      // ... populate factories with strategies ...

      factory1 = factory2 = factory3; // All factories now contain identical strategy
      mappings'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a deep copy operation which may have performance implications
    when dealing with large strategy configurations. The implementation should properly
    handle memory management to prevent resource leaks or double-free errors. Since
    this is a fundamental assignment operator, it's recommended to implement proper
    copy semantics including handling of dynamically allocated resources.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning StrategyFactory objects that contain circular
    references or self-referencing strategies, as this could lead to infinite loops
    during deep copy operations. Also, ensure that any strategy objects being copied
    are properly initialized before assignment to avoid undefined behavior.
