documentation:
  brief: Initializes network-related script systems when the server starts up
  description: The OnNetworkStart method is called during the TrinityCore server initialization
    process to allow scripts to perform any necessary setup for network-related functionality.
    This method serves as a hook point for custom scripts to register network handlers,
    initialize network-dependent systems, or configure networking parameters before
    the server begins accepting client connections. It is invoked once during server
    startup and does not accept any parameters. The method is part of the global ScriptMgr
    singleton and is typically used by script developers who need to integrate custom
    networking behavior into the core TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Network Initialization Script
    code: "class MyNetworkScript : public ScriptObject\n{\npublic:\n    MyNetworkScript()\
      \ : ScriptObject(\"MyNetworkScript\") {}\n\n    void OnNetworkStart() override\n\
      \    {\n        // Initialize custom network handlers here\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Custom network initialization complete\");\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called very early in the server startup sequence, before any
    client connections are accepted. Scripts should avoid performing heavy operations
    or blocking calls within this method to prevent delays in server startup. The
    method is executed in the main thread context and must not spawn new threads without
    proper synchronization.
  warnings: Do not attempt to access or modify network connection states within this
    method as no clients are connected yet. Avoid throwing exceptions from this method
    as it may cause server initialization to fail. This method should be used sparingly
    and only for lightweight initialization tasks.
