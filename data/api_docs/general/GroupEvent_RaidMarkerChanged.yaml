documentation:
  brief: Creates a GroupEvent representing a raid marker change in a group
  description: The RaidMarkerChanged method constructs and returns a GroupEvent object
    that signifies when a raid marker has been updated or modified within a group
    context. This event is typically used to notify group members about changes to
    raid markers placed on the minimap or world map, which are commonly used for coordinating
    group activities such as targeting enemies, marking objectives, or indicating
    important locations during raids or dungeons. The method takes the group's GUID,
    the marker ID, and the position where the marker was placed to create a complete
    event representation.
  parameters:
  - name: groupGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group where the raid marker change
      occurred. This is typically a 32-bit integer representing the group's identifier
      in the game world.
  - name: markerId
    description: The ID of the raid marker that was changed. This value usually corresponds
      to predefined marker types such as 'Attack', 'Defend', 'Move', etc., and is
      used to determine how the marker should be displayed or interpreted by clients.
  - name: position
    description: The Position object containing the X, Y, and Z coordinates where
      the raid marker was placed. This represents the world location of the marker
      in the game environment.
  returns: A GroupEvent object representing the raid marker change event. The returned
    object contains all necessary information to propagate this event through the
    group system and notify other players.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of RaidMarkerChanged
    code: 'GroupEvent event = GroupEvent::RaidMarkerChanged(12345, 2, Position(100.0f,
      200.0f, 300.0f));

      // This creates an event for a marker change in group with GUID 12345

      // The marker ID is 2 (e.g., ''Defend''), located at position (100, 200, 300)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using RaidMarkerChanged in a raid context
    code: "void OnPlayerRaidMarkerUpdate(Player* player, uint32 markerId, Position\
      \ position)\n{\n    Group* group = player->GetGroup();\n    if (group)\n   \
      \ {\n        GroupEvent event = GroupEvent::RaidMarkerChanged(group->GetGUID().GetCounter(),\
      \ markerId, position);\n        group->BroadcastGroupEvent(event);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's group event system and is typically
    used internally by the server to handle raid marker updates. The Position object
    must be valid and within the bounds of the current map for proper functionality.
    Event propagation may depend on the group's settings and whether players are in
    range or have the appropriate permissions.
  warnings: Ensure that the group GUID is valid before calling this method, as invalid
    GUIDs can lead to undefined behavior. The markerId should correspond to a known
    raid marker type; otherwise, clients might not interpret it correctly. Avoid calling
    this method outside of proper game state contexts where group events are expected.
