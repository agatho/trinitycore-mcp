  class: MoveToPositionAction
  method: Execute
  signature: ActionResult MoveToPositionAction::Execute(BotAI * ai, const ActionContext
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a bot to move towards a specified position using the AI system.
  description: The MoveToPositionAction::Execute method is responsible for commanding
    a bot to navigate toward a designated location within the game world. This action
    integrates with the TrinityCore AI framework and utilizes pathfinding algorithms
    to determine the optimal route. The method typically retrieves target coordinates
    from the action context and instructs the bot's movement system to proceed towards
    that position, handling potential obstacles or dynamic environment changes during
    execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an ActionResult indicating whether the movement command was successfully
    initiated (e.g., ACTION_SUCCESS) or if there were issues such as invalid target
    coordinates or movement restrictions (e.g., ACTION_FAILED).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot AI Context
    code: "ActionResult result = moveToPositionAction.Execute(ai, context);\nif (result\
      \ == ACTION_SUCCESS)\n{\n    // Movement initiated successfully\n    ai->GetBot()->SetState(BOT_STATE_MOVING);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying movement system of TrinityCore and assumes
    that the target position is valid and reachable. It may interact with the bot's
    current state, pathfinding cache, and movement restrictions such as terrain or
    collision detection.
  warnings: Ensure that the target position provided in the ActionContext is within
    valid game boundaries to avoid undefined behavior or client-side errors. The method
    does not validate whether the bot can actually reach the destination due to environmental
    constraints.
