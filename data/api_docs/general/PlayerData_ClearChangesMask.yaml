  signature: void PlayerData::ClearChangesMask()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask for player data, resetting all tracked modifications.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask of a PlayerData
    object, effectively clearing any pending or tracked modifications to the player's
    data. This is typically used during synchronization processes where the server
    needs to reset the state of what has been modified since the last update. The
    method ensures that subsequent calls to change tracking functions will start fresh,
    without any residual flags from previous operations. It is commonly invoked when
    sending updates to clients or before applying bulk changes to player data.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PlayerData* playerData = ...;

      playerData->ClearChangesMask();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Update Cycle
    code: "void HandlePlayerUpdate(Player* player)\n{\n    PlayerData* data = player->GetPlayerData();\n\
      \    // Process changes\n    data->Update();\n    // Clear mask after sending\
      \ updates\n    data->ClearChangesMask();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not modify the actual player data itself, only the internal
    tracking mechanism. It's important to call this method at appropriate intervals
    during update cycles to prevent accumulation of stale change flags.
