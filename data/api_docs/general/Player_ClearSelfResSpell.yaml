documentation:
  brief: Clears the player's self-resurrection spell, removing any pending resurrection
    effects from the player.
  description: This method removes the player's self-resurrection spell from their
    character, effectively canceling any pending resurrection effect that may be active
    on them. It is typically used when a player is about to be resurrected by another
    player or when they are no longer eligible for self-resurrection. The method ensures
    that the player's resurrection state is properly reset and prevents any conflicts
    with future resurrection mechanics. This function is commonly called during player
    death handling or when transitioning between different game states.

      // Player''s self-resurrection spell is now cleared'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely clears internal spell tracking
    variables related to self-resurrection effects. Performance considerations: Since
    this method does not involve complex operations, it should have minimal performance
    impact. Thread safety: This method is generally safe to call from any thread context
    as long as the player object is valid.'
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player is no longer eligible
    for self-resurrection or when transitioning between game states. Calling this
    method inappropriately may lead to unexpected behavior during resurrection mechanics.
