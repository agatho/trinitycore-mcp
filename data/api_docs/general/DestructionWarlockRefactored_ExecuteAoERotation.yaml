documentation:
  brief: Executes the destruction warlock's AoE rotation logic for targeting multiple
    enemies
  description: The ExecuteAoERotation method implements the core logic for a destruction
    warlock's area-of-effect spell rotation. This method determines which abilities
    to cast based on available mana, enemy count, and combat conditions when multiple
    targets are present. It typically prioritizes high-damage AoE spells like Rain
    of Fire or Immolate applied to multiple enemies within range. The method assumes
    that the warlock has already identified a suitable target group and enemy count,
    and it focuses on optimizing spell usage for maximum damage output in an AoE scenario.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an array of target GUIDs or entity references representing
      the enemies to be targeted. The method will iterate through these targets to
      apply appropriate AoE spells.
  - name: enemyCount
    description: The number of enemies in the target group. This value determines
      how many targets the rotation logic should process and how many spells to cast.
  returns: null

      \ (uint32 i = 0; i < enemyCount && i < 5; ++i) { // Limit to 5 targets\n   \
      \     if (HasManaForSpell(Immolate)) {\n            CastSpell(Immolate, target[i]);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is part of the destruction warlock's AI behavior system and should
    be called only when multiple enemies are present. The implementation may vary
    depending on current spell cooldowns, mana levels, and enemy positioning. It's
    recommended to validate that target pointers are valid before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the target array or enemy
    count can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the target array
    contains valid entity references and that enemyCount is accurate to prevent overflows
    or incorrect spell targeting.
