  class: EvokerAI
  method: StartEmpoweredSpell
  signature: void EvokerAI::StartEmpoweredSpell(int spellId, EmpowermentLevel targetLevel,
    int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates an empowered spell cast for an evoker AI with specified target
    empowerment level.
  description: The StartEmpoweredSpell method begins the process of casting a spell
    that is enhanced by empowerment mechanics specific to the Evoker class in World
    of Warcraft. This function sets up the necessary state and parameters for an empowered
    spell, targeting a specific empowerment level. The method likely interacts with
    internal AI state tracking and spell casting systems to ensure proper execution
    of empowered abilities. It may also handle cooldowns, resource management, or
    other evoker-specific mechanics related to empowered spells.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The identifier of the spell to be cast in its empowered form. Must
      correspond to a valid evoker spell ID.
  - name: targetLevel
    description: The empowerment level that determines how the spell should be enhanced.
      Typically represents stages like 1, 2, or 3 for different empowerment tiers.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target of the empowered spell.
      May be used to store or retrieve target information during the casting process.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Empowered Spell Casting
    code: "EvokerAI* evoker = ...;\nint target = 42;\n evoker->StartEmpoweredSpell(34567,\
      \ EmpowermentLevel::LEVEL_2, &target);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the Evoker's AI behavior system and may interact
    with spell queues or casting state machines. The target parameter might be used
    for tracking or updating during spell execution.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId corresponds to a valid empowered evoker spell;
    otherwise, the spell may fail to cast properly. The target pointer should not
    be null.
