documentation:
  brief: Moves a QuestMenu object to another QuestMenu object, transferring ownership
    of its resources.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment on a QuestMenu object,
    transferring all resources from the source object to the target object. This operation
    is typically used in scenarios where temporary or intermediate QuestMenu objects
    need to be efficiently transferred without unnecessary copying. The move assignment
    ensures that the source object is left in a valid but unspecified state after
    the operation. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this
    method supports efficient handling of quest-related data structures during player
    interaction with NPCs and quest systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the destination QuestMenu object, allowing for chaining
    of assignment operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'QuestMenu menu1;

      QuestMenu menu2 = std::move(menu1); // Uses move constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      menu1 = std::move(menu2); // Uses move assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: In Quest Giver Context
    code: "void HandleQuestGiverHello(Player* player, Creature* questGiver) {\n  \
      \  QuestMenu newMenu;\n    // ... populate newMenu with quests ...\n    player->PlayerTalkClass->ClearMenus();\n\
      \    *player->PlayerTalkClass->GetQuestMenu() = std::move(newMenu);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the standard C++ move semantics and should be used
    carefully to avoid dangling references. The source object after a move assignment
    is left in a valid but unspecified state, meaning its contents should not be relied
    upon. In TrinityCore, this is particularly important when dealing with quest menus
    that are frequently updated during player interactions.
  warnings: Do not use the source object after performing a move assignment; doing
    so results in undefined behavior. Be cautious when chaining multiple move operations
    as they can lead to complex state management issues if not handled properly.
