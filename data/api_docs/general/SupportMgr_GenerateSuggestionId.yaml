  class: SupportMgr
  method: GenerateSuggestionId
  signature: int SupportMgr::GenerateSuggestionId()
documentation:
  brief: Generates a unique identifier for support suggestions within the TrinityCore
    system.
  description: The GenerateSuggestionId method creates and returns a unique integer
    identifier for tracking user-generated support suggestions in the World of Warcraft
    server environment. This identifier is used internally by the SupportMgr class
    to manage and reference specific suggestions submitted by players or administrators.
    The method ensures that each suggestion receives a distinct ID, which helps in
    organizing, retrieving, and processing support requests efficiently. It typically
    increments an internal counter or utilizes a database-generated sequence to maintain
    uniqueness across all generated IDs.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the unique identifier assigned to a newly
    created support suggestion. This ID is guaranteed to be unique within the scope
    of the current server session and database state, allowing for reliable referencing
    and tracking of individual suggestions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int suggestionId = sSupportMgr->GenerateSuggestionId();

      // Use suggestionId to store or reference a new support suggestion'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely thread-safe if used within the context of TrinityCore's
    single-threaded event loop or properly synchronized access patterns. The generated
    IDs are typically sequential or derived from a global counter, ensuring no collisions
    occur during normal operation.
