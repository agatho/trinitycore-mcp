  class: WorldSession
  method: HandleDBQueryBulk
  signature: void WorldSession::HandleDBQueryBulk(WorldPackets::Hotfix::DBQueryBulk
    & dbQuery)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a bulk database query request from the client, retrieving multiple
    records based on provided IDs.
  description: The HandleDBQueryBulk method handles incoming database query requests
    from players in World of Warcraft, specifically designed to process bulk queries
    for hotfix data. This method is part of TrinityCore's hotfix system that allows
    clients to fetch updated game data dynamically. It receives a DBQueryBulk packet
    containing multiple IDs and retrieves corresponding records from the database,
    typically used for fetching localized strings, item information, or other dynamic
    content that may change during game updates. The method operates within the WorldSession
    context, ensuring proper authentication and session management before executing
    database operations.
  parameters:
  - name: dbQuery
    description: A reference to a WorldPackets::Hotfix::DBQueryBulk packet containing
      the list of IDs to query from the database
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in session handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleDBQueryBulk(WorldPackets::Hotfix::DBQueryBulk\
      \ & dbQuery)\n{\n    // Process multiple database queries for hotfix data\n\
      \    for (auto const& id : dbQuery.IDs)\n    {\n        // Retrieve and send\
      \ back the corresponding database records\n        SendHotfixRecord(id);\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of TrinityCore's hotfix system implementation.
    It should be called only when the session has proper authentication and the client
    is authorized to receive hotfix data. The method assumes that database connections
    are properly established and that the requested IDs exist in the corresponding
    hotfix tables.
  warnings: Improper handling of DBQueryBulk requests may lead to excessive database
    load or security vulnerabilities if not properly validated. Ensure all incoming
    IDs are sanitized and authorized before processing. This method should not be
    used for regular gameplay data retrieval as it's specifically designed for hotfix
    operations.
