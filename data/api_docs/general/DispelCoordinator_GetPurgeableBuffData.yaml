  class: DispelCoordinator
  method: GetPurgeableBuffData
  signature: const PurgeableBuff * DispelCoordinator::GetPurgeableBuffData(uint32
    auraId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves purgeable buff data associated with a specific aura ID from the
    dispel coordinator.
  description: The GetPurgeableBuffData method fetches the PurgeableBuff structure
    that corresponds to a given aura identifier. This function is used within the
    context of aura management and dispelling mechanics in TrinityCore, particularly
    when determining which buffs can be removed through purging effects. It acts as
    a lookup mechanism for predefined purgeable buff configurations stored internally
    by the DispelCoordinator. The method does not modify any state and returns a constant
    pointer to ensure data integrity during access.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to a PurgeableBuff object if an entry exists for the
    specified aura ID; otherwise, returns nullptr indicating no matching purgeable
    buff configuration was found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const PurgeableBuff* buffData = dispelCoordinator->GetPurgeableBuffData(12345);\n\
      if (buffData != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process the purgeable buff data\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Found purgeable buff with duration: \" << buffData->duration << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation in an internal data structure, so
    performance should be considered when called frequently. The returned pointer
    is valid only as long as the DispelCoordinator instance remains alive and the
    purgeable buff data has not been modified.
  warnings: Ensure that the auraId passed to this function is valid and corresponds
    to an actual aura in the game's system. Using invalid or uninitialized aura IDs
    may result in undefined behavior or incorrect return values.
