  class: BotSpawner
  method: SelectCharacterForSpawn
  signature: int BotSpawner::SelectCharacterForSpawn(const int & request)
documentation:
  brief: Selects a character from the bot pool for spawning based on the provided
    request identifier.
  description: The SelectCharacterForSpawn method is responsible for choosing an appropriate
    character from the available bot pool to be spawned in the game world. It takes
    a request identifier as input and uses it to determine which character should
    be selected, considering factors such as character availability, role requirements,
    and spawn rules. This method typically integrates with the broader bot management
    system to ensure that bots are properly allocated and deployed according to configured
    parameters. The selection process may involve checking for existing spawns, character
    class distribution, and other game mechanics that affect bot deployment.
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: An integer identifier representing the spawn request. This value
      is used to determine which character should be selected from the bot pool based
      on predefined rules and constraints.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the GUID (Global Unique Identifier) of
    the selected character for spawning, or -1 if no suitable character could be found
    or if the selection process failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Character Selection
    code: "int botGuid = botSpawner.SelectCharacterForSpawn(12345);\nif (botGuid !=\
      \ -1) {\n    // Proceed with spawning the bot using the returned GUID\n    printf(\"\
      Selected bot GUID: %d\\n\", botGuid);\n} else {\n    // Handle case where no\
      \ character was selected\n    printf(\"Failed to select a bot for spawn request.\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Spawning Logic
    code: "class BotManager {\npublic:\n    void SpawnBotForRequest(int requestId)\
      \ {\n        int selectedGuid = botSpawner.SelectCharacterForSpawn(requestId);\n\
      \        if (selectedGuid != -1) {\n            // Create the bot instance using\
      \ the selected GUID\n            Bot* newBot = new Bot(selectedGuid);\n    \
      \        newBot->Spawn();\n        } else {\n            // Log error or trigger\
      \ fallback behavior\n            sLog->outError(\"Could not select character\
      \ for spawn request %d\", requestId);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of a larger bot spawning workflow
    and may interact with internal data structures such as character pools, spawn
    queues, and role distribution systems. The method assumes that the bot pool has
    been properly initialized and populated before being invoked.
  warnings: The method may return -1 if no valid character can be selected, which
    should be handled gracefully in calling code to prevent unexpected behavior or
    crashes. Ensure that the request identifier passed is within expected ranges to
    avoid invalid selections.
