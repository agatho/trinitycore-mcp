  class: SocialEvent
  method: TextEmoteReceived
  signature: SocialEvent SocialEvent::TextEmoteReceived(int player, int target, uint32
    emoteId)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a text emote received from a player targeting another player in
    the game.
  description: The TextEmoteReceived method handles the logic when a player sends
    a text-based emote (such as 'laughs' or 'glares') to another player. This method
    is typically invoked by the server's social system when a text emote packet is
    received from a client. It validates the emote ID against known emotes, ensures
    both players are valid and within range, and then broadcasts the emote to nearby
    players in the same area. The method returns a SocialEvent object representing
    the processed emote event, which can be used for further processing or logging.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: The GUID of the player sending the text emote. Must be a valid player
      GUID within the current session.
  - name: target
    description: The GUID of the target player receiving the text emote. Must be a
      valid player GUID and within communication range of the sender.
  - name: emoteId
    description: The unique identifier for the text emote being sent. Must correspond
      to a valid emote ID defined in the game's emote database.
  returns: A SocialEvent object containing details about the processed text emote,
    including sender, target, and emote type. Returns an empty or invalid SocialEvent
    if validation fails.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: SocialEvent event = socialHandler.TextEmoteReceived(playerGuid, targetGuid,
      1234);
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing Emote with Validation
    code: "if (playerGuid && targetGuid) {\n    SocialEvent event = socialHandler.TextEmoteReceived(playerGuid,\
      \ targetGuid, emoteId);\n    if (event.IsValid()) {\n        // Broadcast or\
      \ log the event\n        LOG_INFO(\"social\", \"Player {} sent emote {} to {}\"\
      , playerGuid, emoteId, targetGuid);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the input GUIDs are already validated and that the
    players exist in the current session. The emote ID must be present in the server's
    emote database for successful processing. This method does not perform direct
    network communication; it prepares the event for further handling by the social
    subsystem.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or uninitialized GUIDs, as it may
    cause undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that emote IDs are validated against
    the server's emote list to avoid sending invalid emotes to players.
