  class: GuildAchievementMgr
  method: DeleteFromDB
  signature: void GuildAchievementMgr::DeleteFromDB(const int & guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a guild achievement record from the database using the specified
    GUID.
  description: 'The DeleteFromDB method is responsible for removing a specific guild
    achievement entry from the database. It takes a unique identifier (GUID) as input
    and performs a database delete operation to remove the corresponding achievement
    data. This method is typically used when a guild achievement needs to be revoked,
    reset, or cleaned up from the game''s persistent storage. The operation directly
    affects the underlying database tables that store guild achievement information,
    ensuring consistency between in-game state and stored data. Precondition: The
    provided GUID must correspond to an existing guild achievement record in the database.
    Postcondition: The specified guild achievement record is permanently removed from
    the database.'
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the guild achievement to be deleted
      from the database. This value should correspond to an existing record in the
      guild achievements table.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Delete a specific guild achievement by GUID
    code: 'GuildAchievementMgr mgr;

      uint32 achievementGuid = 12345;

      mgr.DeleteFromDB(achievementGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct database operation and should be used carefully
    to avoid unintended data loss. The GUID parameter must be validated before calling
    this method to ensure it references an actual existing achievement record. Consider
    implementing transaction handling if multiple related operations need to be performed
    together.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in
    no-op behavior or database errors. Always verify that the achievement exists before
    attempting deletion. This operation is irreversible and will permanently remove
    data from the database.
