  class: ProfessionAuctionBridge
  method: IsStockpileTargetMet
  signature: bool ProfessionAuctionBridge::IsStockpileTargetMet(int * player, uint32
    itemId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a player's stockpile target has been met for a specific item.
  description: The IsStockpileTargetMet method evaluates if a given player has accumulated
    enough of a specified item to satisfy their defined stockpile target. This functionality
    is typically used in auction house systems or crafting-related mechanics where
    players set targets for how much of certain materials they wish to accumulate.
    The method takes a pointer to a player object and an item ID, then returns true
    if the player's current inventory meets or exceeds the target quantity for that
    item.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object whose stockpile status is being evaluated.
      Must not be null.
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item for which the stockpile target
      is checked. Must correspond to a valid item in the game database.
  returns: Returns true if the player's current inventory quantity of the specified
    item meets or exceeds their defined stockpile target; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 itemId = 12345;\nbool isMet = bridge.IsStockpileTargetMet(player,\
      \ itemId);\nif (isMet) {\n    // Player has met their stockpile target for item\
      \ 12345\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Auction House Logic
    code: "void CheckStockpileStatus(Player* player, uint32 itemId) {\n    if (bridge.IsStockpileTargetMet(player,\
      \ itemId)) {\n        // Trigger notification or update auction status\n   \
      \     player->SendNotification(\"Stockpile target met for item %u.\", itemId);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Continue monitoring or alert user\n        player->SendNotification(\"\
      Still collecting item %u.\", itemId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal player data structures such as
    inventory tracking and stockpile target settings. It may involve database queries
    to retrieve current item counts and target values, so performance could be impacted
    if called frequently in tight loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method; passing
    a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. Also, verify
    that the itemId corresponds to an actual item in the game database to avoid unexpected
    results.
