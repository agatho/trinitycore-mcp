  class: Player
  method: RemoveArenaSpellCooldowns
  signature: void Player::RemoveArenaSpellCooldowns(bool removeActivePetCooldowns)
documentation:
  brief: Removes all arena spell cooldowns from the player, including active pet cooldowns
    if specified.
  description: This method removes all arena-specific spell cooldowns from the player's
    spell book, effectively resetting the cooldowns for arena-related spells. It can
    optionally remove active pet cooldowns as well, depending on the parameter value.
    The method is typically used during arena match preparation or when switching
    between different arena modes to ensure proper cooldown management. This operation
    affects both the player and their summoned pet's cooldowns, making it crucial
    for maintaining game balance in competitive play.
  parameters:
  - name: removeActivePetCooldowns
    description: When true, removes active pet cooldowns along with player spell cooldowns;
      when false, only removes player cooldowns. This parameter controls whether the
      method affects the player's pet's cooldowns as well.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->RemoveArenaSpellCooldowns(false);

      // Removes only player spell cooldowns'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->RemoveArenaSpellCooldowns(true);

      // Removes both player and pet cooldowns'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during arena match preparation or when switching
    between different arena modes. It's important to note that this operation affects
    both the player and their summoned pet's cooldowns, making it crucial for maintaining
    game balance in competitive play. Performance-wise, this method should be used
    carefully as it can affect multiple cooldowns simultaneously.
  warnings: This method should not be called during active combat or when the player
    is in a non-arena match context, as it may cause unexpected behavior. Also, calling
    this method with true parameter while the player's pet is active could lead to
    unintended cooldown removals for pet spells.
