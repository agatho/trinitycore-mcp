  brief: Initializes the role definitions for evoker class specializations within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The InitializeEvokerRoles method sets up and configures the default
    role assignments and behaviors specific to the Evoker class in World of Warcraft.
    This method is typically invoked during server initialization or when loading
    class-specific configurations. It ensures that all necessary role definitions
    for evokers are properly registered and available for use in combat, questing,
    and other gameplay scenarios. The method likely populates internal data structures
    with predefined roles such as Damage Dealer, Support, or Tank, depending on the
    evoker's specialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  notes: This method should only be called once during server startup or when resetting
    class role configurations. It is not thread-safe and must be executed in a single-threaded
    context to avoid race conditions.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate role definitions or memory leaks. Ensure that all existing role data
    is cleared before reinitialization.
