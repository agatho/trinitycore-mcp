documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is visible globally to another player.
  description: This method checks if a player is visible globally to a specific target
    player, meaning whether the player's visibility status allows the target player
    to see them in the world. It is commonly used in player-to-player visibility contexts
    and can be influenced by various game mechanics including stealth, invisibility,
    and GM visibility settings. The method returns true if the player is visible globally
    for the specified player, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is visible globally to the target player, false
    otherwise. This indicates that the player's visibility status allows the target
    player to see them in the world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsVisibleGloballyFor(targetPlayer)) {\n    // Player is visible\
      \ globally to targetPlayer\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include checking visibility status and potentially
    considering game mechanics such as stealth, invisibility, and GM visibility. Performance
    considerations involve minimal overhead since this method typically involves simple
    visibility checks.
