  signature: bool CombatBehaviorIntegration::HandleEmergencies()
documentation:
  brief: Processes emergency combat behaviors for the current unit
  description: The HandleEmergencies method evaluates and executes emergency combat
    actions for the unit controlled by this CombatBehaviorIntegration instance. It
    typically handles situations such as sudden health drops, enemy aggro changes,
    or critical threat scenarios that require immediate response. This method is part
    of the core AI decision-making loop and ensures that units react appropriately
    to urgent combat conditions. The method returns true if an emergency action was
    successfully processed, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if an emergency behavior was successfully executed, false if no emergency
    conditions were met or if execution failed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI Loop
    code: "void MyCombatAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    if (m_combatBehavior->HandleEmergencies())\n    {\n        // Emergency\
      \ action was taken, skip normal behavior\n        return;\n    }\n    // ...\
      \ continue with regular AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat updates to ensure timely
    response to emergency situations. It's designed to be lightweight and non-blocking,
    but may perform complex threat assessments internally. The method assumes the
    unit has valid combat state and target information.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat context without proper validation,
    as it may access invalid target or health data. The method might modify unit state
    directly, so ensure proper synchronization if used in multi-threaded environments.
