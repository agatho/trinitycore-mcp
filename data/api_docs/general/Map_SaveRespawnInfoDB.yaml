  method: SaveRespawnInfoDB
  signature: void Map::SaveRespawnInfoDB(const RespawnInfo & info, int dbTrans)
documentation:
  brief: Saves respawn information to the database for the map.
  description: This method stores the respawn data of objects and creatures within
    the map to the database, ensuring that respawn times and locations are properly
    recorded for future restoration. It handles the persistence of respawn information
    through a database transaction, allowing for consistent state management across
    server restarts or updates. The method is typically invoked during map loading
    or when changes occur in the map's respawn state.
  parameters:
  - name: info
    description: The respawn information structure containing details about objects
      and creatures that need to be saved, including their respawn times and locations.
  - name: dbTrans
    description: The database transaction identifier used for coordinating the save
      operation within a transactional context. This parameter ensures that the data
      is saved consistently with other database operations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Map map;

      RespawnInfo info;

      map.SaveRespawnInfoDB(info, 1);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the map's internal database handling mechanism. It
    should be called when respawn data changes and needs to be persisted across server
    sessions. The transaction parameter ensures that multiple operations are grouped
    together for consistency.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to inconsistent or corrupted database
    records, especially if the transaction is not properly managed. Care must be taken
    to ensure that all respawn data is correctly formatted before calling this method.
