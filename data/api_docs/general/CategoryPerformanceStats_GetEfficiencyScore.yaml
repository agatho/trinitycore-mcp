  method: GetEfficiencyScore
  signature: double CategoryPerformanceStats::GetEfficiencyScore() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the efficiency score for a category performance statistics
    object.
  description: The GetEfficiencyScore method computes a normalized numerical value
    representing how efficiently a specific category of performance metrics is being
    handled. This score typically reflects the balance between resource usage, task
    completion rates, and other relevant factors within the category. The method performs
    internal calculations based on stored performance data and returns a double-precision
    floating-point number that can be used for comparisons, rankings, or display purposes
    in game interfaces. It is designed to be a read-only operation that does not modify
    any internal state of the CategoryPerformanceStats object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A double value representing the calculated efficiency score for the category.
    The score typically ranges from 0.0 (lowest efficiency) to 1.0 (highest efficiency),
    though exact bounds may vary depending on implementation details and normalization
    logic.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'CategoryPerformanceStats stats;

      // ... populate stats with data ...

      double efficiency = stats.GetEfficiencyScore();

      printf("Efficiency Score: %.2f\n", efficiency);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Efficiency Score for Performance Analysis
    code: "CategoryPerformanceStats* categoryStats = player->GetCategoryPerformanceStats(CATEGORY_COMBAT);\n\
      double score = categoryStats->GetEfficiencyScore();\nif (score < 0.5) {\n  \
      \  // Alert player or log low performance\n    sLog->outString(\"Low combat\
      \ efficiency detected: %.2f\", score);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended to be called frequently during performance monitoring
    and should ideally have minimal computational overhead. The efficiency score calculation
    may involve weighted averages, normalization techniques, or other mathematical
    operations that could vary between different implementations or versions of the
    TrinityCore codebase.
  warnings: The returned value is a floating-point number and may suffer from precision
    limitations in certain edge cases. Ensure proper handling when comparing values
    for equality or using them in conditional logic. The method assumes all required
    internal data has been properly initialized before calling.
