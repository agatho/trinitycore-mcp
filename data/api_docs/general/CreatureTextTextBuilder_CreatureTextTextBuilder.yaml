documentation:
  brief: Initializes a CreatureTextTextBuilder object with specified text and speaker
    parameters for generating creature dialogue.
  description: The CreatureTextTextBuilder constructor initializes an instance of
    the CreatureTextTextBuilder class, which is used to construct and manage text
    data for creature dialogue in World of Warcraft. This method sets up internal
    state variables including the source object (speaker), target object, gender,
    message type, text group, broadcast text ID, emote ID, sound kit ID, and other
    relevant parameters required for proper text delivery within the game's dialogue
    system. The builder pattern allows for fluent construction of complex text messages
    that can be sent to players or other NPCs in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: obj
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that is the source of the text message,
      typically a Creature or GameObject
  - name: speaker
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that will actually speak the text, which
      may be different from obj in some cases
  - name: gender
    description: Gender of the speaker (0 = male, 1 = female, 2 = neutral)
  - name: msgtype
    description: Message type indicating how the text should be displayed (e.g., SAY,
      YELL, WHISPER, etc.)
  - name: textGroup
    description: Text group identifier used to organize related texts for the creature
  - name: id
    description: Unique identifier for this specific text entry within the group
  - name: language
    description: Language code for the text (0 = common, 1 = orcish, etc.)
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target WorldObject receiving the message, or NULL
      if no specific target
  - name: broadcastTextId
    description: ID of the BroadcastText entry associated with this text message
  - name: emoteId
    description: Emote ID to be played along with the text message (0 = no emote)
  - name: soundKitId
    description: Sound kit ID for playing audio associated with the text message
  - name: soundKitPlayType
    description: Type of sound playback (0 = normal, 1 = play once, etc.)
  - name: playerConditionId
    description: Player condition ID used to determine if the text should be shown
      based on player state
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Creature Text Builder Initialization
    code: CreatureTextTextBuilder builder(creature, creature, GENDER_MALE, CHAT_MSG_MONSTER_SAY,
      0, 1, LANG_UNIVERSAL, NULL, 12345, 0, 0, 0, 0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Creature Text Builder with Target and Sound
    code: CreatureTextTextBuilder builder(npc, player, GENDER_FEMALE, CHAT_MSG_MONSTER_YELL,
      1, 2, LANG_ORCISH, player, 54321, 42, 10001, 1, 9876);
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the CreatureTextTextBuilder class which is used
    internally by TrinityCore's creature text system. The builder pattern allows for
    flexible construction of text messages with various optional parameters. The parameters
    are stored as member variables and can be accessed through getter methods in the
    class.
  warnings: The obj and speaker parameters should not be NULL, otherwise the behavior
    is undefined. Ensure that broadcastTextId corresponds to an existing BroadcastText
    entry in the database or the message may not display correctly.
