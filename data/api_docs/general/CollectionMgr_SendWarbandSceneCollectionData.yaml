  brief: Sends warband scene collection data to the client.
  description: The SendWarbandSceneCollectionData method is responsible for transmitting
    warband-related scene collection information to the connected player's client.
    This method likely handles the synchronization of warband-specific visual or gameplay
    elements, such as scene markers, objectives, or interactive elements within the
    game world. The data sent typically includes metadata about available scenes,
    their states, and any relevant flags or identifiers that allow the client to properly
    render or interact with these warband scenes. This method is part of the CollectionMgr
    class which manages various collection-related data for players in TrinityCore.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CollectionMgr* mgr = player->GetCollectionMgr();

      mgr->SendWarbandSceneCollectionData();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked when a player logs in or when warband scene
    data needs to be refreshed. It's important to ensure that the player has proper
    permissions or ownership of the warband scenes before calling this method. The
    actual data transmission may involve multiple packets depending on the amount
    of information being sent.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying player authentication or warband
    ownership could result in incorrect data being sent to the client, potentially
    causing visual glitches or gameplay inconsistencies.
