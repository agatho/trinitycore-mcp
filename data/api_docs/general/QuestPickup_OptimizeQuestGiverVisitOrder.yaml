  class: QuestPickup
  method: OptimizeQuestGiverVisitOrder
  signature: void QuestPickup::OptimizeQuestGiverVisitOrder(Player * bot, int & questGivers)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the order in which quest givers are visited by a bot player.
  description: The OptimizeQuestGiverVisitOrder method determines the most efficient
    sequence for a bot player to visit multiple quest givers within a single zone.
    This optimization minimizes travel time and maximizes quest completion efficiency
    by analyzing the spatial relationships between quest givers and prioritizing those
    that are geographically closer together. The method modifies the input parameter
    'questGivers' to reflect this optimized order, which is particularly useful for
    automated questing bots in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will visit
      quest givers. This player must be in a valid state with an active questing session.
  - name: questGivers
    description: Reference to an integer value that represents the number of quest
      givers in the current optimization scope. The method modifies this value to
      reflect the optimized visit order, typically by reordering internal data structures
      or updating a list of quest giver IDs.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume initialized bot

      int numQuestGivers = 5;

      questPickup->OptimizeQuestGiverVisitOrder(myBot, numQuestGivers);

      // numQuestGivers now contains the optimized visit order information'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in automated questing systems where minimizing
    travel time between quest givers is crucial for performance. The optimization
    algorithm likely uses pathfinding or clustering techniques to group nearby quest
    givers together, reducing overall movement distance.
  warnings: The method modifies the 'questGivers' parameter directly and assumes that
    the player object has valid quest giver data. Improper use without proper initialization
    of quest data may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect optimization results.
