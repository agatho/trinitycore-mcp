  signature: LootMethod Loot::GetLootMethod() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the loot method currently assigned to this loot instance.
  description: The GetLootMethod function retrieves the loot distribution method that
    is currently set for this specific loot object. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    loot methods define how items are distributed among group members, such as 'Round
    Robin', 'Free For All', or 'Need Before Greed'. This method is essential for determining
    the current distribution rules applied to a particular loot event, which affects
    player behavior and item allocation during group encounters. The returned LootMethod
    enum value indicates the active distribution strategy for this loot container.
  parameters: []
  returns: A LootMethod enumeration value representing the current loot distribution
    method assigned to this loot instance. Possible values include ROUND_ROBIN, FREE_FOR_ALL,
    NEED_BEFORE_GREED, and others defined in the LootMethod enum.
  examples:
  - title: Check Current Loot Method
    code: "Loot* loot = player->GetLoot();\nLootMethod method = loot->GetLootMethod();\n\
      if (method == LOOT_METHOD_FREE_FOR_ALL)\n{\n    // Handle Free For All loot\
      \ distribution\n    sLog->outString(\"Free for all loot method active\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not modify the loot state; it only reads the current loot
    method. The returned value is determined by the group's loot settings or individual
    player preferences, and may change during a loot event based on game mechanics
    or user actions.
