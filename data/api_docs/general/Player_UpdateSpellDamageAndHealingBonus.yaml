  brief: Updates the player's spell damage and healing bonus values based on current
    stats and buffs.
  description: This method recalculates and applies any changes to the player's spell
    damage and healing bonuses. It is typically invoked when stat modifications occur,
    such as equipment changes, buff expiration, or level-ups. The method ensures that
    the player's spell power and healing effectiveness are accurately reflected in
    their current game state. This update affects all spell-related damage and healing
    calculations for the player, including both direct spells and periodic effects.

      \ gear\n    player->UpdateSpellDamageAndHealingBonus();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically called during various stat update events in
    the game loop. Developers should not typically need to call this directly unless
    implementing custom stat modification logic. The method performs internal calculations
    based on player's current stats, buffs, and debuffs.
