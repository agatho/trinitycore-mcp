documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the FeralBloodtalonsTracker class for tracking
    feral bloodtalons effects.
  description: The FeralBloodtalonsTracker constructor initializes a new instance
    of the FeralBloodtalonsTracker class, which is responsible for managing and tracking
    the state of feral bloodtalons effects in the game. This tracker is typically
    used by feral druids to monitor their bloodtalons buff, which provides increased
    damage and movement speed. The constructor sets up internal data structures and
    initializes tracking variables necessary for maintaining the effect's duration,
    stack count, and associated game mechanics. It ensures that the tracker is properly
    configured before being used in combat scenarios.

  - title: Creating a new FeralBloodtalonsTracker instance
    code: 'FeralBloodtalonsTracker tracker;

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track bloodtalons effects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any validation or initialization of external
    dependencies. It assumes that the game environment and necessary systems are already
    properly set up. The tracker will typically be instantiated as part of a druid's
    spell effect handling system.
