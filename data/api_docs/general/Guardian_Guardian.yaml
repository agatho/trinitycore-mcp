  method: Guardian
  signature: void Guardian::Guardian(const SummonPropertiesEntry * properties, int
    * owner, bool isWorldObject)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a guardian entity with specified summon properties and owner
    reference.
  description: The Guardian method is responsible for setting up a guardian creature
    or pet within the TrinityCore framework. It takes summon properties that define
    how the guardian should behave, a pointer to the owner's identifier, and a flag
    indicating whether the guardian is a world object. This method typically gets
    called during the creation of summoned creatures such as guardians, pets, or other
    temporary entities in the game world. The initialization process includes setting
    up the creature's properties, linking it to its owner, and determining if it should
    be treated as a world object for certain gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: properties
    description: Pointer to SummonPropertiesEntry which defines the summon behavior,
      duration, and other summon-related properties for the guardian.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the owner's identifier (GUID).
      This is used to establish the relationship between the guardian and its summoner.
  - name: isWorldObject
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the guardian should be treated as
      a world object. If true, certain game mechanics like visibility or interaction
      rules may apply differently.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guardian Initialization
    code: 'SummonPropertiesEntry* props = sObjectMgr->GetSummonProperties(12345);

      int ownerGuid = player->GetGUID().GetRawValue();

      Guardian(props, &ownerGuid, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the game engine when summoning
    creatures. Developers should ensure that the SummonPropertiesEntry passed is valid
    and corresponds to an existing summon type in the database.
  warnings: Incorrectly passing a null pointer for 'properties' or an invalid owner
    GUID can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate inputs before
    calling this method.
