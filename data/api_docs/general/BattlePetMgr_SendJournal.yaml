  brief: Sends the battle pet journal to the player's client
  description: The SendJournal method is responsible for transmitting the complete
    battle pet journal data to the connected player's client. This method typically
    initializes the display of all collected battle pets, their stats, and available
    abilities within the game's user interface. It ensures that the player's pet collection
    is synchronized with their client view, allowing them to access and manage their
    battle pets. The method likely handles serialization of pet data and sends it
    through the appropriate network protocol to update the UI.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BattlePetMgr* mgr = player->GetBattlePetMgr();

      mgr->SendJournal();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player is fully logged in and
    the client is ready to receive updates. It may trigger additional UI refreshes
    or data synchronization processes.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper player context or before the client
    is initialized may cause network errors or UI glitches. Ensure that the BattlePetMgr
    instance is valid before invoking this method.
