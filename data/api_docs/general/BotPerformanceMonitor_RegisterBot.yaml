  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: RegisterBot
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::RegisterBot(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a bot with the performance monitoring system using its unique identifier.
  description: The RegisterBot method adds a bot instance to the performance monitoring
    system by its unique global identifier (GUID). This allows the system to track
    and analyze the performance metrics of individual bots, including resource usage,
    execution time, and other relevant statistics. The method is typically invoked
    when a new bot is created or initialized within the TrinityCore environment. It
    ensures that subsequent performance data collection and analysis can be accurately
    attributed to specific bot instances.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique global identifier (GUID) of the bot to register. This
      value must correspond to a valid bot instance in the game world, typically generated
      by the TrinityCore framework when the bot is created.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Registration
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      BotPerformanceMonitor::RegisterBot(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Registration with Error Handling
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = GetNewBotGuid();\nif (botGuid != 0)\n{\n    BotPerformanceMonitor::RegisterBot(botGuid);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid GUID case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the performance monitoring infrastructure and should
    be called during bot initialization or activation. The registration process does
    not validate whether the bot actually exists in the game world, so it's expected
    that the caller ensures the GUID refers to a valid bot instance.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID may lead
    to undefined behavior or performance monitoring inconsistencies. Ensure that only
    legitimate bot instances are registered.
