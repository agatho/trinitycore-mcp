documentation:
  brief: Enables a player to participate in guild-related events and activities.
  description: The ParticipateInGuildEvents method configures the social manager to
    allow a player to engage with guild-specific events such as guild achievements,
    guild challenges, and other interactive guild mechanics. This method typically
    sets internal flags or states that determine whether the player's actions are
    considered valid for guild event participation. It may also synchronize the player's
    state with the guild's event system, ensuring that their contributions are properly
    tracked and rewarded. The method is usually invoked when a player joins a guild
    or when they explicitly opt-in to guild activities.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();

      socialMgr->ParticipateInGuildEvents();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal state flags within the SocialManager
    class and may trigger updates to the player's guild event participation status.
    It is expected to be called after a player has joined a guild or when they wish
    to begin participating in guild activities.
