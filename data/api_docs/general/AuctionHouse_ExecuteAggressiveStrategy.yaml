api:
  class: AuctionHouse
  method: ExecuteAggressiveStrategy
  signature: void AuctionHouse::ExecuteAggressiveStrategy(int * player, AuctionSession
    & session)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the aggressive auction strategy for a given player session.
  description: The ExecuteAggressiveStrategy method implements a high-risk, high-reward
    bidding approach within the auction house system. It evaluates available auctions
    and places bids based on predefined criteria such as item value, market trends,
    and player inventory constraints. This strategy prioritizes securing valuable
    items quickly over long-term profit optimization. The method modifies the session
    state to reflect aggressive bidding behavior and may trigger additional actions
    like notifying other players or adjusting future bidding thresholds.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) in the auction system. Must be a valid, non-null pointer to an existing
      player.
  - name: session
    description: Reference to an AuctionSession object containing current auction
      state and bidding parameters. The session must be initialized and associated
      with the specified player before calling this method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Aggressive Strategy Execution
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      AuctionSession session;

      // Initialize session with auction data

      auctionHouse->ExecuteAggressiveStrategy(&playerId, session);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Aggressive Strategy with Error Handling
    code: "int* playerId = new int(12345);\nAuctionSession session;\ntry {\n    auctionHouse->ExecuteAggressiveStrategy(playerId,\
      \ session);\n} catch (const std::exception& e) {\n    // Handle invalid player\
      \ or session errors\n    LogError(\"Failed to execute aggressive strategy: %s\"\
      , e.what());\n}\ndelete playerId;"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AuctionSession is already populated with relevant
    auction data and that the player has sufficient funds. The implementation may
    involve multiple database queries and network calls to update auction states in
    real-time.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper session initialization can lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the player ID points to an active,
    logged-in user account.
