  signature: bool SpellInfo::IsPassive() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell is passive, meaning it does not require any activation
    or trigger.
  description: The IsPassive method checks if a spell is classified as passive within
    the TrinityCore framework. A passive spell is one that does not need to be actively
    triggered or activated by the player; instead, it is automatically applied or
    active from the start. This method is commonly used in spell handling logic to
    distinguish between active and passive spells, particularly for determining whether
    a spell should be considered as part of a player's passive abilities or as an
    active spell requiring specific conditions or triggers. The method returns true
    when the spell is classified as passive, false otherwise. This functionality is
    essential for managing spell behavior in World of Warcraft mechanics, especially
    in cases where passive effects are applied to players or NPCs without requiring
    explicit activation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell is passive, indicating that it does not require
    any activation or trigger; returns false otherwise. The method does not return
    null or error values as it is a boolean check.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "SpellInfo* spell = SpellMgr::GetSpellInfo(12345);\nif (spell->IsPassive())\
      \ {\n    // Handle passive spell logic\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "SpellInfo* spell = SpellMgr::GetSpellInfo(12345);\nif (spell->IsPassive())\
      \ {\n    // Apply passive effects to player\n    // No need for activation or\
      \ trigger\n}\nelse {\n    // Handle active spell logic\n    // Requires trigger\
      \ or activation\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    to determine the behavior of a spell. It should be noted that passive spells may
    have different handling mechanisms compared to active spells, particularly in
    terms of how they are applied or managed within game mechanics.
  warnings: The method does not perform any validation checks on the spell itself;
    it simply returns the classification as passive. Care must be taken when using
    this method with spells that may be classified differently based on different
    conditions or contexts.
