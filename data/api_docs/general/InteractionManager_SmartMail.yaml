  method: SmartMail
  signature: bool InteractionManager::SmartMail(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a smart mail to the specified player based on bot interaction logic.
  description: The SmartMail method in the InteractionManager class handles the automated
    sending of mails to a player character, typically used in botting or AI-driven
    interactions within the TrinityCore framework. It evaluates the context and requirements
    for sending an appropriate message or item to the target player. This method likely
    integrates with the game's mail system and may consider factors such as player
    state, available items, or interaction history. The function returns a boolean
    indicating whether the mail was successfully sent or not.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the smart mail was successfully sent to the player; otherwise,
    returns false if the operation failed due to invalid parameters, system errors,
    or other constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SmartMail
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized\nbool result = sInteractionManager->SmartMail(bot);\n\
      if (result)\n{\n    // Mail sent successfully\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Failed to\
      \ send mail\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal botting or AI systems and may
    require proper initialization of the InteractionManager instance. It is intended
    for use in automated gameplay scenarios such as scripted bots or AI-controlled
    characters.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null, otherwise the behavior is undefined. Improper usage could lead to crashes
    or unexpected mail delivery issues.
