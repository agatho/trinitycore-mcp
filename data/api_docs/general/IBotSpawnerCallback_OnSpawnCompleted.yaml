documentation:
  brief: Notifies when a bot spawn operation has completed with success or failure
    status
  description: The OnSpawnCompleted method is a callback function invoked by the bot
    spawner system to indicate that a bot spawning operation has finished. This method
    provides feedback on whether the spawn was successful and includes additional
    details about the operation. It serves as an asynchronous notification mechanism
    for the system managing bot creation, allowing implementers to react to spawn
    outcomes such as success, failure, or specific error conditions. The callback
    is typically triggered after all necessary steps for spawning a bot have been
    executed, including any required database updates, object instantiation, or world
    state modifications.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that was spawned. This value
      represents the internal identifier used by TrinityCore to track the bot instance
      in memory and database.
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the spawn operation completed successfully.
      True indicates successful spawning, false indicates failure or cancellation.
  - name: details
    description: Reference to an integer containing additional details about the spawn
      operation. The meaning of this value depends on the specific implementation
      and may represent error codes, spawn type identifiers, or other operational
      metadata.
  returns: void

  notes: This callback is invoked asynchronously after a bot spawn operation completes.
    Implementers should ensure thread safety if the callback may be called from different
    threads. The 'details' parameter's interpretation depends on the specific implementation
    of the spawner and should be documented by the system that invokes this method.
  warnings: Do not perform blocking operations within this callback as it may impact
    performance or cause deadlocks. The botGuid value is only valid if success is
    true; otherwise, it might represent an invalid or uninitialized value.
