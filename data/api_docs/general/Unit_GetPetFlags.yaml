  signature: UnitPetFlag Unit::GetPetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the pet flags indicating the current pet state and behavior.
  description: The GetPetFlags method retrieves the current pet flags that define
    the pet's state and behavior within the game world. This includes information
    about whether the pet is currently following, attacking, or has other specific
    states. The method is commonly used in player-controlled pet logic to determine
    how the pet should behave in different situations. It returns a UnitPetFlag structure
    that encapsulates various pet-related flags such as 'pet is following' or 'pet
    is attacking'.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a UnitPetFlag value representing the current state and behavior
    flags of the pet, including whether it is following, attacking, or other states.
    The value can be interpreted as a bitmask where each bit represents different
    pet behaviors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "UnitPetFlag flags = unit->GetPetFlags();\nif (flags & UNIT_petflag_Follow)\n\
      {\n    // Pet is following\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Pet is not following\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other pet-related methods
    to determine the overall behavior of a pet. It's important to note that the returned
    flags may vary depending on the pet's current state and can be modified by various
    game mechanics.
  warnings: Care should be taken when interpreting the returned flags, as they may
    change based on the pet's state or actions. Also, this method does not return
    a copy of the flags but rather a reference to the actual flags stored in the unit
    object.
