documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell can be interrupted by incoming damage or other
    interruptible actions.
  description: The IsSpellInterruptible method evaluates if a given spell is susceptible
    to being interrupted by external factors such as incoming damage, movement, or
    other interruptible game events. This method is typically used within the context
    of spell casting logic to determine whether an ongoing spell cast should be disrupted.
    The evaluation considers various spell properties and state conditions that define
    interruptibility. It's commonly called during combat scenarios where spell interruption
    mechanics are active.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell is interruptible, false otherwise. A spell may
    not be interruptible if it's a non-interruptible cast type or if specific conditions
    prevent interruption.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Handler
    code: "if (player->GetSpellHistory()->IsSpellInterruptible(spell)) {\n    // Handle\
      \ spell interruption logic\n    player->InterruptSpell(CURRENT_GENERIC_SPELL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Interruptibility Before Casting
    code: "SpellInfo const* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(spellId);\nif (spellInfo\
      \ && !spellInfo->IsFlagSet(SPELL_FLAG_NO_INTERRUPT)) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ casting logic\n    if (!interruptAwareness.IsSpellInterruptible(spell)) {\n\
      \        // Spell cannot be interrupted, apply special handling\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks spell flags and current spell state to determine
    interruptibility. It's important to note that some spells may have hardcoded immunity
    to interruption regardless of this check. The method is part of the core interrupt
    awareness system used throughout TrinityCore's spell handling.
  warnings: Do not assume all spells are interruptible without checking this method.
    Some spells, particularly those with specific flags or mechanics, may be immune
    to interruption even if they appear to be standard casts.
