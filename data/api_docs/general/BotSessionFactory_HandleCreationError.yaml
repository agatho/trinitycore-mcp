documentation:
  brief: Handles and processes errors that occur during bot character creation in
    the TrinityCore system
  description: The HandleCreationError method is responsible for managing error conditions
    that arise when attempting to create bot characters within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method receives an error message string and a character GUID, then processes
    this information to log the error appropriately and potentially notify relevant
    systems or administrators. The method likely serves as part of a larger bot management
    system where character creation failures need to be tracked and handled gracefully
    without crashing the application. It may also trigger cleanup procedures for partially
    created bot characters or update internal state tracking to reflect the failed
    creation attempt.
  parameters:
  - name: error
    description: A string containing the error message describing what went wrong
      during bot character creation
  - name: characterGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the character for which the creation
      error occurred, used for tracking and logging purposes
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Error Handling Example
    code: "void BotSessionFactory::HandleCreationError(const std::string& error, int\
      \ characterGuid) {\n    // Log the error with character GUID for debugging\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Bot creation failed for character GUID %d: %s\", characterGuid,\
      \ error.c_str());\n    // Additional error handling logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called from within bot creation workflows and should
    be thread-safe if multiple bots are being created simultaneously. The character
    GUID parameter suggests this method may be part of a larger system that tracks
    all bot characters by their unique identifiers.
  warnings: Ensure proper logging mechanisms are in place before calling this method,
    as errors may not be visible without appropriate logging configuration. The method
    should not throw exceptions as it's designed to handle error conditions gracefully.
