  signature: DeathKnightSpec DeathKnightAI::GetCurrentSpecialization() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current specialization of the Death Knight AI.
  description: 'This method returns the active specialization of the Death Knight
    AI instance. The returned value indicates which of the three Death Knight specializations
    is currently active: Blood, Frost, or Unholy. This information is crucial for
    determining the AI''s behavior, spell selection, and ability usage during combat.
    The method does not modify any internal state and is safe to call at any time
    during the AI''s lifecycle.'
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A DeathKnightSpec enum value representing the current specialization of
    the Death Knight. Possible values are: DEATH_KNIGHT_SPEC_BLOOD, DEATH_KNIGHT_SPEC_FROST,
    or DEATH_KNIGHT_SPEC_UNHOLY.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "DeathKnightSpec spec = ai->GetCurrentSpecialization();\nif (spec == DEATH_KNIGHT_SPEC_BLOOD)\n\
      {\n    // Handle Blood specialization logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Combat Decision Making
    code: "void MyDeathKnightAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    DeathKnightSpec spec\
      \ = GetCurrentSpecialization();\n    switch (spec)\n    {\n        case DEATH_KNIGHT_SPEC_BLOOD:\n\
      \            // Use Blood-specific abilities\n            break;\n        case\
      \ DEATH_KNIGHT_SPEC_FROST:\n            // Use Frost-specific abilities\n  \
      \          break;\n        case DEATH_KNIGHT_SPEC_UNHOLY:\n            // Use\
      \ Unholy-specific abilities\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal specialization tracking of the Death Knight
    AI. It assumes that the AI has been properly initialized with a valid specialization
    state. The returned value is consistent throughout the lifetime of the AI instance
    unless explicitly changed by other methods.
  warnings: Ensure that the Death Knight AI instance is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as calling it on an uninitialized or invalid AI instance
    may result in undefined behavior. This method should not be used to modify specialization
    state directly; use appropriate setter methods for that purpose.
