  class: HostileEventBus
  method: PublishSpawn
  signature: void HostileEventBus::PublishSpawn(int hostile, uint32 zoneId)
documentation:
  brief: Publishes a hostile spawn event to the EventBus for the specified zone.
  description: The PublishSpawn method notifies the HostileEventBus that a hostile
    creature has been spawned within a specific zone. This method is typically used
    by the game's AI and event systems to track and manage hostile entities in real-time.
    The method does not return any value but triggers internal event handling mechanisms
    that may update game state, trigger alerts, or notify other subsystems about the
    new hostile presence. It is designed to be called whenever a hostile NPC or creature
    enters the world within a defined zone boundary.
  parameters:
  - name: hostile
    description: An integer identifier representing the hostile entity that has spawned.
      This typically corresponds to a creature entry ID or similar unique identifier
      used by the game engine to distinguish different types of hostile creatures.
  - name: zoneId
    description: A 32-bit unsigned integer identifying the zone where the hostile
      spawn occurred. Zone IDs are used by TrinityCore to organize world content and
      manage events on a per-zone basis, allowing for localized event handling and
      performance optimization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Hostile Spawn Notification
    code: 'HostileEventBus::instance().PublishSpawn(12345, 123);

      // Notifies the EventBus that hostile creature with ID 12345 has spawned in
      zone 123.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Dynamic Zone Detection
    code: 'uint32 currentZoneId = player->GetZoneId();

      HostileEventBus::instance().PublishSpawn(creature->GetEntry(), currentZoneId);

      // Publishes a spawn event for a creature in the same zone as the player.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the EventBus pattern used throughout TrinityCore to
    decouple event producers from consumers. The implementation likely uses thread-safe
    mechanisms to ensure events are properly queued and dispatched across multiple
    threads. Performance considerations include avoiding frequent calls during high-frequency
    spawning scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the hostile parameter represents a valid creature entry ID,
    as invalid IDs may cause undefined behavior or trigger error logging within the
    EventBus system. ZoneId should be validated to prevent out-of-bounds access or
    incorrect event routing.
