documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the value of a persistent world variable by its identifier
  description: The GetPersistentWorldVariable method fetches the current value associated
    with a given PersistentWorldVariable. This method is used to access global game
    state data that persists across server restarts and player sessions. The returned
    value represents the stored integer value for the specified variable, or a default
    value if the variable has not been set previously. This functionality supports
    maintaining consistent game world states such as event flags, server configuration
    values, or other persistent data across different server instances.
  parameters:
  - name: var
    description: The PersistentWorldVariable enum value identifying which specific
      world variable to retrieve
  returns: Returns the integer value currently stored for the specified persistent
    world variable. If the variable has not been set previously, it returns the default
    value (typically 0) as defined in the variable's declaration or initialization
    logic.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve a server event flag
    code: int32 eventActive = sWorld->GetPersistentWorldVariable(PersistentWorldVariable::EVENT_HALLOWEEN_ACTIVE);
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if a global server setting is enabled
    code: "if (sWorld->GetPersistentWorldVariable(PersistentWorldVariable::SERVER_PVP_ENABLED)\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // PvP is enabled\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup in the persistent world variable storage system
    which may involve database queries or cached data access. The implementation likely
    uses a map or similar data structure to store and retrieve these values efficiently.
    Developers should be aware that this method is typically called during server
    initialization or when checking global game state conditions.
  warnings: This method assumes that the PersistentWorldVariable enum values are properly
    defined and that corresponding database entries exist. If an invalid variable
    identifier is passed, behavior may be undefined or return default values without
    error reporting. Always validate return values when they represent critical game
    state flags.
