  class: TargetAssistAction
  method: LogAssistAction
  signature: void TargetAssistAction::LogAssistAction(const std::string & action,
    Player * bot, Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Logs an assist action performed by a bot player on a target unit.
  description: The LogAssistAction method records information about an assist action
    taken by a bot player towards a specific target unit. This function is typically
    used within the context of AI behavior scripting to track and document actions
    such as targeting, attacking, or supporting other players or units during combat
    scenarios. It allows for logging of the action type, the bot player involved,
    and the target unit being assisted. The method does not return any value but performs
    a side effect of logging the action details to an appropriate system log or data
    structure.
  parameters:
  - name: action
    description: A string describing the assist action performed, such as 'attack',
      'support', or 'follow'. This identifies the type of assist behavior executed
      by the bot.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is performing
      the assist action. Must not be null for valid logging.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is the target of the assist action.
      This can be any unit such as a player, NPC, or creature. Must not be null for
      valid logging.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "void MyAI::OnUpdate()\n{\n    if (Player* bot = GetBot())\n    {\n    \
      \    if (Unit* target = GetTarget())\n        {\n            LogAssistAction(\"\
      attack\", bot, target);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI system in TrinityCore and is likely used for
    debugging or analytics purposes. It assumes that both bot and target pointers
    are valid when called, otherwise behavior may be undefined.
  warnings: Ensure that both bot and target parameters are non-null before calling
    this method to avoid potential crashes or invalid log entries. The logging mechanism
    itself should be thread-safe if used in multi-threaded AI contexts.
