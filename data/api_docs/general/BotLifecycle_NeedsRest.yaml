documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot needs to rest based on its current state and activity
    level
  description: The NeedsRest method evaluates the bot's current condition to determine
    if it requires rest. This typically involves checking the bot's health, mana levels,
    and recent activity to decide if it should enter a resting state. The method is
    used within the bot lifecycle management system to ensure bots maintain optimal
    performance by avoiding exhaustion or overuse. It considers factors such as combat
    status, resource depletion, and time since last rest period.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot's current state indicates it needs rest, false
    otherwise. The decision is based on internal bot state tracking including health,
    mana, activity duration, and combat status.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (botLifecycle.NeedsRest()) {\n    // Initiate rest behavior\n    bot->SetState(BotState::RESTING);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot AI Loop
    code: "void BotAI::Update() {\n    if (botLifecycle.NeedsRest()) {\n        //\
      \ Execute rest behavior\n        bot->Rest();\n        return;\n    }\n    //\
      \ Continue normal bot operations\n    bot->PerformAction();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the bot's update cycle to make decisions
    about rest behavior. The implementation likely uses internal state tracking and
    may consider configurable thresholds for health/mana levels before triggering
    rest requirements.
  warnings: The method should not be used as a direct indicator of whether a bot can
    perform actions - it only indicates rest needs. Using this method in isolation
    might lead to bots entering rest states too frequently or not enough.
