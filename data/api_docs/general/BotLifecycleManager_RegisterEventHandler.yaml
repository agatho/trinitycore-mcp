documentation:
  brief: Registers a new event handler for bot lifecycle management within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  description: The RegisterEventHandler method is used to register a new event handler
    with the BotLifecycleManager class. This allows the system to respond to various
    bot lifecycle events such as creation, destruction, or state changes. The method
    takes an integer parameter that likely represents a handler identifier or callback
    function pointer. It integrates with the core TrinityCore event handling system
    to ensure proper coordination of bot behavior and resource management during their
    operational lifecycle.
  parameters:
  - name: handler
    description: An integer identifier representing the event handler to be registered.
      This typically corresponds to a callback function or handler object that will
      be invoked when relevant bot lifecycle events occur.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Handler Registration
    code: 'BotLifecycleManager* manager = BotLifecycleManager::Instance();

      int myHandler = 42;

      manager->RegisterEventHandler(myHandler);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during system initialization or when new
    bot behavior modules need to be integrated into the lifecycle management framework.
    The handler parameter should be unique to avoid conflicts with other registered
    handlers.
