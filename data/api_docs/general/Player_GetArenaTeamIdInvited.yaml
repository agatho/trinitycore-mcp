  class: Player
  method: GetArenaTeamIdInvited
  signature: uint32 Player::GetArenaTeamIdInvited() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the arena team ID that the player was invited to, if any.
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier of the arena team that
    the player has been invited to but not yet accepted. It is used primarily in the
    context of arena team management and player invitation handling within World of
    Warcraft's battleground system. The method returns 0 if no invitation exists or
    if the player has already accepted the invitation. This functionality is crucial
    for managing player invitations and tracking arena team membership status during
    gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the arena team ID that the player was invited
    to. A value of 0 indicates that no invitation exists or that the invitation has
    been accepted. The returned value corresponds to the unique identifier of the
    specific arena team in the game's database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 teamId = player->GetArenaTeamIdInvited();\nif (teamId != 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Player has an active invitation\n    printf(\"Player is invited to arena\
      \ team ID: %u\\n\", teamId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No invitation exists\n    printf(\"\
      No active invitation\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other arena team related
    methods to manage player invitations and tracking. It's important to note that
    this method returns the ID of the team the player was invited to, not necessarily
    the team they are currently a member of. The implementation relies on internal
    state tracking within the Player class.
  warnings: This method should only be used when checking for pending invitations;
    using it inappropriately can lead to incorrect game state tracking. Also note
    that this method does not check whether the invitation has been accepted or not,
    so it may return an ID even if the player has already joined the team.
