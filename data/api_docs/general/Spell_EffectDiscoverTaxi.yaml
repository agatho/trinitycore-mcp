documentation:
  brief: Discovers and adds a taxi path to the player's known paths.
  description: This method handles the discovery of a taxi path for the player, typically
    triggered by spells that grant access to specific flight paths. It adds the discovered
    taxi path to the player's known paths, allowing them to use the corresponding
    flight nodes. The method is commonly used in conjunction with spell effects that
    provide access to taxi nodes, such as those found in quest rewards or item abilities.
    This functionality is essential for players to navigate the game world using flight
    paths.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void Spell::EffectDiscoverTaxi() {\n    // Implementation would add taxi\
      \ path to player's known paths\n    // This method is typically called when\
      \ a spell effect discovers a taxi path\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves checking if the player already knows the taxi
    path before adding it, and may require the player to be in a valid location for
    the taxi path to be discoverable.
