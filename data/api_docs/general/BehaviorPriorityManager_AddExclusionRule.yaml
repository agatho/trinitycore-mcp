  class: BehaviorPriorityManager
  method: AddExclusionRule
  signature: void BehaviorPriorityManager::AddExclusionRule(BehaviorPriority a, BehaviorPriority
    b)
documentation:
  brief: Adds an exclusion rule between two behavior priorities to prevent them from
    being executed simultaneously.
  description: The AddExclusionRule method registers a constraint in the BehaviorPriorityManager
    that prevents two specified behavior priorities from being active at the same
    time. This is used in AI systems to manage conflicting behaviors, ensuring that
    mutually exclusive actions do not occur concurrently. The method takes two BehaviorPriority
    parameters representing the priorities to be excluded from simultaneous execution.
    This functionality is essential for maintaining logical consistency in complex
    AI decision-making processes within TrinityCore's creature and player behavior
    systems.
  parameters:
  - name: a
    description: First behavior priority to exclude from simultaneous execution with
      the second priority
  - name: b
    description: Second behavior priority to exclude from simultaneous execution with
      the first priority
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BehaviorPriorityManager* manager = creature->GetBehaviorPriorityManager();

      manager->AddExclusionRule(BEHAVIOR_PRIORITY_ATTACK, BEHAVIOR_PRIORITY_FLEE);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Exclusion Rules
    code: 'BehaviorPriorityManager* manager = player->GetBehaviorPriorityManager();

      manager->AddExclusionRule(BEHAVIOR_PRIORITY_CAST_SPELL, BEHAVIOR_PRIORITY_MOVE);

      manager->AddExclusionRule(BEHAVIOR_PRIORITY_CAST_SPELL, BEHAVIOR_PRIORITY_ATTACK);

      manager->AddExclusionRule(BEHAVIOR_PRIORITY_MOVE, BEHAVIOR_PRIORITY_ATTACK);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state of the BehaviorPriorityManager and should
    be called during initialization or configuration phases. The exclusion rules are
    typically applied at runtime when evaluating which behaviors can be executed simultaneously.
    The behavior priorities must be valid enum values defined in the BehaviorPriority
    enumeration.
  warnings: Adding exclusion rules between non-conflicting behaviors may lead to unintended
    AI behavior or reduced functionality. Ensure that the excluded priorities actually
    represent mutually exclusive actions. Repeated calls with the same priority pair
    will not cause issues but are redundant.
