  class: Weather
  method: GetScriptId
  signature: uint32 Weather::GetScriptId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the script identifier associated with the weather instance.
  description: The GetScriptId method retrieves the unique identifier that corresponds
    to the script assigned to this weather instance. In TrinityCore's architecture,
    weather systems can be linked to specific scripts for dynamic behavior modification.
    This identifier is typically used internally by the core to manage and dispatch
    events related to weather changes, such as transitioning between different weather
    states or triggering environmental effects. The method does not modify any internal
    state and is purely a getter function.
  parameters: []
  returns: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the script identifier assigned to
    this weather instance. This ID is used by the core to locate and execute the appropriate
    script logic when weather-related events occur.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Weather Script ID
    code: 'Weather* weather = player->GetMap()->GetWeather();

      uint32 scriptId = weather->GetScriptId();

      TC_LOG_INFO("weather", "Current weather script ID: %u", scriptId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Weather instance has been properly initialized
    with a valid script ID. If no script is assigned, the returned value may be zero
    or undefined behavior depending on implementation details.
