  class: MotionMaster
  method: MoveRandom
  signature: void MotionMaster::MoveRandom(float wanderDistance, int duration, MovementSlot
    slot, int param3)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a random movement pattern for a creature or unit within a specified
    distance and duration.
  description: The MoveRandom method instructs a motion master to execute a random
    movement behavior, typically used for AI-controlled creatures to wander around
    within a defined area. This method allows specifying the maximum distance the
    unit can wander from its current position, the duration of the movement, which
    movement slot to use, and an additional parameter that may influence movement
    behavior or pathfinding. The motion is usually temporary and will be replaced
    by other movements when the duration expires or another movement command is issued.
    This functionality is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore for NPC
    roaming behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: wanderDistance
    description: Maximum distance (in yards) that the unit can move away from its
      current position during random wandering. Must be a positive value.
  - name: duration
    description: Duration in milliseconds for which the random movement should continue.
      A value of 0 typically means indefinite or until interrupted by another movement
      command.
  - name: slot
    description: Movement slot identifier (typically from MovementSlot enum) to determine
      where this movement should be queued or executed within the motion queue.
  - name: param3
    description: Additional parameter that may influence movement behavior, pathfinding,
      or other internal mechanics. Exact usage depends on implementation details and
      context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Random Movement
    code: motionMaster->MoveRandom(10.0f, 5000, MOTION_SLOT_IDLE, 0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Infinite Random Movement with Custom Parameters
    code: motionMaster->MoveRandom(25.0f, 0, MOTION_SLOT_MOVE, 1);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the MotionMaster system which manages all movement
    behaviors for units in TrinityCore. The actual pathfinding and movement execution
    are handled by underlying systems. The duration parameter controls how long the
    random movement persists; setting it to zero may result in indefinite wandering
    unless interrupted.
  warnings: Using a very large wanderDistance or zero duration can cause performance
    issues or unexpected behavior if not properly managed. Ensure that the slot parameter
    is valid and does not conflict with other active movements.
