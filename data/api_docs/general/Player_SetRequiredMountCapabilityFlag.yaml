  class: Player
  method: SetRequiredMountCapabilityFlag
  signature: void Player::SetRequiredMountCapabilityFlag(uint8 flag)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the required mount capability flag for the player, enabling or disabling
    specific mount-related game mechanics.
  description: This method configures a player's mount capability flag, which determines
    whether the player can access certain mount-related features in World of Warcraft.
    The flag parameter controls the state of mount capabilities, such as whether a
    player can use specific mounts or if certain mount requirements are met. This
    method is typically used during gameplay to enforce mount restrictions or to enable/disable
    mount-related mechanics based on game conditions or player progression.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: The mount capability flag value that determines the state of mount-related
      features. Valid values include 0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled), with other values
      potentially representing different mount states or requirements.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetRequiredMountCapabilityFlag(1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nuint8 flag = 0;\nif (player->GetPlayer()->HasMount())\n\
      {\n    flag = 1;\n}\nplayer->SetRequiredMountCapabilityFlag(flag);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other mount-related methods
    and may affect player's mount availability or gameplay mechanics. The implementation
    requires careful handling of flags to ensure correct behavior in game systems.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect mount states, potentially
    causing players to be unable to access mounts or triggering unexpected behavior
    in mount-related gameplay mechanics.
