documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified player class is capable of performing healing
    duties in World of Warcraft's LFG system.
  description: The ClassCanHeal method evaluates whether a given player class is eligible
    to fulfill a healing role within the Looking for Group (LFG) framework of TrinityCore.
    This functionality is crucial for matching players with appropriate roles during
    group formation, ensuring that healers are correctly identified and assigned to
    groups requiring support. The method takes into account the traditional healer
    classes from World of Warcraft such as Priest, Druid, Paladin, and Shaman, which
    are inherently capable of providing healing abilities. It does not consider temporary
    role changes or class-specific talents that might alter a character's ability
    to heal in specific scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified player class is capable of performing healing
    duties; otherwise returns false. Valid classes include Priest, Druid, Paladin,
    and Shaman, while other classes such as Warrior, Rogue, Mage, and others return
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a Priest can heal
    code: 'LFGRoleDetector detector;

      bool canHeal = detector.ClassCanHeal(CLASS_PRIEST);

      // Returns true since Priest is a healing class'
    language: cpp
  - title: Verify if a Warrior can heal
    code: 'LFGRoleDetector detector;

      bool canHeal = detector.ClassCanHeal(CLASS_WARRIOR);

      // Returns false since Warrior is not a healing class'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on hardcoded class definitions and does not dynamically
    evaluate talents or gear that might enable non-traditional healing. The implementation
    assumes standard World of Warcraft class roles and may not account for future
    expansions or custom content modifications.
  warnings: Do not rely solely on this method for determining if a character can heal
    in all situations, as it only checks the base class capabilities without considering
    talents, glyphs, or other gameplay modifiers that could change a character's role.
