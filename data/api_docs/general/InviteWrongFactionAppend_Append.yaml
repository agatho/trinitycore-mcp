  method: Append
  signature: void InviteWrongFactionAppend::Append(WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    & param0) const
documentation:
  brief: Appends channel notification data for wrong faction invites to a packet.
  description: The Append method populates a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet with data related to incorrect faction invitations. This typically occurs
    when a player attempts to join a channel that is restricted to a specific faction,
    and their faction does not match the required faction. The method ensures that
    appropriate error messages or notifications are sent back to the client to inform
    them of the faction mismatch. It is used internally by the TrinityCore server
    to handle channel access control based on player faction.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A reference to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify packet that
      will be populated with the notification data for wrong faction invites.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Appending Wrong Faction Notification to Packet
    code: 'InviteWrongFactionAppend notifier;

      WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      notifier.Append(notifyPacket);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal channel management system in TrinityCore
    and should not be called directly by external modules. It is typically invoked
    during channel join operations when faction checks fail.
