  signature: ReportMinorCategory ComplaintTicket::GetMinorCategoryFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the minor category flags associated with the complaint ticket.
  description: The GetMinorCategoryFlags method returns the ReportMinorCategory enumeration
    value that represents the specific minor category of the complaint ticket. This
    value is used to classify the type of issue reported by the player, such as harassment,
    game exploit, or other in-game concerns. The returned flags can be used to filter,
    sort, or process complaints based on their minor category. This method does not
    modify any internal state and is purely a getter function.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ReportMinorCategory enumeration value indicating the minor category of
    the complaint ticket. Possible values include but are not limited to categories
    like 'Harassment', 'Game Exploit', 'Bug Report', etc., depending on how the enum
    is defined in the TrinityCore codebase.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Check Minor Category
    code: "ComplaintTicket* ticket = sComplaintsMgr->GetTicketByGuid(ticketGuid);\n\
      if (ticket)\n{\n    ReportMinorCategory minorCat = ticket->GetMinorCategoryFlags();\n\
      \    if (minorCat == REPORT_MINOR_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT)\n    {\n        // Handle\
      \ harassment complaint\n        sLog->outString(\"Harassment complaint received.\"\
      );\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other ticket management
    functions to categorize and route player complaints appropriately. The ReportMinorCategory
    enum should be referenced from the TrinityCore source code for complete list of
    possible values.
