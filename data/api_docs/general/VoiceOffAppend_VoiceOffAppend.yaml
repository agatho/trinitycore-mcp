  class: VoiceOffAppend
  method: VoiceOffAppend
  signature: void VoiceOffAppend::VoiceOffAppend(const int & guid)
documentation:
  brief: Appends a voice off entry for the specified GUID to the voice off list.
  description: The VoiceOffAppend method adds a given player's GUID to the voice off
    list, effectively disabling voice communication for that player. This functionality
    is typically used in World of Warcraft server environments to manage player voice
    chat permissions. The method operates on a per-player basis and modifies internal
    voice communication state data structures. It does not validate whether the GUID
    corresponds to an active player or if voice chat is enabled globally.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose voice should be
      disabled. This value must represent a valid player entity within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Disable Voice for Specific Player
    code: 'VoiceOffAppend::VoiceOffAppend(playerGuid);

      // This disables voice communication for the player with the specified GUID.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger voice management system and may be
    called during player login, logout, or administrative actions. It modifies internal
    server state without returning any status information.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID is valid and corresponds to an actual player
    entity; otherwise, the behavior is undefined. This method does not perform any
    validation on the GUID itself.
