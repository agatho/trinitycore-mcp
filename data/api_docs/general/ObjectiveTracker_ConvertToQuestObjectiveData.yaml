  signature: QuestObjectiveData ObjectiveTracker::ConvertToQuestObjectiveData(const
    ObjectiveState & state)
documentation:
  brief: Converts an ObjectiveState into a QuestObjectiveData structure for quest
    tracking purposes.
  description: The ConvertToQuestObjectiveData method transforms an ObjectiveState
    object into a QuestObjectiveData structure, which is used internally by the objective
    tracker to manage and display quest objectives. This conversion process ensures
    that the state information of a specific quest objective is properly formatted
    and encapsulated in a data structure suitable for serialization, transmission,
    or storage within the TrinityCore quest system. The method likely handles mapping
    between internal objective states and standardized quest objective data formats
    required by the game client or server-side systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A QuestObjectiveData object containing the converted state information
    from the input ObjectiveState. This structure typically includes fields such as
    objective type, progress status, completion flags, and associated quest identifiers
    necessary for tracking quest objectives in the World of Warcraft client.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Conversion Example
    code: 'ObjectiveTracker tracker;

      ObjectiveState state;

      // Assume state is populated with valid objective data

      QuestObjectiveData data = tracker.ConvertToQuestObjectiveData(state);

      // Use data for quest tracking or display purposes'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal state validation and transformation
    without side effects. It's part of the core quest tracking infrastructure in TrinityCore,
    so it should be called only when valid ObjectiveState objects are available. The
    conversion process may involve copying or moving data from the source state to
    the target data structure.
  warnings: Ensure that the input ObjectiveState parameter is properly initialized
    before calling this method, as invalid or uninitialized states could lead to undefined
    behavior in the resulting QuestObjectiveData. This method should not be called
    with null or corrupted objective state objects.
