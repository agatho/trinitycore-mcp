  class: Unit
  method: SetImmuneToPC
  signature: void Unit::SetImmuneToPC(bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the unit's immunity to player-controlled creatures.
  description: This method controls whether a unit is immune to attacks from player-controlled
    creatures, such as those created by players using spells or abilities. When applied,
    the unit becomes immune to all player-controlled creature attacks, including those
    that would normally cause damage or status effects. This is commonly used in game
    mechanics where certain NPCs need to be protected from player interactions, particularly
    during quest events or when dealing with player-controlled summons.
  parameters:
  - name: apply
    description: If true, the unit becomes immune to player-controlled creatures;
      if false, the immunity is removed.
  - name: keep
    description: If true, the unit maintains immunity even when it would normally
      be affected by player-controlled creature attacks; if false, the unit loses
      immunity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* target = new Unit();


      // Set the unit to be immune to player-controlled creatures

      target->SetImmuneToPC(true);


      // Later, remove immunity

      target->SetImmuneToPC(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other immunity-related
    methods and can be combined with other flags to control how a unit interacts with
    player-controlled creatures. It should be used carefully as it may interfere with
    normal gameplay mechanics.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior during quest
    events or when dealing with player-controlled summons, potentially causing the
    unit to become unresponsive to player interactions.
