  class: FormationManager
  method: DeterminePlayerRole
  signature: FormationRole FormationManager::DeterminePlayerRole(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the formation role of a specified player within the
    group.
  description: The DeterminePlayerRole method evaluates a given Player object to assign
    them a specific FormationRole based on their current position, class, and group
    dynamics. This method is typically used in group-based gameplay scenarios such
    as raid encounters or battlegrounds where player positioning and roles are crucial
    for optimal performance. The role assigned may influence how the player interacts
    with other group members, their ability to perform certain actions, or their effectiveness
    in specific tactical situations. The method does not modify the player's state
    directly but rather provides a read-only assessment of their role within the formation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a FormationRole enum value indicating the determined role for the
    player. Possible values include LEADER, TANK, HEALER, DAMAGE_DEALER, and others
    depending on the implementation details. The method will return a valid FormationRole
    unless the input Player pointer is null or invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "FormationRole role = formationManager.DeterminePlayerRole(player);\nif\
      \ (role == FormationRole::TANK)\n{\n    // Handle tank-specific logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Role-Based Action Handling
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player pointer\nFormationRole role\
      \ = formationManager.DeterminePlayerRole(player);\nswitch (role)\n{\n    case\
      \ FormationRole::LEADER:\n        // Execute leader-specific actions\n     \
      \   break;\n    case FormationRole::HEALER:\n        // Execute healing logic\n\
      \        break;\n    default:\n        // Handle other roles\n        break;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal group state and player attributes to determine
    role assignments. It may perform checks against the player's current class, gear,
    and position within the formation. The implementation is expected to be thread-safe
    for concurrent access by multiple threads.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null to avoid undefined behavior. The method does not validate input parameters
    beyond checking for nullity, so callers should ensure proper initialization of
    player objects before invoking this method.
