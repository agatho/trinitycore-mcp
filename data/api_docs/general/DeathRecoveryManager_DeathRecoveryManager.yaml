documentation:
  brief: Initializes a DeathRecoveryManager instance as a copy of another DeathRecoveryManager
    instance.
  description: The DeathRecoveryManager constructor is used to create a new instance
    of the DeathRecoveryManager class by copying the state from an existing DeathRecoveryManager
    object. This copy constructor ensures that all internal data members and configurations
    are duplicated from the source object, maintaining consistency in death recovery
    mechanics across different instances. In the context of TrinityCore's World of
    Warcraft emulation, this functionality supports proper management of player death
    recovery states, including resurrection timers, soulstone usage, and related gameplay
    elements. The constructor does not perform any validation or error handling as
    it simply replicates the state of another manager instance.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source DeathRecoveryManager object whose state will be copied
      to initialize this new instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a DeathRecoveryManager by copying an existing one
    code: 'DeathRecoveryManager originalManager;

      // ... configure originalManager ...

      DeathRecoveryManager newManager(originalManager); // Copy constructor usage'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a standard copy constructor implementation. It performs a shallow
    copy of all member variables, which should be sufficient for DeathRecoveryManager's
    internal state management. Developers should ensure that any pointers or references
    within the class are properly handled to avoid dangling references or memory issues.
