documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is currently using LFG (Looking for Group)
    functionality.
  description: This method checks if a player is actively participating in the Looking
    for Group system, which allows players to queue for dungeons, raids, and other
    content through the LFG interface. The method returns true when the player has
    entered the LFG queue and false when they have exited it. This functionality is
    essential for managing player participation in group content and ensuring proper
    game mechanics handling during queue operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is using LFG, false otherwise. The return value
    indicates whether the player is currently queued for group content through the
    Looking for Group system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->isUsingLfg()) {\n    // Player is in LFG queue\n    // Do something\
      \ with LFG\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used to determine if a player has entered the LFG
    queue, which is important for managing group content participation and ensuring
    proper game mechanics handling during queue operations. The method may be used
    in conjunction with other LFG-related methods to track player status.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a player is actually in
    a group, as it only indicates whether they are queued for group content. It's
    important to distinguish between being in an LFG queue and being in a group.
