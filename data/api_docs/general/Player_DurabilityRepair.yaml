documentation:
  brief: Repairs player's equipment durability
  description: The DurabilityRepair method restores the durability of a player's equipment
    to maximum levels. It allows for repair of specific equipment slots or all equipment
    at once, with optional cost deduction and discount modifiers. This method is commonly
    used during gameplay to maintain equipment integrity and prevent gear degradation.
    The method operates on the player's inventory and equipped items, ensuring that
    all damaged items are restored to full condition.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The equipment slot position to repair, or 0xFFFF for all slots. Valid
      values include 0-18 (equipment slots) or 0xFFFF for all slots.
  - name: takeCost
    description: Whether to deduct gold from player's inventory for repair costs.
      True means cost is deducted, false means no cost is deducted.
  - name: discountMod
    description: The discount modifier applied to repair costs. Values range from
      0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 means full cost and 1.0 means no cost.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic durability repair
    code: player->DurabilityRepair(0, true, 0.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Full equipment repair with discount
    code: player->DurabilityRepair(0xFFFF, false, 0.5f);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during player interaction with repair NPCs
    or when using repair items. The method may be used in conjunction with other durability-related
    methods like DurabilityLoss to maintain proper equipment state.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect repair behavior, especially
    if the discount modifier is set incorrectly. Care should be taken when specifying
    the pos parameter to avoid unintended repairs.
