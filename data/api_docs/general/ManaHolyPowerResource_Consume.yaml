  class: ManaHolyPowerResource
  method: Consume
  signature: bool ManaHolyPowerResource::Consume(uint32 manaCost)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes mana cost from the holy power resource and returns true if successful.
  description: The Consume method attempts to deduct a specified amount of mana from
    the current holy power resource. This method is typically used in spell casting
    or ability usage mechanics within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework. It
    checks whether sufficient resources are available before performing the deduction.
    If the mana cost can be fully consumed, the method returns true; otherwise, it
    returns false. The operation modifies the internal state of the ManaHolyPowerResource
    object by reducing its available mana. This functionality is integral to managing
    player resource consumption during gameplay actions such as casting spells or
    using abilities that require holy power.
  parameters:
  - name: manaCost
    description: The amount of mana to consume from the holy power resource. Must
      be a non-negative integer representing the cost of the action being performed.
  returns: True if the specified mana cost was successfully deducted from the holy
    power resource; false if there were insufficient resources or if the operation
    failed for any reason.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (resource.Consume(50)) {\n    // Mana consumed successfully, proceed\
      \ with spell casting\n    CastSpell();\n} else {\n    // Not enough mana, cannot\
      \ cast spell\n    SendManaError();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Check Before Consumption
    code: "uint32 requiredMana = GetSpellManaCost();\nif (resource.GetAvailableMana()\
      \ >= requiredMana) {\n    if (resource.Consume(requiredMana)) {\n        //\
      \ Proceed with ability execution\n        ExecuteAbility();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the mana cost parameter is validated before being
    passed to ensure it represents a legitimate resource consumption request. The
    implementation likely includes bounds checking and may interact with other game
    systems such as cooldowns or resource regeneration timers.
  warnings: Do not call this method without verifying that the player has sufficient
    resources, as calling it with an invalid mana cost could lead to inconsistent
    state in the resource system. Also, be cautious about race conditions if multiple
    threads might access the same resource object concurrently.
