  class: ScopedDifficultyAdjustment
  method: ScopedDifficultyAdjustment
  signature: void ScopedDifficultyAdjustment::ScopedDifficultyAdjustment(BotAI * bot,
    Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a scoped difficulty adjustment for a bot AI with a specified
    player.
  description: The ScopedDifficultyAdjustment constructor initializes a scoped difficulty
    adjustment context for a BotAI instance associated with a specific Player. This
    mechanism allows temporary adjustments to difficulty settings during AI behavior
    execution, ensuring that the bot's actions are appropriately calibrated based
    on the player's current state or level. The adjustment is typically used in scenarios
    where dynamic difficulty scaling is required, such as during quest progression
    or combat encounters. The constructor sets up internal state tracking for the
    adjustment scope and ensures proper cleanup upon destruction.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that will utilize the difficulty adjustment.
      Must not be null.
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player instance whose characteristics will influence
      the difficulty adjustment. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of ScopedDifficultyAdjustment
    code: 'BotAI* bot = ...;

      Player* player = ...;

      ScopedDifficultyAdjustment adjustment(bot, player);

      // Difficulty adjustments are now active for this scope'
    language: cpp
  notes: This class likely uses RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles
    to manage the lifecycle of difficulty adjustments. The adjustment scope is typically
    tied to the object's lifetime and automatically cleans up when it goes out of
    scope.
  warnings: Ensure that both bot and player parameters are valid non-null pointers
    before constructing this object. Failure to do so may result in undefined behavior
    or crashes during AI execution.
