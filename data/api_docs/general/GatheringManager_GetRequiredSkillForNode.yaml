  signature: uint16 GatheringManager::GetRequiredSkillForNode(const GatheringNode
    & node) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the required skill level for a gathering node.
  description: The GetRequiredSkillForNode method returns the minimum skill level
    that a player must have in order to successfully gather resources from a specified
    gathering node. This method is used internally by the game engine to enforce skill
    requirements for mining, herbalism, and other gathering activities. The returned
    value represents the skill threshold needed for the node's resource to be obtainable.
    This method does not validate whether the player actually meets this requirement;
    it simply retrieves the configured value from the node definition.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint16 value representing the minimum skill level required to gather
    from the specified node. A value of 0 typically indicates no skill requirement,
    while higher values indicate increasing difficulty levels.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GatheringNode node;\n// Assume node is initialized with valid data\nuint16\
      \ requiredSkill = gatheringManager.GetRequiredSkillForNode(node);\nif (requiredSkill\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"This node requires skill level \" << requiredSkill\
      \ << \" to gather.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GatheringNode parameter is valid and properly
    initialized. The returned skill value should be compared against a player's current
    skill level in the relevant gathering profession (e.g., Mining, Herbalism). This
    method may be called frequently during gameplay when checking node accessibility,
    so performance considerations should be taken into account for high-frequency
    operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the GatheringNode parameter is valid before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. The returned skill level does not automatically enforce
    gathering rules; it only provides the required threshold for game logic implementation.
