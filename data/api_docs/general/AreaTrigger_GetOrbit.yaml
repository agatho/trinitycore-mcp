documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the orbit value associated with the area trigger.
  description: The GetOrbit method returns a constant reference to an integer representing
    the orbit configuration of the area trigger. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework, area triggers are used to define specific spatial regions that can
    have various effects or behaviors. The orbit value typically defines how the area
    trigger behaves in relation to other game entities, such as whether it orbits
    around a target or follows a specific path. This method is commonly used in conjunction
    with area trigger scripts and AI logic to determine movement patterns or interaction
    behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the orbit configuration
    of the area trigger. The value typically indicates the orbital behavior pattern,
    where different integers may represent different orbit types (e.g., 0 = no orbit,
    1 = clockwise orbit, -1 = counter-clockwise orbit).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Orbit Configuration
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = ...; // Assume we have a valid area trigger\nconst\
      \ int& orbitValue = trigger->GetOrbit();\nif (orbitValue > 0)\n{\n    // Trigger\
      \ has a clockwise orbit\n    // Perform clockwise orbit logic\n}\nelse if (orbitValue\
      \ < 0)\n{\n    // Trigger has a counter-clockwise orbit\n    // Perform counter-clockwise\
      \ orbit logic\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Trigger does not orbit\n    // Perform standard\
      \ area trigger logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Orbit Value in AI Behavior
    code: "class CustomAreaTriggerAI : public AreaTriggerAI\n{\npublic:\n    void\
      \ OnUpdate(uint32 diff) override\n    {\n        const int& orbit = GetOrbit();\n\
      \        if (orbit != 0)\n        {\n            // Apply orbital movement logic\
      \ based on orbit value\n            ApplyOrbitalMovement(orbit);\n        }\n\
      \        else\n        {\n            // Standard area trigger behavior\n  \
      \          AreaTriggerAI::OnUpdate(diff);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to an internal member variable of the AreaTrigger
    class. Modifying this value directly through the returned reference may affect
    the trigger's behavior. The orbit value is typically set during the area trigger's
    initialization or through scripting and should not be changed arbitrarily during
    runtime unless specifically intended for dynamic behavior modification.
  warnings: Be cautious when modifying the orbit value directly through the returned
    reference, as it may cause unexpected behavior in area trigger logic. Ensure that
    any changes to the orbit configuration are consistent with the intended game mechanics
    and do not introduce conflicts with existing orbital movement systems.
