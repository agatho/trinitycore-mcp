  signature: void PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface::UpdateConfig(const Config & config)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the player bot configuration in the database
  description: The UpdateConfig method persists the current player bot configuration
    settings to the database. This method is typically called when configuration changes
    need to be saved permanently, ensuring that the bot's behavior and settings are
    maintained across server restarts or sessions. The method handles the serialization
    and storage of various bot parameters including combat strategies, movement patterns,
    and interaction behaviors. It operates within the context of TrinityCore's playerbot
    system, which allows for automated character control through AI-driven decision
    making.
  parameters:
  - name: config
    description: Reference to the Config object containing the updated bot configuration
      settings to be saved to the database
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Configuration Update
    code: 'PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface dbInterface;

      Config newConfig;

      // Modify config settings...

      dbInterface.UpdateConfig(newConfig);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Combat Configuration
    code: 'PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface dbInterface;

      Config combatConfig;

      combatConfig.Set("combat_strategy", "aggressive");

      combatConfig.Set("attack_distance", 20);

      dbInterface.UpdateConfig(combatConfig);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database I/O operations and may impact performance during
    high-frequency configuration updates. The implementation likely uses transactional
    database operations to ensure data consistency. Developers should be aware that
    this method is part of the playerbot subsystem and requires proper initialization
    of the bot system before use.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or improperly initialized Config object
    may result in data corruption or database errors. Ensure that all configuration
    values are properly validated before calling this method. Frequent calls to UpdateConfig
    can cause performance degradation due to database write operations.
