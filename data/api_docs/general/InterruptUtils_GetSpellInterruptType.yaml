  class: InterruptUtils
  method: GetSpellInterruptType
  signature: InterruptType InterruptUtils::GetSpellInterruptType(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the interrupt type associated with a specified spell ID.
  description: The GetSpellInterruptType method determines and returns the interrupt
    behavior type for a given spell ID. This is used in TrinityCore's spell system
    to define how a spell should behave when interrupted by certain actions, such
    as movement or damage. The returned interrupt type influences whether a spell
    can be interrupted, what triggers the interruption, and how the spell's casting
    state should be handled during interruption events. This method is typically invoked
    during spell casting logic to enforce proper game mechanics related to spell interruptions.
  parameters: []
  returns: An InterruptType enum value indicating the specific interrupt behavior
    for the spell. Possible values may include SPELL_INTERRUPT_TYPE_NONE, SPELL_INTERRUPT_TYPE_MOVEMENT,
    SPELL_INTERRUPT_TYPE_DAMAGE, etc., depending on how the spell is configured in
    the spell database or script definitions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "InterruptType interruptType = InterruptUtils::GetSpellInterruptType(12345);\n\
      if (interruptType == SPELL_INTERRUPT_TYPE_DAMAGE)\n{\n    // Handle damage-based\
      \ interruption logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal spell data tables or configuration
    files to map spell IDs to their respective interrupt types. It's important for
    developers working with spell systems or custom spell behaviors to understand
    how these interrupt types are defined and used in the core game logic.
