documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the hunter's current target poses a significant threat
    to the hunter.
  description: The IsTargetDangerous method evaluates the threat level of the hunter's
    current target by analyzing various combat factors such as the target's health,
    attack power, defensive abilities, and proximity. This method is used internally
    by the HunterAI class to make tactical decisions about when to use certain abilities
    or when to reposition. It returns true if the target is considered dangerous enough
    to warrant defensive actions or avoidance, and false otherwise. The method does
    not take any parameters and relies on the internal state of the AI to determine
    the current target.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether the current target is dangerous.
    True indicates that the target poses a significant threat requiring defensive
    measures, while false indicates the target is not currently considered dangerous.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (hunterAI->IsTargetDangerous()) {\n    // Switch to defensive stance\
      \ or use protective ability\n    hunterAI->UseAbility(ABILITY_DEFENSIVE_STANCE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI's decision-making cycle and
    may involve calculations based on target attributes like health percentage, threat
    level, and distance. The implementation likely considers factors such as whether
    the target can one-shot the hunter or if it has high damage abilities.
