documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is the raid leader of their current group
  description: This method checks if the player associated with the GroupCoordinator
    instance holds the raid leader role within their current raid group. In World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, raid leadership is determined by the
    group's leader status and the group type being a raid. The method returns true
    only if the player is both the group leader and the group is configured as a raid.
    This functionality is essential for determining permissions and access to raid-specific
    features such as loot distribution settings, raid commands, and group management
    options.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is the raid leader of their current group; otherwise
    returns false. The method will return false if the player is not in a group, if
    the group is not a raid, or if the player is not the group leader.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check raid leadership
    code: "if (groupCoordinator->IsRaidLeader()) {\n    // Player has raid leader\
      \ permissions\n    SendRaidCommand(\"start_raid_encounter\");\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Player does not have raid leader permissions\n    SendSystemMessage(\"\
      You must be the raid leader to perform this action.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a command handler to validate permissions
    code: "void HandleRaidLockCommand(ChatHandler* handler) {\n    GroupCoordinator*\
      \ coordinator = handler->GetPlayer()->GetGroupCoordinator();\n    if (!coordinator\
      \ || !coordinator->IsRaidLeader()) {\n        handler->SendSysMessage(\"You\
      \ must be the raid leader to lock the raid.\");\n        return;\n    }\n  \
      \  // Proceed with raid locking logic\n    coordinator->LockRaid();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal group leadership state maintained by TrinityCore.
    It does not perform any network calls or database queries, making it efficient
    for frequent checks. The method will return false if the player is in a party
    but not in a raid, or if the group has been disbanded.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only checks the immediate leadership status
    and does not account for temporary leadership transfers or sub-group leader roles.
    Additionally, in scenarios where multiple players might have similar permissions
    (like raid assistants), this method will only return true for the actual group
    leader.
