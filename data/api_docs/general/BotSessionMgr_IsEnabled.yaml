documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot session manager is enabled and active.
  description: The IsEnabled method determines if the BotSessionMgr is currently enabled
    and functioning within the TrinityCore instance. This check is typically used
    to verify that bot-related functionality is available before attempting to interact
    with bot sessions. The method performs a simple state check on the internal enabled
    flag of the manager, returning true if bots are allowed to operate and false otherwise.
    This functionality is crucial for systems that conditionally enable or disable
    bot behavior based on server configuration or runtime conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot session manager is enabled and active, false otherwise.
    A return value of true indicates that bot sessions can be created, managed, and
    interacted with through the system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (BotSessionMgr::instance()->IsEnabled()) {\n    // Proceed with bot\
      \ session operations\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot sessions are enabled\");\n}\
      \ else {\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot sessions are disabled\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically a lightweight check that accesses an internal boolean
    flag. It should not have significant performance impact when called frequently.
    The enabled state may be influenced by server configuration settings or runtime
    conditions.
