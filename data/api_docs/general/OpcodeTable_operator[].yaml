documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the server opcode handler for a given opcode index.
  description: The operator[] method of the OpcodeTable class provides indexed access
    to server opcode handlers. It takes an OpcodeServer enum value as input and returns
    a pointer to the corresponding ServerOpcodeHandler structure. This mechanism is
    used internally by the TrinityCore server to map incoming client opcodes to their
    respective handler functions. The method performs bounds checking implicitly through
    the enum type, ensuring that only valid opcodes are accessed. This lookup is essential
    for processing network messages from clients in a performant and organized manner.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to a ServerOpcodeHandler structure corresponding to
    the provided opcode index. Returns nullptr if the opcode index is invalid or not
    registered.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing an Opcode Handler
    code: "OpcodeServer opcode = Opcodes::CMSG_AUTH_SESSION;\nconst ServerOpcodeHandler*\
      \ handler = opcodeTable[opcode];\nif (handler != nullptr) {\n    // Process\
      \ the opcode using handler->handler\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in the core network handling code where client
    messages are dispatched to appropriate handlers. The underlying implementation
    likely uses a lookup table or array for O(1) access time, making it efficient
    for high-frequency opcode lookups during gameplay.
