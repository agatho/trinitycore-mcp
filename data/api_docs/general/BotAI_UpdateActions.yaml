  signature: void BotAI::UpdateActions(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the bot's AI actions based on the elapsed time since last update.
  description: The UpdateActions method is responsible for processing and executing
    the current AI behavior of a bot within the TrinityCore framework. It evaluates
    the bot's state, determines appropriate actions to take, and performs those actions
    based on the time delta provided. This method is typically called from the main
    game loop at regular intervals, ensuring that bots respond dynamically to changes
    in their environment or assigned tasks. The method handles action scheduling,
    cooldown management, and decision-making logic for various bot behaviors such
    as movement, combat, and interaction with objects or players.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::UpdateBots(uint32 diff)\n{\n    for (auto& bot : botManager->GetAllBots())\n\
      \    {\n        bot->GetAI()->UpdateActions(diff);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly by the game loop to ensure bots behave
    responsively. It's important that the diff parameter accurately reflects the time
    elapsed since the last call to maintain consistent bot behavior. The implementation
    may involve complex state machines and decision trees that evaluate multiple factors
    like health, target status, and environmental conditions.
