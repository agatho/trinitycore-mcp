documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new QuestCompletion object for handling quest completion events
    in TrinityCore.
  description: The QuestCompletion constructor initializes a new instance of the QuestCompletion
    class, which is responsible for managing and processing quest completion events
    within the TrinityCore framework. This class typically handles the logic associated
    with marking quests as completed, awarding rewards, updating quest progress, and
    triggering related game events. The initialization process sets up internal state
    variables and prepares the object to handle quest-related operations such as validating
    quest completion conditions, distributing experience points, items, and other
    rewards to players. It is commonly used in conjunction with player interaction
    systems and quest management modules.

  - title: Basic QuestCompletion Initialization
    code: 'QuestCompletion completion;

      // This creates a new QuestCompletion object ready to handle quest events

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The QuestCompletion class is typically instantiated when a player interacts
    with quest givers or completes quest objectives. It's important to ensure proper
    cleanup of these objects after use to prevent memory leaks. The constructor may
    perform initial validation of quest data and set up internal callbacks for event
    handling.
  warnings: Improper initialization or usage of QuestCompletion objects can lead to
    undefined behavior in quest systems. Ensure that all required quest data is properly
    loaded before attempting to complete quests through this class. Avoid creating
    multiple instances unnecessarily as it may cause conflicts in quest state management.
