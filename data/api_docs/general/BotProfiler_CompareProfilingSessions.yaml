  signature: bool BotProfiler::CompareProfilingSessions(uint64_t sessionId1, uint64_t
    sessionId2, std::string & comparisonReport)
documentation:
  brief: Compares two profiling sessions and generates a detailed comparison report.
  description: The CompareProfilingSessions method takes two session identifiers and
    performs a detailed analysis of their profiling data to generate a comprehensive
    comparison report. This functionality is typically used by bot developers or administrators
    to evaluate performance differences between various bot configurations or execution
    states. The method retrieves profiling information from both sessions, processes
    the data to identify key metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and execution
    times, and then produces a structured text-based report summarizing the differences.
    The comparison is designed to be meaningful for debugging and optimization purposes
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionId1
    description: The unique identifier of the first profiling session to compare.
      This value must correspond to an existing session in the profiler's data store.
  - name: sessionId2
    description: The unique identifier of the second profiling session to compare.
      This value must correspond to an existing session in the profiler's data store.
  - name: comparisonReport
    description: A reference to a string where the generated comparison report will
      be stored upon successful execution. The report contains detailed metrics and
      differences between the two sessions.
  returns: Returns true if both sessions exist and the comparison was successfully
    generated; otherwise, returns false. A return value of false typically indicates
    that one or both session IDs are invalid or that an internal error occurred during
    processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Session Comparison
    code: "uint64_t session1 = 1234567890ULL;\nuint64_t session2 = 1234567891ULL;\n\
      std::string report;\nif (botProfiler.CompareProfilingSessions(session1, session2,\
      \ report)) {\n    std::cout << \"Comparison Report:\\n\" << report << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    std::cerr << \"Failed to compare profiling sessions.\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BotProfiler has already collected and stored
    profiling data for both specified sessions. It is recommended to ensure that sessions
    are properly closed before calling this method to avoid inconsistencies in the
    comparison results.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid session IDs will result in a failure
    and may cause undefined behavior if not handled correctly. Ensure that session
    IDs are validated prior to use.
