  method: GetPacketsProcessed
  signature: uint32 IBotSession::GetPacketsProcessed() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of network packets processed by the bot session
  description: The GetPacketsProcessed method retrieves the cumulative count of network
    packets that have been handled by this bot session instance. This counter includes
    all types of incoming and outgoing packets, such as movement updates, chat messages,
    and game state changes. The value is typically used for monitoring bot performance,
    debugging network issues, or tracking resource usage over time. This method is
    thread-safe and provides a consistent view of packet processing statistics across
    different threads.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of network packets processed
    by this bot session since its initialization. Returns zero if no packets have
    been processed yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Bot Activity
    code: 'uint32 packets = botSession->GetPacketsProcessed();

      TC_LOG_INFO("bot", "Bot has processed {} network packets", packets);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Packet Processing Rate Over Time
    code: 'uint32 initialPackets = botSession->GetPacketsProcessed();

      std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(10));

      uint32 finalPackets = botSession->GetPacketsProcessed();

      uint32 packetsPerSecond = (finalPackets - initialPackets) / 10;

      TC_LOG_INFO("bot", "Average packets per second: {}", packetsPerSecond);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used for diagnostic purposes and performance monitoring.
    The packet counter is incremented atomically to ensure thread safety in multi-threaded
    environments. For accurate performance metrics, consider taking measurements at
    regular intervals rather than relying on single snapshots.
  warnings: The returned value represents cumulative packet count which can grow indefinitely.
    In long-running bot sessions, this number may approach the maximum value for uint32
    (4,294,967,295), potentially causing overflow issues if not properly managed in
    applications that rely on this counter.
