  signature: bool BotProfiler::PauseProfilingSession(uint64_t sessionId)
documentation:
  brief: Pauses an active profiling session identified by the given session ID.
  description: The PauseProfilingSession method is used to temporarily halt a profiling
    session that was previously started using the BotProfiler class. This functionality
    allows developers or administrators to pause profiling data collection without
    terminating the session entirely, enabling them to resume profiling at a later
    time. The method takes a unique session identifier (sessionId) as input and returns
    a boolean value indicating whether the operation was successful. Profiling sessions
    are typically used in World of Warcraft bot development to monitor performance
    metrics, resource usage, or behavior patterns of AI-controlled characters.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionId
    description: A unique identifier representing the profiling session to be paused.
      This value is typically generated when a profiling session is initiated and
      must correspond to an active session for the method to succeed.
  returns: Returns true if the profiling session was successfully paused, false otherwise.
    The method may return false if the specified sessionId does not exist or if the
    session is already in a paused state.
  examples:
  - title: Pause an active profiling session
    code: "uint64_t sessionId = botProfiler.StartProfilingSession();\n// ... perform\
      \ some operations ...\nbool success = botProfiler.PauseProfilingSession(sessionId);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Profiling session paused successfully\n} else {\n   \
      \ // Failed to pause the session\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that profiling sessions are managed internally by the
    BotProfiler class. It is expected that a session has been started before attempting
    to pause it. The implementation likely involves checking internal session state
    tracking and updating the session's active status flag.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-existent or already paused session may result
    in a false return value without throwing an exception. Ensure proper error handling
    when using this method in production code.
