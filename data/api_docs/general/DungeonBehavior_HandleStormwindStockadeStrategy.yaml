  signature: void DungeonBehavior::HandleStormwindStockadeStrategy(Group * group,
    uint32 encounterId)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the Stormwind Stockade dungeon strategy for a given group and encounter
    ID.
  description: The HandleStormwindStockadeStrategy method is responsible for managing
    the AI behavior and tactical decisions within the Stormwind Stockade dungeon instance.
    This method processes the group's actions based on the current encounter ID, determining
    appropriate responses such as positioning, spell casting, or movement patterns.
    It integrates with the broader DungeonBehavior system to ensure coherent group
    strategy execution during encounters. The method assumes that the group has been
    properly initialized and that the encounter ID corresponds to a valid Stormwind
    Stockade encounter.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group participating
      in the Stormwind Stockade dungeon. Must be a valid, non-null pointer.
  - name: encounterId
    description: Unique identifier for the current encounter within the Stormwind
      Stockade instance. Determines which specific strategy logic is applied during
      the encounter.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in dungeon encounter
    code: 'Group* playerGroup = sObjectAccessor->GetGroupByLeader(ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345));

      uint32 currentEncounterId = 1;

      this->HandleStormwindStockadeStrategy(playerGroup, currentEncounterId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the DungeonBehavior AI system and should only be called
    when the group is actively engaged in a Stormwind Stockade encounter. The method
    does not perform any validation on the group's state or the encounter ID, so callers
    must ensure these are valid before invocation.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid group pointer or an unrecognized encounter
    ID may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all preconditions are
    met before invoking this method.
