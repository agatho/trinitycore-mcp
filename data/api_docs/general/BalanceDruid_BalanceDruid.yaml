  class: BalanceDruid
  method: BalanceDruid
  signature: void BalanceDruid::BalanceDruid(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a BalanceDruid instance with the specified player bot.
  description: The BalanceDruid constructor initializes a new instance of the BalanceDruid
    class, associating it with a specific Player object that represents the bot. This
    method sets up the necessary internal state and configuration required for the
    balance druid AI behavior. The player parameter should represent a valid bot character
    that has been initialized with appropriate attributes and abilities for a balance
    druid class. This constructor is typically called during the creation or initialization
    phase of a bot AI system within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character that
      will be controlled by this BalanceDruid instance. Must not be null and should
      represent a valid player with balance druid class characteristics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic BalanceDruid Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get or create a bot player

      BalanceDruid druidAI(myBot);

      // The BalanceDruid instance is now initialized and ready to control the bot'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely performs initialization of AI behavior flags, spell
    caches, and other internal data structures needed for balance druid gameplay.
    It may also validate that the provided player object has appropriate class and
    level requirements for a balance druid.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter points to a valid Player object with proper
    balance druid class setup before calling this constructor. Passing a null pointer
    will likely cause undefined behavior or crashes.
