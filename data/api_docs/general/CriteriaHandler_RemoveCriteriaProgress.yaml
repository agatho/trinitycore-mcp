  method: RemoveCriteriaProgress
  signature: void CriteriaHandler::RemoveCriteriaProgress(const Criteria * criteria)
documentation:
  brief: Removes progress for a specified criteria from the player's tracking.
  description: The RemoveCriteriaProgress method is responsible for clearing or resetting
    the progress associated with a specific criteria object. This function is typically
    invoked when a player no longer meets the requirements for a particular criterion,
    such as when they lose a quest reward, complete a daily quest that grants criteria,
    or when a criteria is manually removed from tracking. The method ensures that
    any stored progress data related to the criteria is cleared from memory and potentially
    from persistent storage if applicable. This action directly affects the player's
    achievement tracking system by removing partial or full completion status for
    the given criteria.
  parameters:
  - name: criteria
    description: A pointer to the Criteria object whose progress should be removed.
      This parameter must not be null and must point to a valid criteria instance
      that has been previously added to the player's tracking system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing Progress for a Quest Completion Criteria
    code: "Criteria* questCriteria = sObjectMgr->GetCriteria(12345);\nif (questCriteria)\n\
      {\n    RemoveCriteriaProgress(questCriteria);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Progress for a Specific Achievement Criteria
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player is valid\nCriteria* achievementCriteria\
      \ = sObjectMgr->GetCriteria(67890);\nif (achievementCriteria && player->HasCriteriaProgress(achievementCriteria))\n\
      {\n    player->RemoveCriteriaProgress(achievementCriteria);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it directly impacts the achievement
    system. It's recommended to verify that the criteria exists and has been previously
    added to the tracking system before calling this function. The underlying implementation
    may also trigger updates to the player's achievement data, which could result
    in UI refreshes or database writes.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null pointer will likely cause undefined behavior
    or crashes. Always validate that the criteria parameter points to a valid and
    tracked criteria object. Additionally, removing progress for criteria that are
    part of active achievements may lead to unexpected results if not handled properly
    within the broader achievement system logic.
