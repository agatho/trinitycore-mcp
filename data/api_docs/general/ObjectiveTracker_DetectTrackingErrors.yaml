  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: DetectTrackingErrors
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::DetectTrackingErrors(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Detects and reports errors in objective tracking for a player.
  description: The DetectTrackingErrors method performs validation checks on the current
    state of objectives being tracked by a player. It identifies inconsistencies or
    invalid states within the objective tracker, such as missing or corrupted objective
    data, invalid objective types, or tracking states that do not align with the player's
    current quest status. This method is typically invoked during periodic updates
    or when errors are suspected to maintain the integrity of the objective tracking
    system. The method does not modify any state but rather reports detected issues
    for potential correction or logging purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose objective tracking state is being
      validated. This parameter must be a valid player instance; passing a null pointer
      will result in undefined behavior.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      ObjectiveTracker* tracker = player->GetObjectiveTracker();

      tracker->DetectTrackingErrors(player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called periodically or when objective tracking inconsistencies
    are suspected. It does not perform any corrective actions but serves as a diagnostic
    tool to identify potential issues in the objective tracking system.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null player pointer will lead to undefined
    behavior and possible crash. Ensure that the player object is valid before invoking
    this method.
