  class: Unit
  method: SetUnitMovementFlags
  signature: void Unit::SetUnitMovementFlags(uint32 f)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the movement flags for a unit, controlling its movement behavior and
    state.
  description: This method allows developers to set the movement flags of a Unit object,
    which determines how the unit moves and behaves in the game world. The movement
    flags control various aspects such as walking, running, swimming, flying, and
    other movement states. This is commonly used for setting movement states like
    walking or running, or for controlling special movement behaviors like swimming
    or flying. It's an essential method for managing unit movement in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: f
    description: The movement flags value to set. This is a uint32 representing various
      movement states and behaviors, including walking, running, swimming, flying,
      and other movement types.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetSelectedUnit();

      unit->SetUnitMovementFlags(MOVEMENTFLAG_WALKING);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetSelectedUnit();

      unit->SetUnitMovementFlags(MOVEMENTFLAG_RUNNING | MOVEMENTFLAG_SWIMMING);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the movement flags of a Unit object, which
    affects how the unit moves. It's important to note that movement flags are typically
    set using bitwise operations and can be combined to represent complex movement
    states. The method is commonly used in conjunction with other movement-related
    methods.
  warnings: Care must be taken when setting movement flags as incorrect usage may
    lead to unexpected behavior or movement glitches. This method should not be used
    to directly manipulate unit's position, but rather to control movement state and
    behavior.
