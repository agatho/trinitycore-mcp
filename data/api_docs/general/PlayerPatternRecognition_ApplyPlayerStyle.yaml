  class: PlayerPatternRecognition
  method: ApplyPlayerStyle
  signature: void PlayerPatternRecognition::ApplyPlayerStyle(Player * bot, int templatePlayerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a predefined player style template to a specified bot character.
  description: The ApplyPlayerStyle method assigns a set of behavioral and tactical
    attributes from a template player to a given bot. This functionality is typically
    used in AI-driven gameplay scenarios where bots need to emulate specific player
    behaviors or strategies. The method retrieves the template data associated with
    the provided templatePlayerGuid and applies it to the target bot, adjusting its
    actions, decision-making patterns, and overall gameplay style accordingly. It's
    commonly utilized in custom TrinityCore modules or AI frameworks that extend bot
    behavior beyond standard defaults.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character that
      will receive the applied style.
  - name: templatePlayerGuid
    description: Integer value representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the template
      player whose style attributes are to be applied to the bot.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot instance

      int templateGuid = 12345;

      PlayerPatternRecognition::ApplyPlayerStyle(myBot, templateGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "Player* bot = sObjectAccessor->FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player,\
      \ 10001));\nif (bot)\n{\n    int templateId = 98765;\n    PlayerPatternRecognition::ApplyPlayerStyle(bot,\
      \ templateId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid bot reference\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the template player with the specified GUID exists
    in the database and contains valid style data. The actual application of styles
    may involve internal state updates within the bot's AI system, which could affect
    performance if called frequently during active gameplay.
  warnings: Calling this method on a bot without ensuring the existence of the template
    player can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the templatePlayerGuid
    corresponds to an existing and valid player entry before invoking this function.
