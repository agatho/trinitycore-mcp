  class: RoleOptimizer
  method: GreedyOptimization
  signature: OptimizationResult RoleOptimizer::GreedyOptimization(const int & players,
    const GroupComposition & targetComposition, const OptimizationConstraints & constraints)
documentation:
  brief: Performs a greedy optimization of group composition based on target roles
    and constraints.
  description: The GreedyOptimization method evaluates available players and attempts
    to construct an optimal group composition that satisfies the specified target
    roles and constraints. It uses a greedy algorithm approach, selecting players
    in order of their suitability for each role to maximize overall group effectiveness.
    This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server to automate
    raid or dungeon group formation, ensuring that teams meet required role distributions
    such as tanks, healers, and damage dealers. The optimization process considers
    player availability, class distribution, and other game-specific constraints to
    produce a balanced team configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: players
    description: Reference to the number of players available for group formation.
      This parameter determines how many potential candidates are considered in the
      optimization process.
  - name: targetComposition
    description: The desired group composition containing the required role distribution
      (e.g., number of tanks, healers, DPS). Defines what roles need to be filled
      for optimal performance.
  - name: constraints
    description: Set of rules and limitations that must be respected during optimization.
      Includes restrictions such as minimum level requirements, class restrictions,
      or player availability constraints.
  returns: An OptimizationResult object containing the optimized group composition
    along with metadata about the success or failure of the optimization process.
    The result includes details like which players were selected for the group and
    whether all roles could be satisfied within the given constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Greedy Optimization Usage
    code: "RoleOptimizer optimizer;\nint playerCount = 25;\nGroupComposition target;\n\
      target.tanks = 1;\ntarget.healers = 3;\ntarget.dps = 8;\nOptimizationConstraints\
      \ constraints;\nconstraints.minLevel = 80;\nconstraints.maxLevel = 90;\nOptimizationResult\
      \ result = optimizer.GreedyOptimization(playerCount, target, constraints);\n\
      if (result.success) {\n    // Process the optimized group\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Optimization with Multiple Constraints
    code: "RoleOptimizer optimizer;\nint playerCount = 15;\nGroupComposition target;\n\
      target.tanks = 2;\ntarget.healers = 2;\ntarget.dps = 6;\nOptimizationConstraints\
      \ constraints;\nconstraints.minLevel = 80;\nconstraints.maxLevel = 90;\nconstraints.requiredClasses\
      \ = {CLASS_WARRIOR, CLASS_PALADIN, CLASS_DRUID, CLASS_SHAMAN};\nOptimizationResult\
      \ result = optimizer.GreedyOptimization(playerCount, target, constraints);\n\
      if (result.success) {\n    for (const auto& player : result.groupMembers) {\n\
      \        std::cout << \"Selected: \" << player.name << \" (\" << player.classType\
      \ << \")\" << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method implements a greedy algorithm which may not always produce the
    globally optimal solution but provides a fast and reasonably effective result.
    The performance of this optimization can be affected by large numbers of players
    or complex constraints, as it iterates through available candidates to fill each
    role in turn. For best results, ensure that the target composition is feasible
    given the available player pool and constraints.
  warnings: The method may return an incomplete result if the constraints are too
    restrictive or if there aren't enough qualified players for all roles. It's important
    to check the success flag of the returned OptimizationResult before using the
    group members. Additionally, this method assumes that player availability and
    role preferences are properly initialized in the system.
