  method: PvPInfo
  signature: void PvPInfo::PvPInfo()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes PvP information for a player, setting up flags and timers related
    to player versus player combat.
  description: The PvPInfo constructor initializes the PvP-related state for a player
    character. This includes setting up internal flags that track whether the player
    is in a PvP zone, has enabled PvP, or is flagged for PvP combat. It also initializes
    timers and other PvP-specific data members necessary for tracking PvP status during
    gameplay. The method is typically called when a player logs in or enters a PvP
    zone, ensuring that all PvP-related systems are properly initialized for the character.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initializing PvP Info on Player Login
    code: "void OnPlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    // Initialize PvP info when\
      \ player logs in\n    player->GetPvPInfo()->PvPInfo();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal PvP system and should not typically be
    called directly by addon developers. It's usually invoked automatically during
    player initialization or zone transitions. The constructor may reset certain PvP
    timers and flags, so calling it inappropriately could affect PvP state tracking.
  warnings: Calling this method manually can interfere with normal PvP state management.
    It should only be used when explicitly required for custom PvP logic or testing
    purposes. Improper usage might cause inconsistencies in PvP flagging or timer
    behavior.
