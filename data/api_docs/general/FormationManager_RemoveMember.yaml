documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from their current formation group
  description: The RemoveMember method removes a specified player from their current
    formation group within the FormationManager. This method is typically used when
    a player leaves a group, disbands a formation, or needs to be removed from a specific
    formation layout. The method ensures that the player's formation data is properly
    cleaned up and that any associated formation references are updated accordingly.
    It returns true if the removal was successful, or false if the player was not
    found in any formation.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object that should be removed from the formation
      group. Must be a valid player instance; null pointers will result in undefined
      behavior.
  returns: Returns true if the player was successfully removed from their formation
    group, false if the player was not found in any formation or if the removal failed
    for other reasons.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of RemoveMember
    code: "Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Assume this is a valid player pointer\n\
      bool success = formationManager->RemoveMember(targetPlayer);\nif (success) {\n\
      \    // Player successfully removed from formation\n    sLog->outString(\"Player\
      \ removed from formation.\");\n} else {\n    // Player was not in any formation\
      \ or removal failed\n    sLog->outString(\"Failed to remove player from formation.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the FormationManager has proper tracking of all
    players within formations. It is recommended to validate that a player is actually
    part of a formation before calling this method to avoid unnecessary operations.
  warnings: Calling RemoveMember with a null player pointer will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Always ensure that the player pointer is valid and points
    to an active player object before invoking this method.
