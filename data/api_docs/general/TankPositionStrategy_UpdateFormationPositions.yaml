api:
  class: TankPositionStrategy
  method: UpdateFormationPositions
  signature: void TankPositionStrategy::UpdateFormationPositions(int bots, Unit *
    centerTarget)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the positioning of bots in a formation around a central target unit.
  description: The UpdateFormationPositions method adjusts the locations of bot units
    within a tactical formation relative to a specified center target. This method
    is typically used in AI-driven group behaviors where multiple NPCs need to maintain
    a structured position around a leader or focal point. It calculates and applies
    new positions based on formation logic, ensuring that bots remain properly spaced
    and aligned according to predefined tactical patterns. The method operates on
    the current state of the bot group and modifies their positioning dynamically
    as the center target moves or changes.
  parameters:
  - name: bots
    description: The number of bot units in the formation that will have their positions
      updated.
  - name: centerTarget
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that serves as the central target around
      which the bots will position themselves. This can be any valid unit such as
      a player, NPC, or creature.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'TankPositionStrategy strategy;

      Unit* target = player;

      strategy.UpdateFormationPositions(5, target);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Target
    code: "TankPositionStrategy strategy;\nUnit* target = GetClosestEnemy();\nif (target)\n\
      {\n    strategy.UpdateFormationPositions(botCount, target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal state variables of the TankPositionStrategy
    class to track bot positions and formation data. It may involve calculations for
    distance, angle, and spacing between units to maintain a coherent tactical layout.
  warnings: Ensure that the centerTarget parameter is not null before calling this
    method, as it could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The bots count should
    also be validated to prevent negative values or excessive numbers that might cause
    performance issues.
