documentation:
  brief: Optimizes guild bank space by reorganizing items to maximize storage efficiency.
  description: The OptimizeBankSpace method in GuildBankManager is responsible for
    reorganizing the contents of a guild's bank to improve storage utilization. This
    process typically involves moving items around within the bank's inventory slots
    to reduce empty spaces and ensure that items are stored in the most efficient
    manner possible. The method may be triggered automatically by the game system
    or manually by a guild officer with appropriate permissions. It ensures that the
    guild bank operates at maximum capacity, allowing more items to be stored without
    requiring additional bank tabs or upgrades.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's GUID who initiated
      the optimization request. This parameter is used to verify permissions and track
      which guild member performed the action.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GuildBankManager* bankManager = sObjectAccessor->GetGuildBankManager();

      int playerGuid = 12345;

      bankManager->OptimizeBankSpace(&playerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal calculations to determine optimal item
    placement and may involve temporary locking of bank slots during the optimization
    process. It's typically called when a guild member with sufficient permissions
    requests to optimize their guild's bank space.
