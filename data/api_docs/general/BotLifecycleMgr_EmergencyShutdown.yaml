documentation:
  brief: Immediately terminates all active bot instances and cleans up associated
    resources.
  description: The EmergencyShutdown method performs an immediate and forceful termination
    of all currently running bot instances within the TrinityCore environment. This
    method is typically invoked during critical system failures, server shutdowns,
    or emergency conditions to ensure that no orphaned bot processes continue to consume
    system resources. It forcefully closes all active bot connections, releases allocated
    memory, and ensures clean state cleanup across the bot lifecycle management system.
    The operation is synchronous and blocks until all shutdown procedures are completed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Emergency Shutdown Call
    code: BotLifecycleMgr::EmergencyShutdown();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during critical system events or server
    shutdowns. It does not perform graceful cleanup of individual bot states and may
    leave some data in an inconsistent state. The method is designed to be thread-safe
    and can be invoked from any thread context.
  warnings: Calling this method will abruptly terminate all bots without allowing
    them to perform any cleanup operations, potentially leading to data loss or inconsistent
    game state. It should never be called during normal gameplay operations.
