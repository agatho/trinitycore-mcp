documentation:
  brief: Analyzes competition for a target based on location and updates objective
    tracking state
  description: The AnalyzeTargetCompetition method evaluates the competitive landscape
    for a specified target within the game world, considering the provided location
    coordinates. This method is typically invoked during objective tracking to determine
    how many players or factions are competing for the same target. It processes the
    competition data and adjusts internal tracking states accordingly. The method
    operates on the assumption that targets have associated competition metrics and
    that location data is valid for spatial analysis.
  parameters:
  - name: targetId
    description: Unique identifier of the target being analyzed for competition. Must
      correspond to a valid game object or entity in the world.
  - name: location
    description: Reference to an integer representing the location coordinate used
      for competition analysis. The value typically corresponds to a spatial position
      within the game world, such as a zone ID or grid coordinate.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ObjectiveTracker tracker;

      uint32 targetGuid = 12345;

      int locationCoord = 67890;

      tracker.AnalyzeTargetCompetition(targetGuid, locationCoord);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal competition tracking systems and
    may update player or faction objective states. It should be called only when target
    and location data are confirmed valid to avoid processing invalid entries.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid targetId or malformed location data may
    lead to undefined behavior or incorrect competition analysis results. Ensure all
    inputs are validated before invocation.
