  class: SpellScript
  method: SetHitHeal
  signature: void SpellScript::SetHitHeal(int heal)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the hit heal value for the spell script.
  description: The SetHitHeal method is used within SpellScript implementations to
    define the amount of healing that will be applied when the spell hits its target.
    This method directly influences the final healing done by the spell, allowing
    developers to modify healing values dynamically during spell execution. It is
    typically called within spell effect handlers or custom spell logic to adjust
    healing amounts based on various conditions or modifiers.
  parameters:
  - name: heal
    description: The integer value representing the amount of healing to be applied
      when the spell hits its target. This value can be positive (healing) or negative
      (damage), and should be within valid game mechanics limits.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Healing Adjustment
    code: "class MyHealSpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleHeal()\n\
      \    {\n        int baseHeal = 100;\n        // Apply a 20% bonus to healing\n\
      \        int adjustedHeal = baseHeal * 1.2;\n        SetHitHeal(adjustedHeal);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Healing Modification
    code: "class DivineHealSpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void\
      \ HandleHeal()\n    {\n        Unit* target = GetHitUnit();\n        if (target\
      \ && target->GetHealth() < target->GetMaxHealth() * 0.3)\n        {\n      \
      \      // Double heal for critically injured targets\n            SetHitHeal(GetHitHeal()\
      \ * 2);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during spell execution, typically within
    effect handlers or custom logic. The healing value set here directly affects the
    final damage/healing done and will override any previous values. Be cautious with
    negative values as they may cause unintended damage effects.
  warnings: Calling SetHitHeal outside of proper spell execution context can lead
    to undefined behavior. Ensure that the heal value is within acceptable game mechanics
    bounds to prevent exploits or crashes. This method does not validate input parameters,
    so developers must ensure valid values are passed.
