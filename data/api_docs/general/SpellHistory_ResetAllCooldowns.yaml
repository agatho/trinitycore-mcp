  signature: void SpellHistory::ResetAllCooldowns()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all spell cooldowns in the SpellHistory object.
  description: The ResetAllCooldowns method clears all active spell cooldowns stored
    within the SpellHistory instance. This function is typically used to immediately
    reset a player's or creature's spell cooldown state, effectively making all spells
    available for immediate use. It does not affect global cooldowns or other non-cooldown
    related spell restrictions. The method operates on the internal cooldown tracking
    mechanism of the SpellHistory class, which manages when spells can be cast based
    on their cooldown timers.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset player spell cooldowns
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->GetSpellHistory()->ResetAllCooldowns();

      // All spell cooldowns are now cleared for the player'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset cooldowns in a custom spell handler
    code: "void CustomSpellHandler(Unit* caster)\n{\n    if (caster->GetSpellHistory())\n\
      \    {\n        caster->GetSpellHistory()->ResetAllCooldowns();\n    }\n}\n\
      // Clears all cooldowns for the casting unit before applying new effects"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it bypasses normal cooldown mechanics.
    It's commonly called during special events, player resets, or when applying temporary
    spell effects that require immediate availability of all spells. The operation
    is performed in O(n) time where n is the number of tracked cooldowns.
  warnings: Using this method may cause unintended gameplay behavior if not properly
    controlled. It should not be used in regular spell casting logic as it can break
    game balance by allowing unlimited use of cooldown-based abilities. Always ensure
    cooldowns are reset only when appropriate for game mechanics.
