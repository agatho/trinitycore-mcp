  class: RoleAssignment
  method: GetPlayerRolePreference
  signature: GroupRole RoleAssignment::GetPlayerRolePreference(uint32 playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the role preference assigned to a player within a group context.
  description: The GetPlayerRolePreference method fetches the designated role that
    a specific player has selected or been assigned within a group. This is typically
    used in group management systems such as raid groups or dungeons where players
    may have different roles (e.g., tank, healer, damage dealer). The returned GroupRole
    value indicates what role the player prefers or is expected to fulfill during
    group activities. This method does not validate whether the player is actually
    in a group; it simply returns their stored preference. If no role preference exists
    for the given player GUID, the behavior may return a default or invalid role value
    depending on implementation details.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose role preference
      is being retrieved. This should be a valid player GUID from the game's database.
  returns: Returns a GroupRole enum value representing the player's assigned or preferred
    role in a group. Possible values may include GR_TANK, GR_HEALER, GR_DAMAGE, or
    an invalid/unknown role if no preference is set.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Check Player Role Preference
    code: "GroupRole role = roleAssignment->GetPlayerRolePreference(playerGuid);\n\
      if (role == GR_DAMAGE)\n{\n    // Player prefers to be a damage dealer\n   \
      \ // Perform appropriate actions for DPS role\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use Role Preference in Group Assignment Logic
    code: "uint32 playerGuid = 12345;\nGroupRole preferredRole = roleAssignment->GetPlayerRolePreference(playerGuid);\n\
      switch (preferredRole)\n{\n    case GR_TANK:\n        // Assign to tank position\n\
      \        break;\n    case GR_HEALER:\n        // Assign to healer position\n\
      \        break;\n    case GR_DAMAGE:\n        // Assign to damage dealer position\n\
      \        break;\n    default:\n        // Handle unknown or unset role\n   \
      \     break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that player role preferences are stored and managed by
    the RoleAssignment system. It is recommended to check if a player is part of a
    group before calling this method to avoid unintended behavior. The actual implementation
    may cache results or query from an internal map for performance reasons.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided playerGuid is valid and corresponds to an existing
    player in the game world. Using an invalid GUID might result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect role assignments.
