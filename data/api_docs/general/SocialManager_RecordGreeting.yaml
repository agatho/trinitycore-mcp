  brief: Records a greeting message for the player's social interactions.
  description: The RecordGreeting method is used to log or store a greeting message
    associated with the player's social behavior within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method likely updates internal social tracking systems, such as friend lists,
    guild communications, or interaction logs. It may be invoked when a player sends
    or receives a greeting, and it ensures that the greeting is properly recorded
    in the game's social database. The method does not return any value but modifies
    internal state related to social interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();

      socialMgr->RecordGreeting();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core game logic when a
    greeting interaction occurs. Developers should not need to call this method directly
    unless implementing custom social behavior or debugging.
