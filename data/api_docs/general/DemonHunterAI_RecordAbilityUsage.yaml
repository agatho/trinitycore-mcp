  class: DemonHunterAI
  method: RecordAbilityUsage
  signature: void DemonHunterAI::RecordAbilityUsage(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Records the usage of a specified spell ability for the Demon Hunter AI.
  description: The RecordAbilityUsage method logs when a specific spell ability is
    used by the Demon Hunter AI. This functionality is typically employed to track
    cooldowns, manage ability ordering, and maintain internal state for AI decision-making
    processes. The method likely updates internal tracking structures or databases
    within the AI system to reflect that a given spell has been executed. It serves
    as part of the broader AI behavior management system in TrinityCore's Demon Hunter
    implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell ability being recorded. This value
      corresponds to the Spell ID used within the TrinityCore database and must represent
      a valid Demon Hunter spell.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void MyDemonHunterAI::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    // Record usage of Shadowfury\n\
      \    RecordAbilityUsage(30283);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // Example: Record usage of Eye Beam when cast\n   \
      \ if (me->GetVictim() && me->IsWithinMeleeRange(me->GetVictim()))\n    {\n \
      \       RecordAbilityUsage(198013); // Eye Beam spell ID\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI state management system and may
    interact with cooldown tracking, ability priority queues, or other internal AI
    modules. It's expected to be called from within the Demon Hunter's combat logic
    flow.
  warnings: Ensure that spellId corresponds to an actual spell defined in the TrinityCore
    database; otherwise, the method might not behave as intended or could cause undefined
    behavior.
