  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: CheckBuildingBlocking
  signature: bool LineOfSightManager::CheckBuildingBlocking(const int & from, const
    int & to)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if there are any building obstructions between two points in the game
    world.
  description: The CheckBuildingBlocking method determines whether any structures
    or buildings block the line of sight between two specified locations within the
    TrinityCore game world. This functionality is crucial for determining visibility,
    spell casting, and NPC behavior that depends on unobstructed paths. The method
    evaluates the spatial relationship between the provided coordinates and returns
    true if an obstruction exists, false otherwise. It's commonly used in combat systems,
    AI pathfinding, and gameplay mechanics requiring line-of-sight calculations.
  parameters:
  - name: from
    description: The starting point coordinate for the line of sight check. This represents
      the origin position from which the visibility test begins.
  - name: to
    description: The ending point coordinate for the line of sight check. This represents
      the target position to which visibility is being tested.
  returns: Returns true if there are building obstructions blocking the line of sight
    between the two points; returns false if no obstructions are found or if the points
    are valid and unobstructed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Line of Sight Check
    code: "if (lineOfSightManager.CheckBuildingBlocking(100, 200)) {\n    // Handle\
      \ case where line of sight is blocked\n    std::cout << \"Line of sight blocked\
      \ by building\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Line of sight is clear\n   \
      \ std::cout << \"Line of sight is clear\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Combat System
    code: "bool canSeeTarget = !lineOfSightManager.CheckBuildingBlocking(playerPosition,\
      \ enemyPosition);\nif (canSeeTarget) {\n    // Player can attack enemy\n   \
      \ player->CastSpell(enemy, SPELL_SHOOT);\n} else {\n    // Cannot see target\
      \ due to obstruction\n    player->SendChatMessage(\"I cannot see my target!\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs spatial calculations using the game's collision system
    and may have performance implications when called frequently. The coordinates
    passed should be valid world positions within the game map boundaries. The implementation
    likely uses internal grid-based or ray-casting algorithms to determine obstruction
    status.
  warnings: Ensure that the from and to parameters represent valid positions in the
    game world; invalid coordinates may lead to undefined behavior. This method does
    not account for dynamic objects like moving creatures, only static building obstructions.
