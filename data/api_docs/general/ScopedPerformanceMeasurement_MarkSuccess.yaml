documentation:
  brief: Marks the performance measurement as successful, indicating completion of
    a tracked operation.
  description: The MarkSuccess method is used to signal that a performance measurement
    operation has completed successfully. This method typically updates internal tracking
    state to reflect that the measured task or operation has finished without errors.
    In the context of TrinityCore's performance monitoring systems, this method would
    be called after a monitored code section has executed properly. The method does
    not take any parameters and performs no return value operations, serving purely
    as a state marker for performance measurement tracking.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Performance Monitoring
    code: 'ScopedPerformanceMeasurement perfMeasure("DatabaseQuery");

      // ... perform database query ...

      perfMeasure.MarkSuccess(); // Mark successful completion'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other performance measurement
    APIs to track operation success rates and execution times. It should be called
    after a successful operation completes, but before the scope of the measurement
    ends.
