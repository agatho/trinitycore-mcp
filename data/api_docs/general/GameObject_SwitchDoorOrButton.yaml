  signature: void GameObject::SwitchDoorOrButton(bool activate, bool alternative)
documentation:
  brief: Activates or deactivates a game object's door or button state.
  description: The SwitchDoorOrButton method is used to toggle the state of a GameObject
    that represents a door or button in the World of Warcraft environment. This method
    controls whether the door is open or closed, or whether the button is pressed
    or released. It is typically invoked when an interaction occurs with the object,
    such as a player clicking on it or a spell affecting it. The method modifies internal
    state flags and may trigger related events or scripts depending on how the GameObject
    is configured in the database.
  parameters:
  - name: activate
    description: Determines whether to activate (true) or deactivate (false) the door
      or button state.
  - name: alternative
    description: Controls alternative behavior, often used for special cases like
      dual-state objects or specific quest conditions. When true, may trigger different
      animations or effects than the default activation path.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Door Toggle
    code: 'GameObject* door = ...; // Get reference to a door GameObject

      door->SwitchDoorOrButton(true, false); // Open the door'
    language: cpp
  - title: Button Press with Alternative Logic
    code: 'GameObject* button = ...; // Get reference to a button GameObject

      button->SwitchDoorOrButton(false, true); // Trigger alternative button behavior
      (e.g., secret mechanism)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the GameObject and may cause visual
    changes such as animation triggers or sound effects. It does not directly send
    packets to clients; instead, it relies on the core's event system to propagate
    state changes.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation might lead to unexpected
    behavior in quest logic or object interactions. Ensure that the GameObject is
    indeed a door or button before invoking this method.
