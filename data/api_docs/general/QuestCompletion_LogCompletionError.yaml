  class: QuestCompletion
  method: LogCompletionError
  signature: void QuestCompletion::LogCompletionError(Player * bot, uint32 questId,
    const std::string & error)
documentation:
  brief: Logs an error message when a quest completion fails for a player.
  description: The LogCompletionError method records diagnostic information about
    why a quest could not be completed by a player. This function is typically used
    in automated quest handling systems or botting frameworks to track failures and
    debug quest-related issues. It writes the error details to the game's logging
    system, associating the error with the specific player and quest ID for later
    analysis. The method does not throw exceptions but may produce log output that
    can be reviewed by administrators or developers.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character attempting
      to complete the quest. Must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest that failed to complete. Should correspond
      to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: error
    description: String describing the specific error encountered during quest completion.
      This can include reasons like missing items, incorrect conditions, or other
      validation failures.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player object

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      std::string errorMsg = "Required item not found in inventory";

      QuestCompletion::LogCompletionError(player, questId, errorMsg);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended for internal use within TrinityCore's quest handling
    system and may be called from various subsystems such as quest validators or automated
    quest completion logic. The error messages are logged using the standard TrinityCore
    logging infrastructure, which can be configured to output to console, files, or
    other destinations.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid undefined behavior. Also, make sure that the questId corresponds to an actual
    quest in the database; otherwise, the log entry may not be meaningful.
