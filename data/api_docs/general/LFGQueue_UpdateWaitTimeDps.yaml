  class: LFGQueue

  signature: void LFGQueue::UpdateWaitTimeDps(int32 waitTime, uint32 dungeonId)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the average wait time for a specific dungeon in the LFG queue system.
  description: The UpdateWaitTimeDps method is responsible for updating the average
    wait time statistic for a given dungeon within the Looking For Group (LFG) queue
    system. This method is typically called when a player's wait time for a specific
    dungeon has been calculated or adjusted, and it helps maintain accurate queue
    statistics that are used to inform players about expected wait times. The method
    updates internal tracking data structures to reflect the new wait time value for
    the specified dungeon ID. This functionality supports the dynamic adjustment of
    queue expectations based on real-time player behavior and dungeon availability.
  parameters:
  - name: waitTime
    description: The updated average wait time in seconds for the specified dungeon.
      Negative values may indicate special states or errors, while positive values
      represent actual wait time measurements.
  - name: dungeonId
    description: Unique identifier for the dungeon whose wait time is being updated.
      This ID corresponds to specific dungeon entries in the game's database and typically
      maps to instances like raid dungeons, heroic dungeons, or normal dungeons.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Wait Time for a Raid Dungeon
    code: 'LFGQueue* queue = sLFGMgr->GetQueue(PLAYER_GUID);

      queue->UpdateWaitTimeDps(180, 1234); // Update wait time to 3 minutes for dungeon
      ID 1234'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Wait Time Based on Player Experience
    code: 'uint32 currentWaitTime = CalculateAverageWaitTime(player);

      LFGQueue* queue = sLFGMgr->GetQueue(player->GetGUID());

      queue->UpdateWaitTimeDps(currentWaitTime, player->GetDungeonId());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal data structures that are used for calculating
    and displaying wait times to players. The implementation may involve thread-safe
    operations since LFG queue systems often need to handle concurrent access from
    multiple players. It is important to note that this method does not directly affect
    the player's queue position or group formation, but rather maintains statistical
    data.
  warnings: Ensure that dungeonId values are valid and correspond to existing dungeons
    in the game database; invalid IDs may cause undefined behavior or errors. The
    waitTime parameter should be carefully validated as negative values might indicate
    error states or special conditions that require handling.
