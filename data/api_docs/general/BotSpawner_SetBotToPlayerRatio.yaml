  signature: void BotSpawner::SetBotToPlayerRatio(float ratio)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the ratio of bots to players in the world.
  description: The SetBotToPlayerRatio method configures the proportion of AI-controlled
    bots relative to real players within the game environment. This setting affects
    how many non-player characters (bots) are spawned or maintained in relation to
    active player characters. The ratio is typically expressed as a floating-point
    value where 1.0 represents one bot for every player, 0.5 represents half as many
    bots as players, and so forth. This method is commonly used in bot management
    systems to control server load, testing environments, or gameplay balance adjustments.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Bot-to-Player Ratio to 1:1
    code: BotSpawner::SetBotToPlayerRatio(1.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Configure Bots to be Half the Number of Players
    code: BotSpawner::SetBotToPlayerRatio(0.5f);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal recalculation of bot population based
    on current player count. It may not immediately affect existing bots but will
    influence future spawning decisions.
  warnings: Setting very high ratios may cause performance issues or unexpected behavior
    if the server cannot handle the additional AI load. Ensure that the ratio is within
    reasonable bounds for your server configuration.
