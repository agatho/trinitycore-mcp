  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: CalculateRoleScore
  signature: float AdaptiveBehaviorManager::CalculateRoleScore(BotRole role) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a role score for a specified bot role within the adaptive
    behavior manager.
  description: The CalculateRoleScore method computes a numerical score that represents
    how suitable or effective a given bot role is within the current adaptive behavior
    context. This score is typically used to determine optimal role assignments for
    bots in dynamic gameplay scenarios, such as group encounters or quest completion.
    The method evaluates various factors including player performance, encounter difficulty,
    and team composition to produce an accurate assessment of role effectiveness.
    It does not modify any internal state but rather provides a read-only evaluation
    based on current conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated role score. Higher scores indicate
    better suitability or performance for the specified role. The exact scale and
    interpretation may vary depending on implementation details and contextual factors
    within the adaptive behavior system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: float score = manager.CalculateRoleScore(BotRole::TANK);
    language: cpp
  - title: Role Scoring for Multiple Roles
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < MAX_BOT_ROLES; ++i)\n{\n    BotRole role = static_cast<BotRole>(i);\n\
      \    float score = manager.CalculateRoleScore(role);\n    printf(\"Role %d score:\
      \ %.2f\\n\", i, score);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently during gameplay to provide
    real-time role assessments. It should not be used in performance-critical sections
    without considering its computational overhead. The returned scores are relative
    and may vary between different instances or configurations of the AdaptiveBehaviorManager.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotRole enum values passed to this method are valid and
    within expected ranges, as invalid inputs could lead to undefined behavior or
    inaccurate scoring results. This method assumes all necessary contextual data
    is properly initialized before invocation.
