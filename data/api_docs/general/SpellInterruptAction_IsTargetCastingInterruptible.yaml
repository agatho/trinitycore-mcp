  signature: bool SpellInterruptAction::IsTargetCastingInterruptible(::Unit * target)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a target unit's current spell casting can be interrupted
    by an interrupt action.
  description: The IsTargetCastingInterruptible method evaluates if a given target
    unit is currently casting a spell that is eligible for interruption. This check
    typically occurs during spell interruption logic, such as when a spell is cast
    on an enemy or when a combat situation changes. The method verifies the target's
    current spell state and returns true if the casting can be interrupted, false
    otherwise. It is commonly used in spell systems to determine valid interrupt conditions
    before applying effects like silence, dispel, or other interruption mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target unit is currently casting a spell that can be
    interrupted; returns false if the target is not casting or if the current spell
    cannot be interrupted.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Interrupt Logic
    code: "if (spellInterruptAction.IsTargetCastingInterruptible(targetUnit)) {\n\
      \    // Apply interrupt effect\n    targetUnit->InterruptSpell(CurrentSpellTypes::SPELL_INTERRUPT_TYPE_CHANNELED);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Interruptibility Before Applying Effects
    code: "SpellInterruptAction interruptAction;\nif (interruptAction.IsTargetCastingInterruptible(victim))\
      \ {\n    // Apply silence effect\n    victim->AddAura(SPELL_AURA_MOD_SILENCE,\
      \ caster);\n    // Log interruption\n    sLog->outString(\"Interrupted spell\
      \ casting on %s\", victim->GetName().c_str());\n} else {\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Target %s is not casting a spell that can be interrupted.\", victim->GetName().c_str());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state of the target unit's spell casting.
    It may return false if the target is in a state where spell interruption is not
    allowed, such as during certain channeling spells or while under specific magical
    effects that prevent interruption.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit pointer is valid before calling this method
    to avoid accessing invalid memory. This method should only be called when the
    target unit is known to exist and is in a valid state for spell checking.
