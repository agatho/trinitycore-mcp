documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the declined names array for this pet.
  description: The GetDeclinedNames method retrieves a const pointer to an array of
    declined names associated with the pet. In World of Warcraft, pets can have declined
    forms of their names (similar to player name declensions) which are stored in
    an array. This method provides access to that data structure for use in name display
    or localization logic. The returned pointer points to internal memory managed
    by the Pet object and should not be modified or freed by the caller. The array
    typically contains 5 integers representing different grammatical cases of the
    pet's name.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an integer array containing declined names for this
    pet, or nullptr if no declined names are set. The array usually contains 5 elements
    corresponding to different grammatical cases (nominative, accusative, dative,
    genitive, locative).
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Pet Declined Names
    code: "Pet* pet = ...; // Assume pet is initialized\nconst int* declinedNames\
      \ = pet->GetDeclinedNames();\nif (declinedNames != nullptr)\n{\n    for (int\
      \ i = 0; i < 5; ++i)\n    {\n        printf(\"Declined name %d: %d\\n\", i,\
      \ declinedNames[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned array is managed internally by the Pet class and must not be
    modified or deallocated. This method should only be called on valid pet objects
    that have been properly initialized with name data. The declined names are typically
    used for localization purposes in the game client when displaying pet names in
    different grammatical cases.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned array as it is managed internally by the Pet
    object. Calling this method on a pet without initialized declined names may return
    nullptr, which should be checked before accessing the data.
