  method: CalculateOptimalMeleePosition
  signature: int PaladinAI::CalculateOptimalMeleePosition(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal melee position for a paladin based on
    target distance and combat mechanics.
  description: The CalculateOptimalMeleePosition method determines the best physical
    positioning for a paladin to engage in melee combat with a target. This calculation
    considers factors such as the target's current distance, the paladin's attack
    range, and optimal positioning for maintaining threat while avoiding unnecessary
    movement. The method is typically used by the PaladinAI class to make strategic
    decisions about when and where to close to melee range. It returns an integer
    value representing the calculated position or state, which may be used by other
    AI components to determine movement behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the optimal melee position state. The
    specific meaning of return values depends on internal implementation but typically
    represents a position code or flag indicating whether the paladin should move
    closer, maintain distance, or is already in optimal range for melee attacks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "int position = this->CalculateOptimalMeleePosition();\nif (position ==\
      \ OPTIMAL_POSITION)\n{\n    // Proceed with melee attack\n    this->AttackTarget();\n\
      }\nelse if (position == NEEDS_TO_MOVE_CLOSER)\n{\n    // Move toward target\n\
      \    this->MoveToTarget();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PaladinAI's strategic decision-making system and
    relies on internal state tracking of target position and paladin capabilities.
    The exact calculation logic may vary based on paladin specialization (e.g., Protection,
    Retribution, Holy) and current combat situation.
