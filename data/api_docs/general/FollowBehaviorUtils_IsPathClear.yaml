  class: FollowBehaviorUtils
  method: IsPathClear
  signature: bool FollowBehaviorUtils::IsPathClear(Player * bot, const int & destination)
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a clear path exists from the bot's current position to the
    specified destination for follow behavior.
  description: The IsPathClear method evaluates whether there is a navigable, unobstructed
    path between the bot's current location and a given destination coordinate. This
    utility function is typically used in AI-based follow behaviors to determine if
    the bot can safely move toward its target without colliding with obstacles or
    terrain features. The method performs pathfinding checks using TrinityCore's navigation
    system to ensure that movement is feasible. It returns true if a valid path exists,
    and false otherwise. This check is essential for preventing bots from attempting
    to follow targets through walls or other impassable terrain.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will be checking
      the path. Must not be null.
  - name: destination
    description: Reference to an integer representing the destination identifier or
      coordinate. The exact meaning depends on how the system maps destinations to
      coordinates in the game world.
  returns: Returns true if a clear navigable path exists from the bot's current position
    to the destination, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate obstacles,
    impassable terrain, or invalid destination data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in follow behavior
    code: "if (FollowBehaviorUtils::IsPathClear(bot, destinationId)) {\n    bot->MoveTowards(destinationId);\n\
      } else {\n    bot->Say(\"Cannot reach target.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with conditional movement logic
    code: "uint32 dest = GetTargetDestination(bot);\nif (FollowBehaviorUtils::IsPathClear(bot,\
      \ dest)) {\n    bot->SetFollowState(FOLLOW_STATE_FOLLOWING);\n    bot->MoveTo(dest);\n\
      } else {\n    bot->SetFollowState(FOLLOW_STATE_STOPPED);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on TrinityCore's navigation mesh system to perform path
    checks. Performance may be impacted by complex terrain or numerous obstacles in
    the path. The destination parameter must map correctly to valid coordinates within
    the game world for accurate results.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot pointer is valid before calling this method, as passing
    a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also, note that pathfinding
    accuracy depends on the quality of the navigation mesh; poorly defined areas may
    return incorrect results.
