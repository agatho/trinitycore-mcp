  method: CheckDualWieldStatus
  signature: void FuryWarriorRefactored::CheckDualWieldStatus()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the dual-wield status of the fury warrior based on current weapon
    configuration and combat state.
  description: The CheckDualWieldStatus method evaluates whether the fury warrior
    is currently using dual-wielded weapons or a single main-hand weapon. This method
    is typically invoked during combat state changes, weapon swaps, or when checking
    the warrior's ability to perform dual-wield attacks. It ensures that the warrior's
    attack mechanics are correctly configured according to their current equipment
    setup and class restrictions. The method may also update internal flags or states
    related to dual-wield capabilities, such as enabling or disabling off-hand attack
    animations or adjusting damage calculations accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void FuryWarriorRefactored::UpdateCombatState()\n{\n    // ... other combat\
      \ logic ...\n    CheckDualWieldStatus();\n    // ... continue with attack logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage After Weapon Swap
    code: "void FuryWarriorRefactored::OnWeaponChanged(Item* newWeapon)\n{\n    //\
      \ ... handle weapon change logic ...\n    CheckDualWieldStatus();\n    // ...\
      \ update attack speed and damage based on new weapon setup ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's equipment system to determine
    if both main-hand and off-hand weapons are equipped. It may also be called automatically
    by the core combat system when weapon states change, making it an essential part
    of maintaining proper warrior combat behavior.
