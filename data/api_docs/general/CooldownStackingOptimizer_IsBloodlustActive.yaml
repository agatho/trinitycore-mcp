  signature: bool CooldownStackingOptimizer::IsBloodlustActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the Bloodlust buff is currently active on the player
  description: This method determines whether the player has the Bloodlust buff applied,
    which increases attack speed and casting speed by 30% for 15 seconds. The check
    considers both the player's own Bloodlust effect as well as any similar effects
    from other sources such as Heroism, Time Warp, or other haste-increasing abilities
    that share the same cooldown. This method is typically used in cooldown optimization
    logic to determine when certain abilities should be prioritized or delayed based
    on the presence of haste buffs.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if any Bloodlust-type buff is currently active on the player,
    false otherwise. The method checks for all variants of the haste buff including
    Bloodlust, Heroism, Time Warp, and similar effects that share the same underlying
    cooldown mechanism.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Cooldown Logic
    code: "if (optimizer.IsBloodlustActive()) {\n    // Prioritize high-damage abilities\
      \ that benefit from haste\n    player.CastSpell(SpellId::FrostfireBolt);\n}\
      \ else {\n    // Use standard rotation\n    player.CastSpell(SpellId::Fireball);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Rotation Logic
    code: "class MyRotation {\npublic:\n    void ExecuteNextAbility(CooldownStackingOptimizer&\
      \ optimizer) {\n        if (optimizer.IsBloodlustActive()) {\n            //\
      \ Use abilities that scale well with haste\n            CastHasteBenefitingSpell();\n\
      \        } else {\n            // Use standard ability sequence\n          \
      \  CastNormalSpell();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state tracking of buffs and debuffs within
    the TrinityCore framework. It may return false if the buff is active but not properly
    tracked by the optimizer, or if the player is in a state where buffs cannot be
    applied (such as during certain combat phases). The implementation uses the underlying
    aura system to check for active haste effects.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a direct replacement for checking specific
    spell IDs. Instead, it provides a higher-level abstraction that considers all
    haste-increasing effects that share the same cooldown window. Be aware that some
    effects may have different durations or stacking behaviors than others, but this
    method treats them uniformly.
