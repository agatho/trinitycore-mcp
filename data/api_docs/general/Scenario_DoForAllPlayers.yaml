  class: Scenario
  method: DoForAllPlayers
  signature: void Scenario::DoForAllPlayers(const int & worker) const
documentation:
  brief: Executes a specified function for all players within the scenario context.
  description: The DoForAllPlayers method iterates through all active players participating
    in the scenario and executes the provided worker function for each player. This
    method is typically used to apply actions, checks, or modifications across all
    players in a scenario instance. The worker parameter represents an integer identifier
    that determines which specific operation or action to perform on each player.
    The method ensures thread safety by operating within the scenario's context and
    does not modify the player list during iteration. It is commonly used for scenario-wide
    events, rewards distribution, or status updates.
  parameters:
  - name: worker
    description: An integer identifier that specifies which function or operation
      to execute for each player in the scenario. This value determines the behavior
      of the worker function and should correspond to a valid action within the scenario's
      logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to send a message to all players
    code: scenario->DoForAllPlayers(1); // Sends a welcome message to all players
    language: cpp
  - title: Executing a scenario-specific action for all players
    code: scenario->DoForAllPlayers(5); // Applies a debuff to all players in the
      scenario
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called only within a valid scenario context.
    The worker parameter must map to a predefined action within the scenario's implementation.
    The function executes synchronously for each player, so performance may degrade
    with large numbers of players. Ensure that the worker function does not modify
    the scenario's player list during iteration.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy computations or blocking operations within the
    worker function as it will block all players in the scenario. Do not assume that
    the player objects remain valid throughout the execution, especially if the scenario
    can end or remove players during the process.
