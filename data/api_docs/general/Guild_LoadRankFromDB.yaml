  class: Guild
  method: LoadRankFromDB
  signature: void Guild::LoadRankFromDB(int * fields)
documentation:
  brief: Loads guild rank information from the database into the guild object's internal
    data structures.
  description: The LoadRankFromDB method is responsible for retrieving guild rank
    data from the database and populating the corresponding internal structures within
    the Guild class. This method is typically called during guild initialization or
    when refreshing guild data from the database. It processes the raw database fields
    and maps them to the appropriate rank properties such as rank name, rights, and
    permissions. The method assumes that the database connection is already established
    and that the necessary data is available in the provided fields array. This functionality
    is essential for maintaining accurate guild hierarchy and member permissions within
    the World of Warcraft server environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Guild Initialization
    code: 'Guild* guild = new Guild();

      int fields[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Example database fields

      guild->LoadRankFromDB(fields);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the Guild class during construction
    or data refresh operations. Developers should not call this method directly unless
    implementing custom guild loading logic. The method expects a properly formatted
    fields array containing rank-related database values in a specific order.
  warnings: Calling this method with an improperly formatted fields array may result
    in undefined behavior or corrupted guild data. Ensure that the database connection
    is active and that field indices match expected column positions before invoking
    this method.
