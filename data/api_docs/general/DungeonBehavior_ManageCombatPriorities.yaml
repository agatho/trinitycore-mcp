documentation:
  brief: Manages combat priorities for group members during dungeon encounters
  description: The ManageCombatPriorities method adjusts the combat behavior and targeting
    priorities of group members based on the current dungeon encounter. It ensures
    that players focus on appropriate targets according to encounter mechanics, such
    as prioritizing boss attacks over adds or handling specific encounter phases.
    This method is typically invoked during dungeon encounters to maintain proper
    group coordination and optimal combat efficiency. The method operates on a provided
    group object and uses encounter data to determine priority adjustments.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing players participating in the
      dungeon encounter
  - name: encounter
    description: Reference to the DungeonEncounter object defining current encounter
      mechanics and priorities
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in dungeon encounter
    code: "void MyDungeonScript::OnEncounterStart(Group* group, const DungeonEncounter&\
      \ encounter)\n{\n    dungeonBehavior.ManageCombatPriorities(group, encounter);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom encounter logic
    code: "void CustomDungeonAI::UpdateCombatPriorities(Group* group, const DungeonEncounter&\
      \ encounter)\n{\n    // Pre-processing\n    if (encounter.GetPhase() == PHASE_ADDS)\n\
      \    {\n        dungeonBehavior.ManageCombatPriorities(group, encounter);\n\
      \    }\n    // Post-processing\n    else if (encounter.GetPhase() == PHASE_BOSS)\n\
      \    {\n        // Additional boss-specific logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies player AI behavior dynamically based on encounter
    state. It may involve updating target selection, threat management, and combat
    stance adjustments for group members. The implementation probably uses internal
    priority tables or rules defined by the encounter data.
  warnings: Calling this method without valid group or encounter parameters may lead
    to undefined behavior. Ensure that the group contains active players and the encounter
    is properly initialized before invocation.
