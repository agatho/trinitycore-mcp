documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AuctionHouseScript instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the AuctionHouseScript class is responsible for
    cleaning up any resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This method
    is automatically invoked when an AuctionHouseScript instance goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's auction house system,
    this destructor ensures that any internal data structures or references related
    to auction house events are properly released. The method does not accept any
    parameters and performs no return operations, as it is a destructor.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Default Destructor Usage
    code: 'AuctionHouseScript* script = new AuctionHouseScript();

      // ... use the script ...

      delete script; // This calls ~AuctionHouseScript()'
    language: cpp
  notes: Developers should not manually invoke this destructor. It is automatically
    called by the C++ runtime when an object is destroyed. The AuctionHouseScript
    class likely inherits from a base script class, and its destructor may be virtual
    if polymorphic behavior is expected.
