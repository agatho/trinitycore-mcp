documentation:
  brief: Returns the exact number of soul shards currently available to the player
  description: The GetExactShards method retrieves the precise floating-point count
    of soul shards that a player possesses. This value represents the actual quantity
    of soul shards, which are used primarily by warlocks for casting spells and abilities.
    The return value includes fractional amounts, allowing for precise tracking of
    shard accumulation from various sources such as spell casts, item bonuses, or
    consumable effects. This method does not account for any temporary modifiers or
    pending shard gains that may occur in the next game tick.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the exact number of soul shards available to
    the player. The value can include fractional components (e.g., 3.5 shards) and
    will be zero if no shards are available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float shards = player->GetSoulShardSystem()->GetExactShards();\nif (shards\
      \ >= 1.0f)\n{\n    // Player can cast a spell requiring at least one soul shard\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Sufficient Shards
    code: "SoulShardSystem* shardSystem = player->GetSoulShardSystem();\nfloat currentShards\
      \ = shardSystem->GetExactShards();\nif (currentShards >= 2.5f)\n{\n    // Player\
      \ has enough shards to cast a high-cost spell\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_SOUL_SHARD_SPELL, true);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Not enough shards - handle\
      \ accordingly\n    player->SendNotification(\"Not enough soul shards.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns the raw, unmodified shard count and should be used when
    precise calculations are needed. It does not factor in temporary effects like
    haste or spell procs that may modify shard generation rates. The value is typically
    updated after each shard-generating action.
  warnings: Do not assume that integer values will always represent whole shards;
    fractional values are valid and should be handled properly in calculations. This
    method may return a cached value if called during certain game states, so for
    real-time updates, consider using other related methods or polling strategies.
