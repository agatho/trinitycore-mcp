  signature: bool DisciplinePriestRefactored::HandleShielding(const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Applies shielding effect to a specified group of players
  description: 'The HandleShielding method is responsible for applying a protective
    shielding effect to a designated group of players within the Discipline Priest''s
    aura range. This method typically manages the application and removal of shield
    spells such as Power Word: Shield or similar protective abilities. It evaluates
    whether the shielding can be applied based on game mechanics, player conditions,
    and group composition. The method ensures that only valid targets receive the
    shield effect and handles any necessary cooldowns or resource management.'
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The identifier of the target group to apply the shielding effect
      to. This value typically represents a group index or GUID used to determine
      which players in the raid/party should receive the shield.
  returns: Returns true if the shielding was successfully applied to the specified
    group, false otherwise. The method may return false if the group is invalid, if
    the player lacks sufficient resources, or if the shielding effect cannot be applied
    due to game rules or conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Apply Shielding to Group 1
    code: "if (priest->HandleShielding(1)) {\n    // Shielding successfully applied\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Power Word: Shield applied to group 1\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Failed to apply shielding\n    sLog->outString(\"Failed to apply Power\
      \ Word: Shield to group 1\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Shielding Application
    code: "uint8 targetGroup = GetTargetGroup();\nif (targetGroup > 0 && priest->HandleShielding(targetGroup))\
      \ {\n    // Apply additional effects or log success\n    SendSpellLog(SPELL_LOG_SHIELD_APPLIED);\n\
      \    SetLastShieldTime(getMSTime());\n} else if (targetGroup == 0) {\n    //\
      \ No valid group selected\n    SendSystemMessage(\"No valid target group selected.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the TrinityCore's spell system and AI framework.
    It may require that the priest has sufficient mana or resources to cast the shield
    effect. The group parameter should be validated against current raid/party composition
    to prevent invalid targeting.
  warnings: Ensure that the group identifier is valid before calling this method,
    as invalid groups can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This method may have
    cooldown restrictions and resource consumption that should be considered in AI
    decision-making logic.
