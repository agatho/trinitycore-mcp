documentation:
  brief: Loads all waypoint paths from the database into memory for creature movement.
  description: The _LoadPaths method is responsible for initializing and loading all
    defined waypoint paths from the database into the in-memory waypoint manager.
    This method is typically called during server startup or when the waypoint system
    needs to be refreshed. It retrieves path data including waypoints, movement types,
    and associated creature IDs, then constructs internal data structures that allow
    creatures to follow these predefined paths. The method ensures that all path-related
    data is properly validated and ready for use by the AI system when creatures need
    to perform waypoint-based movement.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during server initialization
    code: "void World::LoadDatabase() {\n    // ... other initialization code ...\n\
      \    sWaypointMgr->_LoadPaths();\n    // ... continue with other systems ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the WaypointMgr class and
    should not be called directly by other systems. The method performs database queries
    and may have performance implications during server startup when loading large
    numbers of paths. It assumes that the database connection is already established
    and that the relevant waypoint tables contain valid data.
  warnings: Calling this method while creatures are actively using waypoint paths
    can cause undefined behavior or movement glitches. This method should only be
    called during safe initialization phases, not during active gameplay. Improperly
    formatted path data in the database may cause assertion failures or crashes during
    path loading.
