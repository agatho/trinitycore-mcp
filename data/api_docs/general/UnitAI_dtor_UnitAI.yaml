  class: UnitAI
  method: ~UnitAI
  signature: void UnitAI::~UnitAI()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the UnitAI instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ~UnitAI destructor is automatically invoked when a UnitAI object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper cleanup
    of AI-related resources, including releasing references to the associated unit,
    clearing AI state information, and performing any necessary memory deallocation.
    In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this destructor is
    crucial for maintaining memory integrity when creatures or players with AI behavior
    are removed from the game world. The destruction process typically involves calling
    parent class destructors and ensuring no dangling pointers remain in the AI subsystem.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction of UnitAI
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    UnitAI* ai = new CreatureAI(creature);\n\
      \    // ... AI usage ...\n    delete ai; // Triggers ~UnitAI destructor\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-based UnitAI Destruction
    code: "void AnotherExample()\n{\n    CreatureAI ai(creature);\n    // ai automatically\
      \ destroyed when going out of scope\n    // ~UnitAI called implicitly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is typically not called directly by user code in TrinityCore.
    It's automatically invoked during object lifetime management. Developers should
    be aware that AI-related resources may be freed immediately upon destruction,
    so any references to the AI must not be used after this point.
