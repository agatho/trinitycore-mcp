  brief: Retrieves the prioritized strategy list for behavior management in AI systems
  description: The GetPrioritizedStrategies method returns an integer identifier representing
    the current set of prioritized strategies managed by the BehaviorPriorityManager.
    This method is used within TrinityCore's AI framework to determine the order of
    strategy execution for NPC behaviors. The returned value typically corresponds
    to a bitmask or enumeration that defines which strategies should be evaluated
    and executed in what priority order. This mechanism allows for dynamic behavior
    adjustment based on context, such as combat state, health level, or environmental
    conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the prioritized strategy set. The specific
    meaning of this value depends on the internal implementation but typically encodes
    a bitmask or enumeration indicating which behaviors should be considered and in
    what order they should be executed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve current behavior priorities
    code: "int prioritySet = behaviorManager.GetPrioritizedStrategies();\nif (prioritySet\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process the prioritized strategies\n    // Implementation\
      \ depends on how strategies are encoded\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI decision-making cycles to determine
    which behaviors should be considered. The returned integer may represent a bitmask
    where each bit corresponds to a different behavior strategy, allowing for efficient
    combination and evaluation of multiple strategies simultaneously.
