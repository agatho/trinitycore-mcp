  signature: float MageAI::GetSchoolMasteryBonus(MageSchool school)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the mastery bonus percentage for a specified magic
    school.
  description: The GetSchoolMasteryBonus method computes the mastery bonus applied
    to spell damage or healing for a given MageSchool. This value represents the percentage
    increase in effectiveness from a mage's mastery trait specific to that school
    of magic. The method takes into account the player's current mastery rating and
    applies the appropriate scaling factor based on the game's mastery mechanics.
    It is typically used by MageAI to adjust spell damage calculations or to determine
    the effectiveness of mastery-based abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the mastery bonus percentage for the specified
    school. This value is usually between 0.0 and 2.0, where 1.0 represents no bonus,
    and values above 1.0 indicate a percentage increase in spell effectiveness.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float frostMastery = mageAI->GetSchoolMasteryBonus(MAGE_SCHOOL_FROST);

      float fireMastery = mageAI->GetSchoolMasteryBonus(MAGE_SCHOOL_FIRE);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying Mastery Bonus to Spell Damage
    code: 'float baseDamage = 100.0f;

      float masteryBonus = mageAI->GetSchoolMasteryBonus(MAGE_SCHOOL_ARCANE);

      float finalDamage = baseDamage * masteryBonus;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal player stats and mastery ratings stored
    within the AI context. The actual calculation may involve complex scaling factors
    or look-up tables based on the player's mastery level. This function is typically
    called during spell damage calculations to apply the appropriate bonus.
  warnings: Ensure that the MageSchool parameter is valid before calling this method,
    as invalid values could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect calculations.
    The returned value should be used carefully in mathematical operations to avoid
    precision loss.
