documentation:
  brief: Returns the previous LFG state of the group
  description: The GetOldState method retrieves the last known state of a Looking
    for Group (LFG) group before the current state was set. This is used internally
    by the LFG system to track state transitions and maintain consistency during group
    matching and queue operations. The returned LfgState value represents the logical
    state the group was in prior to any recent changes, which can be useful for determining
    what actions or notifications should be triggered based on the transition.
  parameters: []
  returns: The previous LFG state of the group as an LfgState enum value. This represents
    the state the group was in before the most recent state change occurred.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Previous LFG State
    code: "LfgGroupData* groupData = ...;\nLfgState oldState = groupData->GetOldState();\n\
      if (oldState == LFG_STATE_DUNGEON)\n{\n    // Handle transition from dungeon\
      \ state\n    sLog->outString(\"Group transitioning from dungeon state\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with state change tracking within
    the LFG subsystem. The old state value may be invalid or undefined if this is
    the first time the group has been assigned a state, or if the internal state tracking
    mechanism hasn't been initialized yet.
