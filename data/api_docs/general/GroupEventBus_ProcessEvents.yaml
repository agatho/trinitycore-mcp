  method: ProcessEvents
  signature: uint32 GroupEventBus::ProcessEvents(uint32 diff, uint32 maxEvents)
documentation:
  brief: Processes pending group events up to a specified limit within the given time
    delta
  description: The ProcessEvents method handles the execution of queued group-related
    events such as member joins, leaves, invitations, and other group state changes.
    It processes these events in the order they were queued, respecting a maximum
    event count limit to prevent performance degradation. The method is typically
    called from the main game loop or update cycle to ensure timely handling of group
    operations. This method ensures that group synchronization and event propagation
    occur correctly without blocking the main thread for extended periods.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: Time delta in milliseconds since last call, used to determine how
      much time has passed for event processing
  - name: maxEvents
    description: Maximum number of events to process in this call, preventing excessive
      processing overhead
  returns: Returns the actual number of events processed during this invocation, which
    may be less than maxEvents if fewer events were queued or if processing was limited
    by time constraints
  examples:
  - title: Basic event processing in game loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Process up to 100 group\
      \ events per update cycle\n    uint32 processed = sGroupEventBus->ProcessEvents(diff,\
      \ 100);\n    // Additional world updates...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing with dynamic event limits
    code: "void GroupManager::UpdateGroupEvents()\n{\n    uint32 diff = getMSTimeDiff(lastEventTime,\
      \ getMSTime());\n    lastEventTime = getMSTime();\n    \n    // Process events\
      \ but limit to 50 to avoid blocking\n    uint32 processed = sGroupEventBus->ProcessEvents(diff,\
      \ 50);\n    \n    if (processed > 0)\n        TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"group\", \"Processed\
      \ {} group events\", processed);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called regularly from the main game update
    loop. It's important to note that processing time may vary depending on the number
    of queued events and their complexity. The method does not block execution but
    may defer event processing if too many events are pending. Event processing order
    is maintained as events were added to the queue.
  warnings: Calling this method with very high maxEvents values can cause performance
    spikes during busy periods. It's recommended to use moderate limits (e.g., 50-100)
    to balance responsiveness with system stability. Avoid calling this method from
    within event handlers to prevent potential deadlocks or infinite recursion.
