  signature: void LFGQueue::SetCompatibles(const std::string & key, LfgCompatibility
    compatibles)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the compatible players for a given LFG queue key
  description: This method assigns a set of compatible players to a specific LFG (Looking
    For Group) queue key. It is used internally by the LFG system to track which players
    are compatible with each other for group matching. The method stores the compatibility
    information in an internal map, allowing the LFG system to quickly determine which
    players can be grouped together based on their compatibility status. This functionality
    is crucial for efficient group formation and player matching within the game's
    LFG framework.
  parameters:
  - name: key
    description: The unique identifier key for the LFG queue, typically representing
      a specific dungeon or group type
  - name: compatibles
    description: The set of compatible players represented as an LfgCompatibility
      object containing player GUIDs and their compatibility status
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Compatible Players for a Dungeon Queue
    code: 'LfgCompatibility compatibles;

      compatibles.insert(Player::GetGUID());

      compatibles.insert(Player::GetGUID() + 1);

      compatibles.insert(Player::GetGUID() + 2);

      lfgQueue.SetCompatibles("dungeon_123", compatibles);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during LFG queue processing when player compatibility
    information needs to be updated or initialized. The internal storage mechanism
    uses efficient data structures for fast lookup and matching operations.
  warnings: Modifying compatibility data directly can affect group formation logic.
    Ensure that compatibility data reflects actual player relationships and preferences
    to maintain proper LFG functionality.
