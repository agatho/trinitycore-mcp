  class: RuneSystem
  method: Consume
  signature: bool RuneSystem::Consume(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified number of runes from the player's rune system and returns
    true if successful.
  description: The Consume method reduces the available rune count in the RuneSystem
    by the specified amount. This method is typically used in World of Warcraft's
    combat system to manage death knight runes, where each ability consumes one or
    more runes. The method checks whether sufficient runes are available before performing
    the consumption. If the requested amount exceeds the current rune count, the operation
    will fail and return false without modifying the rune state. This method is essential
    for maintaining proper game balance and ensuring that abilities can only be used
    when appropriate resources are available.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified number of runes were successfully consumed;
    otherwise returns false if there are insufficient runes available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic rune consumption
    code: "if (player->GetRuneSystem()->Consume(1)) {\n    // Successfully consumed\
      \ one rune\n    // Proceed with ability execution\n} else {\n    // Not enough\
      \ runes available\n    // Handle insufficient resources\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Consuming multiple runes for a powerful ability
    code: "uint32 requiredRunes = 3;\nif (player->GetRuneSystem()->Consume(requiredRunes))\
      \ {\n    // Execute the powerful ability that consumes 3 runes\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_POWERFUL_ABILITY, true);\n} else {\n    // Notify player they don't\
      \ have enough runes\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"Not enough runes to use\
      \ this ability.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before executing abilities that require rune
    consumption. It's important to note that the RuneSystem manages both death knight
    runes and other similar resource types in the game. The implementation may involve
    checking cooldowns, rune regeneration states, or other related systems depending
    on the specific game mechanics.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking if sufficient runes are available
    can lead to unexpected behavior. Always verify the return value before proceeding
    with ability execution. In some cases, this method might be called in a context
    where rune regeneration is not yet processed, so ensure proper timing of calls.
