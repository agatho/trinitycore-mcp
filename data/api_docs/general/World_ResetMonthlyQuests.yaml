  brief: Resets the monthly quest progress for all players in the world.
  description: The ResetMonthlyQuests method clears and resets the monthly quest completion
    data for all connected players in the World of Warcraft server. This function
    is typically invoked during monthly reset periods to ensure that players can begin
    new monthly quest chains. The method iterates through all active player sessions
    and clears their monthly quest tracking flags, allowing them to re-engage with
    monthly quest objectives. It does not affect daily quests or other recurring quest
    types. This operation is performed server-side and does not require any direct
    player interaction.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: World::instance()->ResetMonthlyQuests();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during scheduled monthly reset intervals
    to avoid disrupting active player progress. The operation is synchronous and may
    cause temporary performance impact on servers with high player counts.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of normal reset periods may result in unexpected
    behavior for players who are actively engaged in monthly quests. Ensure this function
    is only invoked at appropriate times during the monthly reset cycle.
