  class: DeclinedName
  method: DeclinedName
  signature: void DeclinedName::DeclinedName(const UF::DeclinedNames & uf)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a DeclinedName object with data from a UF::DeclinedNames structure.
  description: The DeclinedName constructor initializes the internal state of a DeclinedName
    object by copying data from a provided UF::DeclinedNames structure. This method
    is typically used when creating or updating declined name data for player characters
    in World of Warcraft, particularly when handling noun declensions for different
    grammatical cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, etc.). The initialization
    process ensures that all declined forms are properly set according to the provided
    data structure. This method does not perform any validation on the input data
    and assumes the UF::DeclinedNames object contains valid information.
  parameters:
  - name: uf
    description: A constant reference to a UF::DeclinedNames structure containing
      the declined name data to initialize this DeclinedName object with. This structure
      typically holds arrays or containers of strings representing different grammatical
      cases for a noun.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'UF::DeclinedNames declinedData;

      // ... populate declinedData with name declensions ...

      DeclinedName name(declinedData);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Player Creation Context
    code: "void InitializePlayerDeclinedNames(Player* player, const std::string& playerName)\
      \ {\n    UF::DeclinedNames declinedNames;\n    // ... populate declined names\
      \ for the player's name ...\n    DeclinedName declinedName(declinedNames);\n\
      \    // ... use declinedName for character creation ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a shallow copy of the data from UF::DeclinedNames. The
    DeclinedName object will hold references to the same underlying data, so modifications
    to the original UF::DeclinedNames structure after initialization may affect this
    object if it's not properly copied. This constructor is part of the World of Warcraft
    TrinityCore framework and is typically used internally by the server when processing
    character creation or name-related data.
  warnings: Ensure that the UF::DeclinedNames parameter contains valid data before
    passing it to this constructor, as no validation is performed. Improperly initialized
    declined names may cause issues with character naming in the game world. Be aware
    that this constructor does not perform deep copying, so changes to the source
    data after initialization might affect the DeclinedName object.
