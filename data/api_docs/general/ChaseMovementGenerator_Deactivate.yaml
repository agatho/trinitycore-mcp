  class: ChaseMovementGenerator
  method: Deactivate
  signature: void ChaseMovementGenerator::Deactivate(Unit * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Deactivates the chase movement generator, stopping the unit from pursuing
    its target.
  description: The Deactivate method terminates the active chasing behavior of a Unit
    controlled by this movement generator. It is typically invoked when the target
    unit becomes unreachable, dies, or when the AI logic determines that pursuit should
    cease. This method ensures proper cleanup of any ongoing movement states and resets
    internal flags to prevent further pursuit actions. The deactivation process may
    also trigger callbacks or notifications within the AI system to inform other components
    about the change in movement state.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Unit instance that owns this movement generator and
      is currently being chased.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Deactivation Usage
    code: 'ChaseMovementGenerator* chaseGen = new ChaseMovementGenerator();

      Unit* target = player->GetTarget();

      chaseGen->Deactivate(target);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on active movement generators. Calling
    it on an already inactive generator may result in undefined behavior or assertion
    failures. The method does not directly remove the movement generator from memory;
    it merely deactivates its active state.
  warnings: Do not call Deactivate on a null Unit pointer, as this will likely cause
    a crash. Ensure that the provided Unit is valid and currently controlled by this
    movement generator before invoking the method.
