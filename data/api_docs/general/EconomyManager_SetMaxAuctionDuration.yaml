  class: EconomyManager
  method: SetMaxAuctionDuration
  signature: void EconomyManager::SetMaxAuctionDuration(uint32 hours)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum auction duration in hours for items listed on the auction
    house.
  description: The SetMaxAuctionDuration method configures the upper limit of time
    that an item can remain listed on the auction house. This value determines how
    long players can keep their items available for bidding before the auction expires.
    The parameter represents the maximum number of hours an auction may last, with
    valid values typically ranging from 1 to 24 hours depending on server configuration.
    This setting affects all future auctions created after the change is applied and
    does not retroactively modify existing auctions.
  parameters:
  - name: hours
    description: The maximum duration in hours for which an auction can remain active.
      Valid range is typically 1-24 hours, though exact limits may vary by server
      settings.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Maximum Auction Duration to 12 Hours
    code: EconomyManager::instance()->SetMaxAuctionDuration(12);
    language: cpp
  - title: Configure Auction House with 24-Hour Maximum Duration
    code: 'EconomyManager* economyMgr = EconomyManager::instance();

      economyMgr->SetMaxAuctionDuration(24);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies a global server configuration value that affects all
    auction house transactions. Changes take effect immediately for new auctions but
    do not impact existing auctions currently listed on the auction house.
  warnings: Modifying this value may affect player behavior and revenue generation
    on the auction house. Ensure that the chosen duration aligns with your server's
    intended gameplay mechanics and economic balance.
