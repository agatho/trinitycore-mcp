  signature: void Unit::SendFlightSplineSyncUpdate()
documentation:
  brief: Sends a flight spline synchronization update to the client for the unit.
  description: This method sends a flight spline synchronization update to the client,
    which is used to synchronize the movement of units that are flying. It typically
    occurs when a unit's flight path needs to be updated or when a unit is transitioning
    between different flight states. The method ensures that the client receives accurate
    information about the unit's current flight position and trajectory. This functionality
    is essential for maintaining proper game mechanics related to flying movement
    and player experience.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SendFlightSplineSyncUpdate();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    flight path updates are required. It may be used in conjunction with other movement-related
    methods to ensure proper synchronization of flying units. Performance considerations
    include avoiding unnecessary calls during high-frequency updates.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can result in incorrect client-side movement,
    leading to visual glitches or game mechanics issues. This method should only be
    called when the unit is actually flying and the flight path needs updating.
