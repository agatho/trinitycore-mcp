documentation:
  brief: Swaps the script execution context for the TrinityCore server's scripting
    system, initializing or switching between different script environments.
  description: The SwapScriptContext method is responsible for managing the active
    script context within the TrinityCore server. This function facilitates switching
    between different scripting environments, typically used during server initialization
    or when reloading scripts. The method ensures that all script-related functionality
    operates correctly by properly setting up the execution environment. It may be
    invoked internally by the server's core systems or exposed to administrators for
    manual script context management. The initialize parameter controls whether this
    operation should perform a fresh initialization of the script context or simply
    switch between existing contexts.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Script Context Swap
    code: ScriptMgr::SwapScriptContext(true);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or script reloading
    processes. Developers should ensure that all script dependencies are properly
    loaded before invoking this function. The method may have performance implications
    if called frequently during runtime.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to undefined behavior or crashes
    in the scripting system. It should only be called when the server is in a stable
    state and not actively processing game events.
