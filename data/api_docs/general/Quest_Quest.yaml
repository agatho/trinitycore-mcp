documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new Quest object with move semantics, transferring ownership
    of the quest data.
  description: This method serves as the move constructor for the Quest class, enabling
    efficient transfer of ownership of quest data from an existing Quest object to
    a newly created one. It is commonly used in scenarios where temporary or temporary
    objects need to be created and immediately moved into a permanent location, such
    as when handling quest-related data structures within TrinityCore's core systems.
    The method ensures that the source object's data is properly transferred without
    unnecessary copying, improving performance and reducing memory overhead. This
    constructor typically occurs during internal game mechanics processing when quest
    objects are being manipulated or created in memory.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Constructor Usage
    code: 'Quest* quest = new Quest(std::move(*quest));

      // This transfers the ownership of quest data to the new object'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the standard C++ move semantics implementation and
    should be used carefully to avoid dangling references. It's important that developers
    understand the difference between copy and move constructors, especially when
    working with quest data structures in TrinityCore.
  warnings: Improper use of this constructor can lead to undefined behavior or memory
    corruption if the source object is accessed after the move operation. Always ensure
    that moved objects are properly invalidated or reset after calling this method.
