  class: QuestCache
  method: Update
  signature: void QuestCache::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the quest cache for the specified player, synchronizing quest data
    between the client and server.
  description: The QuestCache::Update method is responsible for refreshing or synchronizing
    quest-related information within the quest cache for a given player. This operation
    ensures that the player's active quests, quest objectives, and related data are
    consistent with the current game state. The method typically handles updating
    quest progress, checking quest completion status, and managing any dynamic quest
    elements that may have changed since the last update. It is commonly invoked during
    player login, quest acceptance, or when quest-related events occur in the game
    world.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which the quest cache should be
      updated. This parameter must not be null and must represent a valid player instance
      within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Cache Update
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      QuestCache::Update(player);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Quest Cache After Quest Acceptance
    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    // Perform\
      \ quest acceptance logic\n    QuestCache::Update(player);\n    // Continue with\
      \ other operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    quest-related events occur. Developers should ensure that the Player object passed
    to this method remains valid throughout the update process. The method may trigger
    additional internal callbacks or notifications related to quest state changes.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the bot parameter will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always validate player pointers before calling this method.
    Additionally, frequent calls to this method without proper throttling may impact
    performance during high-traffic scenarios.
