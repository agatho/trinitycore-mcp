  brief: Checks if the escort invoker is within a specified range of the AI-controlled
    unit
  description: The IsEscortInvokerInRange method determines whether the player who
    initiated an escort quest is currently within a defined proximity range of the
    SmartAI-controlled creature. This functionality is primarily used in escort quest
    scripts to manage NPC behavior based on the player's location. The method evaluates
    the distance between the AI unit and its escort invoker (the player who started
    the escort) and returns true if they are within range, false otherwise. This check
    is essential for quests where NPCs must remain close to their escort target or
    when certain actions should only occur when the player is nearby.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the escort invoker (player) is within the defined range
    of the AI-controlled unit; returns false if the player is outside this range or
    if no escort invoker is set.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in an escort quest script
    code: "if (escortAI->IsEscortInvokerInRange())\n{\n    // Perform actions when\
      \ player is close\n    me->AI()->Talk(0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in conditional logic for quest progression
    code: "if (!escortAI->IsEscortInvokerInRange())\n{\n    // Player has wandered\
      \ too far, reset or warn\n    escortAI->SetDespawnAtEnd(false);\n    escortAI->SetRun(true);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Player is close, continue escort\n    escortAI->SetRun(false);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal escort system's tracking of the invoker.
    It may not function correctly if the AI unit is not properly initialized as part
    of an escort quest or if the invoker has been removed from the quest state. The
    range threshold is typically defined by the quest script or default AI settings.
  warnings: This method should only be called within the context of active escort
    quests. Using it outside of proper escort scenarios may lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect results. Also, ensure that the invoker has been properly set before
    calling this method.
