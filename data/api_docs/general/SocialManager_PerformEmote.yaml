documentation:
  brief: Executes an emote action for the player
  description: The PerformEmote method triggers a specific emote animation for the
    player character. This method handles the validation and execution of emotes,
    ensuring that the requested emote type is valid and can be performed by the player.
    The method typically sends the appropriate network packets to update the emote
    state for nearby players in the game world. It returns true if the emote was successfully
    initiated, or false if the emote could not be performed due to validation failures
    or other constraints.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the emote was successfully executed, false otherwise. The
    method may return false if the emote type is invalid, the player is in a state
    where emotes cannot be performed (e.g., during combat), or if there are other
    game state restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Emote Execution
    code: "if (socialManager->PerformEmote(EMOTE_STATE_SALUTE)) {\n    // Emote executed\
      \ successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Player performed salute emote\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when a player
    triggers an emote via command or UI interaction. The actual emote animation is
    handled by the client-side rendering system, while this method manages the server-side
    logic and state updates.
  warnings: Ensure that emote types are validated before calling this method to avoid
    unexpected behavior. Some emotes may not be available in certain game states such
    as combat or while mounted.
