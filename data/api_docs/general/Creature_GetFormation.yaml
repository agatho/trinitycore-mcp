  class: Creature
  method: GetFormation
  signature: CreatureGroup * Creature::GetFormation()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the formation group that the creature belongs to, if any.
  description: The GetFormation method retrieves the CreatureGroup object that represents
    the formation to which the current creature belongs. This method is used to access
    formation-related data and behavior for creatures that are part of a specific
    formation. The returned CreatureGroup may be null if the creature is not assigned
    to any formation, or it may return a valid formation group if the creature has
    been assigned to one. This functionality is essential for managing creature behavior
    in grouped scenarios such as scripted encounters or coordinated AI behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the CreatureGroup object that represents the formation
    the creature belongs to. If the creature is not part of any formation, this will
    return nullptr. The returned pointer may be used to access formation-specific
    properties and methods for managing group behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "CreatureGroup* formation = creature->GetFormation();\nif (formation)\n\
      {\n    // Creature is part of a formation\n    // Do something with formation\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Creature is not part of any formation\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other formation-related
    methods such as SetFormation or GetFormationId. The returned pointer should be
    handled carefully to avoid dangling pointers, especially when the creature might
    be destroyed or removed from its formation during gameplay. Performance considerations
    are minimal as this method simply retrieves a stored pointer.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in scenarios where creatures may be
    removed from formations or destroyed. Accessing a formation pointer after removal
    can result in invalid memory access. Also, ensure that the creature actually belongs
    to a formation before attempting to use the returned pointer.
