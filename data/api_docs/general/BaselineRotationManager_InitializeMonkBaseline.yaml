documentation:
  brief: Initializes the baseline rotation settings for Monk class special abilities
    and combat mechanics.
  description: The InitializeMonkBaseline method sets up default configuration values
    and internal state for a Monk's baseline rotation system. This includes initializing
    ability cooldowns, resource management thresholds, and combat priority orders
    specific to the Monk class. The method prepares the rotation manager to handle
    Monk-specific gameplay mechanics such as Chi generation, Stagger tracking, and
    talent-based ability selection. It ensures that all required data structures are
    properly initialized before any combat rotation logic begins.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'BaselineRotationManager rotationManager;

      rotationManager.InitializeMonkBaseline();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called once during the initialization phase of a Monk's
    AI controller. It does not perform any runtime calculations or state changes during
    execution, but rather prepares internal data structures for subsequent rotation
    decisions.
