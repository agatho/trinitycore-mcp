  method: Regenerate
  signature: void RuneRunicPowerResource::Regenerate(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Regenerates runic power for a player based on elapsed time.
  description: The Regenerate method updates the runic power resource of a player
    by calculating and applying the regeneration amount over the specified time interval.
    This method is typically called during game ticks to simulate the natural recovery
    of runic power, which is used by Death Knights for their abilities. The regeneration
    rate depends on various factors including the player's class, level, and equipped
    items. It ensures that runic power gradually increases until it reaches its maximum
    value.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Regeneration Call
    code: 'RuneRunicPowerResource resource;

      resource.Regenerate(1000); // Regenerate over 1 second'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void UpdatePlayerRunicPower(Player* player, uint32 diff) {\n    if (player->GetClass()\
      \ == CLASS_DEATH_KNIGHT) {\n        RuneRunicPowerResource* runicResource =\
      \ player->GetRuneRunicPowerResource();\n        runicResource->Regenerate(diff);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on active Death Knight players. The regeneration
    calculation takes into account the player's current runic power, maximum runic
    power, and the time elapsed since last regeneration. It is designed to be called
    from within the game's main update loop.
  warnings: Calling this method on non-Death Knight players or without proper initialization
    may cause undefined behavior. Ensure that the resource object is properly initialized
    before calling Regenerate.
