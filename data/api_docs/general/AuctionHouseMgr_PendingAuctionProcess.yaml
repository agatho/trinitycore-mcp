  signature: void AuctionHouseMgr::PendingAuctionProcess(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Processes pending auctions for the specified player, handling auction outcomes
    and updates.
  description: The PendingAuctionProcess method in the AuctionHouseMgr class is responsible
    for managing and executing any pending auction activities associated with a given
    player. This typically involves checking if any auctions have concluded, processing
    the sale or failure of those auctions, updating the player's inventory or gold
    balance accordingly, and sending relevant notifications or updates to the player's
    client. The method ensures that all auction-related transactions are properly
    finalized and that players receive appropriate feedback on their auction actions.
    It is generally called during player login or at regular intervals to maintain
    auction house consistency.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Login
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    sAuctionHouseMgr->PendingAuctionProcess(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the core during player
    session initialization or periodically to ensure auction house state integrity.
    It may involve database operations and client communication, so performance considerations
    should be taken into account when called frequently.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method outside of appropriate game flow contexts (e.g.,
    during player login or periodic updates) as it might cause inconsistencies in
    auction states or unexpected behavior in the auction house system.
