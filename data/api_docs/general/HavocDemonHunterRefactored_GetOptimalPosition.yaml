  class: HavocDemonHunterRefactored
  method: GetOptimalPosition
  signature: int HavocDemonHunterRefactored::GetOptimalPosition(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal position for a Havoc Demon Hunter to maximize
    damage output or survivability in combat.
  description: The GetOptimalPosition method determines the best strategic location
    for a Havoc Demon Hunter to stand during combat, considering factors such as enemy
    positioning, threat levels, and available abilities. This method is typically
    used by AI systems to guide player character movement and positioning decisions.
    The calculation takes into account the current target's position, the hunter's
    own abilities, and environmental constraints to return an optimal coordinate or
    state value. It may also consider cooldowns, resource management, and tactical
    positioning for maximum effectiveness.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the calculated optimal position index or
    state identifier. A positive value typically indicates a valid position, while
    negative values may indicate failure conditions such as invalid targets or insufficient
    resources to determine a meaningful position.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "int optimalPosition = hunter.GetOptimalPosition();\nif (optimalPosition\
      \ >= 0) {\n    // Move to the calculated optimal position\n    player->SetPosition(optimalPosition);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle failure case - no valid position found\n    LogError(\"\
      Failed to calculate optimal position\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger combat decision-making system and
    may be called frequently during combat. It's recommended to cache results when
    possible to avoid redundant calculations. The exact positioning algorithm may
    vary based on the current combat scenario and available abilities.
  warnings: The method may return negative values indicating failure conditions, so
    callers should always check for valid return values before using the result. In
    high-frequency combat situations, excessive calls to this method could impact
    performance if not properly optimized.
