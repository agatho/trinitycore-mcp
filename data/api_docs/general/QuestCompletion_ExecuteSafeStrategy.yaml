    & progress)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a safe strategy for quest completion involving a player bot and
    quest progress data.
  description: The ExecuteSafeStrategy method in the QuestCompletion class is designed
    to handle the safe execution of quest completion logic for player bots within
    the TrinityCore framework. It takes a Player pointer representing the bot and
    a reference to QuestProgressData that contains the current state of quest progress.
    This method ensures that quest completion actions are performed without causing
    instability or errors, particularly in automated or AI-driven scenarios. The implementation
    likely includes checks for valid quest states, proper resource handling, and safe
    transitions between quest stages. It is typically invoked during bot behavior
    execution when a quest needs to be completed under controlled conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will execute
      the quest completion strategy. Must not be null and should represent a valid
      player instance.
  - name: progress
    description: Reference to QuestProgressData containing the current progress state
      of the quest being completed. This includes information about quest objectives,
      rewards, and completion status.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot AI logic
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateQuestCompletion()\n{\n    QuestProgressData progress;\n\
      \    // Assume progress is populated with current quest data\n    questCompletion.ExecuteSafeStrategy(playerBot,\
      \ progress);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with quest completion event handling
    code: "void QuestHandler::OnQuestComplete(Player* player)\n{\n    QuestProgressData\
      \ progress;\n    // Populate progress data\n    QuestCompletion questCompletion;\n\
      \    questCompletion.ExecuteSafeStrategy(player, progress);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended for internal use within the TrinityCore AI system.
    It assumes that the provided Player object and QuestProgressData are valid and
    properly initialized. The method may perform internal validation checks before
    executing any quest completion logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter points to a valid player instance, as passing
    a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. The progress data must be accurately
    populated with current quest state information for proper execution.
