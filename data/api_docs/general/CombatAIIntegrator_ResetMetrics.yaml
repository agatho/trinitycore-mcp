  class: CombatAIIntegrator
  method: ResetMetrics
  signature: void CombatAIIntegrator::ResetMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all combat-related performance metrics and counters within the CombatAIIntegrator.
  description: The ResetMetrics method clears and initializes all internal tracking
    variables used for measuring combat AI performance. This includes resetting counters
    for actions executed, time spent in various combat states, and other diagnostic
    data that may have been accumulated during previous combat encounters. The method
    is typically invoked when transitioning between different combat scenarios or
    when a new combat session begins to ensure accurate metric collection. It prepares
    the system for fresh performance monitoring without carrying over data from prior
    sessions.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Handler
    code: "void MyCombatHandler::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    combatAIIntegrator.ResetMetrics();\n\
      \    // Begin new combat session with clean metrics\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before starting a new combat encounter to ensure
    accurate performance tracking. It does not affect the AI's behavioral logic, only
    the diagnostic data collection.
