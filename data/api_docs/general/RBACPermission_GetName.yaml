  class: RBACPermission
  method: GetName
  signature: const std::string & RBACPermission::GetName() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the name of the RBAC permission.
  description: The GetName method retrieves the human-readable name associated with
    an RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) permission. This name is typically used for
    identification and display purposes within the TrinityCore system, allowing administrators
    and developers to reference specific permissions by their descriptive labels rather
    than internal identifiers. The returned string is a constant reference, ensuring
    that the name cannot be modified through this interface. This method is commonly
    used in permission checking, logging, and administrative interfaces where user-friendly
    permission names are required.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the name of the RBAC permission.
    The string is guaranteed to be valid and non-empty for properly initialized RBACPermission
    objects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'RBACPermission permission;

      // Assume permission has been properly initialized

      const std::string& permName = permission.GetName();

      std::cout << "Permission name: " << permName << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Permission Checks
    code: "RBACPermission* perm = sAccountMgr->GetRBACPermission(123);\nif (perm)\n\
      {\n    std::cout << \"Checking permission: \" << perm->GetName() << std::endl;\n\
      \    // Perform further checks using the name\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method returns a constant reference to avoid unnecessary copying of the
    string. The underlying string data is managed internally by the RBACPermission
    object and should not be modified externally. This method is thread-safe as long
    as the RBACPermission object itself is not being modified concurrently.
  warnings: Ensure that the RBACPermission object is properly initialized before calling
    GetName, as accessing a name on an uninitialized or invalid object may result
    in undefined behavior. The returned reference is only valid while the RBACPermission
    object exists.
