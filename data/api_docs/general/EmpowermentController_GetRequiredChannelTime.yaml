  class: EmpowermentController
  method: GetRequiredChannelTime
  signature: int EmpowermentController::GetRequiredChannelTime(EmpowermentLevel level)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the required channel time in milliseconds for a specified
    empowerment level.
  description: The GetRequiredChannelTime method determines the duration, in milliseconds,
    that a player must channel a spell or ability based on their current empowerment
    level. This value is typically used in conjunction with spell casting mechanics
    to enforce minimum channeling times before abilities can be completed. The method
    takes an EmpowermentLevel parameter which defines the specific empowerment tier
    and returns the corresponding channel time. This functionality is essential for
    maintaining game balance and ensuring proper spell progression mechanics within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: level
    description: The empowerment level enum value that determines the required channel
      time. Valid values are typically defined in the EmpowermentLevel enumeration,
      representing different tiers of empowerment (e.g., Level1, Level2, etc.).
  returns: An integer value representing the required channel time in milliseconds
    for the specified empowerment level. Returns 0 if the empowerment level is invalid
    or not supported.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'int channelTime = controller->GetRequiredChannelTime(EmpowermentLevel::Level1);

      // Returns the channel time required for Level 1 empowerment'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Spell Logic
    code: "void CastEmpoweredSpell(Player* player, EmpowermentLevel level) {\n   \
      \ int requiredTime = controller->GetRequiredChannelTime(level);\n    if (requiredTime\
      \ > 0) {\n        player->SetChannelTime(requiredTime);\n        // Proceed\
      \ with spell casting logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely cached or precomputed for performance reasons as it
    may be called frequently during spell casting sequences. The actual channel time
    values are typically defined in game data files or configuration tables and may
    vary based on server settings or expansion content.
  warnings: Ensure that the EmpowermentLevel parameter passed to this method is valid,
    as invalid values may return unexpected results or zero. This method should only
    be called when a player's empowerment level is properly initialized and known.
