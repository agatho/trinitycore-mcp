documentation:
  brief: Registers a packet opcode to be relayed by the bot packet relay system
  description: The AddRelayOpcode method adds a specified opcode to the list of packet
    opcodes that will be processed and relayed by the BotPacketRelay system. This
    functionality is essential for bots to properly intercept, modify, or forward
    game packets between clients and the server. The method typically integrates with
    TrinityCore's packet handling mechanisms to ensure that specific network communications
    are monitored or altered as needed for bot behavior. It is commonly used during
    initialization or configuration phases of bot systems to define which types of
    packets should be subject to relay processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotPacketRelay relay;

      relay.AddRelayOpcode(CMSG_ENTER_WORLD);

      relay.AddRelayOpcode(SMSG_UPDATE_OBJECT);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely maintains an internal set or map of opcodes that are checked
    during packet processing. It should be called before the relay system begins handling
    packets to ensure proper registration. The implementation may involve thread synchronization
    if multiple threads access the relay system.
  warnings: Calling this method after packet processing has already begun may result
    in inconsistent behavior or missed packets. Ensure all desired opcodes are registered
    prior to enabling relay functionality.
