  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: UpdateGroupTarget
  signature: void GroupCoordinator::UpdateGroupTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the group target tracking for all members in the coordinated group.
  description: The UpdateGroupTarget method synchronizes and refreshes the current
    target information across all players within a group managed by the GroupCoordinator.
    This ensures that each group member's UI and gameplay state reflects the most
    recent shared target selection, which is crucial for coordinated raid or dungeon
    activities. The method typically gets invoked when a new target is selected, or
    when existing target data needs to be refreshed to maintain consistency among
    group members.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Group Coordination
    code: "GroupCoordinator* coordinator = sGroupCoordinator->GetGroupCoordinator(player->GetGroup());\n\
      if (coordinator)\n{\n    coordinator->UpdateGroupTarget();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may trigger UI updates on client-side for all group members,
    so frequent calls should be avoided to prevent unnecessary network traffic or
    performance degradation. It is typically called internally by the GroupCoordinator
    when target changes occur.
