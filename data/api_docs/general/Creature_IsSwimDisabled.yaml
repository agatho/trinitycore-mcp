  method: IsSwimDisabled
  signature: bool Creature::IsSwimDisabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a creature is currently disabled from swimming.
  description: This method checks if a creature has been marked as disabled for swimming
    operations, typically due to game mechanics or specific conditions such as being
    in water or having certain movement flags. The function returns true when the
    creature cannot swim, and false when it can swim normally. This functionality
    is commonly used in pathfinding and movement logic within TrinityCore's AI system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is disabled from swimming, false otherwise.
    This indicates that the creature's swimming capabilities have been restricted
    by game mechanics or movement flags.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->IsSwimDisabled()) {\n    // Handle disabled swimming\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation relies on internal movement flags and game state logic. This
    method typically checks against the creature's current movement status rather
    than a direct flag.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a creature can swim in
    general, as it only reflects disabled state for swimming operations. Use with
    caution when checking movement restrictions.
