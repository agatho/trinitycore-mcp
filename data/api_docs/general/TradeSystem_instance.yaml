documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the TradeSystem class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the TradeSystem
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the trade system exists throughout the
    application. This method is commonly used to access global trade-related functionality
    such as item trading, auction house operations, and player-to-player transactions.
    The returned pointer should be used carefully as it represents a globally accessible
    object that may be shared across multiple threads and systems within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single instance of the TradeSystem class. The method will
    always return a valid pointer, never NULL, as the singleton pattern ensures its
    creation upon first access.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the Trade System Singleton
    code: "TradeSystem* tradeSys = TradeSystem::instance();\n// Use tradeSys to access\
      \ trade-related functionality\nif (tradeSys)\n{\n    // Perform trade operations\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Trade System for Player Trading
    code: "TradeSystem* ts = TradeSystem::instance();\nPlayer* player1 = ...;\nPlayer*\
      \ player2 = ...;\n// Initiate a trade between two players\nif (ts && player1\
      \ && player2)\n{\n    ts->StartTrade(player1, player2);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the standard singleton pattern implementation. The TradeSystem
    instance is typically initialized during server startup and remains valid for
    the entire runtime of the TrinityCore server. Developers should be aware that
    accessing this singleton from multiple threads requires proper synchronization
    mechanisms if the system's internal state is modified.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, modifying the global trade system state can
    affect all parts of the application that use it. Be cautious when testing or debugging
    as changes might have unintended side effects across the entire server. Avoid
    storing references to the returned pointer for extended periods without verifying
    its validity.
