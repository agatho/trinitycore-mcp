  class: QuestManager
  method: QuestManager
  signature: void QuestManager::QuestManager(Player * bot, BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a quest manager for a bot player within the AI system.
  description: The QuestManager constructor initializes the quest management functionality
    for a bot player, setting up internal data structures and linking the player object
    with the associated AI context. This method prepares the bot to handle quest-related
    activities such as quest acceptance, progression, and completion within the TrinityCore
    framework. The initialization process ensures that the bot's quest state is synchronized
    with the game world and that the AI can properly respond to quest-related events.
    It typically runs during the bot's creation or activation phase.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic QuestManager Initialization
    code: 'QuestManager questManager(bot, ai);

      // Initializes a new quest manager for the specified bot player and AI context.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the bot system during initialization.
    Developers should ensure that both the Player* and BotAI* parameters are valid
    and properly initialized before calling this constructor. The QuestManager object
    must be kept alive for as long as quest management is required.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly unless you understand the internal
    structure of the bot AI system. Improper initialization may lead to undefined
    behavior or quest-related bugs in the bot's gameplay.
