documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier of the calendar event associated with this
    invite
  description: The GetEventId method returns the 64-bit unique identifier (GUID) that
    represents the calendar event to which this invite is linked. This identifier
    is used internally by TrinityCore to track and reference specific calendar events
    within the game's database. The method is typically called when processing calendar
    invitations, allowing the system to determine which event a particular invite
    corresponds to. It is a read-only accessor that does not modify any internal state
    of the CalendarInvite object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the unique identifier of the associated calendar
    event. This GUID is used throughout the TrinityCore calendar system to uniquely
    identify each event instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Event Processing
    code: "CalendarInvite* invite = ...; // Assume invite is initialized\nuint64 eventId\
      \ = invite->GetEventId();\nif (eventId != 0)\n{\n    // Process the event using\
      \ the retrieved ID\n    sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(eventId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Invite Validity Before Processing
    code: "CalendarInvite* invite = player->GetCalendarInvite(inviteId);\nif (invite)\n\
      {\n    uint64 eventId = invite->GetEventId();\n    if (eventId > 0)\n    {\n\
      \        // Proceed with event-related operations\n        sCalendarMgr->SendEventDetails(player,\
      \ eventId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it only reads from const member variables.
    The returned value should not be modified directly as it represents a database
    key. In cases where the invite is not properly initialized or associated with
    an event, this method may return zero, which should be handled appropriately by
    calling code.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-zero return value guarantees the existence of
    the referenced event in the current session. The event might have been deleted
    or modified since the invite was created. Always validate the returned GUID against
    existing events before performing operations on them.
