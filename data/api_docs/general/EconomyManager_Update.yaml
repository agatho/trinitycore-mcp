  class: EconomyManager
  method: Update
  signature: void EconomyManager::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the economy manager's internal state based on elapsed time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and maintaining the
    state of the EconomyManager class. It typically handles periodic tasks such as
    checking for expired auctions, updating currency balances, or managing economic
    events that occur over time. This method is called regularly by the game loop
    to ensure the economy system remains synchronized with the passage of time. The
    method accepts a time delta parameter representing milliseconds since the last
    update call, which it uses to determine how much time has passed and what actions
    need to be taken accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The number of milliseconds elapsed since the last update call. This
      value is used to calculate time-based changes in the economy system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = GetMillisecondsSinceLastUpdate();\n\
      \    economyManager.Update(diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with World Update Loop
    code: "void World::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other world updates ...\n\
      \    economyManager.Update(diff);\n    // ... more world updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game loop and should be invoked
    frequently to maintain accurate economic state. The diff parameter must represent
    a valid time interval in milliseconds; negative values may cause unexpected behavior.
    Performance considerations are important as this method may perform database operations
    or other time-consuming tasks.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid time deltas (e.g., extremely large
    or negative values) as it may lead to incorrect economic calculations or system
    instability. The method should only be called from the main thread in single-threaded
    environments.
