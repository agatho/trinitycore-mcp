  brief: Checks if the unit is immune to NPC attacks
  description: This method determines whether the unit (creature or player) is immune
    to NPC-related attacks and interactions. It returns true if the unit is immune
    to NPC attacks, false otherwise. The method is commonly used in game mechanics
    to prevent NPCs from targeting certain units, particularly in scenarios where
    players or creatures need to be protected from NPC aggression. This functionality
    is crucial for implementing special behaviors such as immunity to NPC attacks
    during specific events or encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is immune to NPC attacks, false otherwise. The
    value indicates whether the unit can be targeted by NPCs or not.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsImmuneToNPC()) {\n    // Unit cannot be attacked by NPCs\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method typically checks internal flags or state
    variables related to NPC immunity. Performance considerations: The method is lightweight
    and should not impact performance significantly. Thread safety: This method is
    thread-safe as it only reads from internal state variables.'
  warnings: 'Common mistakes: Using this method in conjunction with other immunity
    checks without understanding the full context of NPC immunity. Dangerous edge
    cases: If used incorrectly, this method may lead to unexpected behavior in NPC
    targeting or interaction during encounters.'
