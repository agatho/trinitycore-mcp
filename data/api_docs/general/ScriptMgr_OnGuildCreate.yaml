documentation:
  brief: Invoked when a new guild is created in the game world
  description: This method is called by the TrinityCore scripting system whenever
    a player successfully creates a new guild. It provides a hook for custom scripts
    to execute logic when a guild is formed, such as logging the event, applying custom
    rules, or modifying guild properties. The method receives the newly created guild
    object, the player who created it (the leader), and the guild's name. This callback
    allows developers to extend or modify default guild creation behavior without
    directly modifying core game code.
  parameters:
  - name: guild
    description: Pointer to the newly created Guild object that represents the guild
      being formed. This object contains all guild data including members, permissions,
      and properties.
  - name: leader
    description: Pointer to the Player object who initiated the guild creation process
      and becomes the guild leader. This player is automatically added to the guild
      as its founder.
  - name: name
    description: String containing the name of the newly created guild. This name
      is validated against game rules before the method is invoked, but scripts can
      still modify or react to it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Creation Logging
    code: "void OnGuildCreate(Guild* guild, Player* leader, const std::string& name)\
      \ override\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"New guild created: %s by player %s\", name.c_str(),\
      \ leader->GetName().c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Apply Custom Guild Properties on Creation
    code: "void OnGuildCreate(Guild* guild, Player* leader, const std::string& name)\
      \ override\n{\n    // Set a custom guild level or other properties\n    guild->SetGuildLevel(5);\n\
      \    guild->SaveToDB();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the global script manager and is executed in the main
    game thread. Scripts should avoid long-running operations or blocking calls to
    prevent performance degradation. The guild object passed to this function is fully
    initialized, but modifications made during this callback may not be persisted
    unless explicitly saved.
  warnings: Modifying the guild or player objects within this callback can affect
    gameplay mechanics and should be done carefully. Avoid modifying core game data
    structures directly without proper validation to prevent unexpected behavior or
    crashes.
