  brief: Adds a conditional transmog appearance to the player's collection
  description: This method adds a conditional transmog appearance to the player's
    collection, allowing them to unlock and use specific transmogrification options.
    It is typically used in conjunction with other transmog-related methods to manage
    player's appearance modifications. The method operates within the context of World
    of Warcraft's transmog system, where players can unlock various appearance options
    through gameplay mechanics.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 appearanceId = 12345;

      player->AddConditionalTransmog(appearanceId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely interacts with the player''s
    transmog collection system, potentially requiring the player to have unlocked
    specific transmog options before being able to apply them. Performance considerations:
    The method should be called during appropriate game events or when the player
    is in a valid state for transmog operations.'
  warnings: This method may not work as expected if the player's transmog collection
    system has not been properly initialized or if the appearance ID does not correspond
    to valid transmog options. Common mistakes include calling this method without
    proper validation of the appearance ID or using it outside of appropriate game
    contexts.
