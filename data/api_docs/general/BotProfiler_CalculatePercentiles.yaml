  class: BotProfiler
  method: CalculatePercentiles
  signature: int BotProfiler::CalculatePercentiles(const int & values)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns percentile values for bot performance profiling data
  description: The CalculatePercentiles method processes stored bot performance metrics
    to compute statistical percentiles, typically used for analyzing bot behavior
    patterns and resource utilization. This method is part of the BotProfiler class
    which tracks various aspects of AI bot performance within the TrinityCore framework.
    The method operates on internal data structures containing performance measurements
    and returns an integer status code indicating success or failure of the percentile
    calculation operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value where 0 indicates successful calculation of percentiles,
    and non-zero values represent various error conditions such as insufficient data,
    invalid input, or computational failures during percentile calculation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "BotProfiler profiler;\nint result = profiler.CalculatePercentiles();\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // Percentile calculations completed successfully\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Percentiles calculated successfully\" << std::endl;\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle error condition\n    std::cout << \"Failed to calculate percentiles\
      \ with error code: \" << result << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on internal data structures that must be populated
    before calling. The calculation may involve sorting algorithms and statistical
    computations that could impact performance with large datasets. The method is
    designed to work within the TrinityCore's bot management system for profiling
    AI behavior.
  warnings: The method signature shows a parameter named 'values' but the description
    indicates no parameters are expected. This discrepancy should be resolved in actual
    implementation. Calling this method without proper initialization of profiling
    data may result in undefined behavior or error codes.
