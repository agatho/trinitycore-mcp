    they have been removed from their inventory, such as when items are destroyed
    or when they are returned to players after being sold to NPCs. The method handles
    the creation of a mail message with specified item entry and count, and can be
    used in conjunction with context to determine how the item is handled.

      many items are included in the mail.
  - name: context
