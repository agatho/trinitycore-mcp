  class: BaselineRotationManager
  method: ShouldUseBaselineRotation
  signature: bool BaselineRotationManager::ShouldUseBaselineRotation(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the baseline rotation system should be used for a given
    bot.
  description: The ShouldUseBaselineRotation method evaluates the current state and
    conditions of a bot to decide if the baseline rotation logic should be activated.
    This method is typically used in AI decision-making processes within TrinityCore's
    bot framework, where different rotation strategies may be applied based on combat
    situation, resource availability, or other game mechanics. The method returns
    true when the baseline rotation system is appropriate to use, and false otherwise.
    It considers factors such as player level, available abilities, current target
    status, and bot configuration settings.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot instance for which the rotation decision is being
      made. This parameter represents the specific AI-controlled character that will
      be using the rotation system.
  returns: Returns true if the baseline rotation system should be used for the specified
    bot, false otherwise. The decision is based on various internal conditions and
    state checks within the bot's AI framework.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision logic
    code: "if (baselineRotationManager.ShouldUseBaselineRotation(&bot)) {\n    //\
      \ Activate baseline rotation behavior\n    bot.UseBaselineRotation();\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Fall back to alternative rotation or idle state\n    bot.PerformDefaultBehavior();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat state evaluation
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateCombatState() {\n    if (ShouldUseBaselineRotation(&m_bot))\
      \ {\n        m_rotationManager.ExecuteBaselineRotation();\n    } else {\n  \
      \      // Handle non-baseline rotation scenarios\n        HandleAlternativeRotation();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal checks such as verifying if the bot
    has sufficient resources, if it's in a valid combat state, or if other rotation
    systems are already active. It may also consider the bot's class-specific abilities
    and gear configuration to make an informed decision.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter is properly initialized before calling this
    method, as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. The method
    should only be called during appropriate AI update cycles to maintain performance.
