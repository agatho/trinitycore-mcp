  method: SetMercenaryForBattlegroundQueueType
  signature: void Player::SetMercenaryForBattlegroundQueueType(int bgQueueTypeId,
    bool mercenary)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether a player is marked as a mercenary for a specific battleground
    queue type.
  description: This method controls whether a player is considered a mercenary for
    the purposes of battleground queue matching. When set to true, the player will
    be treated as a mercenary in the queue, which affects how they are matched with
    other players and potentially influences their rewards or experience. The method
    operates on a specific battleground queue type identifier, allowing for fine-grained
    control over mercenary status per queue type.
  parameters:
  - name: bgQueueTypeId
    description: The battleground queue type identifier that determines which queue
      the mercenary status applies to. Valid values are typically integer constants
      representing different battleground types such as 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, etc.
  - name: mercenary
    description: A boolean value indicating whether the player should be marked as
      a mercenary for this specific queue type. True sets the player as a mercenary,
      false removes the mercenary status.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->SetMercenaryForBattlegroundQueueType(1, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nfor (int i = 0; i < MAX_BATTLEGROUND_TYPES; ++i)\n\
      {\n    player->SetMercenaryForBattlegroundQueueType(i, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the game engine to manage player
    queue status during battleground matchmaking. It may be called during player initialization
    or when entering a battleground queue. The implementation likely involves checking
    if the player has already been marked as a mercenary for this specific queue type,
    and updating accordingly.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect player matching in battlegrounds,
    potentially affecting reward distribution or experience gain. Care should be taken
    when setting this flag, especially in scenarios where players are being matched
    with others who may not have the same mercenary status.
