    itemId, int32 itemLevel)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the cast item GUID, item ID, and item level for an aura creation context
  description: The SetCastItem method configures the casting item information associated
    with an aura being created. This is used in TrinityCore's aura system to track
    which item was responsible for applying a specific aura effect. The method accepts
    a GUID representing the item's unique identifier, an item ID for identifying the
    item type, and an item level that defines the power or quality of the item. This
    information is crucial for proper aura application logic, especially in cases
    involving item-based buffs, debuffs, or enchantments. The method returns a reference
    to the same AuraCreateInfo object, enabling method chaining.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the cast item. This should be a valid
      GameObject or Item GUID in the World of Warcraft database.
  - name: itemId
    description: The item ID that identifies the specific type of item used to cast
      the aura. Must correspond to an existing item template in the database.
  - name: itemLevel
    description: The level or quality of the item, which affects aura properties such
      as duration, strength, or effects. Negative values may indicate special item
      states or errors.
  returns: Returns a reference to the same AuraCreateInfo object, allowing for method
    chaining.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SetCastItem
    code: 'AuraCreateInfo createInfo;

      createInfo.SetCastItem(123456789, 45678, 100);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Method chaining with SetCastItem
    code: "AuraCreateInfo createInfo;\ncreateInfo.SetCastItem(987654321, 98765, 150)\n\
      \        .SetDuration(30000);\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore's spell and aura
    systems when an aura is applied via an item. It ensures that the aura system can
    properly track item-based effects, including their source and properties. The
    GUID parameter should be validated against existing objects in the world to prevent
    invalid references.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the GUID or item ID may lead to broken aura applications
    or unexpected behavior in gameplay mechanics. Ensure that the provided item level
    is within valid ranges for the specific aura being created.
