  method: ExecuteHealingRotation
  signature: void RestorationDruidRefactored::ExecuteHealingRotation(const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the healing rotation logic for a Restoration Druid in a specified
    group context.
  description: The ExecuteHealingRotation method is responsible for determining and
    executing the appropriate healing spells and abilities for a Restoration Druid
    class. It evaluates the current state of the group members, their health percentages,
    and any active buffs or debuffs to decide which healing spell to cast next. This
    method typically operates within the context of a group or raid environment, using
    the provided group identifier to target the correct set of players. The implementation
    likely includes logic for prioritizing targets based on threat levels, mana efficiency,
    and spell cooldowns. It may also consider the presence of emergency healing situations
    such as low health allies or incoming damage.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: An integer identifier representing the group or raid instance to
      perform healing rotation for. This value typically corresponds to a specific
      group within the TrinityCore instance, allowing the method to target only members
      of that particular group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Group Context
    code: "void MyDruidAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_groupId > 0)\n    \
      \    m_druid->ExecuteHealingRotation(m_groupId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Healing Logic
    code: "class RestorationDruidRefactored\n{\npublic:\n    void ExecuteHealingRotation(const\
      \ int& group)\n    {\n        // Evaluate group members' health\n        //\
      \ Prioritize lowest health targets\n        // Cast appropriate healing spells\
      \ based on current state\n        // Handle emergency situations like sudden\
      \ damage spikes\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called regularly during the AI update cycle,
    typically every few seconds in a combat scenario. It assumes that the Druid instance
    has proper access to group information and target selection capabilities. The
    method may internally manage spell cooldowns, mana costs, and targeting logic
    to ensure optimal healing performance.
  warnings: Improper handling of the group parameter can lead to incorrect targeting
    or no healing being performed at all. Ensure that the group identifier passed
    is valid and corresponds to an active group before calling this method.
