  method: OutlawRogueRefactored
  signature: void OutlawRogueRefactored::OutlawRogueRefactored(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an Outlaw Rogue AI bot with the specified player character.
  description: The OutlawRogueRefactored constructor initializes a new instance of
    the Outlaw Rogue AI behavior class, setting up the bot's initial state and configuration
    based on the provided Player object. This method configures the rogue's combat
    abilities, ability priorities, and tactical decision-making logic specific to
    the outlaw specialization. The initialization process includes setting up spell
    caches, defining combat routines, and establishing the bot's target selection
    criteria. This constructor is typically called when creating a new AI-controlled
    outlaw rogue character within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Outlaw Rogue Initialization
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Get player reference

      OutlawRogueRefactored rogueBot(bot);

      // Bot is now initialized with outlaw rogue AI behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor assumes the Player object passed in is valid and represents
    an outlaw rogue character. The method performs no validation of the player's class
    or specialization, so it's expected that the caller ensures proper initialization.
    Performance-wise, this method may perform some caching operations for abilities
    and spells which could have a minor impact during bot creation.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor with a null Player pointer as it will likely
    cause a crash. Ensure that the Player object represents a valid outlaw rogue character
    before passing it to this constructor. The method does not verify the player's
    specialization, so incorrect usage may lead to undefined behavior.
