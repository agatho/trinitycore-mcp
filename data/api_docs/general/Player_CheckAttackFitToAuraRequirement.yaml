  signature: bool Player::CheckAttackFitToAuraRequirement(int attackType, const int
    * aurEff) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if an attack fits the requirements of a given aura effect.
  description: This method determines whether a specific attack type meets the conditions
    set by a given aura effect. It evaluates the compatibility between the attack
    type and the aura's requirements, considering factors such as weapon type, damage
    type, or other game mechanics that may affect the validity of the attack. The
    method is typically used in conjunction with spell effects or aura applications
    to validate attack behavior during combat situations.
  parameters:
  - name: attackType
    description: The type of attack being evaluated, such as melee, ranged, or spell
      attacks. This parameter defines the nature of the attack that is being checked
      against the aura requirements.
  - name: aurEff
    description: Pointer to an array containing the aura effect values that define
      the requirements for the attack. This could include information about weapon
      types, damage types, or other conditions that must be met for the attack to
      be considered valid.
  returns: Returns true if the attack fits the requirements of the aura effect, false
    otherwise. The method may return false if the attack type does not match the requirements
    set by the aura effect or if certain conditions are not met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->CheckAttackFitToAuraRequirement(ATTACK_MELEE, &aurEff[0]))\
      \ {\n    // Attack is valid for this aura\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "bool isValid = player->CheckAttackFitToAuraRequirement(ATTACK_RANGED, &aurEff[1]);\n\
      if (isValid) {\n    // The attack meets the requirements for the aura effect\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in combat scenarios where spell effects or
    aura applications need to validate attack types. It may be called during spell
    casting or attack processing to ensure that attacks align with the requirements
    set by specific aura effects.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method, as incorrect usage can lead
    to invalid attack validation and potentially affect gameplay balance. The method
    should only be used in contexts where aura effects are properly defined and validated.
