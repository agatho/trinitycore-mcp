  brief: Initializes a new SpatialGridManager instance as a copy of an existing one
  description: The SpatialGridManager constructor creates a new spatial grid manager
    by copying the state and configuration from an existing SpatialGridManager instance.
    This copy constructor is used to create duplicate spatial grid managers, typically
    when passing them between functions or creating local copies within different
    scopes. The copied instance maintains identical grid configurations, cell dimensions,
    and spatial partitioning settings as the source instance. This functionality is
    essential for maintaining consistent spatial indexing across different parts of
    the TrinityCore world simulation where multiple grid managers may need to share
    the same spatial configuration.

  examples:
  - title: Copying a SpatialGridManager instance
    code: 'SpatialGridManager originalGrid;

      // ... configure originalGrid ...

      SpatialGridManager copiedGrid(originalGrid); // Copy constructor usage'
    language: cpp
  notes: The copy constructor performs a shallow copy of the spatial grid manager's
    internal state. Any modifications to the original instance after copying will
    not affect the copied instance, and vice versa. This behavior ensures thread safety
    when multiple threads access different copies of the same grid configuration.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this constructor in performance-critical code paths
    as it may involve copying large amounts of spatial data structures. Consider reference
    counting or shared pointers if frequent copying is required.
