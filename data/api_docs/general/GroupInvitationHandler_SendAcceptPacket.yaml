  signature: bool GroupInvitationHandler::SendAcceptPacket()
documentation:
  brief: Sends a group invitation acceptance packet to the player's client
  description: The SendAcceptPacket method is responsible for transmitting a group
    invitation acceptance message from the server to the player's client in World
    of Warcraft. This method is typically invoked when a player accepts a group invitation
    sent by another player or NPC. It handles the necessary protocol communication
    to notify the client that the invitation has been accepted and updates the player's
    group membership status accordingly. The method ensures proper synchronization
    between the server state and the client's view of group participation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the packet was successfully sent to the client, false otherwise.
    A return value of false may indicate network transmission errors or that the player's
    client is not properly connected.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group invitation handling
    code: "void HandleGroupAccept()\n{\n    GroupInvitationHandler handler;\n    if\
      \ (handler.SendAcceptPacket())\n    {\n        // Packet sent successfully\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Group invitation accepted and packet sent.\");\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Failed to send packet\n        sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to send group invitation acceptance packet.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal group invitation system and should only
    be called when a player has actually accepted a group invitation. The method assumes
    that all necessary preconditions for group membership have been validated before
    execution. It's important to note that this method does not perform any validation
    of the invitation itself - that responsibility lies with other components in the
    group management system.
  warnings: This method should not be called without proper verification that the
    player has indeed accepted the invitation, as sending acceptance packets for unaccepted
    invitations could lead to client-side errors or inconsistent group states. Additionally,
    calling this method on disconnected players will likely result in a failed packet
    transmission.
