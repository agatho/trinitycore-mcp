documentation:
  brief: Destroys the IBotSpawnerEvents instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the IBotSpawnerEvents class is responsible for releasing
    any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the instance. This method
    is automatically invoked when an object of type IBotSpawnerEvents goes out of
    scope or is explicitly deleted. As a virtual destructor, it ensures proper cleanup
    of derived classes and maintains correct object destruction order in inheritance
    hierarchies. The destructor does not take any parameters and performs no return
    operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Destructor Usage
    code: 'IBotSpawnerEvents* spawner = new IBotSpawnerEvents();

      // ... use the object ...

      delete spawner; // This calls the destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a virtual destructor, which means it's designed to be overridden
    in derived classes. When implementing derived classes, ensure proper cleanup of
    any additional resources allocated during construction. The destructor should
    not throw exceptions as it's called during stack unwinding.
