  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: AnalyzeDecisionSpeed
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::AnalyzeDecisionSpeed(uint32_t botGuid,
    BotPerformanceProfile & profile)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and records the decision-making speed of a bot identified by its
    GUID within the performance profile.
  description: The AnalyzeDecisionSpeed method evaluates the time taken by a specific
    bot to make a decision during gameplay. It uses the provided bot GUID to locate
    the relevant bot instance and measures the duration between key decision points.
    The results are then stored or updated in the specified BotPerformanceProfile
    object, which tracks various performance metrics for the bot. This method is typically
    invoked during bot behavior analysis to identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies
    in decision-making processes. It assumes that the bot has already been initialized
    and is actively participating in gameplay activities.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose decision speed is being
      analyzed. Must correspond to an existing active bot instance within the TrinityCore
      environment.
  - name: profile
    description: Reference to a BotPerformanceProfile object where the analysis results
      will be stored or updated. This profile contains historical and real-time performance
      data for the specified bot.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      BotPerformanceProfile profile;

      BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      analytics.AnalyzeDecisionSpeed(botGuid, profile);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Manager
    code: "class BotManager {\npublic:\n    void UpdateBotPerformance(uint32_t botGuid)\
      \ {\n        BotPerformanceProfile profile;\n        BotPerformanceAnalytics\
      \ analytics;\n        analytics.AnalyzeDecisionSpeed(botGuid, profile);\n  \
      \      // Further processing of profile data\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may have performance implications if called excessively during
    high-frequency bot operations. It is recommended to batch multiple analyses or
    call it at strategic intervals rather than on every decision cycle. The accuracy
    of timing measurements depends on the system's clock resolution and potential
    thread scheduling delays.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot GUID corresponds to an active bot instance; otherwise,
    the method may produce undefined behavior or fail silently. Avoid calling this
    method from within time-critical sections of code as it might introduce latency
    in decision-making processes.
