documentation:
  brief: Manages the cleave mechanic behavior for a tank unit based on target and
    group member count
  description: The ManageCleaveMechanics method controls how a tank unit applies the
    cleave ability, which allows the tank to damage multiple nearby enemies within
    a specified range. This method evaluates the current target and the number of
    group members to determine appropriate cleave mechanics behavior, such as whether
    to trigger cleave effects or adjust positioning for optimal threat generation.
    The implementation considers game balance factors like player class abilities,
    combat stance, and group composition to ensure proper execution of the cleave
    mechanic during encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target Unit that the tank is engaging in combat. This
      parameter determines which enemies will be affected by the cleave mechanics.
  - name: groupMembers
    description: Reference to an integer representing the number of group members
      currently present in the encounter. This value influences how cleave effects
      are calculated and applied.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example for managing cleave mechanics
    code: "void exampleFunction(Unit* tankTarget, int groupCount) {\n    TankPositioning\
      \ positioning;\n    positioning.ManageCleaveMechanics(tankTarget, groupCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with conditional logic for cleave management
    code: "void advancedCleaveManagement(Unit* target, int memberCount) {\n    if\
      \ (memberCount > 1) {\n        TankPositioning positioning;\n        positioning.ManageCleaveMechanics(target,\
      \ memberCount);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during combat updates or when target changes
    to ensure proper cleave behavior. The implementation assumes that the target unit
    is valid and within combat range.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is not null before calling this method,
    as it may cause undefined behavior. Also, be aware that group member count must
    accurately reflect current party/raid composition for correct mechanics application.
