  class: LFGMgr
  method: GetRoles
  signature: uint8 LFGMgr::GetRoles(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the LFG roles assigned to a player by their GUID
  description: The GetRoles method retrieves the LFG (Looking For Group) roles associated
    with a specific player identified by their GUID. This method is used internally
    by the TrinityCore LFG system to determine what roles a player is interested in
    or qualified for when forming groups. The returned value represents a bitmask
    of roles, where each bit corresponds to a specific role type such as Tank, Healer,
    or Damage Dealer. This information is crucial for the LFG queue system to match
    players with appropriate group compositions.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier of the player whose LFG roles are being
      retrieved. This should be a valid player GUID obtained from the game's entity
      management system.
  returns: A uint8 value representing a bitmask of LFG roles assigned to the player.
    Each bit in the mask corresponds to a specific role type (e.g., Tank, Healer,
    DPS). The exact bit positions and meanings are defined by the LFG system's role
    constants.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check player's LFG roles
    code: "uint8 roles = sLFGMgr->GetRoles(playerGuid);\nif (roles & LFG_ROLE_TANK)\n\
      {\n    // Player has Tank role\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking multiple roles using bitmask operations
    code: 'uint8 roles = sLFGMgr->GetRoles(playerGuid);

      bool isTank = (roles & LFG_ROLE_TANK) != 0;

      bool isHealer = (roles & LFG_ROLE_HEALER) != 0;

      bool isDps = (roles & LFG_ROLE_DAMAGE) != 0;

      // Use role flags to determine group composition'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the LFG manager's internal data structures and should
    only be called with valid player GUIDs. The returned bitmask values are consistent
    with TrinityCore's LFG role definitions, which include roles like LFG_ROLE_TANK,
    LFG_ROLE_HEALER, and LFG_ROLE_DAMAGE. This method is thread-safe as it accesses
    read-only data structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to an actual player in the game
    world; otherwise, the behavior is undefined. The returned role bitmask should
    be checked using bitwise operations rather than direct comparison since multiple
    roles can be assigned simultaneously.
