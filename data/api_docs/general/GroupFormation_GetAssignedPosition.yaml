documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the assigned position index of a group member by their GUID.
  description: The GetAssignedPosition method retrieves the positional index assigned
    to a specific group member identified by their unique identifier (GUID). This
    functionality is typically used within group formation systems where members are
    positioned in a predefined formation, such as for raid or party layouts. The returned
    value represents the zero-based index of the member's position within the group's
    formation structure. If the specified member is not found in the current formation,
    the method may return an invalid index or throw an exception depending on implementation
    details. This method is essential for maintaining organized group positioning
    during combat and movement scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the zero-based index of the assigned position for
    the specified group member. Returns -1 if the member with the given GUID is not
    found in the current formation.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Position of a Group Member
    code: "uint32 playerGuid = 12345;\nint position = groupFormation->GetAssignedPosition(playerGuid);\n\
      if (position >= 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Player is assigned to position: \"\
      \ << position << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n    std::cout << \"Player not found\
      \ in formation.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GroupFormation object maintains an internal
    mapping of member GUIDs to their assigned positions. The implementation may involve
    lookups in hash tables or other data structures for efficient access. It is recommended
    to cache results when frequently querying multiple members' positions to improve
    performance.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid group member before
    calling this method, as invalid GUIDs might lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    return values. This method should not be called on groups that are not actively
    managed by the formation system.
