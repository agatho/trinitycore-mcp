  class: SocialStrategy
  method: InitializeTriggers
  signature: void SocialStrategy::InitializeTriggers()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the social behavior triggers for the AI strategy.
  description: The InitializeTriggers method sets up and configures all necessary
    trigger conditions that govern how an AI-controlled character interacts socially
    with other players or NPCs. This includes establishing relationships, defining
    response behaviors to various social stimuli, and preparing the internal state
    machine for handling social events such as greetings, invitations, or combat encounters.
    The method is typically called during the initialization phase of a SocialStrategy
    instance to ensure all social triggers are properly registered and ready to be
    evaluated by the AI decision-making system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'SocialStrategy strategy;

      strategy.InitializeTriggers();

      // Triggers are now active and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the object's lifecycle, typically
    after all necessary configuration has been completed. It is not thread-safe and
    should be invoked from the main game thread to avoid race conditions in trigger
    registration.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in duplicate triggers or
    undefined behavior. Ensure that no social AI logic is active before calling this
    method to prevent conflicts with existing trigger states.
