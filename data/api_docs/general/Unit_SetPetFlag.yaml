  class: Unit
  method: SetPetFlag
  signature: void Unit::SetPetFlag(UnitPetFlag flags)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the pet flag for a unit, enabling or disabling pet-related behaviors
    in the game.
  description: The SetPetFlag method is used to control whether a unit (such as a
    player or creature) has pet-related functionality enabled or disabled. This method
    affects the unit's ability to have a pet, manage pet behavior, and interact with
    pet systems within World of Warcraft. It typically modifies internal flags that
    determine if the unit can be a pet owner or if pet-related actions are allowed.
    The method is commonly used in conjunction with other pet-related functions to
    ensure proper pet management and gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: The UnitPetFlag enum value that defines the pet behavior state to
      set. Valid values include PetFlagNone, PetFlagHasPet, PetFlagIsPet, and others
      depending on the specific implementation. This parameter controls whether a
      unit can act as a pet owner or if pet-related actions are enabled.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: Unit::SetPetFlag(UnitPetFlag::PetFlagHasPet);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Unit* unit = player->GetPet();\nif (unit)\n{\n    unit->SetPetFlag(UnitPetFlag::PetFlagIsPet);\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework to
    manage pet-related flags. It may affect internal state variables and should be
    used carefully to avoid unexpected behavior in pet management. Performance considerations
    are minimal as this method primarily modifies internal flags rather than performing
    heavy operations.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect pet behavior or state
    changes, potentially causing issues with pet ownership or pet actions. Care must
    be taken when setting flags to ensure proper game mechanics are maintained.
