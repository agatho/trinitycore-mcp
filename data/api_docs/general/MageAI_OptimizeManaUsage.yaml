  brief: Optimizes mana usage for the Mage AI by selecting appropriate spells based
    on available mana and combat situation.
  description: The OptimizeManaUsage method in the MageAI class is responsible for
    managing a mage's spell selection to ensure efficient use of mana during combat.
    It evaluates the current mana pool, available spells, and combat conditions to
    determine which spells should be cast to maximize damage output while conserving
    mana. This method plays a crucial role in maintaining optimal performance for
    mage characters in both PvE and PvP scenarios. The method does not require any
    input parameters and modifies internal AI state to reflect updated spell selection
    strategies.

  - title: Basic Usage in Mage AI Context
    code: "void MyMageAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    // Other AI logic...\n    OptimizeManaUsage();\n\
      \    // Continue with spell casting logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle to dynamically
    adjust spell selection based on changing mana levels. It may interact with other
    MageAI methods such as SpellSelection() or ManaCheck() to make informed decisions
    about which spells to cast.
