documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the current integrity status of a formation.
  description: The AssessFormationIntegrity method analyzes the current state of a
    formation, checking for member validity, positioning accuracy, and overall cohesion.
    It returns a FormationIntegrity structure that encapsulates various metrics such
    as leader status, member count, distance deviations, and alignment errors. This
    method is typically used by AI systems or game logic to determine whether a formation
    needs adjustment or re-evaluation. The evaluation considers factors like unit
    health, positioning relative to the formation center, and adherence to predefined
    formation patterns.
  parameters: []
  returns: A FormationIntegrity object containing detailed metrics about the formation's
    current state, including member count, leader validity, positional accuracy, and
    cohesion score. The structure may include fields such as 'is_valid', 'member_count',
    'average_distance_deviation', and 'cohesion_score'.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "FormationIntegrity integrity = formationManager.AssessFormationIntegrity();\n\
      if (integrity.is_valid)\n{\n    // Formation is in good condition\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Formation cohesion score: \" << integrity.cohesion_score << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Formation Monitoring
    code: "FormationIntegrity integrity = formationManager.AssessFormationIntegrity();\n\
      if (integrity.cohesion_score < 0.5f)\n{\n    // Formation is deteriorating,\
      \ consider repositioning\n    formationManager.ReorganizeFormation();\n}\nelse\
      \ if (integrity.member_count < 3)\n{\n    // Not enough members to maintain\
      \ formation\n    formationManager.DisbandFormation();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a comprehensive analysis of the formation and may have
    performance implications when called frequently. It should be used judiciously
    in performance-critical code paths. The integrity assessment considers both static
    properties (member count, leader validity) and dynamic properties (positioning
    accuracy).
  warnings: The returned FormationIntegrity object should not be modified directly
    as it represents a snapshot of the formation's state at the time of evaluation.
    Changes to the formation during the evaluation period may result in inconsistent
    integrity readings if called multiple times.
