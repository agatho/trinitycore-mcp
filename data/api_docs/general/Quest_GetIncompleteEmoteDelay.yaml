  class: Quest
  method: GetIncompleteEmoteDelay
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetIncompleteEmoteDelay() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the delay time in milliseconds for incomplete quest emotes.
  description: This method retrieves the delay value used for quest emote events when
    a quest is not yet completed. The returned value represents the time in milliseconds
    that the game will wait before triggering emote actions related to incomplete
    quests. This is typically used in conjunction with quest completion checks and
    can be influenced by various game mechanics including player progression, quest
    timers, and event triggers. The method is commonly used in quest handling systems
    to manage timing between quest completion and emote execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the delay time in milliseconds for
    incomplete quest emotes. This value typically ranges from 0 to several thousand
    milliseconds depending on the specific quest and game context, with higher values
    indicating longer delays before emote actions occur.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 delay = quest->GetIncompleteEmoteDelay();\n// Use delay in quest\
      \ handling logic\nif (delay > 0)\n{\n    // Process emote after delay\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the Quest class and typically used in conjunction with
    other quest-related methods. Implementation details may vary based on how quest
    completion state is handled internally. Performance considerations include potential
    delays in quest processing if this value is used in timing-sensitive operations.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it can affect quest progression
    timing. Incorrect handling of emote delays may lead to quest completion issues
    or timing problems in game events. The delay value might be influenced by other
    factors such as quest timers or player progress.
