documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the taxi node entry for a specified node ID from the flight master
    manager's internal data structure.
  description: The GetTaxiNode method retrieves a const pointer to a TaxiNodesEntry
    object corresponding to the given node ID. This method is used to access flight
    path node information within the TrinityCore framework, which is essential for
    handling player taxi navigation and flight master interactions. The method performs
    a lookup in an internal data structure that stores all available taxi nodes. It
    is typically called when processing player flight requests or validating flight
    paths. The returned pointer is guaranteed to be valid only if the nodeId corresponds
    to an existing taxi node in the database; otherwise, it may return nullptr. This
    method does not modify any state and is thread-safe for read operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to a TaxiNodesEntry structure representing the taxi node
    data for the specified ID. Returns nullptr if no taxi node exists with the given
    ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const TaxiNodesEntry* node = flightMasterManager.GetTaxiNode(12345);\n\
      if (node != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process valid taxi node\n    printf(\"Node %u\
      \ found at (%f, %f, %f)\\n\", node->ID, node->x, node->y, node->z);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Flight Path Validation
    code: "uint32 startNode = 1001;\nuint32 endNode = 1002;\nconst TaxiNodesEntry*\
      \ start = flightMasterManager.GetTaxiNode(startNode);\nconst TaxiNodesEntry*\
      \ end = flightMasterManager.GetTaxiNode(endNode);\nif (start != nullptr && end\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Both nodes exist, proceed with flight path validation\n\
      \    printf(\"Valid flight path from %u to %u\\n\", startNode, endNode);\n}\n\
      else\n{\n    // Invalid node ID encountered\n    printf(\"Invalid flight path\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal data structures that are populated during server
    startup from the game database. The TaxiNodesEntry structure contains information
    such as position coordinates, node flags, and associated map IDs. Performance
    is generally good due to optimized lookups, but repeated calls with many different
    node IDs may impact performance if not cached appropriately.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned TaxiNodesEntry pointer as it points to read-only
    internal data. Accessing invalid node IDs will result in a nullptr return, so
    always check for null before dereferencing the returned pointer.
