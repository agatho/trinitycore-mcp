api:
  class: Conversation
  method: ClearUpdateMask
  signature: void Conversation::ClearUpdateMask(bool remove)
documentation:
  brief: Clears the update mask for a conversation, optionally removing it from the
    world.
  description: The ClearUpdateMask method is used to reset or clear the update mask
    associated with a Conversation object. This typically occurs when a conversation
    needs to be refreshed or reinitialized, ensuring that all pending updates are
    cleared and the conversation state is reset. The optional 'remove' parameter determines
    whether the conversation should also be removed from the active world state, which
    may affect how the client handles the conversation data. This method is commonly
    used during conversation lifecycle management, such as when ending a conversation
    or preparing for a new one.
  parameters:
  - name: remove
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether to remove the conversation from
      the world state after clearing the update mask. If true, the conversation will
      be fully removed; if false, only the update mask is cleared.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ClearUpdateMask
    code: "Conversation* conv = sObjectAccessor->GetConversationById(12345);\nif (conv)\n\
      {\n    conv->ClearUpdateMask(false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Clear update mask and remove conversation from world
    code: "Conversation* conv = sObjectAccessor->GetConversationById(12345);\nif (conv)\n\
      {\n    conv->ClearUpdateMask(true);\n    // Conversation is now removed from\
      \ active state\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it can affect the client's perception
    of ongoing conversations. The 'remove' flag can have implications for memory management
    and network synchronization in multiplayer environments.
  warnings: Calling ClearUpdateMask with remove=true may cause clients to immediately
    stop displaying the conversation, potentially leading to a broken user experience
    if not properly synchronized with game logic or quest progression.
