  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: GenerateClassAnalysisReport
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::GenerateClassAnalysisReport(std::string
    & report, uint8_t classId) const
documentation:
  brief: Generates a performance analysis report for a specified class within the
    bot analytics system.
  description: The GenerateClassAnalysisReport method creates a detailed performance
    summary for a given class ID, aggregating data from bot behavior patterns, usage
    statistics, and efficiency metrics. This function is typically used by administrators
    or developers to evaluate how different player classes perform in terms of bot
    engagement and resource utilization within the TrinityCore framework. The generated
    report is stored in the provided string reference and can be used for further
    analysis or logging purposes. The method operates on internal analytics data structures
    and does not modify any persistent game state.
  parameters:
  - name: report
    description: A reference to a std::string where the generated performance analysis
      report will be stored.
  - name: classId
    description: The unique identifier of the class for which the performance analysis
      is to be generated. Valid values correspond to standard World of Warcraft class
      IDs (e.g., 1 = Warrior, 2 = Paladin, etc.).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'std::string report;

      BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      analytics.GenerateClassAnalysisReport(report, 3);

      // report now contains the analysis for the Hunter class'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Performance Data
    code: "void LogClassPerformance(uint8_t classId) {\n    std::string report;\n\
      \    BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;\n    analytics.GenerateClassAnalysisReport(report,\
      \ classId);\n    sLog->outString(\"Performance Report for Class %u:\\n%s\",\
      \ classId, report.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal bot performance tracking data that must be
    initialized before calling. The output report format is implementation-specific
    and may vary based on the current analytics configuration. It's recommended to
    call this method only when necessary as it processes potentially large datasets.
  warnings: Ensure that the classId parameter corresponds to a valid class in the
    game; invalid IDs may result in an empty or malformed report. The method assumes
    that performance data has been collected and is available for analysis.
