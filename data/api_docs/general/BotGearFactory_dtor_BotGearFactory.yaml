  signature: void BotGearFactory::~BotGearFactory()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BotGearFactory instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotGearFactory class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were initialized during
    the object's lifetime. In the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this likely
    involves releasing gear templates, item configurations, or other data structures
    used to generate bot equipment. This method ensures proper resource management
    and prevents memory leaks when a BotGearFactory instance is no longer needed.
    The destructor is automatically invoked when the object goes out of scope or is
    explicitly deleted.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BotGearFactory
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    BotGearFactory factory;\n    // Use factory...\n\
      \    // Destructor called automatically when factory goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of BotGearFactory pointer
    code: 'BotGearFactory* factory = new BotGearFactory();

      // Use factory...

      delete factory; // Triggers destructor

      factory = nullptr;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing memory
    with pointers. It is typically invoked automatically by the C++ runtime when objects
    go out of scope or are deleted. In TrinityCore's bot system, this destructor may
    also handle cleanup of internal caches or configurations related to bot gear generation.
  warnings: Avoid calling the destructor manually on stack-allocated objects as it
    will result in undefined behavior. Ensure that all references to the BotGearFactory
    instance are cleared before destruction to prevent dangling pointers.
