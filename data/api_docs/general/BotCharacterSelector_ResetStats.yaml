  method: ResetStats
  signature: void BotCharacterSelector::ResetStats()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all character stats for the bot character selector to their default
    values.
  description: The ResetStats method clears and reinitializes all statistical data
    associated with the bot character selector, restoring it to its original state.
    This typically involves resetting attributes such as health points, mana, experience,
    skill levels, and other gameplay-related statistics back to their base values.
    The method is commonly used when a bot character needs to be prepared for a new
    session or scenario, ensuring that previous stat modifications do not carry over.
    It may also clear cached data or temporary modifiers that were applied during
    earlier operations.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotCharacterSelector selector;

      selector.ResetStats();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the bot character is not actively
    engaged in gameplay to avoid unexpected behavior or data corruption. It may trigger
    internal cleanup routines that could affect performance if invoked frequently
    during active sessions.
  warnings: Invoking ResetStats while a bot character is performing actions (e.g.,
    in combat or moving) might lead to undefined behavior or inconsistent state. Always
    ensure the character is idle before calling this method.
