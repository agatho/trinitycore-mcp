  class: BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized
  method: GetUpdateBatchSize
  signature: uint32 BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::GetUpdateBatchSize() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum number of updates to process in a single batch for bot
    world sessions.
  description: The GetUpdateBatchSize method retrieves the configured batch size limit
    used when processing updates for bot world sessions. This value determines how
    many bot updates are handled together in one processing cycle, which can impact
    performance and resource utilization. The batch size is typically set during initialization
    or configuration of the BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized class and affects how frequently
    and efficiently bot data is synchronized with the game world. This method is essential
    for managing update throughput in high-bot-density environments where performance
    optimization is critical.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of updates that can be processed
    in a single batch. This value is typically configured based on system resources
    and performance requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 batchSize = botWorldSessionMgr.GetUpdateBatchSize();

      printf("Bot update batch size: %u\n", batchSize);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring
    code: "uint32 currentBatchSize = botWorldSessionMgr.GetUpdateBatchSize();\nif\
      \ (currentBatchSize > 1000)\n{\n    // Log performance warning for large batch\
      \ sizes\n    sLog->outString(\"Warning: Large bot update batch size detected\
      \ (%u)\", currentBatchSize);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    returned value should not change during runtime unless explicitly modified through
    a corresponding setter method. This batch size parameter directly influences the
    frequency of bot update processing cycles.
  warnings: Modifying the batch size too aggressively may cause performance degradation
    or synchronization issues. Ensure that changes to this value are made carefully
    and tested thoroughly in a development environment before deployment.
