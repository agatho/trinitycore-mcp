  class: ArmsWarriorRefactored
  method: UpdateArmsState
  signature: void ArmsWarriorRefactored::UpdateArmsState(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the arms warrior's combat state based on the target unit provided.
  description: The UpdateArmsState method is responsible for managing and updating
    the combat behavior of an Arms Warrior class instance in response to a specified
    target unit. This method likely evaluates the current combat situation, adjusts
    the warrior's stance or action queue, and ensures proper engagement with the target.
    It may also handle state transitions between different combat modes such as melee
    attack, defensive stance, or special ability usage. The method operates within
    the context of TrinityCore's AI system and is typically invoked during combat
    updates or when a new target is assigned.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the current combat target.
      This parameter defines the entity against which the warrior will engage in combat.
      Must be a valid Unit pointer; passing NULL may result in undefined behavior
      or error conditions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void MyWarriorAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = me->getVictim())\n\
      \    {\n        m_warriorRefactored.UpdateArmsState(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating State with New Target
    code: "void ArmsWarriorRefactored::OnTargetChange(Unit* newTarget)\n{\n    if\
      \ (newTarget)\n    {\n        UpdateArmsState(newTarget);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI framework and may interact with
    other internal state management functions. It should be called only when the warrior
    has an active target to prevent invalid operations. The implementation may include
    checks for target validity, distance calculations, and stance adjustments.
  warnings: Passing a NULL pointer as target can lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the target unit is valid and in the same map before calling this method.
    This function may not be thread-safe and should only be called from the main game
    thread.
