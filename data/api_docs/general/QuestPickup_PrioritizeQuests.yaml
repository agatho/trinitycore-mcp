api:
  class: QuestPickup
  method: PrioritizeQuests
  signature: int QuestPickup::PrioritizeQuests(const int & questIds, Player * bot,
    QuestAcceptanceStrategy strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Prioritizes a list of quest IDs for a bot player based on specified acceptance
    strategy.
  description: The PrioritizeQuests method evaluates and ranks a collection of quest
    identifiers for a given player bot, applying a defined strategy to determine their
    order of acceptance. This functionality is crucial in automated questing systems
    where the bot must decide which quests to pursue first based on factors such as
    quest rewards, level requirements, or quest chain progression. The method ensures
    that the most suitable quests are selected according to the provided strategy
    before being returned for further processing.
  parameters:
  - name: questIds
    description: A reference to an integer representing a list or identifier of quests
      to prioritize. In typical usage, this may be a container holding multiple quest
      IDs.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which the quest
      priorities are being calculated.
  - name: strategy
    description: An enum or strategy type that defines how quests should be prioritized,
      such as by reward value, level requirement, or quest chain logic.
  returns: Returns an integer indicating the number of quests successfully prioritized.
    A return value of zero may indicate no valid quests were found or processed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'std::vector<int> questList = {12345, 12346, 12347};

      int prioritizedCount = bot->GetQuestPickup()->PrioritizeQuests(questList, bot,
      QuestAcceptanceStrategy::REWARD);

      // Prioritizes quests by reward value and returns count of processed quests'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended for internal use within the AI questing system. It
    assumes that the input quest IDs are valid and accessible to the bot player. The
    strategy parameter determines how the prioritization logic is applied, so developers
    should ensure the correct strategy is selected based on gameplay needs.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot player has sufficient level and prerequisites to accept
    the quests before calling this method. Incorrect usage of the strategy enum may
    lead to unexpected quest prioritization behavior.
