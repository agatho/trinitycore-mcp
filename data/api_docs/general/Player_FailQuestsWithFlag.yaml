  class: Player
  method: FailQuestsWithFlag
  signature: void Player::FailQuestsWithFlag(int flag)
documentation:
  brief: Fail all quests with a specific flag for the player.
  description: This method fails all active quests that have the specified flag set
    in the player's quest log. It is used to forcefully remove quests from the player's
    progress when they are no longer valid or when the player has failed them due
    to various game mechanics such as quest completion requirements or time limits.
    The method operates on the principle of removing quests based on their flag value
    rather than their actual status, making it a useful tool for developers working
    with quest systems.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: The flag value used to identify which quests should be failed. Quests
      with this flag will be removed from the player's active quest list.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->FailQuestsWithFlag(123);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      int flagValue = 456;

      player->FailQuestsWithFlag(flagValue);

      // This will fail all quests with flag 456

      // and remove them from the player''s quest log'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with quest system management
    functions. It may be called during quest completion or failure scenarios when
    the player's quest status needs to be updated. Performance considerations include
    potential memory usage if many quests are affected by this operation.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it directly affects the
    player's quest progress and can cause issues if used incorrectly. It should not
    be used in situations where the player's quest status is already being managed
    by other methods or systems.
