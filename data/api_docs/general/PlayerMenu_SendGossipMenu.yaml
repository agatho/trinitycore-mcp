  class: PlayerMenu
  method: SendGossipMenu
  signature: void PlayerMenu::SendGossipMenu(uint32 titleTextId, int objectGUID)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a gossip menu to the player with the specified title text ID and object
    GUID.
  description: The SendGossipMenu method is used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    server implementation to display a gossip menu interface to a player. This method
    is typically invoked when a player interacts with an NPC or game object that has
    associated gossip options. The method takes a title text ID which determines the
    header text displayed in the gossip window, and an object GUID which identifies
    the specific NPC or object triggering the interaction. The gossip menu allows
    players to select from various dialogue options, quest information, vendor listings,
    or other interactive elements depending on the game context. This method is part
    of the player's menu system and is essential for creating interactive quest and
    dialogue experiences in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: titleTextId
    description: The ID of the text entry to be displayed as the title/header of the
      gossip menu. This typically references a row in the npc_text or gossip_menu
      tables in the database.
  - name: objectGUID
    description: The GUID (Global Unique Identifier) of the game object or NPC that
      triggered the gossip interaction. This identifies which specific entity is providing
      the gossip options to the player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Gossip Menu Display
    code: "void Player::OnGossipHello()\n{\n    // Send a basic gossip menu with title\
      \ ID 12345 and NPC GUID\n    player->PlayerMenu->SendGossipMenu(12345, GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Gossip Menu with Dynamic Title
    code: "void Player::OnGossipHello()\n{\n    uint32 gossipTitleId = 0;\n    if\
      \ (player->HasQuest(12345))\n        gossipTitleId = 12346; // Different title\
      \ for players with quest\n    else\n        gossipTitleId = 12345; // Default\
      \ title\n    \n    player->PlayerMenu->SendGossipMenu(gossipTitleId, GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player is in a valid state to
    receive gossip menus. The titleTextId must correspond to an existing entry in
    the database tables that support gossip text display. The objectGUID must be a
    valid GUID of an NPC or GameObject that has associated gossip data. This method
    does not directly handle the menu options themselves; those are managed through
    other methods like AddGossipItem.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the titleTextId and objectGUID
    can result in client-side errors or missing UI elements. The method assumes that
    the player is already in a state where gossip menus can be displayed (e.g., not
    in combat, not in a taxi flight). Using an invalid GUID will cause the client
    to display an empty or broken gossip window.
