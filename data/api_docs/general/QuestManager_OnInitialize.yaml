documentation:
  brief: Initializes the quest manager system and loads all available quests into
    memory
  description: The OnInitialize method is responsible for setting up the QuestManager's
    internal state during server startup or initialization phase. This method typically
    loads quest definitions from database tables, initializes quest-related data structures,
    and prepares the system to handle quest interactions. It ensures that all quest
    data is properly cached and ready for player quest tracking, acceptance, completion,
    and reward distribution. The method performs essential setup operations such as
    validating quest dependencies, registering quest templates, and initializing quest
    state management components. This method should only be called once during the
    server's initialization lifecycle.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initialization was successful and all quests were loaded
    properly; returns false if there was a critical failure during initialization
    that prevents proper quest functionality
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Manager Initialization
    code: "QuestManager questMgr;\nbool success = questMgr.OnInitialize();\nif (success)\n\
      {\n    // Quest system is ready for use\n    sLog->outString(\"Quest manager\
      \ initialized successfully\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Critical failure - server\
      \ should not continue\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to initialize quest manager\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup by the core initialization
    sequence. It's important to note that this method may block execution while loading
    data from the database, so it should not be called from time-critical code paths.
    The method assumes that database connections are already established and functional.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate quest registrations. This method should only be invoked
    once during the server's lifecycle, typically during the core initialization phase
    before any player connections are accepted.
