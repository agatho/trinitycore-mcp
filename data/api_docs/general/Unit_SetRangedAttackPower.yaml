  class: Unit
  method: SetRangedAttackPower
  signature: void Unit::SetRangedAttackPower(int32 attackPower)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the ranged attack power of the unit to the specified value.
  description: This method assigns a specific ranged attack power value to the Unit
    object, which affects the unit's ability to perform ranged attacks. The attack
    power directly influences the damage output of ranged attacks and is typically
    used in conjunction with other combat-related methods for adjusting character
    stats or NPC behavior. This method is commonly used during creature AI initialization
    or when modifying player character attributes.
  parameters:
  - name: attackPower
    description: The ranged attack power value to set for the unit. This value represents
      the base attack power that determines the damage range of ranged attacks, with
      negative values indicating a reduction in attack power.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Ranged Attack Power for Player
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetRangedAttackPower(100);

      // Sets the player''s ranged attack power to 100'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Ranged Attack Power for Creature
    code: 'Creature* creature = GetCreature();

      creature->SetRangedAttackPower(500);

      // Sets the creature''s ranged attack power to 500'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the unit's combat statistics and should be used
    carefully when modifying character attributes. The value is typically set during
    initialization or when adjusting combat-related stats, and may require additional
    updates to related fields such as attack power modifiers or damage calculations.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect combat behavior, especially
    if the attack power value is not properly calculated or adjusted. Care should
    be taken when setting negative values as they may affect the unit's ability to
    perform ranged attacks correctly.
