  method: GetMaxAvailableConditionTargets
  signature: uint32 Condition::GetMaxAvailableConditionTargets() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum number of condition targets available for this condition.
  description: The GetMaxAvailableConditionTargets method retrieves the upper limit
    of targets that can be evaluated against this condition. This value represents
    how many objects or entities the condition is capable of checking against simultaneously.
    In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, conditions are often used in
    quest systems, gossip interactions, and other game mechanics where certain actions
    depend on evaluating multiple potential targets. The returned value typically
    corresponds to internal data structures that define the capacity for condition
    evaluation, which may be influenced by the condition type, associated triggers,
    or configuration settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of available condition targets.
    This number indicates how many entities can be checked against this specific condition
    at once. A return value of zero typically means no targets are supported or the
    condition is not properly initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Condition* condition = sConditionMgr->GetCondition(ConditionType::CONDITION_SOURCE_QUEST,\
      \ 12345);\nuint32 maxTargets = condition->GetMaxAvailableConditionTargets();\n\
      if (maxTargets > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with target evaluation\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Maximum targets for condition: %u\", maxTargets);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the condition system to determine
    capacity limits before performing evaluations. It may return different values
    depending on how the condition was constructed or loaded from database entries.
    The value returned should not be modified directly, as it's derived from internal
    configuration and initialization logic.
  warnings: Do not assume that all targets up to this maximum will always be valid
    for evaluation. Some conditions may have additional constraints or filtering logic
    that reduces the actual number of usable targets at runtime. Also, calling this
    method on an uninitialized or invalid condition object may result in undefined
    behavior.
