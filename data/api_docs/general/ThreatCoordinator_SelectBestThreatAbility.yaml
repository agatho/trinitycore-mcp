  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: SelectBestThreatAbility
  signature: const ThreatAbilityData * ThreatCoordinator::SelectBestThreatAbility(int
    botGuid, ThreatAbilityType type) const
documentation:
  brief: Selects the best threat ability for a bot based on its current threat type
    and GUID.
  description: The SelectBestThreatAbility method determines the most appropriate
    threat ability for a specific bot identified by its GUID, considering the specified
    threat type. This method is typically used in AI-driven gameplay mechanics where
    bots must dynamically choose the optimal ability to apply or respond to threat
    situations. It evaluates available threat abilities and returns a pointer to the
    best matching ability data based on internal logic such as cooldowns, resource
    requirements, or situational relevance. The method does not modify any state and
    is designed to be called during bot decision-making processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a ThreatAbilityData structure representing the selected best
    threat ability for the given bot and threat type. Returns nullptr if no suitable
    ability is found or if the input parameters are invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const ThreatAbilityData* ability = coordinator.SelectBestThreatAbility(12345,\
      \ THREAT_TYPE_MELEE);\nif (ability)\n{\n    // Use the selected ability\n  \
      \  printf(\"Selected ability: %s\\n\", ability->name.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ThreatCoordinator class, which manages AI behavior
    related to threat assessment and ability selection. It assumes that the bot's
    GUID and threat type are valid and properly initialized before calling.
