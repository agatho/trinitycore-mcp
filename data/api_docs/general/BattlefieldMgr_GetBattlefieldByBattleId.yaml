  class: BattlefieldMgr
  method: GetBattlefieldByBattleId
  signature: Battlefield * BattlefieldMgr::GetBattlefieldByBattleId(const Map * map,
    int battleId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a Battlefield object associated with the specified map and battle
    ID.
  description: The GetBattlefieldByBattleId method is used to fetch a specific Battlefield
    instance from the Battlefield Manager based on the provided map and battle ID.
    This method allows access to battlefield-related data and functionality for managing
    player participation, objectives, and rewards within a specific battlefield instance.
    The method performs a lookup in the internal battlefield registry using the given
    parameters to locate and return the appropriate Battlefield object if it exists.
    If no matching battlefield is found, the method returns a null pointer.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object representing the game map where the battlefield
      is located. Must be a valid map instance.
  - name: battleId
    description: Integer identifier for the specific battlefield instance. This ID
      uniquely identifies a particular battlefield within the context of the provided
      map.
  returns: Pointer to the Battlefield object if found, or nullptr if no matching battlefield
    exists for the given map and battle ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByBattleId(map, 12345);\n\
      if (bf != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the battlefield object\n    bf->Update(1000);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Access with Null Check
    code: "const Map* map = sMapMgr->FindMap(0, 0);\nif (map != nullptr)\n{\n    Battlefield*\
      \ bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByBattleId(map, 54321);\n    if (bf !=\
      \ nullptr)\n    {\n        // Process battlefield logic\n        bf->PlayerEnter(player);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Handle case where battlefield doesn't exist\n\
      \        sLog->outError(\"Battlefield with ID 54321 not found\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during player entry/exit events, objective
    updates, and battlefield state management. The method performs a lookup operation
    which may have performance implications if called frequently in tight loops. The
    returned Battlefield object should not be deleted or modified directly by external
    code.
  warnings: Always check the return value for null before using the returned Battlefield
    pointer to avoid segmentation faults. Do not assume that a valid battlefield instance
    will always exist for any given battle ID, as battlefields may be destroyed or
    removed during gameplay.
