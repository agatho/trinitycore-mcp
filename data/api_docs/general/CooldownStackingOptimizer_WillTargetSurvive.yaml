  class: CooldownStackingOptimizer
  method: WillTargetSurvive
  signature: bool CooldownStackingOptimizer::WillTargetSurvive(Unit * target, uint32
    duration) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a target unit will survive a given duration based on cooldown
    stacking optimization logic.
  description: The WillTargetSurvive method evaluates if a specified target unit can
    withstand the effects of a spell or ability for a defined duration, taking into
    account cooldown stacking mechanics and target survivability factors. This method
    is typically used in AI decision-making processes to determine whether it's safe
    to cast a spell or ability on a target without risking immediate death. The method
    considers various combat factors such as incoming damage, healing, and the target's
    current health state during the specified duration. It returns true if the target
    is expected to survive the entire duration, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target whose survival
      is being evaluated. Must not be null.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the target's survival is being
      assessed. Represents the time period during which damage or effects are applied.
  returns: Returns true if the target is expected to survive the specified duration,
    false otherwise. The result depends on internal cooldown stacking calculations
    and target health state evaluation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (optimizer.WillTargetSurvive(target, 5000)) {\n    // Cast the spell\
      \ knowing the target will survive 5 seconds\n    caster->CastSpell(target, spellId,\
      \ true);\n} else {\n    // Target likely dies, avoid casting\n    return false;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple Targets
    code: "std::vector<Unit*> targets = GetNearbyEnemies();\nfor (Unit* target : targets)\
      \ {\n    if (optimizer.WillTargetSurvive(target, 3000)) {\n        // Safe to\
      \ cast on this target\n        CastSpellOnTarget(target, spellId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal cooldown stacking optimization logic that
    may vary based on the specific implementation of the CooldownStackingOptimizer
    class. The accuracy of survival predictions depends on the completeness and correctness
    of the underlying combat simulation data.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as dereferencing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    The duration parameter should represent realistic time intervals for meaningful
    results.
