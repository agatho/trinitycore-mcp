  class: BlackMarketEntry
  method: BuildAuctionMailBody
  signature: int BlackMarketEntry::BuildAuctionMailBody()
documentation:
  brief: Constructs and returns the body content for a mail message related to a black
    market auction.
  description: The BuildAuctionMailBody method generates the formatted text content
    that will be included in the email sent to players when a black market auction
    is created or updated. This method typically constructs a structured message containing
    details about the item being auctioned, such as its name, quality, and other relevant
    attributes. The returned integer likely represents the length of the constructed
    string or indicates success/failure of the operation. This functionality is integral
    to the in-game black market system where players can bid on rare items through
    an auction mechanism.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing either the size of the constructed mail
    body string, or a status code indicating success (typically 0) or failure (non-zero)
    of the operation. A positive value usually denotes the number of characters written
    to the buffer, while negative values may indicate errors during construction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Auction Creation
    code: "BlackMarketEntry entry;\nint bodyLength = entry.BuildAuctionMailBody();\n\
      if (bodyLength > 0)\n{\n    // Mail body successfully constructed\n    // Proceed\
      \ with sending mail to bidder\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle error case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal string buffers and formatting
    logic specific to the TrinityCore mail system. It may be called during black market
    auction creation, update, or notification processes. Developers should ensure
    proper initialization of the BlackMarketEntry object before calling this method.
  warnings: The method might not handle all edge cases gracefully if the BlackMarketEntry
    data is incomplete or corrupted. Calling this method on an uninitialized or improperly
    configured entry could result in malformed mail content or return invalid values.
