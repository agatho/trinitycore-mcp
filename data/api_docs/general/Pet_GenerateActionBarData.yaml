  method: GenerateActionBarData
  signature: std::string Pet::GenerateActionBarData() const
documentation:
  brief: Generates and returns the action bar data string for the pet, containing
    spell and ability information for client display.
  description: The GenerateActionBarData method constructs and returns a formatted
    string that represents the pet's action bar data. This data includes information
    about the spells, abilities, and commands available to the pet, which is used
    by the client to render the pet's action bar interface. The returned string typically
    contains serialized data that the game client interprets to display the appropriate
    buttons and their associated actions. This method is essential for synchronizing
    the pet's action bar state between the server and the client, ensuring that players
    see accurate information about their pet's available abilities. The method does
    not modify any internal state of the pet object but rather provides a read-only
    view of its action bar configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the serialized action bar data for the pet. This
    string typically includes spell IDs, cooldown information, and other metadata
    required by the client to properly display the pet's action bar. The format is
    specific to TrinityCore's internal serialization protocol.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Pet* myPet = player->GetPet();

      std::string actionBarData = myPet->GenerateActionBarData();

      // actionBarData now contains the serialized pet action bar information'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending to Client
    code: "Pet* pet = player->GetPet();\nif (pet)\n{\n    std::string data = pet->GenerateActionBarData();\n\
      \    WorldPacket packet(SMSG_PET_ACTION_BAR, data.length() + 1);\n    packet\
      \ << uint8(0); // Unknown field\n    packet << data;\n    player->SendDirectMessage(&packet);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when the pet's action bar needs to be refreshed
    or sent to a client. The returned string format may vary depending on the pet
    type and its current abilities. The method assumes that the pet has valid action
    bar data and does not perform any validation checks internally.
  warnings: The returned string should not be modified directly as it is generated
    on-demand. Any changes to the pet's action bar state (such as adding/removing
    spells) will require calling this method again to get updated data. This method
    may return an empty string if the pet has no valid action bar configuration.
