  class: FeralBleedTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void FeralBleedTracker::Update(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the feral bleed tracker state for a target.
  description: The Update method in FeralBleedTracker is responsible for managing
    the state and application of feral bleed effects on a target. This method typically
    handles the logic for applying, refreshing, or removing bleed debuffs from a unit,
    often used in conjunction with feral druid abilities such as Rake or Rip. It may
    also manage stacking mechanics, damage calculations, and duration updates for
    the bleed effect. The method operates on a provided target reference, which could
    be a player or creature object within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit's identifier or
      index in the game world. This parameter is used to determine which unit the
      bleed effect should be applied to or updated for.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'FeralBleedTracker tracker;

      int targetId = 12345;

      tracker.Update(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Unit Management
    code: "Unit* unit = player->GetSelectedUnit();\nif (unit)\n{\n    int targetId\
      \ = unit->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n    tracker.Update(&targetId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the game's combat system and debuff management
    framework. It may be called during combat updates or when specific abilities are
    used. The target parameter should point to a valid unit in the world to avoid
    undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is not null or invalid before calling this
    method, as it could lead to crashes or incorrect behavior. This method might have
    performance implications if called excessively during combat loops without proper
    throttling.
