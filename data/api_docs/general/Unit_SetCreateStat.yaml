  class: Unit
  method: SetCreateStat
  signature: void Unit::SetCreateStat(int stat, float val)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a creation stat value for the unit, typically used during initialization
    or stat modification.
  description: The SetCreateStat method assigns a specific stat value to a Unit object,
    likely used during character or creature creation, or when modifying base stats.
    This method is part of the core game mechanics that define how units behave in
    World of Warcraft. It allows developers to programmatically set initial stat values
    such as health, mana, strength, agility, etc., which are fundamental to unit attributes
    and gameplay balance. The method operates on a predefined stat index and accepts
    a floating-point value representing the stat's base amount. This is typically
    called during unit instantiation or when applying stat modifications that should
    persist through the unit's lifetime.
  parameters:
  - name: stat
    description: The stat identifier/index to be set. This corresponds to predefined
      stat constants such as STAT_STRENGTH, STAT_AGILITY, etc., typically defined
      in the TrinityCore codebase.
  - name: val
    description: The floating-point value to assign to the specified stat. This represents
      the base amount of the stat that will be applied to the unit during creation
      or modification.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a unit's strength stat
    code: 'Unit* player = ...;

      player->SetCreateStat(STAT_STRENGTH, 100.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing multiple stats for a new creature
    code: 'Creature* npc = ...;

      npc->SetCreateStat(STAT_STRENGTH, 250.0f);

      npc->SetCreateStat(STAT_AGILITY, 150.0f);

      npc->SetCreateStat(STAT_INTELLECT, 80.0f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal stat storage that affects how the unit's
    attributes are calculated during gameplay. It may be used in conjunction with
    other stat-related methods like GetCreateStat or ModifyStat. The stat index should
    correspond to valid stat identifiers defined in the TrinityCore codebase, otherwise
    behavior is undefined.
  warnings: Calling this method on a unit that has already been initialized or spawned
    in the world might not have the expected effect, as stats are usually set once
    during creation. Incorrect stat indices can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
    Ensure that the value passed is appropriate for the context (e.g., positive values
    for most stats).
