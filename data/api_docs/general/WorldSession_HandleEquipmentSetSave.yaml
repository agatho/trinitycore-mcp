documentation:
  brief: Saves an equipment set to the player's collection
  description: The HandleEquipmentSetSave method processes a client request to save
    the current equipment configuration as a named set. This method is invoked when
    a player uses the 'Save Equipment Set' functionality in the game interface. It
    validates the equipment set data, ensures the player has permission to save sets,
    and stores the configuration for future use. The saved sets can be recalled later
    using the HandleEquipmentSetUse method. This method operates within the WorldSession
    context and interacts with the player's equipment set manager.
  parameters:
  - name: saveEquipmentSet
    description: A packet containing the equipment set data to be saved, including
      the set name and associated item GUIDs
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Equipment Set Save Usage
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleEquipmentSetSave(WorldPackets::EquipmentSet::SaveEquipmentSet&\
      \ saveEquipmentSet)\n{\n    // Validate the equipment set name\n    if (saveEquipmentSet.Name.empty())\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Save the equipment set to player's collection\n\
      \    _player->GetEquipmentSetMgr()->SaveEquipmentSet(saveEquipmentSet);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the client-side UI when a player selects
    'Save Equipment Set'. The actual saving process occurs in the player's equipment
    set manager, which handles validation and persistence of the set data.
