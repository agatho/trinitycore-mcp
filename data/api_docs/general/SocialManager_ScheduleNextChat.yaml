  brief: Schedules the next chat message to be sent in the social manager's queue.
  description: The ScheduleNextChat method is responsible for determining and scheduling
    the timing of the next chat message that should be processed and sent by the SocialManager.
    This method typically manages the internal timing logic for when chat messages
    are dispatched, ensuring proper rate limiting and cooldowns between messages.
    It may interact with the player's social settings, chat filters, and global messaging
    systems to determine the appropriate delay before sending the next message. The
    method is usually called internally by the social manager's message processing
    loop or triggered by specific events such as a new message being queued.

  notes: This method is typically called internally by the SocialManager's message
    handling system and should not usually be invoked directly by external code. It
    may involve internal state management for timing and rate limiting of chat messages.
