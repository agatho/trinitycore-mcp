  class: AreaTrigger
  method: CalcCurrentScale
  signature: float AreaTrigger::CalcCurrentScale() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current scale factor of the area trigger.
  description: The CalcCurrentScale method computes the dynamic scale of an AreaTrigger
    based on its internal state and configuration. This method is typically used to
    determine how large or small the visual representation of the area trigger should
    appear to players, which may be influenced by factors such as time-based scaling,
    player proximity, or spell effects. The returned float value represents a multiplicative
    factor that can be applied to the base scale of the area trigger. This method
    does not modify any internal state and is read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current scale factor of the area trigger.
    A value of 1.0 indicates normal scale, values less than 1.0 indicate shrinking,
    and values greater than 1.0 indicate expansion.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float currentScale = areaTrigger->CalcCurrentScale();\n// Use the scale\
      \ factor to adjust visual effects or collision detection\nif (currentScale >\
      \ 1.0f)\n{\n    // Area trigger is expanding\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying Scale to Visual Effects
    code: 'float scale = areaTrigger->CalcCurrentScale();

      // Apply the scale to a particle system or model

      particleSystem->SetScale(scale);

      model->SetScale(scale);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called frequently during the area trigger's active
    lifetime, so performance should be considered. The implementation may involve
    calculations based on time elapsed since creation or other dynamic factors.
