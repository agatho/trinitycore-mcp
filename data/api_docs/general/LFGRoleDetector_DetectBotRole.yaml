  class: LFGRoleDetector
  method: DetectBotRole
  signature: uint8 LFGRoleDetector::DetectBotRole(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the appropriate LFG role for a bot player based on
    its characteristics and behavior.
  description: The DetectBotRole method analyzes a given bot player's attributes,
    such as class, level, and gameplay patterns, to assign an appropriate Looking
    For Group (LFG) role. This function is crucial for maintaining balanced group
    compositions in World of Warcraft instances and dungeons. The method evaluates
    various factors including the bot's specialization, gear level, and other relevant
    properties to determine whether it should be classified as a tank, healer, or
    damage dealer. It ensures that bots contribute effectively to group dynamics by
    assigning them roles that complement the needs of the player group.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the detected LFG role. Possible values
    are typically 0 for none, 1 for tank, 2 for healer, and 3 for damage dealer, though
    exact mappings may vary depending on internal implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized\nuint8 role = lfgRoleDetector.DetectBotRole(bot);\n\
      switch (role)\n{\n    case 1:\n        // Assign as tank\n        break;\n \
      \   case 2:\n        // Assign as healer\n        break;\n    case 3:\n    \
      \    // Assign as damage dealer\n        break;\n    default:\n        // No\
      \ role assigned\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal bot detection logic and may be influenced
    by the bot's configuration, class, and other attributes. It is designed to work
    within the TrinityCore framework and assumes that the Player object passed in
    is a valid bot instance.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed into this function is not null or
    invalid, as doing so could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The method may
    return unexpected values if the bot does not conform to expected patterns.
