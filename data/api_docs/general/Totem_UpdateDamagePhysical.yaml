  method: UpdateDamagePhysical
  signature: void Totem::UpdateDamagePhysical(int param0)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the physical damage values for a totem based on provided parameters.
  description: The UpdateDamagePhysical method is responsible for recalculating and
    applying physical damage statistics to a totem object. This method typically gets
    invoked when the totem's damage properties need to be refreshed, such as after
    a spell effect modification or stat change. It processes the input parameter to
    determine how the physical damage should be adjusted, potentially affecting the
    totem's attack power or damage output in combat scenarios. The method operates
    within the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework and is part of
    the totem system's core functionality.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An integer parameter that influences how physical damage calculations
      are updated for the totem. This value likely represents a modifier, multiplier,
      or stat adjustment factor that affects the totem's damage output.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Totem* totem = player->GetTotem(TOTEM_SLOT_FIRE);

      totem->UpdateDamagePhysical(10);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Damage with Modifier
    code: 'int damageModifier = 25;

      player->GetTotem(TOTEM_SLOT_EARTH)->UpdateDamagePhysical(damageModifier);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the game engine during stat recalculations
    or spell effects. Developers should ensure that any modifications to totem damage
    are consistent with the intended gameplay balance and do not introduce exploits.
    The parameter value may be clamped or normalized depending on internal validation
    logic.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of this method could lead to unexpected behavior in combat
    calculations. Ensure that the parameter values passed are within expected ranges
    to prevent invalid damage modifications or crashes.
