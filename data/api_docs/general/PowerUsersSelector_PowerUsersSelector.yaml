  class: PowerUsersSelector
  method: PowerUsersSelector
  signature: void PowerUsersSelector::PowerUsersSelector(const Unit * unit, Powers
    power, float dist, bool playerOnly)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a PowerUsersSelector with specified unit, power type, distance,
    and player-only flag.
  description: The PowerUsersSelector constructor initializes a selector object that
    identifies units within a specified range based on their power type. This method
    sets up internal parameters to determine which entities qualify as 'power users'
    for various game mechanics such as spell targeting, aura application, or resource
    management. The selector can be configured to include only player characters or
    include all eligible units within the defined distance.
  parameters:
  - name: unit
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that serves as the reference point for
      power user selection. This unit determines the position from which distance
      is measured.
  - name: power
    description: The Powers enum value specifying the type of power (e.g., POWER_MANA,
      POWER_RAGE) to filter eligible units by.
  - name: dist
    description: Floating-point value representing the maximum distance within which
      to search for qualifying units. Units beyond this range will be excluded from
      selection.
  - name: playerOnly
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to restrict selection to player characters
      only (true) or include all eligible units (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Power Users Selection
    code: 'PowerUsersSelector selector(playerUnit, POWER_MANA, 30.0f, true);

      // Selects only players within 30 yards who have mana'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Power Users with All Units
    code: 'PowerUsersSelector selector(mobUnit, POWER_ENERGY, 50.0f, false);

      // Selects all units (players and NPCs) within 50 yards who have energy'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI behavior scripts or spell targeting logic
    where specific power types need to be targeted within a defined range. The implementation
    may use internal caching mechanisms for performance optimization when the same
    unit and parameters are queried repeatedly.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'unit' parameter is valid and not null before calling
    this constructor, as passing an invalid pointer can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Also, be cautious with large distance values which might impact performance
    in high-traffic areas.
