  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::RecordFailedSpawn()
documentation:
  brief: Records a failed bot spawn event in the performance monitoring system.
  description: The RecordFailedSpawn method logs a failed bot spawn attempt within
    the TrinityCore bot performance monitoring framework. This method is typically
    invoked when a bot fails to spawn due to resource constraints, configuration errors,
    or other environmental factors during gameplay. It updates internal counters and
    metrics to track spawn failure rates, which can be used for debugging, performance
    optimization, and identifying potential issues with bot spawning logic. The method
    does not require any parameters and performs no return operations, serving purely
    as a data recording mechanism.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spawn Logic
    code: "void BotManager::TrySpawnBot()\n{\n    if (!CreateBot())\n    {\n     \
      \   sBotPerformanceMonitor->RecordFailedSpawn();\n        // Handle spawn failure\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from within the bot spawning logic flow.
    It should only be invoked when a spawn attempt has definitively failed, not during
    successful spawns or while attempting to spawn. The implementation likely uses
    atomic operations or thread-safe mechanisms for updating performance counters.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context may result in inaccurate performance
    metrics. Ensure that it's only called after confirming a spawn failure to maintain
    data integrity in the monitoring system.
