  class: BattlefieldMgr
  method: GetBattlefieldToZoneId
  signature: Battlefield * BattlefieldMgr::GetBattlefieldToZoneId(const Map * map,
    int zoneId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the Battlefield object associated with a specific map and zone
    ID.
  description: The GetBattlefieldToZoneId method is used to locate and return a Battlefield
    object that corresponds to a given map and zone identifier. This functionality
    is crucial for managing battlefield instances within the World of Warcraft server
    environment, particularly in TrinityCore. The method allows the game engine to
    determine which battlefield instance a player is interacting with based on their
    current map and zone location. It serves as a lookup mechanism for battlefield-related
    operations such as player registration, instance management, and event handling.
    This method is typically invoked when players enter or leave battlefield zones
    to ensure proper instance tracking and coordination.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object representing the current game map where
      the zone is located. This parameter defines the geographical context for the
      zone lookup.
  - name: zoneId
    description: Integer identifier representing the specific zone within the map.
      This ID uniquely identifies a particular battlefield zone for lookup purposes.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Battlefield object if a matching battlefield instance
    is found for the specified map and zone ID. Returns nullptr if no corresponding
    battlefield instance exists or if the parameters are invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattleFieldMgr->GetBattlefieldToZoneId(map, zoneId);\n\
      if (bf != nullptr) {\n    // Process battlefield operations\n    bf->AddPlayer(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Usage with Null Check
    code: "const Map* map = player->GetMap();\nuint32 zoneId = player->GetZoneId();\n\
      Battlefield* bf = sBattleFieldMgr->GetBattlefieldToZoneId(map, zoneId);\nif\
      \ (bf && bf->IsEnabled()) {\n    // Proceed with battlefield operations\n  \
      \  bf->HandlePlayerEnter(player);\n} else {\n    // Handle case where no battlefield\
      \ is active\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"No active battlefield in this\
      \ zone.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal data structures that map zone IDs to battlefield
    instances. The implementation may involve hash lookups or other optimized data
    retrieval mechanisms for performance. Developers should be aware that the returned
    Battlefield pointer is managed by the BattlefieldMgr and should not be deleted
    directly.
  warnings: The method returns a raw pointer which can be null. Always check for nullptr
    before using the returned value to avoid segmentation faults. Additionally, the
    method assumes valid map and zoneId parameters; invalid inputs may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect results.
