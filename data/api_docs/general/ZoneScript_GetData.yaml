documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a 32-bit integer data value associated with the zone script.
  description: The GetData method is used to retrieve stored data values within a
    ZoneScript instance. This method typically serves as part of the scripting system
    for managing dynamic zone-specific information, such as quest progress, event
    states, or other persistent data that needs to be accessed by various game systems.
    The returned value is usually interpreted based on the specific implementation
    of the ZoneScript subclass and may represent flags, counters, or state identifiers
    relevant to the zone's behavior. This method does not modify any internal state
    and is generally safe for repeated calls.
  parameters: []
  returns: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the requested data value stored
    in the zone script. The meaning of this value depends entirely on how it was previously
    set using a corresponding SetData method or through other game logic.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Zone Script State
    code: "uint32 bossKilled = instance->GetData(DATA_BOSS_KILLED);\nif (bossKilled\
      \ == 1)\n{\n    // Boss has been defeated\n    DoAction(ACTION_BOSS_DEFEATED);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with SetData to maintain and
    query persistent zone state information. It's important to ensure that the data
    values returned are consistent with what was previously set, otherwise unexpected
    behavior may occur during gameplay events.
