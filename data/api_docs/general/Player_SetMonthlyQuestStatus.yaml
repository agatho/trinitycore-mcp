documentation:
  brief: Sets the monthly quest status for a specified quest ID
  description: This method updates the player's monthly quest status for the given
    quest ID, marking it as completed or resetting it based on game mechanics. It
    is typically used in conjunction with monthly quest tracking systems to ensure
    proper quest progression and completion status. The method affects the player's
    quest log and may influence reward distribution for monthly quests.
  parameters:
  - name: quest_id
    description: The unique identifier of the quest whose status needs to be set.
      This should correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting monthly quest status
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetMonthlyQuestStatus(12345);

      // This marks quest 12345 as completed for the month'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by TrinityCore's quest system
    when a monthly quest is completed. It may trigger updates to the player's quest
    log and related data structures. The method should be used carefully as it affects
    game state and may have performance implications if called frequently.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect quest status tracking,
    potentially causing players to miss rewards or experience issues with quest progression.
    Care should be taken when calling this method for quests that are not actually
    monthly quests.
