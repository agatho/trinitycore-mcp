  brief: Sends a pet action feedback message to the player's client
  description: This method sends a PetActionFeedback message to the player's client,
    informing them of the status of their pet's actions. It is used primarily in conjunction
    with spell casting or pet commands to provide visual feedback about the pet's
    behavior. The method handles communication between the server and client regarding
    pet actions, including whether an action was successful, failed, or requires further
    input from the player. This method is part of the broader pet management system
    within TrinityCore.

      PET_ACTION_FEEDBACK_NO_TARGET, or PET_ACTION_FEEDBACK_NO_SPELL.'

      unit->SendPetActionFeedback(PET_ACTION_FEEDBACK_SUCCESS, 12345);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other pet-related methods
    to ensure proper communication between the server and client. It should be called
    when a pet action is completed or when feedback needs to be sent regarding a specific
    action.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can result in incorrect feedback being sent
    to the player, potentially causing confusion about their pet's actions or status.
    Care must be taken to ensure that the correct PetActionFeedback enum value is
    used for each scenario.
