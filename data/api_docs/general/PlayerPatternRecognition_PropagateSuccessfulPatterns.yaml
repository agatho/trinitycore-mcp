documentation:
  brief: Propagates successfully recognized patterns to other players in the same
    group or raid
  description: The PropagateSuccessfulPatterns method is responsible for sharing pattern
    recognition results that have been successfully identified by a player with their
    group members. This functionality is typically used in World of Warcraft's pattern-based
    gameplay mechanics, such as those found in certain dungeons or achievements where
    players must identify and share specific visual or sequence patterns. The method
    iterates through the player's group members and sends the recognized patterns
    to them, ensuring that all players in the group can benefit from the pattern recognition
    efforts of their teammates. This promotes cooperative gameplay and allows for
    shared progress in pattern-based challenges.

  - title: Basic usage in a pattern recognition scenario
    code: "void HandlePatternRecognition(Player* player)\n{\n    PlayerPatternRecognition*\
      \ patternRec = player->GetPatternRecognition();\n    if (patternRec)\n    {\n\
      \        patternRec->PropagateSuccessfulPatterns();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates within the context of group or raid communication
    systems. It may have performance implications when dealing with large groups,
    as it iterates through all group members. The propagation mechanism might utilize
    TrinityCore's existing packet sending infrastructure for efficient transmission.
  warnings: The method should only be called when the player is in a valid group or
    raid context to avoid unnecessary processing. Calling this method outside of appropriate
    gameplay contexts may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
