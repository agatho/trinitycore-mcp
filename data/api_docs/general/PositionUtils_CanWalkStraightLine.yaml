  class: PositionUtils
  method: CanWalkStraightLine
  signature: bool PositionUtils::CanWalkStraightLine(const int & from, const int &
    to, Map * map)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a straight-line path can be walked between two points
    on a map.
  description: The CanWalkStraightLine method evaluates whether it is possible for
    a unit to walk in a straight line from a starting position to an ending position
    without encountering obstacles or impassable terrain. This function is commonly
    used in pathfinding and movement logic within the TrinityCore framework, particularly
    when determining if a direct path exists between two locations. The method takes
    into account map boundaries, terrain data, and collision detection to make its
    determination. It is typically invoked during AI decision-making processes, movement
    validation, or navigation calculations.
  parameters:
  - name: from
    description: The starting position coordinate (typically an x or y value) from
      which the straight-line path begins.
  - name: to
    description: The ending position coordinate (typically an x or y value) to which
      the straight-line path leads.
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object representing the game world where the path
      is being evaluated. This parameter provides context for terrain and obstacle
      data.
  returns: Returns true if a straight-line path can be walked from 'from' to 'to'
    without obstruction, otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI movement logic
    code: "if (PositionUtils::CanWalkStraightLine(startX, endX, currentMap)) {\n \
      \   // Proceed with direct movement\n    unit->MoveTowards(endX, endY);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Use pathfinding instead\n    unit->SetTarget(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking line of sight for spell casting
    code: "if (PositionUtils::CanWalkStraightLine(casterX, targetX, map)) {\n    //\
      \ Cast spell directly\n    caster->CastSpell(target, SPELL_ID);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Find alternative path or cancel cast\n    caster->InterruptSpell();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simplified line-of-sight check and does not account
    for dynamic obstacles such as moving units or temporary environmental changes.
    It relies on static map data and may not reflect real-time conditions. The function
    is optimized for performance and should be used in scenarios where quick path
    validation is needed.
  warnings: Do not use this method for complex navigation decisions; it only checks
    for direct line accessibility and does not consider unit size, height differences,
    or complex terrain features. For precise pathfinding, combine with more sophisticated
    algorithms like A* or NavMesh-based solutions.
