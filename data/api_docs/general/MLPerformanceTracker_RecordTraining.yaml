  class: MLPerformanceTracker
  method: RecordTraining
  signature: void MLPerformanceTracker::RecordTraining(uint32_t botGuid, uint64_t
    durationUs)
documentation:
  brief: Records training performance data for a bot, including the duration of the
    training session.
  description: The RecordTraining method logs performance metrics for a specific bot's
    training session within the TrinityCore framework. It takes the unique identifier
    (GUID) of the bot and the duration of the training in microseconds, storing this
    information for later analysis or reporting. This functionality is typically used
    in AI-driven systems where tracking bot learning progress and performance over
    time is essential. The method does not return any value but updates internal tracking
    structures that may be queried later via other methods in the MLPerformanceTracker
    class.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose training session is
      being recorded. This value must correspond to a valid bot entity within the
      game world.
  - name: durationUs
    description: The duration of the training session in microseconds. This represents
      how long the bot spent training and should be a positive integer value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'MLPerformanceTracker tracker;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      uint64_t durationUs = 5000000; // 5 seconds

      tracker.RecordTraining(botGuid, durationUs);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger machine learning performance monitoring
    system. It assumes that the provided botGuid refers to an existing bot in the
    game world and that the duration is measured accurately. The internal storage
    mechanism for these records may be optimized for frequent writes, but could have
    implications for memory usage if many training sessions are recorded.
  warnings: Ensure that botGuid corresponds to a valid bot entity; otherwise, the
    data might not be stored correctly or could cause errors during retrieval. Also,
    avoid passing negative values for durationUs as it may lead to incorrect performance
    calculations.
