  class: PlayerAchievementMgr
  method: GetOwnerInfo
  signature: std::string PlayerAchievementMgr::GetOwnerInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a formatted string containing player identification information for
    achievement tracking.
  description: The GetOwnerInfo method retrieves and formats identifying information
    about the player associated with this achievement manager. This information is
    typically used for logging, debugging, or associating achievements with specific
    players in the game database. The returned string usually contains the player's
    GUID, name, and potentially other identifying attributes relevant to achievement
    tracking within TrinityCore's framework. This method serves as a utility for internal
    systems that need to reference or log player-specific achievement data without
    directly accessing player objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing formatted player identification information, typically
    including the player's GUID and name in a structured format suitable for logging
    or database operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PlayerAchievementMgr* mgr = player->GetAchievementMgr();

      std::string ownerInfo = mgr->GetOwnerInfo();

      TC_LOG_INFO("achievement", "Player achievement data for: %s", ownerInfo.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by TrinityCore's achievement system
    to maintain proper player associations. The exact format of the returned string
    may vary based on implementation details and could be subject to change in different
    TrinityCore versions.
