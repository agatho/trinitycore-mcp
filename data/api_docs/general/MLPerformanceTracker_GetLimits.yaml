  class: MLPerformanceTracker
  method: GetLimits
  signature: PerformanceLimits MLPerformanceTracker::GetLimits() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the performance limits configuration used by the MLPerformanceTracker.
  description: The GetLimits method returns a PerformanceLimits structure that contains
    the current performance thresholds and constraints configured for the MLPerformanceTracker.
    This structure typically defines maximum allowed resource usage, time limits,
    or other performance-related parameters that govern how machine learning operations
    are executed within the TrinityCore environment. The returned limits are read-only
    and reflect the configuration set during initialization or through prior calls
    to setter methods. These limits help ensure that ML operations do not exceed system
    resources or impact server performance beyond acceptable thresholds.
  parameters: []
  returns: A PerformanceLimits structure containing the current performance constraints
    and thresholds configured for the MLPerformanceTracker. This includes values such
    as maximum execution time, memory usage limits, and other resource constraints
    that define how ML operations are constrained during execution.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Performance Limits
    code: 'MLPerformanceTracker tracker;

      PerformanceLimits limits = tracker.GetLimits();

      std::cout << "Max Execution Time: " << limits.maxExecutionTimeMs << "ms" <<
      std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for monitoring and debugging purposes to understand
    the current performance constraints applied to ML operations. The returned PerformanceLimits
    object should not be modified directly as it represents a snapshot of the configuration
    at the time of the call.
