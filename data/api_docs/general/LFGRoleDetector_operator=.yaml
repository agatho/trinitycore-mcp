  method: operator=
  signature: LFGRoleDetector & LFGRoleDetector::operator=(LFGRoleDetector && param0)
documentation:
  brief: Moves the contents of another LFGRoleDetector instance to this instance.
  description: The move assignment operator for LFGRoleDetector transfers all resources
    and state from the source object to the current object, leaving the source in
    a valid but unspecified state. This operation is typically used to efficiently
    transfer ownership of dynamically allocated memory or other resources without
    performing deep copies. In the context of TrinityCore's LFG (Looking for Group)
    system, this method allows for efficient management of role detection data structures
    during group formation and reorganization processes. The operator ensures that
    any existing resources in the target object are properly cleaned up before the
    move operation occurs.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current LFGRoleDetector instance, allowing for chaining
    of assignment operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'LFGRoleDetector detector1;

      LFGRoleDetector detector2 = std::move(detector1); // Uses move assignment

      // detector1 is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // detector2 contains the moved resources'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Move Assignments
    code: 'LFGRoleDetector d1, d2, d3;

      // ... initialize d1, d2, d3 ...

      d3 = std::move(d2) = std::move(d1); // Chained move assignments

      // d1 and d2 are left in valid but unspecified state

      // d3 contains the moved resources from d1'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is part of the C++ move semantics standard. It should only
    be used when you no longer need the source object's contents. The implementation
    typically involves swapping internal pointers or resource handles rather than
    copying data, making it much more efficient than copy assignment for large objects.
  warnings: After a move assignment, the source object is left in a valid but unspecified
    state. Any attempt to use the source object's members without reinitialization
    may lead to undefined behavior. Do not assume that the moved-from object retains
    its original functionality or data integrity.
