documentation:
  brief: Calculates the angular difference between two integer values representing
    positions or directions.
  description: The CalculateAngleBetween method computes the angular difference between
    two integer values that represent positions or directional angles in the game
    world. This utility function is commonly used for determining relative orientations,
    such as calculating the angle between a player's facing direction and a target
    location. The method handles wraparound cases and returns the smallest angular
    difference in radians. It assumes both input parameters are valid angles expressed
    in a consistent unit system (likely degrees or radians depending on internal implementation).
    This function is essential for AI pathfinding, targeting mechanics, and orientation
    calculations within TrinityCore's game engine.
  parameters:
  - name: from
    description: The starting angle or position value from which the angular difference
      is calculated. This represents the reference point for the angle measurement.
  - name: to
    description: The target angle or position value to which the angular difference
      is measured. This represents the destination point for the angle calculation.
  returns: "Returns a float value representing the angular difference in radians between\
    \ the 'from' and 'to' parameters. The result is always positive and represents\
    \ the smallest angular distance, typically within the range [0, \u03C0] radians."
  examples:
  - title: Basic Angle Calculation
    code: 'float angle = PositionUtils::CalculateAngleBetween(45, 90);

      // Returns approximately 0.785 radians (45 degrees)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Wraparound Case Example
    code: 'float angle = PositionUtils::CalculateAngleBetween(350, 10);

      // Handles wraparound correctly, returns approximately 0.349 radians (20 degrees)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed for efficient computation of angular differences
    in a circular space. It likely uses modulo arithmetic to handle cases where angles
    cross the 0/360 degree boundary. The implementation may assume inputs are normalized
    or use internal conversion functions to ensure consistent units. Performance is
    optimized for frequent calls in game logic loops, particularly in AI and movement
    systems.
  warnings: Ensure that input parameters represent valid angular measurements within
    expected ranges. If values are not properly normalized, unexpected results may
    occur during wraparound scenarios. The method might not handle negative angles
    consistently without proper preprocessing.
