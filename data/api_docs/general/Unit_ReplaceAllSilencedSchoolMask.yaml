  class: Unit
  method: ReplaceAllSilencedSchoolMask
  signature: void Unit::ReplaceAllSilencedSchoolMask(int schoolMask)
documentation:
  brief: Replaces all silenced school masks on the unit with a new school mask.
  description: This method replaces all existing silence school masks on the Unit
    with a new specified school mask. It is used to modify the silence behavior of
    the unit, typically in response to certain game mechanics or spell effects. The
    method operates by clearing any current silence masks and applying the new one,
    ensuring that the unit's silence status reflects the updated school mask value.
    This functionality is commonly used in handling spell interactions where silence
    needs to be modified or replaced.
  parameters:
  - name: schoolMask
    description: The new school mask to replace all existing silence masks with. This
      parameter defines the type of school mask being applied, such as fire, frost,
      nature, etc., and determines how the unit's silence behavior will be modified.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Replace Silence School Mask
    code: 'Unit* target = new Unit;


      // Replace all silence school masks with fire mask

      target->ReplaceAllSilencedSchoolMask(SCHOOL_MASK_FIRE);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other silence-related methods
    to ensure consistent behavior of the unit's silence status. It may be called during
    spell effects or game events where silence needs to be modified dynamically.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it directly modifies the
    unit's silence state, potentially affecting gameplay mechanics such as spell casting
    or movement restrictions. Incorrect usage could lead to unintended behavior in
    combat or non-combat situations.
