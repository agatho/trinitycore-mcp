  class: FlightMasterManager
  method: FlightMasterManager
  signature: void FlightMasterManager::FlightMasterManager(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a FlightMasterManager instance for the specified player bot.
  description: The FlightMasterManager constructor initializes the flight master functionality
    for a given player bot. This method sets up internal data structures and configurations
    required for managing flight paths, taxi nodes, and related flight operations
    for the bot. It typically prepares the manager to handle flight-related commands
    and interactions within the game world, such as acquiring flight paths, checking
    available routes, and managing taxi node access for the specified player character.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will utilize
      flight master functionality. This parameter must be a valid player instance;
      passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic FlightMasterManager Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid Player pointer

      FlightMasterManager flightMgr(myBot);

      // The flight manager is now initialized for use with the bot'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely performs initialization tasks such as loading taxi
    node data, setting up internal pathfinding structures, and establishing references
    to the player's current location and flight status. It should be called once per
    bot instance before any flight-related operations are performed.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is valid and not null. Using an
    invalid or uninitialized player reference may lead to crashes or undefined behavior
    during subsequent flight operations.
