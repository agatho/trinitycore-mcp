  class: NeuralNetwork
  method: CopyFrom
  signature: void NeuralNetwork::CopyFrom(const NeuralNetwork & other)
documentation:
  brief: Copies all neural network weights, biases, and configuration from another
    neural network instance.
  description: The CopyFrom method performs a deep copy of the entire neural network
    structure, including all weights, biases, activation functions, layer configurations,
    and training parameters from the source NeuralNetwork object. This operation is
    typically used to duplicate the state of one neural network for use in another
    context, such as when initializing a new network with pre-trained parameters or
    creating backup copies. The method ensures that both networks are completely independent
    after copying, meaning modifications to one will not affect the other. In World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment, this functionality is particularly useful
    for AI behavior trees and machine learning-based NPC decision-making systems where
    network state needs to be preserved or transferred between different instances.
  parameters:
  - name: other
    description: Reference to the source NeuralNetwork object from which all data
      will be copied. This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid
      neural network with initialized layers and weights.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Network Copy
    code: 'NeuralNetwork sourceNet;

      // ... initialize sourceNet with weights and biases ...

      NeuralNetwork targetNet;

      targetNet.CopyFrom(sourceNet);

      // targetNet now contains identical structure and values as sourceNet'
    language: cpp
  - title: AI Behavior Network Duplication
    code: "class AINpc {\n    NeuralNetwork decisionNetwork;\n    void LoadBehavior(const\
      \ std::string& behaviorName) {\n        NeuralNetwork loadedNetwork;\n     \
      \   // ... load network from file or database ...\n        decisionNetwork.CopyFrom(loadedNetwork);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a deep copy operation, which may have performance implications
    for large networks with many layers and neurons. The copied network will be completely
    independent from the source, so any subsequent modifications to either network
    will not affect the other. Memory allocation occurs during this operation, so
    it should be used judiciously in performance-critical sections of code.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'other' parameter refers to a properly initialized NeuralNetwork
    object before calling CopyFrom, as copying from an uninitialized or corrupted
    network may result in undefined behavior. Avoid frequent calls to this method
    in tight loops due to potential memory allocation overhead.
