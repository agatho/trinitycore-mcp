documentation:
  brief: Sends an Azerite respec NPC dialog to the player's client
  description: The SendAzeriteRespecNPC method is responsible for displaying the Azerite
    item respec interface to a player when they interact with an Azerite respec NPC.
    This method prepares and transmits the necessary data packet to the client to
    show the respec window, allowing players to reset their Azerite traits. The method
    typically gets called when a player interacts with an NPC that provides Azerite
    respec services, such as the Azerite Respec Vendor found in major cities. It handles
    the client-side UI presentation and ensures proper synchronization of the respec
    state between server and client.
  parameters:
  - name: npc
    description: The NPC entry ID that the player is interacting with to access the
      Azerite respec service
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage when player interacts with Azerite Respec NPC
    code: "void Player::OnAzeriteRespecNPCInteraction(uint32 npcEntry)\n{\n    if\
      \ (GetSession())\n        GetSession()->SendAzeriteRespecNPC(npcEntry);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Azerite system introduced in World of Warcraft
    Legion. The actual respec functionality requires proper server-side validation
    and client-side UI handling. The NPC parameter should correspond to a valid Azerite
    respec NPC entry defined in the game database.
