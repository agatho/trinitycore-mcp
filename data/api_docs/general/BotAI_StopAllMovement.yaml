  brief: Stops all movement for the bot character
  description: The StopAllMovement method halts any ongoing movement actions for the
    bot AI character. This includes stopping pathfinding, movement towards targets,
    and any active movement states. The method ensures that the bot's movement state
    is reset to idle, preventing further movement until new movement commands are
    issued. It is commonly used when the bot needs to pause its current activity or
    when transitioning between different AI behaviors.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void MyBotAI::OnUpdate(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Stop all movement\n    botAI->StopAllMovement();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the bot's movement state and should be called
    carefully to avoid interrupting important movement sequences. The implementation
    likely clears the bot's current movement path and resets its movement flags.
