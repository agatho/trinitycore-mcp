  method: GetDistanceToTarget
  signature: float HunterAI::GetDistanceToTarget(int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the distance between the hunter and its current target.
  description: The GetDistanceToTarget method computes the Euclidean distance between
    the HunterAI instance's position and the position of its current target. This
    is a fundamental utility method used in AI decision-making processes for ranged
    combat, aiming, and movement behaviors. The method relies on the internal target
    tracking mechanism of the HunterAI class and assumes that a valid target exists.
    It performs no validation checks on the target parameter itself, as it's expected
    to be managed by the AI system. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    this distance calculation is crucial for determining when to shoot, move, or reposition
    during combat.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter is typically managed internally by the AI system and
      should not be null.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the distance in yards between the hunter
    and its target. A return value of 0.0f indicates that either the target is invalid
    or the hunter and target are at the same position.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine combat range
    code: "float distance = hunterAI->GetDistanceToTarget(&targetGuid);\nif (distance\
      \ > 10.0f) {\n    // Move closer to target\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using distance for shot timing logic
    code: "int targetGuid = 12345;\nfloat dist = hunterAI->GetDistanceToTarget(&targetGuid);\n\
      if (dist < 5.0f) {\n    // Target too close, consider moving back\n} else if\
      \ (dist > 30.0f) {\n    // Target too far, consider moving forward\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the target GUID passed in is valid and corresponds
    to an existing unit in the game world. The accuracy of the distance calculation
    depends on the precision of the position tracking system within TrinityCore. Performance-wise,
    this operation is lightweight as it only involves basic mathematical computations.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid target before calling
    this method, otherwise the behavior is undefined. This method should not be called
    when the hunter has no target assigned, as it may lead to incorrect distance calculations
    or potential crashes.
