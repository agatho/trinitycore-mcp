  signature: int SpellInfo::GetSchoolMask() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the school mask of the spell, indicating the magic school type.
  description: The GetSchoolMask method retrieves the school mask associated with
    a SpellInfo object, which defines the magical school or schools that the spell
    belongs to. This value is used in game mechanics to determine spell interactions,
    resistances, and damage types. The method returns an integer representing the
    school mask, where each bit corresponds to a specific magic school. For example,
    a value of 1 might represent Holy school, while 2 could represent Fire school,
    and so on. This information is crucial for determining how spells interact with
    various magical defenses and for calculating damage types in combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the school mask of the spell. Each bit
    in the returned value corresponds to a specific magic school (e.g., 1 = Holy,
    2 = Fire, 4 = Nature, etc.). The value can be used to determine which schools
    are affected by the spell or to check if a particular school is included in the
    spell's mask.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "SpellInfo* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(12345);\nint schoolMask\
      \ = spellInfo->GetSchoolMask();\nif (schoolMask & 1) {\n    // Check if Holy\
      \ school is included\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SpellInfo class and is used in conjunction with
    other spell-related methods to determine spell properties. It should be used carefully
    when checking for specific schools, as bitwise operations are required to properly
    interpret the returned value.
  warnings: The method returns an integer that represents a bitmask; developers must
    ensure proper bit manipulation when interpreting the result. Also, not all spells
    have a single school mask; some may include multiple schools, which requires careful
    handling of bitwise operations.
