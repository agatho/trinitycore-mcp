  class: ObjectGuidFactory
  method: CreateLMMLobby
  signature: ObjectGuid ObjectGuidFactory::CreateLMMLobby(uint32 realmId, uint32 arg2,
    uint8 arg3, uint8 arg4, uint64 counter)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a unique ObjectGuid for a LMM lobby entity using specified realm
    and lobby parameters.
  description: The CreateLMMLobby method generates a unique ObjectGuid specifically
    designed for identifying LMM (Looking for Group Matchmaking) lobby entities within
    the TrinityCore framework. This function takes multiple input parameters including
    realm ID, additional configuration values, and a counter to ensure uniqueness
    across different lobby instances. The resulting ObjectGuid is structured to be
    compatible with World of Warcraft's object identification system and can be used
    to track and reference specific lobby instances throughout the game session. The
    method is typically invoked when initializing or spawning new matchmaking lobbies
    in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: realmId
    description: The unique identifier of the realm where the lobby will exist. Must
      be a valid realm ID from the game database.
  - name: arg2
    description: Additional configuration parameter, likely representing lobby type
      or group size settings. Value range depends on game mechanics and server configuration.
  - name: arg3
    description: Secondary configuration byte, possibly indicating lobby visibility
      or access level. Valid values are typically 0-255.
  - name: arg4
    description: Tertiary configuration byte, potentially used for lobby difficulty
      or game mode flags. Must be within standard unsigned char range (0-255).
  - name: counter
    description: Unique counter value to ensure GUID uniqueness across multiple lobby
      creations. Should be incremented or randomized per new lobby instance.
  returns: Returns an ObjectGuid object uniquely identifying the created LMM lobby.
    The returned GUID follows World of Warcraft's standard object identification format
    and can be used for entity referencing in game systems.
  examples:
  - title: Basic LMM Lobby Creation
    code: 'ObjectGuid lobbyGuid = guidFactory.CreateLMMLobby(1, 5, 2, 1, 1000);

      // Creates a lobby with realm ID 1, lobby type 5, visibility level 2, difficulty
      1, and counter 1000'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Multiple Lobbies in Sequence
    code: "for (uint32 i = 0; i < 5; ++i)\n{\n    ObjectGuid lobbyGuid = guidFactory.CreateLMMLobby(1,\
      \ 5, 2, 1, 1000 + i);\n    // Each iteration creates a unique lobby with incremented\
      \ counter\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectGuidFactory class which manages all GUID
    generation for various game entities. The generated GUIDs are designed to be globally
    unique within the realm and across different server instances. The implementation
    likely uses internal bit manipulation to construct the full GUID from the provided
    parameters, ensuring compatibility with existing TrinityCore systems.
  warnings: Ensure that the counter parameter is properly managed to avoid GUID collisions
    when creating multiple lobbies rapidly. Using sequential counters without proper
    synchronization may lead to duplicate GUIDs in high-concurrency scenarios.
