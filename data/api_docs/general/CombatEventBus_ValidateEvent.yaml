documentation:
  brief: Validates a combat event for correctness and consistency within the CombatEventBus
    system
  description: The ValidateEvent method checks whether a given CombatEvent object
    meets all required criteria and constraints necessary for proper processing within
    the TrinityCore combat system. It ensures that the event contains valid data,
    such as proper GUIDs, valid spell IDs, correct damage values, and consistent timing
    information. This validation is crucial for maintaining the integrity of combat
    logs and preventing invalid or malicious events from being processed. The method
    performs checks on various fields of the CombatEvent structure to ensure they
    fall within expected ranges and follow World of Warcraft's combat mechanics rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the combat event passes all validation checks and is considered
    valid for processing, false otherwise. Invalid events may fail due to missing
    data, out-of-range values, or inconsistent state information.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Validation
    code: "CombatEvent event;\n// ... populate event with valid data ...\nbool isValid\
      \ = combatEventBus.ValidateEvent(event);\nif (isValid)\n{\n    // Process the\
      \ event\n    combatEventBus.ProcessEvent(event);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Log invalid\
      \ event or discard it\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid combat event detected\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the CombatEventBus before processing
    events, but can also be used externally for debugging or pre-validation purposes.
    The validation logic may evolve with game updates and new combat mechanics, so
    developers should be aware that strict validation rules could change over time.
  warnings: Calling this method on an unpopulated or partially initialized CombatEvent
    object will likely result in false returns. Ensure all required fields are properly
    set before calling ValidateEvent to avoid false negatives in your validation logic.
