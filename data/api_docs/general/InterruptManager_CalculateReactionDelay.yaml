  method: CalculateReactionDelay
  signature: float InterruptManager::CalculateReactionDelay()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the reaction delay time for interrupting spell casts
    in the game.
  description: The CalculateReactionDelay method computes the time interval during
    which a unit can react to and interrupt ongoing spell casts. This value is typically
    used by the AI system to determine when a creature or player should attempt to
    interrupt an enemy's casting. The calculation may take into account various factors
    such as the caster's level, the type of spell being cast, and the interrupting
    unit's abilities or attributes. This method is part of the InterruptManager class
    which handles all logic related to spell interruption mechanics in TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the reaction delay time in seconds. This value
    indicates how long after a spell begins casting before an interrupt can be attempted.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float delay = interruptManager.CalculateReactionDelay();\n// Use delay\
      \ to schedule interrupt attempts\nif (delay > 0)\n{\n    // Schedule interrupt\
      \ logic after delay seconds\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal game constants and may be influenced by
    difficulty settings or creature AI configurations. The returned value should not
    be used directly for timing without considering potential modifiers from buffs,
    debuffs, or special abilities that affect interrupt timing.
  warnings: The exact calculation logic is not available in the provided source code,
    so implementation details are inferred based on typical TrinityCore interrupt
    mechanics. Ensure proper synchronization if this method is called from multiple
    threads.
