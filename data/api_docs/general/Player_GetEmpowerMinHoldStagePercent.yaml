  class: Player
  method: GetEmpowerMinHoldStagePercent
  signature: float Player::GetEmpowerMinHoldStagePercent() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the minimum hold stage percentage required for empowerment ability.
  description: This method retrieves the minimum hold stage percentage that must be
    reached before a player can activate their empowerment ability. The value represents
    the threshold at which the empowerment mechanic becomes active, typically related
    to the player's current energy or mana level. This is used in conjunction with
    other empowerment-related methods to determine when an ability can be triggered.
    The method is part of the general player mechanics and does not require any specific
    parameters or conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the minimum percentage required for
    the empowerment stage hold, typically ranging from 0.0 to 100.0, where 0.0 indicates
    no hold stage requirement and 100.0 indicates full hold stage requirement.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float minHoldPercent = player->GetEmpowerMinHoldStagePercent();\nif (minHoldPercent\
      \ > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Use the value to determine if empowerment can be activated\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the general player mechanics and should be used in
    conjunction with other empowerment-related methods for complete functionality.
    Performance considerations are minimal as this is a simple getter method.
  warnings: The value returned by this method may vary depending on class-specific
    mechanics or game updates, so developers should verify that their code accounts
    for potential changes in the game's empowerment system.
