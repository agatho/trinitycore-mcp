api:
  class: Creature
  method: GetGossipMenuId
  signature: uint32 Creature::GetGossipMenuId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the gossip menu identifier associated with the creature.
  description: The GetGossipMenuId method retrieves the unique identifier (ID) of
    the gossip menu that is linked to a specific creature. This ID is used by the
    game server to determine which menu options should be displayed when a player
    interacts with the creature. The method is typically called during the interaction
    process to ensure proper menu handling and display. It's an essential part of
    the creature's gossip system implementation, allowing developers to access and
    modify the creature's gossip behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the uint32 identifier of the gossip menu associated with this creature.
    This value corresponds to a specific menu in the database that defines what options
    are available for player interaction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 gossipId = creature->GetGossipMenuId();\nif (gossipId > 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Process the gossip menu\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other gossip-related functions
    such as AddGossipMenuOption or SetGossipMenuId to build and manage creature's
    gossip menus. Performance considerations are minimal since this is a simple getter
    function.
  warnings: Care must be taken when modifying the returned value, as changing the
    menu ID may affect how players interact with the creature. Ensure that the new
    menu ID corresponds to valid database entries.
