  signature: bool MovementArbiter::HasPendingRequests() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the MovementArbiter has any pending movement requests in its queue.
  description: The HasPendingRequests method determines whether there are any queued
    movement commands or requests that have not yet been processed by the MovementArbiter.
    This is typically used to assess the current state of movement handling for an
    object, such as a player or creature, to decide whether new movement actions can
    be safely added or if the system is already busy processing previous requests.
    The method performs a simple check on internal request queues and returns true
    if any pending operations exist, false otherwise. This functionality is crucial
    in preventing overload of movement commands and ensuring smooth gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if there are pending movement requests currently queued for
    processing; returns false if the queue is empty or no requests are awaiting execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Prevent Overloading Movement Queue
    code: "if (!player->GetMovementArbiter()->HasPendingRequests()) {\n    player->MoveTo(destination);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle case where movement is already pending\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      movement\", \"Player {} has pending movement requests, skipping new request.\"\
      , player->GetName());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not modify any internal state and is safe to call from multiple
    threads as long as the underlying queue implementation is thread-safe. It provides
    a lightweight check suitable for frequent polling without performance impact.
