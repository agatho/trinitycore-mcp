  method: SelectContextualEmote
  signature: EmoteType SocialManager::SelectContextualEmote(const std::string & context)
documentation:
  brief: Selects an appropriate emote based on the provided context string for use
    in social interactions.
  description: The SelectContextualEmote method determines and returns a suitable
    EmoteType based on the given context string. This functionality is typically used
    within the SocialManager to provide contextual responses or actions in player-to-player
    or player-to-NPC interactions. The method evaluates the input context to match
    against predefined emote categories such as greeting, farewell, greeting, or other
    social cues. It ensures that the returned emote type aligns with the expected
    behavior for the given scenario. This method is part of the core social interaction
    system in TrinityCore and helps maintain immersive gameplay by providing appropriate
    visual feedback through emotes.
  parameters:
  - name: context
    description: A string representing the contextual situation that determines which
      emote should be selected. Valid values include strings like 'greeting', 'farewell',
      'hello', 'goodbye', or any custom context defined by the social system.
  returns: Returns an EmoteType enum value indicating the appropriate emote to be
    used for the given context. Possible return values depend on the internal mapping
    of contexts to emotes, typically including standard emotes such as EMOTE_STATE_SIT,
    EMOTE_STATE_SLEEP, EMOTE_STATE_WAVE, etc., or custom defined emotes based on the
    context provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'EmoteType emote = socialManager.SelectContextualEmote("greeting");

      // Returns an appropriate emote type for a greeting interaction'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with dynamic context
    code: 'std::string playerContext = GetPlayerInteractionContext();

      EmoteType selectedEmote = socialManager.SelectContextualEmote(playerContext);

      // Selects an emote based on runtime determined interaction context'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal mappings between context strings and emote
    types. Developers should ensure that all possible context values are handled gracefully
    to avoid unexpected behavior. The implementation may involve lookup tables or
    conditional logic depending on how the social system is configured.
  warnings: Ensure that the input context string is properly sanitized and validated
    to prevent potential misuse or unexpected emote selection. Improperly formatted
    contexts could lead to invalid emote types being returned, which might cause client-side
    issues or inconsistent behavior in social interactions.
