  class: Battlefield
  method: GetFreeBfRaid
  signature: Group * Battlefield::GetFreeBfRaid(int TeamId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the first available battlefield raid group for the specified team.
  description: The GetFreeBfRaid method is used to obtain a pointer to the first free
    (unused) battlefield raid group associated with a specific team in the Battlefield
    system. This method is typically invoked during battlefield matchmaking or group
    assignment processes where a new player needs to be added to an existing raid
    group that has not yet been filled. The method ensures that players are distributed
    evenly across available raid groups for balanced gameplay and team composition.
    It returns a pointer to a Group object which represents the raid group, or nullptr
    if no free group is available for the specified team.
  parameters:
  - name: TeamId
    description: The team identifier (0 for Alliance, 1 for Horde) for which to retrieve
      a free battlefield raid group.
  returns: A pointer to a Group object representing the first available battlefield
    raid group for the specified team. Returns nullptr if no free group is available
    for the given team.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Free Raid Group for Alliance
    code: "Group* allianceRaid = battlefield->GetFreeBfRaid(0);\nif (allianceRaid\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Add player to the raid group\n    allianceRaid->AddMember(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handle No Free Group Available
    code: "Group* freeRaid = battlefield->GetFreeBfRaid(1);\nif (freeRaid == nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Create new raid group or handle error\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_BATTLEFIELD_NO_FREE_GROUPS);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    freeRaid->AddMember(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Battlefield system's internal group management
    and is typically called during player registration or battlefield entry. The returned
    Group object may be used directly to add players or perform other group operations,
    but care should be taken to ensure proper synchronization if multiple threads
    are involved in battlefield operations.
  warnings: The method returns a raw pointer to a Group object which might be null
    if no free groups exist. Always check for nullptr before using the returned value
    to prevent segmentation faults. Additionally, this method does not perform any
    automatic group creation; it only retrieves existing free groups.
