    uint32 & areaid, const Position & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves zone and area identifiers based on phase shift and position
  description: This method determines the zone and area IDs for a given position within
    a specific phase shift context. It is used to identify the geographical location
    of objects or players within the game world, particularly when dealing with phased
    content. The method considers both the phase information and spatial coordinates
    to accurately determine these identifiers. This functionality is essential for
    proper game mechanics handling in TrinityCore's World of Warcraft implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: phaseShift
    description: The phase shift object that defines the current phase context for
      the position. This determines which zone and area IDs are relevant based on
      the phase.
  - name: zoneid
    description: Reference to a uint32 variable where the zone identifier will be
      stored. This represents the geographical zone identifier for the given position.
  - name: areaid
    description: Reference to a uint32 variable where the area identifier will be
      stored. This represents the specific area identifier within the zone for the
      given position.
  - name: pos
    description: The position coordinates that determine which zone and area IDs are
      returned. The method uses these coordinates to calculate the appropriate identifiers
      based on phase shift.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'PhaseShift phaseShift;

      uint32 zoneId, areaId;

      Position pos = Position(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);

      map->GetZoneAndAreaId(phaseShift, zoneId, areaId, pos);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other position-based methods
    to determine geographical context for game objects or players. Implementation
    relies on phase shift information and spatial coordinates to accurately determine
    zone and area identifiers.
