  class: LFGGroupCoordinator
  method: GetTeleportTimeout
  signature: uint32 LFGGroupCoordinator::GetTeleportTimeout() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the teleport timeout value for the LFG group coordinator.
  description: The GetTeleportTimeout method retrieves the timeout duration in seconds
    that determines how long a player has to teleport to a dungeon or raid instance
    after being matched through Looking For Group (LFG). This value is used by the
    LFG system to manage player readiness and prevent stale matches. The timeout ensures
    that players do not remain indefinitely in the LFG queue without taking action,
    maintaining efficient group formation and preventing server resource waste. This
    method is typically called during LFG matchmaking processes to determine the time
    window for player teleportation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the teleport timeout duration in seconds. This
    value indicates how long players have before their LFG match expires if they haven't
    teleported to the instance yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 timeout = coordinator->GetTeleportTimeout();

      printf("Teleport timeout: %u seconds\n", timeout);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Timeout in LFG Logic
    code: "LFGGroupCoordinator* coordinator = sLFGMgr->GetGroupCoordinator(player->GetGUID());\n\
      if (coordinator)\n{\n    uint32 timeout = coordinator->GetTeleportTimeout();\n\
      \    if (timeout > 0)\n    {\n        // Schedule a warning or action when timeout\
      \ is near\n        player->SendLFGTimeoutWarning(timeout);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The teleport timeout value is typically configured server-side and may vary
    based on the type of LFG instance (dungeon, raid, scenario). This method returns
    a cached value that should be consistent for the duration of an LFG match. The
    timeout mechanism helps maintain efficient queue management and prevents players
    from blocking group formation indefinitely.
  warnings: This method should only be called when a valid LFG group coordinator exists
    for the player or group. Calling it on a null coordinator may result in undefined
    behavior. The returned value represents seconds, so ensure proper conversion if
    working with other time units.
