    uint8 level, bool isDeleted)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a new character cache entry to the character cache with specified player
    details.
  description: The AddCharacterCacheEntry method is responsible for inserting a new
    character entry into the in-memory character cache. This cache stores essential
    information about players, such as their GUID, account ID, name, gender, race,
    class, level, and deletion status. The method is typically invoked when a new
    character is created or when character data needs to be synchronized with the
    cache for faster access during gameplay operations. It ensures that subsequent
    lookups of character data can be performed efficiently without repeatedly querying
    the database.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique global identifier (GUID) of the character, used to uniquely
      identify the player across the game world.
  - name: accountId
    description: The account ID associated with the character's owning account, linking
      the character to a specific user account.
  - name: name
    description: The name of the character as it appears in-game, used for identification
      and display purposes.
  - name: gender
    description: The gender of the character, typically represented as 0 for male
      and 1 for female.
  - name: race
    description: The race of the character, defined by a numeric value corresponding
      to game races (e.g., Human = 1, Orc = 2).
  - name: playerClass
    description: The class of the character, represented as a numeric identifier (e.g.,
      Warrior = 1, Mage = 8).
  - name: level
    description: The current level of the character, ranging from 1 to the maximum
      level supported by the game.
  - name: isDeleted
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the character has been marked for
      deletion; true if deleted, false otherwise.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a New Character to Cache
    code: CharacterCache::AddCharacterCacheEntry(123456, 789012, "Aelarion", 1, 2,
      8, 60, false);
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding a Deleted Character to Cache
    code: CharacterCache::AddCharacterCacheEntry(987654, 321098, "Thrain", 0, 1, 1,
      10, true);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the in-memory character cache directly. It should only
    be called when character data is confirmed to be valid and synchronized with the
    database. The cache may have a limited size, so frequent additions could lead
    to eviction of older entries.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID provided is unique and not already present in the
    cache to avoid overwriting existing data. Incorrectly setting the isDeleted flag
    can result in inconsistent character states during gameplay.
