  signature: void Map::RemoveUpdateObject(Object * obj)
documentation:
  brief: Removes an object from the map's update queue
  description: This method removes a specified Object from the Map's update queue,
    ensuring that the object is no longer processed for updates. It is typically used
    when an object needs to be removed from the world, such as during player logout
    or when an object is destroyed. The method handles the removal of the object from
    the map's internal update list and ensures proper cleanup of associated resources.
  parameters:
  - name: obj
    description: Pointer to the Object that should be removed from the update queue.
      This object must be valid and have been previously added to the map's update
      queue.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Map* map = new Map();

      Object* obj = new Object();

      map->RemoveUpdateObject(obj);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method ensures thread safety by locking the update queue before removing
    the object. It is important to note that this method does not delete the object
    itself, but only removes it from the update queue.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to memory leaks or invalid memory
    access if the object is still referenced after removal. Always ensure that objects
    are properly removed from the update queue before deletion.
