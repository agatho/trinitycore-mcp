  method: PerformGarbageCollection
  signature: void BotMemoryManager::PerformGarbageCollection()
documentation:
  brief: Performs memory cleanup operations on bot-related data structures to free
    unused resources and prevent memory leaks.
  description: The PerformGarbageCollection method is responsible for cleaning up
    unused or stale data associated with AI bots within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method typically iterates through internal bot memory pools, identifies orphaned
    or expired bot references, and releases their allocated memory back to the system.
    It helps maintain optimal performance by preventing memory bloat that could occur
    over time as bots are created, used, and destroyed during gameplay. The garbage
    collection process may involve checking bot states, removing inactive bots from
    memory, and cleaning up temporary data structures that are no longer needed. This
    method is usually invoked periodically or upon specific events such as server
    shutdown or bot manager reinitialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Garbage Collection Call
    code: 'BotMemoryManager* memoryManager = BotMemoryManager::Instance();

      memoryManager->PerformGarbageCollection();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called sparingly in performance-critical sections as
    it may involve iterating through large data structures. It's typically designed
    to be thread-safe but may require synchronization if accessed from multiple threads
    simultaneously.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently can cause performance degradation due
    to the overhead of scanning and cleaning memory pools. Avoid calling it during
    high-frequency bot update cycles or in time-sensitive operations.
