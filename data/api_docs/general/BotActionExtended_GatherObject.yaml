  class: BotActionExtended
  method: GatherObject
  signature: BotActionExtended BotActionExtended::GatherObject(int bot, int object,
    uint32 spellId, uint32 skillId, uint32 skillRequired, uint32 timestamp)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a bot to gather a specific object using the specified spell and
    skill requirements.
  description: The GatherObject method is used to instruct a bot to perform gathering
    actions on a specified object within the game world. It requires the bot's identifier,
    the object to be gathered, the spell ID for the gathering action, and associated
    skill information including required skill level and timestamp. This method is
    typically used in bot AI systems to automate resource gathering tasks such as
    mining, herbalism, or skinning. The method returns a BotActionExtended object
    that represents the initiated gathering action.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: The unique identifier of the bot that will perform the gathering
      action.
  - name: object
    description: The unique identifier of the game object to be gathered (e.g., a
      mining node or herbalism plant).
  - name: spellId
    description: The spell ID that corresponds to the gathering action the bot will
      use.
  - name: skillId
    description: The skill ID associated with the gathering profession (e.g., Mining,
      Herbalism).
  - name: skillRequired
    description: The minimum skill level required to successfully gather the object.
  - name: timestamp
    description: A timestamp value used to track when the gathering action was initiated.
  returns: Returns a BotActionExtended object representing the initiated gathering
    action. This object can be used to track or modify the bot's gathering behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of GatherObject
    code: BotActionExtended action = botAction.GatherObject(12345, 67890, 3564, 164,
      150, 1678886400);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GatherObject with Skill Requirements
    code: 'uint32 timestamp = time(nullptr);

      BotActionExtended action = botAction.GatherObject(botId, objectId, 2366, 129,
      200, timestamp);

      // The bot will attempt to mine a node using the Mining skill at level 200'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore bot AI system and assumes that the
    bot has been properly initialized with necessary resources and permissions. The
    spell ID must correspond to a valid gathering spell in the game database.
  warnings: Incorrect skill IDs or spell IDs may cause the bot to fail its gathering
    attempt. Ensure that all parameters are validated before calling this method,
    especially when dealing with dynamic content or user input.
