documentation:
  brief: Deletes a game object from the database using its spawn ID
  description: The DeleteFromDB method removes a GameObject instance from the database
    based on its spawn ID, which uniquely identifies the object's position in the
    world. This method is typically used during object destruction or removal operations
    where the object needs to be completely eliminated from the game world database.
    The operation involves removing all associated records from various tables including
    the gameobject table and related data structures. This method should only be called
    when the GameObject is no longer needed in the world, as it will prevent any further
    interaction with this specific object.
  parameters:
  - name: spawnId
    description: The unique identifier that represents the spawn position of the game
      object in the database. This ID corresponds to the 'spawnId' field in the database
      tables and is used to locate and delete the specific object record.
  returns: Returns true if the deletion operation was successful, false otherwise.
    The method may return false if the specified spawn ID does not exist in the database
    or if there are issues with the database transaction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "GameObject* go = new GameObject();\n\n// Assuming go has been initialized\
      \ and is valid\nif (go->DeleteFromDB(12345)) {\n    // Object successfully deleted\
      \ from database\n    // Proceed with further logic\n}\nelse {\n    // Deletion\
      \ failed, handle error accordingly\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it permanently removes the object
    from the database. It is recommended to ensure that all references to this object
    are cleared before calling this method. The operation may involve multiple database
    transactions and could impact performance if called frequently.
  warnings: Calling this method without properly managing object references can lead
    to dangling pointers or memory corruption. Additionally, this method should not
    be used during active gameplay scenarios where the object might still be referenced
    by players or other game entities.
