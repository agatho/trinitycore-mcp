documentation:
  brief: Destroys an arena team object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ArenaTeam destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    and resources allocated to an arena team instance. When an ArenaTeam object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted, this destructor ensures that all internal
    data structures, player references, and associated memory are properly freed.
    This method is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime during object destruction
    and should not be called manually. The destructor handles cleanup of team members,
    statistics, and any temporary data related to the arena team's existence in the
    game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction of ArenaTeam
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    ArenaTeam* team = new ArenaTeam();\n    //\
      \ ... use the arena team ...\n    delete team; // Destructor called here automatically\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor performs critical cleanup operations including removing references
    from internal tracking systems and freeing memory allocated for team data. It
    is important to note that this destructor should only be invoked through proper
    object lifecycle management, not directly.
