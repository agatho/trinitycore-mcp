  signature: void LootCoordination::HandleCoordinationError(uint32 sessionId, const
    std::string & error)
documentation:
  brief: Handles loot coordination errors by processing session ID and error message
    for proper client communication.
  description: The HandleCoordinationError method is responsible for managing and
    responding to errors that occur during loot coordination processes within the
    TrinityCore framework. It takes a session identifier and an error message string,
    then performs necessary actions to notify the client or system about the failure.
    This method plays a crucial role in maintaining proper game state synchronization
    when loot distribution fails, ensuring that players receive appropriate feedback
    and that internal systems can log or handle the error appropriately. The method
    is typically invoked when coordination logic encounters issues such as invalid
    session states, permission failures, or other runtime errors during loot assignment.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionId
    description: Unique identifier for the client session experiencing the coordination
      error. This value is used to route the error response back to the correct player
      or client connection.
  - name: error
    description: String containing the specific error message describing what went
      wrong during loot coordination. This message is typically formatted for client
      display and may include localization codes or technical details.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Error Handling Example
    code: LootCoordination::HandleCoordinationError(12345, "Invalid loot item requested");
    language: cpp
  - title: Error with Session Management
    code: 'uint32 currentSession = player->GetSession()->GetAccountId();

      LootCoordination::HandleCoordinationError(currentSession, "Loot coordination
      timed out");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the loot coordination system that manages distributed
    loot assignment in group scenarios. It's designed to be thread-safe and should
    not block execution for extended periods. The implementation likely involves sending
    error packets to the client and may trigger cleanup operations for failed loot
    assignments.
  warnings: Ensure that session IDs are valid before calling this method, as invalid
    sessions could cause undefined behavior or crashes. The error message string should
    be properly sanitized to prevent potential security issues in client communication.
