  signature: void BotLocalHostileCache::InvalidateCache()
documentation:
  brief: Clears all cached hostile target data for bot instances
  description: The InvalidateCache method removes all stored hostile target information
    from the BotLocalHostileCache instance. This forces the bot to re-evaluate and
    rebuild its cache of hostile entities when next queried, ensuring that stale or
    outdated hostile target data is not used during AI decision-making processes.
    The method is typically called when significant changes occur in the game environment
    that might affect hostile target validity, such as zone transitions, combat state
    changes, or when bots need to refresh their awareness of nearby enemies.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cache Invalidation
    code: 'BotLocalHostileCache cache;

      cache.InvalidateCache(); // Clears all cached hostile targets'
    language: cpp
  - title: Cache Invalidation During Combat State Change
    code: "void OnCombatStateChanged(Unit* unit, bool inCombat) {\n    if (!inCombat)\
      \ {\n        // Clear cache when exiting combat to refresh hostile targets\n\
      \        bot->GetHostileCache()->InvalidateCache();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs an immediate cache clear operation and should be used
    judiciously as it may cause temporary performance overhead during subsequent hostile
    target evaluations. The cache invalidation is thread-safe and can be called from
    any thread context.
  warnings: Calling InvalidateCache frequently in rapid succession may cause performance
    degradation due to repeated cache rebuilds. Avoid calling this method in tight
    loops or high-frequency update contexts without proper throttling mechanisms.
