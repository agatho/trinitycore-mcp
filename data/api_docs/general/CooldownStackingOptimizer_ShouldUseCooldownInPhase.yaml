  class: CooldownStackingOptimizer
  method: ShouldUseCooldownInPhase
  signature: bool CooldownStackingOptimizer::ShouldUseCooldownInPhase(uint32 spellId,
    BossPhase phase) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a cooldown spell should be used based on the current boss
    phase.
  description: The ShouldUseCooldownInPhase method evaluates if a specific cooldown
    spell is appropriate to use given the current phase of a boss encounter. This
    method likely considers phase-specific rules, cooldown timing, and encounter mechanics
    to make this determination. It is typically used by AI systems or script logic
    to optimize spell usage during boss fights. The method takes into account both
    the spell ID and the current boss phase to decide whether using the cooldown would
    be beneficial or detrimental to the encounter strategy.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell being evaluated for cooldown usage.
      This should correspond to a valid spell in the game's database.
  - name: phase
    description: The current boss phase identifier that determines the context for
      cooldown evaluation. Phases typically represent different stages or mechanics
      of a boss encounter.
  returns: Returns true if the cooldown spell should be used in the specified boss
    phase, false otherwise. The decision is based on internal logic that considers
    phase-specific rules and cooldown optimization strategies.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check cooldown eligibility
    code: "if (optimizer->ShouldUseCooldownInPhase(12345, BossPhase::PHASE_1)) {\n\
      \    // Use the cooldown spell\n    player->CastSpell(target, 12345, true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a boss encounter AI decision loop
    code: "void BossAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (ShouldUseCooldownInPhase(98765,\
      \ GetCurrentBossPhase())) {\n        DoCastVictim(98765);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger cooldown management system that tracks
    spell usage and timing. It may cache previous decisions or maintain internal state
    about cooldowns to avoid redundant calculations. The implementation probably relies
    on encounter phase definitions and spell cooldown data stored in the game's configuration.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId parameter corresponds to an actual cooldown spell
    in the game database, as invalid IDs may lead to unexpected behavior. The method
    assumes valid boss phase values; invalid phases might cause undefined behavior
    or incorrect decisions.
