    && param0)
documentation:
  brief: Moves an InstanceLockUpdateEvent object to another instance, transferring
    ownership of its resources.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment for the InstanceLockUpdateEvent
    class. It transfers all resources from the source object (rvalue reference) to
    the current object, leaving the source in a valid but unspecified state. This
    operation is typically used when assigning temporary or newly created InstanceLockUpdateEvent
    objects to existing variables. The move assignment ensures efficient resource
    management by avoiding unnecessary copying of internal data structures. In the
    context of TrinityCore's instance locking system, this method likely handles the
    transfer of lock state information between event objects during instance management
    operations.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to another InstanceLockUpdateEvent object whose
      resources will be moved to this object.
  returns: A reference to the current InstanceLockUpdateEvent object after the move
    assignment has been completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'InstanceLockUpdateEvent event1;

      InstanceLockUpdateEvent event2 = std::move(event1); // Uses operator=

      // event1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Function Context
    code: "InstanceLockUpdateEvent CreateEvent() {\n    return InstanceLockUpdateEvent();\
      \ // Move constructor/assignment used\n}\n\nvoid ProcessEvent() {\n    auto\
      \ event = CreateEvent(); // Move assignment to local variable\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the C++ move semantics implementation. The source
    object after move assignment should not be used in a meaningful way until it's
    reassigned. This operation is typically more efficient than copy assignment as
    it transfers ownership of resources rather than duplicating them.
  warnings: After performing a move assignment, the source object should not be accessed
    or used unless it is subsequently assigned to another value. Using the moved-from
    object can lead to undefined behavior if it contains invalid state.
