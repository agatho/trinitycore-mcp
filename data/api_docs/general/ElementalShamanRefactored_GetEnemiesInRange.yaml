  signature: uint32 ElementalShamanRefactored::GetEnemiesInRange(float range) const
documentation:
  brief: Counts the number of enemy units within a specified range of the Elemental
    Shaman.
  description: The GetEnemiesInRange method determines how many hostile targets are
    located within a given radius around the Elemental Shaman. This functionality
    is essential for AI decision-making processes, particularly when selecting appropriate
    spells or abilities that require nearby enemies to be effective. The method performs
    a spatial check using the internal game engine's collision detection system to
    identify all valid enemy units in range. It does not differentiate between enemy
    types (player characters, creatures, etc.) but rather counts all hostile entities
    within the specified distance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the total count of enemy units found
    within the defined range. A return value of zero indicates no enemies are present
    in range, while any positive integer reflects the actual number of enemies detected.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 enemyCount = shaman.GetEnemiesInRange(10.0f);\nif (enemyCount >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Execute area-of-effect spell\n    shaman.CastSpell(SPELL_CHAIN_LIGHTNING);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic Based on Enemy Count
    code: "uint32 enemiesInRange = shaman.GetEnemiesInRange(15.0f);\nswitch (enemiesInRange)\n\
      {\n    case 0:\n        // No enemies, move to next behavior\n        break;\n\
      \    case 1:\n        // Single target, cast single-target spell\n        shaman.CastSpell(SPELL_LIGHTNING_BOLT);\n\
      \        break;\n    default:\n        // Multiple enemies, use AoE spell\n\
      \        shaman.CastSpell(SPELL_EARTH_SHOCK);\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the game's internal spatial partitioning systems and
    may have performance implications when used in tight loops or with very large
    ranges. The range parameter is interpreted as a Euclidean distance from the Shaman's
    current position, not line-of-sight. The method returns immediately without blocking,
    making it suitable for real-time AI processing.
  warnings: The method does not account for obstacles or terrain that might block
    line of sight between the Elemental Shaman and potential enemies. Additionally,
    the returned count may include temporary or invisible units if they are within
    the specified range, which could lead to unexpected behavior in certain scenarios.
