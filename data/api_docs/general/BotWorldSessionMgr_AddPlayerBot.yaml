  class: BotWorldSessionMgr
  method: AddPlayerBot
  signature: bool BotWorldSessionMgr::AddPlayerBot(int playerGuid, uint32 masterAccountId)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a player bot to the world session manager using the specified player
    GUID and master account ID.
  description: The AddPlayerBot method is responsible for registering a new player
    bot within the TrinityCore server's world session management system. It takes
    a player GUID and a master account ID as inputs, validates them, and integrates
    the bot into the session manager's internal data structures. This allows the bot
    to be managed alongside regular player sessions, enabling features such as automated
    gameplay, AI-controlled characters, or testing scenarios. The method ensures proper
    initialization of the bot's session state and associates it with the correct account
    for authentication and access control purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player bot to be added. This
      value must correspond to a valid existing player in the database.
  - name: masterAccountId
    description: The account ID of the master user who owns or controls this player
      bot. Used for access control and session management purposes.
  returns: Returns true if the player bot was successfully added to the world session
    manager; otherwise, returns false if validation fails or if the bot could not
    be registered.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of AddPlayerBot
    code: "if (sBotWorldSessionMgr->AddPlayerBot(123456, 789012)) {\n    // Bot successfully\
      \ added\n    sLog->outString(\"Player bot added successfully.\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Failed to add the bot\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to add player bot.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided GUID and account ID are valid and exist
    in the database. It may perform internal checks for duplicate entries or invalid
    states. The session manager maintains a collection of all active bots, which can
    be accessed via other methods like GetPlayerBot() or GetAllBots().
  warnings: Ensure that the playerGuid corresponds to an actual player entry in the
    database; otherwise, the method will likely fail. Also, be cautious when assigning
    master account IDs, as incorrect values may lead to unauthorized access or session
    mismanagement.
