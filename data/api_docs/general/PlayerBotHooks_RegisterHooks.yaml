  method: RegisterHooks
  signature: void PlayerBotHooks::RegisterHooks()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and registers all player bot-related hooks for event handling
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The RegisterHooks method sets up and registers all necessary event
    hooks required for player bot functionality in TrinityCore. This method is typically
    called during the initialization phase of the player bot system to ensure that
    all relevant game events are properly intercepted and processed by bot logic.
    It establishes the connection between core game systems and bot behavior modules,
    enabling bots to respond appropriately to various in-game triggers such as combat
    events, movement changes, or interaction with NPCs. The method ensures that the
    bot system is fully integrated into the game's event-driven architecture without
    requiring manual hook registration for each individual event.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Hook Registration
    code: 'PlayerBotHooks hooks;

      hooks.RegisterHooks();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization of the player
    bot subsystem. Re-registering hooks may lead to duplicate event handlers or memory
    leaks. The registration process is typically handled automatically by the core
    bot manager, but this method allows explicit control when needed.
  warnings: Calling RegisterHooks multiple times can result in duplicate event handlers
    and undefined behavior. Ensure that this method is invoked only once during system
    initialization to avoid conflicts with existing hook registrations.
