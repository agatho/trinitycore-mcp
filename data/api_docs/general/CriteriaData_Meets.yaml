  class: CriteriaData
  method: Meets
  signature: bool CriteriaData::Meets(uint32 criteriaId, const Player * source, const
    WorldObject * target, uint32 miscValue1, uint32 miscValue2) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether specified criteria are met by a player based on given conditions.
  description: The CriteriaData::Meets method determines if a specific criterion defined
    in the criteria data is satisfied by a player under certain circumstances. It
    takes into account various factors such as the player's current state, the target
    object involved, and additional miscellaneous values that may affect the evaluation.
    This method is typically used within the context of achievement tracking, quest
    progression, or other game mechanics where specific conditions must be validated.
    The method performs internal checks against predefined criteria rules to return
    a boolean result indicating success or failure of the condition check.
  parameters:
  - name: criteriaId
    description: The unique identifier for the specific criterion being evaluated.
      This ID maps to a defined criteria entry in the game's database.
  - name: source
    description: Pointer to the Player object that is being checked against the criteria.
      This represents the entity performing the action or meeting the condition.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that may be involved in the criteria evaluation.
      Can be NULL if not applicable to the specific criterion.
  - name: miscValue1
    description: An optional miscellaneous value used for additional context during
      criteria evaluation. Its meaning depends on the specific criteria type and can
      represent things like item count, spell ID, or other game-specific data.
  - name: miscValue2
    description: A second optional miscellaneous value that provides further detail
      to the criteria check. Often used in conjunction with miscValue1 for complex
      criterion definitions.
  returns: Returns true if the specified criteria is met under the given conditions,
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Criteria Check
    code: "if (criteriaData.Meets(12345, player, nullptr, 0, 0)) {\n    // Criteria\
      \ 12345 is met\n    player->SendNotification(\"Criteria completed!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Criteria Check with Target
    code: "if (criteriaData.Meets(67890, player, mobTarget, 1, 5)) {\n    // Criteria\
      \ 67890 is met when player interacts with mobTarget\n    // miscValue1 = 1 indicates\
      \ type of interaction, miscValue2 = 5 indicates quantity\n    player->KilledMonsterCredit(12345);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly invoked during event handling or achievement updates.
    It relies on internal criterion definitions stored in the database and should
    only be called when all required parameters are valid. The method does not modify
    any game state directly; it solely evaluates conditions.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null, as passing an invalid pointer may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    Also, make sure that the criteriaId corresponds to an existing criterion definition
    in the database.
