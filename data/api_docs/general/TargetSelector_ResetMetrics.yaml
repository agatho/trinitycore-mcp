  signature: void TargetSelector::ResetMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all internal metrics and counters used by the TargetSelector for tracking
    target selection behavior.
  description: The ResetMetrics method clears all accumulated statistics and performance
    data within the TargetSelector class. This includes resetting counters for successful
    and failed target selections, timing measurements, and any other internal tracking
    mechanisms that monitor the selector's behavior over time. The method is typically
    invoked when resetting the AI state or during performance profiling to ensure
    clean measurement conditions. It does not affect the selector's configuration
    or current target selection logic, only the accumulated metrics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resetting Target Selector Metrics
    code: 'TargetSelector selector;

      // ... perform target selection operations ...

      selector.ResetMetrics(); // Reset all internal statistics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before starting performance measurements or
    when resetting AI state to ensure accurate metric reporting. The reset operation
    is thread-safe and does not interfere with active target selection processes.
