documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the PlayerbotDatabaseManager
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the PlayerbotDatabaseManager
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the database manager exists throughout
    the application lifecycle. This method is used to access the global database interface
    for player bot-related data operations. The returned pointer should be used directly
    without attempting to delete or manage its lifetime, as it is managed internally
    by the singleton implementation. This is essential for maintaining consistent
    database access across different parts of the player bot system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single global instance of PlayerbotDatabaseManager. The
    method never returns NULL as the singleton is guaranteed to be initialized during
    application startup.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the database manager
    code: "PlayerbotDatabaseManager* db = PlayerbotDatabaseManager::instance();\n\
      // Use db for database operations\nstd::string query = \"SELECT * FROM playerbots\
      \ WHERE guid = 12345\";\nif (db->ExecuteQuery(query)) {\n    // Process results\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it's implemented using the Meyers singleton
    pattern which is inherently safe in C++11 and later. The instance is created on
    first access, ensuring lazy initialization. Developers should not attempt to create
    additional instances of PlayerbotDatabaseManager as this would violate the singleton
    contract.
  warnings: Do not delete or attempt to manage the lifetime of the returned pointer.
    Never call new or delete on the result of this method. Be cautious when using
    this in multi-threaded contexts where database operations might conflict, though
    the singleton itself is thread-safe.
