documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a talent loadout for the specified class and specialization at
    the given level.
  description: The GetTalentLoadout method fetches a pre-defined talent build (talent
    loadout) for a specific player class and specialization at a particular level.
    This is used by the bot system to determine which talents should be selected for
    automated gameplay. The method typically accesses internal data structures that
    store predefined talent configurations for different class/spec combinations,
    ensuring bots can make informed decisions about talent allocation based on their
    role and level. It's important to note that this method returns a const pointer
    to avoid modification of the loadout data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to a TalentLoadout object representing the predefined
    talents for the specified class, specialization, and level. Returns nullptr if
    no matching loadout is found for the given parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve a Mage Fire Specialization Loadout at Level 60
    code: "const TalentLoadout* fireLoadout = botTalentManager->GetTalentLoadout(CLASS_MAGE,\
      \ SPEC_MAGE_FIRE, 60);\nif (fireLoadout)\n{\n    // Use the loadout for bot\
      \ talent allocation\n    // Process talents in fireLoadout->talents\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using a lookup table or map structure that
    maps class, spec, and level combinations to predefined talent builds. The returned
    pointer should not be modified as it points to const data. Performance-wise, this
    operation should be fast since it's typically backed by hash maps or similar efficient
    data structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the class and specId parameters are valid values corresponding
    to existing classes and specializations in TrinityCore. Using invalid combinations
    may result in a nullptr return value, which could lead to crashes if not properly
    checked. The returned pointer is only valid during the lifetime of the BotTalentManager
    instance.
