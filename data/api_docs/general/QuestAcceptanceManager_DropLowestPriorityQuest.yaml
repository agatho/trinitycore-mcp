documentation:
  brief: Removes the lowest priority quest from the player's active quest list.
  description: The DropLowestPriorityQuest method is responsible for removing the
    quest with the lowest priority level from a player's active quest log. This functionality
    is typically invoked when the player's quest log reaches its maximum capacity
    and a new quest needs to be accepted, requiring the removal of an existing quest
    to make space. The method evaluates all active quests based on their assigned
    priority levels and eliminates the one with the lowest value. This mechanism helps
    maintain quest management efficiency within the game's quest system by ensuring
    that players do not exceed the allowed number of concurrent quests.

  - title: Basic Usage in Quest Acceptance Flow
    code: "void HandleQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    QuestAcceptanceManager\
      \ manager(player);\n    if (player->GetQuestSlotCount() >= MAX_QUEST_LOG_SIZE)\n\
      \    {\n        manager.DropLowestPriorityQuest();\n    }\n    // Proceed with\
      \ adding new quest\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player's quest log is full and
    a new quest is about to be added. The priority levels of quests are usually determined
    by quest flags, quest level requirements, or other game-specific criteria. The
    implementation may vary depending on how priorities are assigned within the TrinityCore
    codebase.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking if the quest log is full may result
    in unintended removal of important quests. Ensure that proper validation is performed
    before invoking this method to avoid disrupting player progress or quest completion.
