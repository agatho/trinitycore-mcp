documentation:
  brief: Generates a path for quest objectives based on player data and objective
    configuration
  description: The GenerateObjectivePath method calculates and returns a navigation
    path for a bot player to complete a specific quest objective. This method is typically
    used in AI-driven quest completion systems where the bot needs to determine the
    optimal route or sequence of actions to fulfill quest requirements. The method
    takes into account the current state of the player, available quest data, and
    objective-specific parameters to compute a valid path. It serves as a core component
    in automated quest progression logic within TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft
    servers.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character that
      will execute the quest objective
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to QuestObjectiveData containing configuration and data
      for the specific quest objective to be completed
  returns: 'Integer value representing the success status of path generation: 0 for
    successful path creation, negative values for errors (e.g., -1 for invalid parameters,
    -2 for path not found), positive values for warnings or alternative outcomes'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Objective Path Generation
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Get bot player\nQuestObjectiveData objective = ...;\
      \ // Initialize quest objective data\nint result = bot->GetQuestCompletion()->GenerateObjectivePath(bot,\
      \ objective);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Path successfully generated\n    //\
      \ Proceed with quest execution\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling for Path Generation
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nQuestObjectiveData objective = ...;\nint result = bot->GetQuestCompletion()->GenerateObjectivePath(bot,\
      \ objective);\nswitch (result) {\n    case 0:\n        // Success - path generated\n\
      \        break;\n    case -1:\n        // Invalid parameters provided\n    \
      \    sLog->outError(\"Invalid quest objective data\");\n        break;\n   \
      \ case -2:\n        // Path not found or cannot be computed\n        sLog->outError(\"\
      Could not generate path for objective\");\n        break;\n    default:\n  \
      \      // Other error conditions\n        sLog->outError(\"Unknown error in\
      \ path generation: %d\", result);\n}"

  notes: This method is part of the automated quest completion system and relies on
    accurate quest objective data. The path generation algorithm may involve complex
    calculations including waypoint determination, NPC interaction sequences, and
    item collection routes. Performance considerations include caching previously
    computed paths to avoid redundant calculations.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input parameters; passing null pointers or malformed
    quest objective data will likely result in undefined behavior or errors. Developers
    should ensure that the QuestObjectiveData structure is properly initialized before
    calling this method. The returned path may not always be optimal for all scenarios,
    particularly when dealing with dynamic world conditions.
