  class: Battleground
  method: AddPlayerPosition
  signature: void Battleground::AddPlayerPosition(const WorldPackets::Battleground::BattlegroundPlayerPosition
    & position)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a player's position to the battleground for tracking and synchronization
    purposes.
  description: The AddPlayerPosition method is used to register or update a player's
    current position within a battleground instance. This method is typically invoked
    when a player moves or changes location during gameplay, ensuring that the battleground
    system maintains accurate positional data for all players. The position data includes
    coordinates and potentially orientation information, which are essential for various
    battleground mechanics such as scoring, objective tracking, and player-to-player
    interactions. This method plays a critical role in maintaining synchronization
    between client and server state during active battleground sessions.
  parameters:
  - name: position
    description: A reference to a WorldPackets::Battleground::BattlegroundPlayerPosition
      packet containing the player's current coordinates, orientation, and other positional
      data within the battleground.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Battleground Update Loop
    code: "void MyBattleground::UpdatePlayerPosition(Player* player)\n{\n    WorldPackets::Battleground::BattlegroundPlayerPosition\
      \ pos;\n    pos.Position = player->GetPosition();\n    pos.Orientation = player->GetOrientation();\n\
      \    AddPlayerPosition(pos);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Movement Handler
    code: "void Battleground::OnPlayerMove(Player* player)\n{\n    if (IsArena() ||\
      \ IsBattleground())\n    {\n        WorldPackets::Battleground::BattlegroundPlayerPosition\
      \ pos;\n        pos.Position = player->GetPosition();\n        pos.Orientation\
      \ = player->GetOrientation();\n        AddPlayerPosition(pos);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the battleground's update loop
    or movement handlers. It assumes that the provided position data is valid and
    properly formatted according to the WorldPackets::Battleground::BattlegroundPlayerPosition
    structure. The method does not perform any validation on the input data, so it
    should be ensured that the position values are within acceptable bounds for the
    battleground's map.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method can lead to incorrect player positioning
    in battlegrounds, potentially causing issues with scoring, objective capture,
    or player interaction. Ensure that this method is only called when a player is
    actually inside an active battleground and not during loading or transition states.
