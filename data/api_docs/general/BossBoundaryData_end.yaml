documentation:
  brief: Returns a const iterator pointing to the end of the boss boundary data collection.
  description: The end() method provides access to a const iterator that points to
    the position just past the last element in the BossBoundaryData collection. This
    is a standard container method used for iterating through the data structure using
    range-based loops or traditional iterator-based approaches. The returned iterator
    should not be dereferenced as it points beyond the valid range of elements. This
    method is typically used in conjunction with begin() to define a range for iteration
    over the boundary data associated with a boss encounter.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const_iterator pointing to the position after the last element in the
    BossBoundaryData collection, suitable for use in range-based loops or iterator
    comparisons.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Iteration Example
    code: "for (const auto& boundary : bossBoundaryData)\n{\n    // Process each boundary\
      \ data entry\n    std::cout << \"Boundary: \" << boundary.first << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Iterator Usage
    code: "auto it = bossBoundaryData.begin();\nwhile (it != bossBoundaryData.end())\n\
      {\n    // Process current element\n    ++it;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is const-qualified, meaning it does not modify the BossBoundaryData
    object. It's designed for read-only access to iterate through boundary data during
    boss encounter handling in TrinityCore's AI and game logic systems.
