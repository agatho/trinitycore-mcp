documentation:
  brief: Destroys a RogueAI instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The RogueAI destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up all
    resources allocated during the lifetime of a RogueAI object. This includes releasing
    any dynamically allocated memory, resetting internal state variables, and ensuring
    that no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur. In the context of TrinityCore's
    AI system, this destructor ensures that when a rogue NPC using this AI behavior
    is removed from the world, all associated AI data structures are safely destroyed
    without leaving behind any residual references. The destruction process typically
    involves calling base class destructors and performing any necessary cleanup operations
    specific to the rogue AI implementation.

  - title: Automatic Destruction via Scope Exit
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    RogueAI* rogueAI = new RogueAI();\n    //\
      \ ... use rogueAI ...\n    delete rogueAI; // Triggers ~RogueAI()\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: RAII Pattern with Smart Pointers
    code: "#include <memory>\n\nvoid ExampleFunction()\n{\n    auto rogueAI = std::make_unique<RogueAI>();\n\
      \    // ... use rogueAI ...\n    // ~RogueAI() automatically called when unique_ptr\
      \ goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted. It's important to ensure that no virtual functions are
    called from within the destructor, as the object's vtable may already be partially
    destroyed. Additionally, any cleanup performed in this destructor should be fast
    and not block other operations.
  warnings: Avoid calling virtual functions from within the destructor as they may
    lead to undefined behavior due to incomplete object state. Also, never call delete
    on an object that has already been destroyed or is being destroyed by a parent
    class.
