  class: SocialManager
  method: GetGuild
  signature: Guild * SocialManager::GetGuild() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the guild instance associated with the social manager.
  description: The GetGuild method returns a pointer to the Guild object that is managed
    by this SocialManager instance. This method provides access to the guild data
    and functionality for players within the social system. The returned pointer may
    be null if no guild has been assigned or if the guild has been destroyed. This
    method is typically used in the context of player social interactions, such as
    retrieving guild information for display or performing guild-related operations.
    The SocialManager class maintains a reference to a single guild instance, which
    represents the player's current guild membership.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Guild object if the social manager is associated with
    a guild, or nullptr if no guild is assigned or the guild has been destroyed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Guild* guild = socialManager->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    std::string\
      \ guildName = guild->GetName();\n    // Use guild information\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Guild Membership
    code: "SocialManager* socialManager = player->GetSocial();\nGuild* guild = socialManager->GetGuild();\n\
      if (guild && guild->GetId() == playerGuildId)\n{\n    // Player is a member\
      \ of the expected guild\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation or synchronization checks on
    the returned Guild pointer. The caller should ensure that the SocialManager instance
    is valid and that the underlying guild data has not been modified or destroyed
    by concurrent operations. In a multi-threaded environment, access to the returned
    Guild pointer should be properly synchronized.
  warnings: The returned Guild pointer may be null, so always check for nullptr before
    dereferencing. Additionally, the Guild object pointed to may become invalid if
    the guild is disbanded or deleted while the pointer is in use, leading to undefined
    behavior if not properly handled.
