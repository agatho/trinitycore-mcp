  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related checks
    to determine the type of attack being performed. It's important to note that this
    method may not be directly available in all contexts, as it depends on how the
    SpellInfo class is implemented within TrinityCore.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in combination with other
    spell type checks, as some spells might have overlapping classifications. Also,
    ensure that the spell information being checked has been properly initialized
    before calling this method.
