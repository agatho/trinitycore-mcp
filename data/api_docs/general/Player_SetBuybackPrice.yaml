api:
  class: Player
  method: SetBuybackPrice
  signature: void Player::SetBuybackPrice(uint32 slot, uint32 price)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the buyback price for an item in a specific slot.
  description: This method allows setting the buyback price for an item located in
    a specified inventory slot. The buyback price determines how much gold the player
    will receive when selling an item back to a vendor. This functionality is crucial
    for managing item sell prices and ensuring proper game mechanics during vendor
    transactions. The method operates on the player's inventory slot, where slot represents
    the position of the item in the inventory and price represents the amount of gold
    to be set as the buyback value.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The inventory slot position where the item is located. Valid values
      are 0-18, representing different inventory slots including bag slots, equipped
      items, and other inventory positions.
  - name: price
    description: The amount of gold to set as the buyback price for the item in the
      specified slot. This value must be a valid uint32 representing the gold amount,
      typically ranging from 0 to 999999999.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Buyback Price for an Equipment Item
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetBuybackPrice(15, 1000);

      // Sets the buyback price of item in slot 15 to 1000 gold'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method directly modifies the player's buyback data structure. It should
    be used carefully as it affects how items are handled during vendor interactions.
    The implementation relies on internal player data structures that store buyback
    information for each inventory slot.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect buyback prices being
    set, which may cause issues with vendor transactions and item selling behavior.
    Care must be taken when setting the price value to ensure it matches valid gold
    amounts.
