  class: AnyFriendlyUnitInObjectRangeCheck
  method: AnyFriendlyUnitInObjectRangeCheck
  signature: void AnyFriendlyUnitInObjectRangeCheck::AnyFriendlyUnitInObjectRangeCheck(const
    int * obj, const int * funit, float range, bool playerOnly, bool incOwnRadius,
    bool incTargetRadius)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a check for any friendly unit within a specified range of an
    object or unit.
  description: The AnyFriendlyUnitInObjectRangeCheck constructor initializes a predicate
    object used to determine whether there are any friendly units (players or creatures)
    within a given radius of a specified target. This class is typically used in AI
    logic and targeting systems to evaluate proximity conditions for friendly entities.
    The check can be configured to include or exclude the caster's own radius, the
    target's radius, and can optionally restrict results to player units only. This
    functionality is essential for spell targeting, AI decision-making, and proximity-based
    gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: obj
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the object or unit to check range
      against. This could be a GameObject, Creature, or Player GUID.
  - name: funit
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the friendly unit to check for
      proximity to obj. This is typically a pointer to a Unit's GUID.
  - name: range
    description: Float value specifying the maximum distance (in yards) within which
      to search for friendly units.
  - name: playerOnly
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to restrict results to player units
      only. If true, only players are considered; if false, both players and creatures
      are included.
  - name: incOwnRadius
    description: Boolean flag determining whether to include the caster's own radius
      in the range calculation. If true, the caster's collision radius is added to
      the range.
  - name: incTargetRadius
    description: Boolean flag determining whether to include the target's radius in
      the range calculation. If true, the target's collision radius is added to the
      range.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage for Friendly Unit Check
    code: "#include \"Unit.h\"\n#include \"Object.h\"\n\nvoid ExampleFunction(Unit*\
      \ caster, Unit* target) {\n    float range = 10.0f;\n    bool playerOnly = false;\n\
      \    bool incOwnRadius = true;\n    bool incTargetRadius = true;\n    \n   \
      \ AnyFriendlyUnitInObjectRangeCheck checker(&target->GetGUID(), &caster->GetGUID(),\
      \ range, playerOnly, incOwnRadius, incTargetRadius);\n    // Use checker in\
      \ a condition or with a container\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Player-Only Friendly Unit Check
    code: "#include \"Unit.h\"\n#include \"Object.h\"\n\nvoid ExampleFunction(Unit*\
      \ caster, GameObject* target) {\n    float range = 25.0f;\n    bool playerOnly\
      \ = true; // Only players\n    bool incOwnRadius = false;\n    bool incTargetRadius\
      \ = false;\n    \n    AnyFriendlyUnitInObjectRangeCheck checker(&target->GetGUID(),\
      \ &caster->GetGUID(), range, playerOnly, incOwnRadius, incTargetRadius);\n \
      \   // This would be used to find nearby players only\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This class is commonly used in AI decision-making systems and spell targeting
    logic. The range calculation includes the radius of both objects when applicable,
    which can affect the effective detection distance. The implementation uses TrinityCore's
    internal object positioning system for accurate distance calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUIDs passed to obj and funit are valid and represent
    existing objects in the world. Passing invalid or null pointers may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Be cautious when using incOwnRadius and incTargetRadius flags
    as they can significantly alter the effective range of detection.
