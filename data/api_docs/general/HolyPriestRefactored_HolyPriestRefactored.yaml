documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Holy Priest AI bot with the specified player character.
  description: The HolyPriestRefactored constructor initializes a new instance of
    the HolyPriestRefactored AI class, setting up internal state and configuration
    for a Holy Priest bot. This method prepares the bot for gameplay by configuring
    its behavior patterns, spell selection, and combat strategies specific to the
    Holy Priest class in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment. The initialization
    process includes setting up target acquisition logic, spell cooldown tracking,
    and resource management systems tailored for Holy Priest gameplay mechanics such
    as mana efficiency and healing prioritization.

  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Player* bot = new Player();

      HolyPriestRefactored priestBot(bot);

      // The HolyPriestRefactored AI is now ready for use in the game world'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The Player
    parameter must be a valid, initialized player object with proper character data
    loaded. The method assumes that the TrinityCore AI framework has been properly
    initialized before calling.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor multiple times on the same bot instance as
    it may lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks. Ensure that the Player pointer
    is valid and points to an existing, properly configured player object before initialization.
