documentation:
  brief: Validates whether the quest event object is in a consistent and usable state
  description: The IsValid method checks if the QuestEvent object has been properly
    initialized and contains valid data. It ensures that all internal references are
    intact and that the event can safely be used in game logic operations. This validation
    is particularly important for quest events that may have been created from external
    sources or loaded from database storage, where data integrity cannot be guaranteed
    at creation time. The method performs checks on internal state variables and object
    references to confirm they meet the requirements for safe operation within the
    TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the QuestEvent object is in a valid state and can be safely
    used; returns false if the object has been corrupted, improperly initialized,
    or contains invalid data that would cause errors during usage.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "QuestEvent* event = sObjectMgr->GetQuestEvent(12345);\nif (event && event->IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with quest event operations\n    event->Execute();\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle invalid event\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid quest event encountered\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in Quest Processing Loop
    code: "for (auto& event : questEvents) {\n    if (!event->IsValid()) {\n     \
      \   sLog->outError(\"Skipping invalid quest event %u\", event->GetId());\n \
      \       continue;\n    }\n    // Process valid events\n    event->Process();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs lightweight validation checks and should not be called
    excessively in performance-critical code paths. The validation typically includes
    checking for null pointers, verifying internal data structures, and ensuring that
    required fields are properly populated. In TrinityCore's architecture, quest events
    may be loaded from database entries or created dynamically, making this validation
    step essential for preventing runtime errors.
  warnings: Do not assume that a QuestEvent object is valid just because it was returned
    from a getter method. Always call IsValid() before performing operations on the
    event to prevent potential crashes or undefined behavior. Invalid events may result
    from corrupted database entries or failed initialization processes.
