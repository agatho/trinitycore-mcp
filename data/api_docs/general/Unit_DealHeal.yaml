  brief: DealHeal performs healing calculations and applies heal effects to target
    units
  description: The DealHeal method in TrinityCore's Unit class handles the processing
    of healing information for a unit, including calculating heal amounts and applying
    healing effects to targets. This method is crucial for managing healing mechanics
    within the game's combat system, ensuring proper healing application and damage
    calculation. It typically involves processing heal information through various
    internal mechanisms to determine actual healing values and apply them to target
    units. The method requires specific heal information parameters to be passed in,
    which contain details about the healing being performed.
  parameters:
  - name: healInfo
    description: A reference to HealInfo structure containing healing data including
      amount, spell type, and target information. This parameter defines how much
      healing should be applied and what type of healing it is.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Healing Application Example
    code: 'Unit* target = new Unit();

      HealInfo healInfo;

      healInfo.amount = 100;

      healInfo.spellType = SPELL_TYPE_HOLY;

      healInfo.target = target;


      // Apply healing to target

      unit->DealHeal(healInfo);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method internally handles healing calculations and applies healing effects,
    making it essential for proper healing mechanics. Implementation details include
    processing heal information through various game mechanics such as critical chance
    calculations, healing modifiers, and target-specific adjustments. Performance
    considerations are minimal but involve processing time for healing calculations.
  warnings: Improper handling of HealInfo parameters can lead to incorrect healing
    application or even crashes. Care should be taken when passing heal information
    to ensure proper initialization of the HealInfo structure before calling this
    method.
