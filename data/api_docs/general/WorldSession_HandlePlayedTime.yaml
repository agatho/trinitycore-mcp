documentation:
  brief: Sends the player's total played time to the client upon request.
  description: The HandlePlayedTime method is invoked when a client requests the player's
    total accumulated play time. This method retrieves the player's played time from
    the database and sends it back to the client using a specific packet format. It
    is part of the character management system in TrinityCore, ensuring that players
    can view their play time statistics within the game interface. The method does
    not require any parameters as the request data is contained within the incoming
    packet structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage when client requests played time
    code: "void WorldSession::HandlePlayedTime(WorldPackets::Character::RequestPlayedTime&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    uint32 totalTime = GetPlayer()->GetTotalPlayedTime();\n  \
      \  WorldPackets::Character::PlayedTime playedTimePacket;\n    playedTimePacket.TotalTime\
      \ = totalTime;\n    playedTimePacket.Level = GetPlayer()->getLevel();\n    SendPacket(playedTimePacket.Write());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the TrinityCore framework
    when a client sends a played time request packet. The actual implementation may
    vary depending on how the server handles player data persistence and retrieval.
