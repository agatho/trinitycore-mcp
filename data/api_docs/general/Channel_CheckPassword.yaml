documentation:
  brief: Checks if the provided password matches the channel's required password.
  description: The CheckPassword method verifies whether a given password matches
    the password set for the channel. This method is typically used when a player
    attempts to join a password-protected channel. It performs a comparison between
    the input password and the stored channel password, returning true if they match
    or false otherwise. The method does not modify any internal state of the channel
    object and is read-only in nature. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    this functionality supports secure channel access control for private and restricted
    communication channels.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the provided password matches the channel's stored password;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Password Verification
    code: "Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"MyPrivateChannel\", player);\n\
      if (channel && channel->CheckPassword(\"secret123\"))\n{\n    // Password matches,\
      \ allow access\n    channel->Join(player, \"secret123\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    //\
      \ Password incorrect\n    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Incorrect password.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple string comparison and does not implement any
    cryptographic hashing or salting. It's intended for basic access control rather
    than secure authentication. The method is thread-safe as it only reads from the
    channel's password field without modifying it.
  warnings: Do not use this method for security-critical operations beyond basic channel
    access control, as it performs plaintext string comparison. Also be aware that
    if a channel has no password set, this method may return true for any input or
    behave inconsistently depending on implementation details.
