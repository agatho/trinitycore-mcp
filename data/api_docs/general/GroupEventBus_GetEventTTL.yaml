  method: GetEventTTL
  signature: uint32 GroupEventBus::GetEventTTL() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the time-to-live (TTL) value for events in the group event bus.
  description: The GetEventTTL method returns the configured time-to-live duration,
    in seconds, for events published to the GroupEventBus. This TTL determines how
    long event data remains valid and accessible within the event system before being
    automatically cleaned up. The returned value represents the maximum lifetime of
    an event in the bus, ensuring that stale or outdated events do not persist indefinitely.
    This mechanism helps maintain performance and memory efficiency by preventing
    accumulation of obsolete event data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the time-to-live duration in seconds for events
    stored in the group event bus. A value of 0 typically indicates that events have
    no expiration or that TTL is disabled.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Log Event TTL
    code: 'uint32 ttl = groupEventBus.GetEventTTL();

      TC_LOG_INFO("group", "Group event bus TTL: {} seconds", ttl);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Validate Event TTL Configuration
    code: "uint32 ttl = groupEventBus.GetEventTTL();\nif (ttl == 0)\n{\n    TC_LOG_WARN(\"\
      group\", \"Group event bus has no TTL configured\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      group\", \"Event TTL is set to {} seconds\", ttl);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The TTL value is typically configured via server settings or runtime parameters.
    This method is thread-safe and can be called from any context where the GroupEventBus
    instance is accessible. The actual cleanup of expired events may occur asynchronously
    based on internal scheduling mechanisms.
  warnings: Be cautious when relying on TTL values for critical event handling logic,
    as the exact timing of cleanup may vary. Events with zero TTL should be handled
    carefully as they may persist indefinitely unless manually removed.
