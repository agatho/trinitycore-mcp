documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific movement flag is set within the MovementInfo object.
  description: The HasMovementFlag method determines whether a particular movement
    flag is currently active in the MovementInfo object. This is commonly used in
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to evaluate player or creature movement states
    during gameplay. The method performs a bitwise AND operation between the internal
    movement flags and the provided flag value, returning true if the specified flag
    is set. It is essential for determining movement behavior such as flying, swimming,
    walking, or being on a transport. This functionality supports core game mechanics
    like movement validation, client-server synchronization, and state-based logic
    execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified movement flag is set in the MovementInfo
    object; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check for flying movement flag
    code: "if (movementInfo.HasMovementFlag(MovementFlags::MOVEMENTFLAG_FLYING))\n\
      {\n    // Player is currently flying\n    // Handle flying-specific logic here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validate multiple movement states
    code: "bool isSwimming = movementInfo.HasMovementFlag(MovementFlags::MOVEMENTFLAG_SWIMMING);\n\
      bool isOnTransport = movementInfo.HasMovementFlag(MovementFlags::MOVEMENTFLAG_ONTRANSPORT);\n\
      \nif (isSwimming && isOnTransport)\n{\n    // Player is swimming on a transport\n\
      \    // Special handling for this combined state\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the internal movement flags stored within the MovementInfo
    object. It's important to note that movement flags are typically set and cleared
    by the server during movement updates, and may not reflect real-time client-side
    changes without proper synchronization. The method performs a simple bitwise operation,
    making it very fast and suitable for frequent checks in performance-critical code
    paths.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with flags that might be modified asynchronously.
    Since MovementInfo objects are often updated by the server during movement packets,
    ensure thread safety if accessing from multiple contexts. Also, remember that
    not all movement flags may be relevant to your specific use case - verify which
    flags are appropriate for your intended behavior.
