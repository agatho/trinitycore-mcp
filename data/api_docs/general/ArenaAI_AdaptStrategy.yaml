  class: ArenaAI
  method: AdaptStrategy
  signature: void ArenaAI::AdaptStrategy(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Adapts the arena AI's strategy based on player behavior and combat conditions.
  description: The AdaptStrategy method in ArenaAI dynamically modifies the artificial
    intelligence behavior of arena NPCs to better respond to player actions during
    combat. This method evaluates various factors such as player health, mana levels,
    positioning, and attack patterns to adjust the AI's decision-making process. It
    is typically called during active combat to ensure that the AI remains challenging
    and responsive to changing battlefield conditions. The method operates internally
    without requiring external parameters, relying on the AI's internal state and
    access to player data through the game engine.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player index or identifier
      within the arena context. This parameter is used to determine which specific
      player the AI should adapt its strategy against.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in arena combat
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) override\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n   \
      \ {\n        ArenaAI* ai = dynamic_cast<ArenaAI*>(me->GetAI());\n        if\
      \ (ai)\n        {\n            int playerIndex = 0;\n            ai->AdaptStrategy(&playerIndex);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal AI system and should not be called directly
    by external code. It is typically invoked automatically during combat updates.
    The method modifies the AI's internal strategy state, which may affect future
    decision-making until the next adaptation cycle or reset.
  warnings: Improper use of this method with invalid player pointers can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the player parameter points to a valid arena
    participant before calling this method.
