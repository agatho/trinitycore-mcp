  signature: bool ConditionMgr::isSourceTypeValid(Condition * cond) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a condition's source type is supported by the ConditionMgr
    system.
  description: The isSourceTypeValid method checks if the source type of a given Condition
    object is recognized and valid within the TrinityCore condition system. This validation
    ensures that conditions are properly configured before being processed during
    game events or triggers. The method typically examines the condition's sourceType
    member against a list of supported types defined by the core engine. It returns
    true if the source type is valid, false otherwise. This check is crucial for maintaining
    data integrity and preventing runtime errors when evaluating conditional logic
    in quests, spells, or other game systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the condition's source type is valid and supported by the
    ConditionMgr system; returns false if the source type is invalid or unrecognized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Condition* cond = new Condition();\ncond->SourceType = CONDITION_SOURCE_TYPE_QUEST_ACCEPT;\n\
      bool isValid = conditionMgr->isSourceTypeValid(cond);\nif (isValid)\n{\n   \
      \ // Proceed with condition processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the ConditionMgr during condition
    validation phases. It's important to note that this check only validates the source
    type and does not validate other aspects of the condition such as its target or
    parameters. The method assumes that the input Condition pointer is valid and properly
    initialized.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null Condition pointer will likely result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. Always ensure the Condition object is properly
    allocated and initialized before calling this method. Additionally, this validation
    does not guarantee that the entire condition will be functional, only that its
    source type is recognized by the system.
