  method: GenerateAlert
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::GenerateAlert(uint32_t botGuid, const std::string
    & alertType, const std::string & message)
documentation:
  brief: Generates an alert for a specific bot with the given type and message.
  description: The GenerateAlert method is used to create and log alerts within the
    AI decision profiling system. It takes a bot's unique identifier (GUID), an alert
    type, and a descriptive message to record in the system. This functionality allows
    developers and administrators to track AI behavior, identify potential issues,
    or monitor specific events during bot operation. The method does not return any
    value but is designed to be used in debugging and monitoring scenarios where AI
    decisions need to be logged for analysis.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that triggered or is associated
      with the alert. This value identifies a specific game entity within the TrinityCore
      system.
  - name: alertType
    description: A string representing the type or category of the alert. This can
      be used to classify alerts for filtering or processing purposes, such as 'DecisionError',
      'PathfindingFailure', or 'ResourceShortage'.
  - name: message
    description: A descriptive message providing details about the alert condition.
      This should contain enough information to understand what occurred and why the
      alert was triggered.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Alert Generation
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      profiler.GenerateAlert(12345, "DecisionError", "Bot failed to select a valid
      target");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Pathfinding Failure
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      profiler.GenerateAlert(bot->GetGUID().GetCounter(), "PathfindingFailure", "Unable
      to find path to destination after 5 attempts");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in debugging or monitoring environments where
    AI behavior needs to be tracked. It may internally use logging mechanisms or database
    entries depending on the system configuration. The alert type and message strings
    are not validated for specific formats, so developers should ensure they conform
    to expected conventions.
  warnings: Ensure that botGuid is a valid GUID of an existing bot entity; otherwise,
    the alert might not be properly associated with any AI instance. Avoid using this
    method excessively in performance-critical sections as it may involve logging
    or database operations.
