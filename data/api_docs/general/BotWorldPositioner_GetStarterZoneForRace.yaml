  signature: uint32 BotWorldPositioner::GetStarterZoneForRace(uint8 race) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the zone ID where players of a specified race start their adventure
    in the game.
  description: The GetStarterZoneForRace method retrieves the unique zone identifier
    (ZoneID) corresponding to the starting location for players of a given race in
    World of Warcraft. This is used by the TrinityCore bot system to determine appropriate
    spawn points and initial quest zones for newly created bot characters based on
    their selected race. The method maps race identifiers to predefined starter zones
    that align with the game's original faction and racial starting locations. It
    serves as a lookup utility within the BotWorldPositioner class to ensure bots
    are placed in appropriate starting areas.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the ZoneID of the starter zone for the specified
    race. Returns 0 if the race is invalid or no starter zone is defined for that
    race.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve starter zone for Human player
    code: "uint32 humanStarterZone = botWorldPositioner.GetStarterZoneForRace(RACE_HUMAN);\
      \ // Returns zone ID for Elwynn Forest\nif (humanStarterZone != 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Use the zone ID to spawn bot in correct starting area\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      bot\", \"Human starter zone: %u\", humanStarterZone);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during bot initialization and character creation.
    The returned ZoneID should correspond to a valid zone in the game's database.
    Implementation likely relies on internal race-to-zone mapping tables or lookup
    structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the race parameter passed is a valid TrinityCore race constant
    (RACE_HUMAN, RACE_ORC, etc.) as invalid values may return 0 or undefined behavior.
    This method should not be called with uninitialized or corrupted race data.
