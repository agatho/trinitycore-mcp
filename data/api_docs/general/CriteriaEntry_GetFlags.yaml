  signature: int CriteriaEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flag bits associated with the criteria entry for determining
    completion conditions.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitwise
    flags that define how a criteria entry should be evaluated and completed within
    the World of Warcraft achievement system. These flags typically control aspects
    such as whether the criteria is hidden, requires specific conditions, or modifies
    behavior during evaluation. The returned value can be used in combination with
    flag masks to check for specific criterion properties. This method does not modify
    any internal state and is safe to call multiple times.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer containing the bitwise OR of all flags set on this criteria
    entry. Common flag values may include hidden status, progression tracking, or
    special completion requirements depending on the context of the achievement system.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a criteria is hidden
    code: "CriteriaEntry* entry = sObjectMgr->GetCriteriaEntry(12345);\nif (entry\
      \ && (entry->GetFlags() & CRITERIA_FLAG_HIDDEN)) {\n    // This criteria should\
      \ not be displayed to players\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Evaluate multiple flag conditions
    code: "CriteriaEntry* entry = sObjectMgr->GetCriteriaEntry(67890);\nint flags\
      \ = entry->GetFlags();\nif (flags & CRITERIA_FLAG_PROGRESS_BAR) {\n    // Handle\
      \ progress bar display logic\n}\nif (flags & CRITERIA_FLAG_SHOW_BUFF) {\n  \
      \  // Apply buff-related behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flags returned by this method are typically defined in the game's internal
    constants and may vary between different versions of TrinityCore or custom modifications.
    Developers should refer to the core codebase for exact flag definitions, as they
    are not exposed through public APIs.
  warnings: Do not assume that all possible flag combinations are valid or supported.
    Some combinations might be ignored by the achievement system or cause unexpected
    behavior if used incorrectly.
