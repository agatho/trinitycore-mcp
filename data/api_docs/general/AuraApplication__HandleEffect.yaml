  class: AuraApplication
  method: _HandleEffect
  signature: void AuraApplication::_HandleEffect(uint8 effIndex, bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes an aura effect on the target based on the specified effect
    index.
  description: The _HandleEffect method is a private internal function within the
    AuraApplication class that manages the application or removal of a specific aura
    effect. It takes an effect index and a boolean flag indicating whether to apply
    (true) or remove (false) the effect. This method is typically called during aura
    application or removal processes, and it interacts with the target unit's state,
    stats, and other game mechanics to properly implement the aura's behavior. The
    method ensures that all necessary updates are performed when an aura effect is
    toggled on or off.
  parameters:
  - name: effIndex
    description: The index of the aura effect to handle. This corresponds to the position
      of the effect within the aura's effect array, typically ranging from 0 to the
      total number of effects minus one.
  - name: apply
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the aura effect. When true, the effect is applied to the target; when false,
      it is removed from the target.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying an Aura Effect
    code: 'AuraApplication* auraApp = ...;

      // Apply the first effect of an aura

      auraApp->_HandleEffect(0, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing an Aura Effect
    code: 'AuraApplication* auraApp = ...;

      // Remove the second effect of an aura

      auraApp->_HandleEffect(1, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the aura system and should
    not be invoked directly by external code. It may trigger additional callbacks
    or updates to the target's state, such as stat modifications or visual effects.
    The method assumes that the aura application has been properly initialized and
    that the effect index is valid.
  warnings: Direct invocation of this method can lead to inconsistent aura states
    or game logic errors if not used correctly. Always ensure that the aura application
    is in a valid state before calling this method, and be aware that applying or
    removing effects may have side effects on other systems such as combat state or
    unit stats.
