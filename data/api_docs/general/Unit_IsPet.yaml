documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is a pet.
  description: The IsPet method checks if the current Unit object represents a pet
    in the game world. This method is commonly used in gameplay logic to distinguish
    between player characters and their summoned pets, such as companion pets or guardian
    pets. It returns true when the unit is a pet and false otherwise. The method can
    be particularly useful for implementing AI behavior, handling pet-related interactions,
    or determining if a unit is controlled by a player or another entity.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is a pet, false otherwise. This indicates whether
    the object represents a pet rather than a player or NPC.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (unit->IsPet()) {\n    // Handle pet-specific logic\n    // For example,\
      \ apply pet-specific buffs or effects\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = unit->GetTarget();\nif (target && target->IsPet()) {\n \
      \   // This is a pet, so we can apply specific behavior for pets\n    // such\
      \ as avoiding certain attacks or applying special effects\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal unit flags and may be affected by game mechanics
    like pet ownership or control. It should be used carefully in contexts where the
    distinction between player and pet matters, such as AI decision making or combat
    handling.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in situations involving multiple units,
    as it may not always accurately reflect the current state of control or ownership
    if the unit is not directly a pet but rather a summoned creature. Also note that
    pets can be controlled by players or other entities, so this method does not necessarily
    indicate control.
