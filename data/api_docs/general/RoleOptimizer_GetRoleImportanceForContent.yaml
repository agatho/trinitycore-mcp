  class: RoleOptimizer
  method: GetRoleImportanceForContent
  signature: int RoleOptimizer::GetRoleImportanceForContent(uint32 contentId, bool
    isDungeon)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the importance value of a role for a specific content
    type in the game.
  description: The GetRoleImportanceForContent method determines how critical a particular
    role is for successfully completing a given content type, such as dungeons or
    raids. This function evaluates various factors including the role's contribution
    to group success, encounter mechanics, and overall content requirements. The result
    is used by the RoleOptimizer system to make decisions about player positioning,
    role assignments, and team compositions. The method takes into account whether
    the content is a dungeon (which may have different role requirements than raids)
    and returns an integer importance score that reflects the significance of the
    role within that specific context.
  parameters:
  - name: contentId
    description: Unique identifier for the content type (e.g., dungeon or raid ID).
      Valid values are positive integers representing known game content entries.
  - name: isDungeon
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the content is a dungeon (true) or
      not (false, typically meaning raid or other content type).
  returns: An integer value representing the calculated importance of a role for the
    specified content. Higher values indicate more critical roles. Negative values
    may be returned to indicate low or negligible importance, while zero typically
    means the role is irrelevant for that content.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int importance = roleOptimizer->GetRoleImportanceForContent(1234, true);\
      \ // Get importance for dungeon with ID 1234\nif (importance > 0) {\n    //\
      \ Role is important for this dungeon\n    printf(\"Role is important with value:\
      \ %d\\n\", importance);\n} else if (importance == 0) {\n    // Role is not relevant\n\
      \    printf(\"Role is not relevant for this content\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "uint32 dungeonId = 1567;\nbool isDungeon = true;\nint tankImportance =\
      \ roleOptimizer->GetRoleImportanceForContent(dungeonId, isDungeon);\nint healerImportance\
      \ = roleOptimizer->GetRoleImportanceForContent(dungeonId, isDungeon);\n\n//\
      \ Determine if we should prioritize certain roles\nif (tankImportance > 50)\
      \ {\n    // High tank importance - ensure tank is assigned\n    printf(\"High\
      \ tank importance detected for dungeon %u\\n\", dungeonId);\n}\nelse if (healerImportance\
      \ > 30) {\n    // Moderate healer importance - consider healer assignment\n\
      \    printf(\"Moderate healer importance for dungeon %u\\n\", dungeonId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the RoleOptimizer system and likely caches results
    to improve performance. The exact algorithm used to calculate importance scores
    is internal to TrinityCore's implementation and may vary based on game updates.
    Developers should be aware that this function might return different values depending
    on current game state or configuration settings.
  warnings: The method assumes valid contentId parameters; invalid IDs may lead to
    undefined behavior or incorrect results. The returned integer values are not guaranteed
    to follow any specific scale or range, so comparisons should be made carefully.
    Be cautious when using this in performance-critical code paths as repeated calls
    without caching may impact performance.
