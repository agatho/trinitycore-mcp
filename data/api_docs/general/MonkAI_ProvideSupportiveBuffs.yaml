documentation:
  brief: Applies supportive buffs to nearby friendly targets within the MonkAI's assigned
    area of effect.
  description: The ProvideSupportiveBuffs method is responsible for identifying and
    applying beneficial auras or abilities to allies in proximity. This function typically
    handles the logic for casting healing or buff spells such as Enveloping Mist,
    Renewing Mist, or other supportive monk abilities based on the current combat
    state and target conditions. It ensures that the MonkAI maintains optimal support
    for its group members by automatically applying necessary buffs without requiring
    manual intervention. The method operates under the assumption that the AI has
    been initialized with appropriate targeting and spell selection logic.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n\
      \    if (CanProvideSupportiveBuffs())\n        ProvideSupportiveBuffs();\n \
      \   // ... other logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should be
    used in conjunction with proper targeting logic to ensure that buffs are applied
    only to valid targets. The implementation may include checks for spell cooldowns,
    mana availability, and target health thresholds before applying any buffs.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without verifying target validity or spell
    readiness can lead to unnecessary resource consumption or incorrect behavior in
    combat scenarios. Ensure that the AI's target selection logic properly filters
    out invalid targets before invoking this function.
