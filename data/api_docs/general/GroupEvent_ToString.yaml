documentation:
  brief: Converts a GroupEvent object into a human-readable string representation
  description: The ToString method provides a textual representation of a GroupEvent
    object, typically used for debugging, logging, or displaying event information
    in a readable format. This method is commonly employed in TrinityCore's group
    management system to serialize event data for diagnostic purposes or integration
    with logging frameworks. The output string usually contains key identifiers and
    properties of the group event, making it easier for developers to understand the
    state and context of events within the game's group system. No specific preconditions
    are required for calling this method, and it is generally safe to invoke from
    any thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing a formatted representation of the GroupEvent object,
    typically including event type, associated group ID, and relevant metadata for
    debugging purposes
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Debug Logging
    code: 'GroupEvent event;

      // ... populate event with data ...

      std::string eventStr = event.ToString();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("group", "Group event details: {}", eventStr);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Event Handler for Logging
    code: "void HandleGroupEvent(GroupEvent& event)\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"group\"\
      , \"Processing group event: {}\", event.ToString());\n    // ... process event\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The exact format of the returned string may vary based on the internal implementation
    and version of TrinityCore. This method is primarily intended for diagnostic purposes
    rather than programmatic use. The method should not be used in performance-critical
    code paths due to potential string construction overhead.
