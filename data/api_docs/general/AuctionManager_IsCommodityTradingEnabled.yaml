  signature: bool AuctionManager::IsCommodityTradingEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether commodity trading is enabled within the auction system.
  description: The IsCommodityTradingEnabled method checks if the auction house allows
    trading of commodities, which are items that can be bought and sold in bulk quantities.
    This feature is typically controlled by a server configuration setting or game
    rule that enables or disables commodity transactions in the auction house. The
    method returns a boolean value indicating the current state of this setting. When
    enabled, players may list and purchase commodities through the auction interface,
    which often have different pricing mechanics compared to regular item auctions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if commodity trading is currently enabled in the auction system;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Commodity Trading is Enabled
    code: "if (sAuctionMgr->IsCommodityTradingEnabled()) {\n    // Allow commodity-related\
      \ auction actions\n    sLog->outString(\"Commodity trading is enabled.\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Disable commodity-related auction actions\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Commodity trading is disabled.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely reads from a configuration value or server setting that
    determines whether commodities can be traded through the auction house. It's important
    to note that even if commodity trading is enabled, individual items may still
    have restrictions based on their item flags or other game mechanics.
