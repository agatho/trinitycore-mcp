documentation:
  brief: Teleports all players who are not in the boss's threat list to a designated
    location.
  description: The TeleportCheaters method is used in BossAI implementations to remove
    players who have not been added to the boss's threat list from the combat area.
    This typically occurs during certain boss encounters where specific player behavior
    or positioning is required. The method iterates through all players within the
    boss's encounter area and teleports those who are not on the threat list to a
    predetermined safe location, often used to reset the encounter or enforce proper
    engagement mechanics. It is commonly called during phase transitions or when enforcing
    specific encounter rules.

  - title: Basic usage in boss AI
    code: "class MyBossAI : public BossAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override\n    {\n        if (me->GetMap()->IsDungeon())\n        {\n     \
      \       TeleportCheaters();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with threat management systems.
    It assumes that players not on the threat list are considered 'cheaters' or improperly
    engaged, and should be teleported to a safe zone. The implementation may vary
    depending on how the boss defines its threat list and safe zones.
  warnings: Using this method without proper threat list management can result in
    unintended player teleportation. Ensure that the threat list is properly maintained
    before calling this function to avoid teleporting players who should remain in
    combat.
