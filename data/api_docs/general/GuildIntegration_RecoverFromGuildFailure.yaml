  signature: void GuildIntegration::RecoverFromGuildFailure(uint32 playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to recover a player's guild-related data after a guild operation
    failure.
  description: The RecoverFromGuildFailure method is designed to handle cases where
    a guild operation has failed, allowing the system to restore or reset the player's
    guild state. This typically involves cleaning up temporary guild data, resetting
    guild-related flags or timers, and ensuring that the player can re-attempt guild
    operations without conflicts. The method is usually invoked internally by the
    guild management system when an operation fails due to various conditions such
    as network issues, invalid guild state, or server-side errors. It helps maintain
    consistency in the guild subsystem and prevents corrupted or stale data from affecting
    future guild interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose guild state needs
      to be recovered. This value must correspond to a valid player in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.RecoverFromGuildFailure(123456);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Error Handling Context
    code: "if (!guild->AddMember(player)) {\n    guildInt.RecoverFromGuildFailure(player->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      \    // Additional error handling logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of an automatic recovery mechanism
    and should not be invoked manually unless specifically required by custom guild
    logic. It may involve database operations to reset player guild flags or timers,
    so performance considerations apply in high-traffic environments.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or non-existent player GUIDs, as
    it may lead to undefined behavior or database corruption. Ensure that the player
    is actually in a failed guild state before invoking this recovery mechanism.
