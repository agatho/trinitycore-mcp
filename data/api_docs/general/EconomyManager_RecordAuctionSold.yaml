api:
  class: EconomyManager
  method: RecordAuctionSold
  signature: void EconomyManager::RecordAuctionSold(uint32 itemId, uint32 price)
documentation:
  brief: Records an auction sale event for a specific item and its sold price in the
    economy system.
  description: The RecordAuctionSold method logs information about a successful auction
    sale within the TrinityCore economy manager. It takes the unique identifier of
    the item that was sold and the final price at which it was sold, storing this
    data for tracking purposes. This method is typically invoked when an auction item
    is successfully purchased by a player, allowing the server to maintain records
    of transactions for economy analysis, reporting, or in-game currency flow monitoring.
    The method does not return any value and operates as a void function, meaning
    its primary purpose is to perform side effects such as data logging or updating
    internal state.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item that was sold in the auction. This
      corresponds to the item's entry ID in the database.
  - name: price
    description: The final price at which the item was sold. This value represents
      the amount of currency paid by the buyer.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'EconomyManager* economyMgr = sEconomyManager;

      economyMgr->RecordAuctionSold(12345, 5000);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Dynamic Values
    code: 'uint32 soldItemId = item->GetEntry();

      uint32 finalPrice = auctionHouse->GetHighestBid();

      EconomyManager* economyMgr = sEconomyManager;

      economyMgr->RecordAuctionSold(soldItemId, finalPrice);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other economy-related functions
    to maintain transaction logs. It may be called from auction house logic or related
    systems when an item completes a sale. The implementation should ensure thread
    safety if multiple threads can access the economy manager simultaneously.
  warnings: Ensure that itemId and price are valid before calling this method, as
    invalid values might cause data inconsistency or errors in the economy tracking
    system. This function does not validate input parameters, so callers must provide
    correct values.
