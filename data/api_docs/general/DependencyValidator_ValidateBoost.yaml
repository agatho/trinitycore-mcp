documentation:
  brief: Validates Boost dependencies for the TrinityCore server environment
  description: The ValidateBoost method checks whether all required Boost library
    components are properly installed and compatible with the current TrinityCore
    build. This validation ensures that the server can utilize Boost libraries for
    essential functionalities such as threading, networking, and file operations.
    The method performs version checking and dependency resolution to confirm that
    the Boost installation meets the minimum requirements specified by the TrinityCore
    project. It returns true if all dependencies are satisfied, or false if any critical
    components are missing or incompatible.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all Boost dependencies are valid and compatible with the
    TrinityCore build; returns false if any dependency validation fails or is missing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Dependency Validation Check
    code: "DependencyValidator validator;\nbool isValid = validator.ValidateBoost();\n\
      if (!isValid) {\n    std::cerr << \"Boost dependencies are not properly configured.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup to ensure proper initialization.
    The validation process may involve checking Boost version numbers, library presence,
    and compatibility with the current TrinityCore version. Performance impact is
    minimal as it's a one-time check during initialization.
  warnings: If this method returns false, the server may fail to start or exhibit
    unstable behavior due to missing or incompatible Boost libraries. Always ensure
    that the Boost libraries are correctly installed and linked before running TrinityCore.
