  class: ObjectGridUnloader
  method: Visit
  signature: void ObjectGridUnloader::Visit(CorpseMapType & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Unloads corpses from the grid based on the provided corpse map type.
  description: The ObjectGridUnloader::Visit method processes and removes corpses
    from a specified grid area. It iterates through the CorpseMapType container, which
    holds references to corpses within a particular grid cell. This method is typically
    invoked during grid unloading operations to ensure that corpse objects are properly
    cleaned up and removed from memory when players leave a grid zone. The method
    does not return any value but modifies the internal state of the grid by removing
    corpse entries.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A reference to a CorpseMapType container that holds all corpses within
      a specific grid cell. This parameter is used to iterate through and process
      each corpse in the grid for removal.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of ObjectGridUnloader::Visit
    code: 'ObjectGridUnloader unloader;

      CorpseMapType corpseMap;

      // Assume corpseMap is populated with corpses

      unloader.Visit(corpseMap);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal grid management system in TrinityCore
    and should not be called directly by external code unless implementing custom
    grid handling logic. The method assumes that all corpses in the provided map are
    valid and ready for cleanup.
