  method: AchievementCriteriaScript
  signature: void AchievementCriteriaScript::AchievementCriteriaScript(const char
    * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an achievement criteria script with a specified name.
  description: The AchievementCriteriaScript constructor initializes a new achievement
    criteria script instance with the provided name. This method is typically used
    within the TrinityCore framework to register custom achievement criteria handlers.
    The name parameter serves as a unique identifier for the criteria script, allowing
    the game engine to properly associate and execute the script when relevant achievement
    conditions are met. This constructor sets up the internal state of the script
    object, preparing it for use in the achievement system's event handling mechanisms.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated string representing the unique name identifier
      for this achievement criteria script. This name is used by the game engine to
      register and locate the script within the achievement system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Achievement Criteria Script Initialization
    code: "class MyAchievementCriteria : public AchievementCriteriaScript\n{\npublic:\n\
      \    MyAchievementCriteria() : AchievementCriteriaScript(\"MyCustomCriteria\"\
      ) {}\n\n    bool OnCheck(Player* player, Unit* target) override\n    {\n   \
      \     // Custom criteria logic here\n        return true;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during class initialization and should
    not be invoked manually in gameplay code. The name parameter must be unique across
    all achievement criteria scripts to prevent conflicts in the registry.
