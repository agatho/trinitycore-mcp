documentation:
  brief: Removes extra movement flags from a unit's movement state.
  description: This method removes specific movement flags from a unit's movement
    state, allowing for precise control over unit movement behavior. It is commonly
    used in conjunction with other movement-related methods to manage unit positioning
    and movement restrictions within the game world. The method operates on the unit's
    internal movement flag structure, modifying the flags that affect how the unit
    moves or behaves during movement.
  parameters:
  - name: f
    description: The movement flag to be removed from the unit's movement state. This
      represents a specific flag value that corresponds to a particular movement behavior
      or restriction.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->RemoveExtraUnitMovementFlag(MOVEMENTFLAG_FLYING);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related
    methods to manage unit behavior. It should be called carefully as it affects the
    unit's movement state and may impact how the unit interacts with the game world.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected movement behavior or
    positioning issues in the game world, particularly when used without proper understanding
    of the movement flag system.
