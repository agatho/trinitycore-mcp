documentation:
  brief: Notifies the interrupt awareness system of a detected spell cast.
  description: The NotifySpellDetected method is used to inform the InterruptAwareness
    system that a spell has been detected being cast by a unit. This method typically
    updates internal tracking mechanisms to determine if an interruption should occur
    based on game rules, such as when a player begins casting a spell that can be
    interrupted by certain actions or events. It plays a key role in managing spell
    casting behavior and ensuring proper handling of interruptions during combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: cast
    description: A reference to a DetectedSpellCast object containing details about
      the detected spell cast, including caster information, spell ID, cast time,
      and other relevant metadata.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'InterruptAwareness awareness;

      DetectedSpellCast spellCast;

      // ... populate spellCast with data ...

      awareness.NotifySpellDetected(spellCast);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the core game loop or subsystems
    that monitor unit actions. It's important to ensure that the DetectedSpellCast
    object passed in contains valid and up-to-date information for accurate interrupt
    handling.
