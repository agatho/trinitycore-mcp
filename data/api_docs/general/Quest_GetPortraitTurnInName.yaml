  brief: Returns the portrait turn-in name for a quest
  description: This method retrieves the portrait turn-in name associated with a quest,
    which is used in the game's quest interface to display the name of the quest when
    it's ready to be turned in. The returned string represents the name that appears
    in the quest turn-in portrait, typically used for displaying quest completion
    information in the UI. This method is commonly used in quest scripts and event
    handling to determine what name should be displayed when a player completes a
    quest.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const std::string& representing the portrait turn-in name of
    the quest, which is typically used for display purposes in the game's UI. The
    string may be empty if no portrait turn-in name has been set for the quest.
