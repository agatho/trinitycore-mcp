    minProfile, PerformanceProfile maxProfile) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of bot GUIDs whose performance profiles fall within the
    specified minimum and maximum ranges.
  description: The GetBotsInPerformanceRange method filters and returns a vector of
    bot identifiers (GUIDs) that match a given performance profile range. This function
    is typically used in performance analytics or bot management systems to isolate
    bots based on their computed performance metrics, such as response time, memory
    usage, or task completion rates. The method assumes the existence of internal
    data structures storing bot performance profiles and performs a range-based lookup
    without modifying any state. It does not validate input parameters directly since
    they are passed as PerformanceProfile objects, which should be pre-validated by
    the caller.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector<uint32_t> containing the unique identifiers (GUIDs) of bots
    whose performance profiles fall within the specified range. Returns an empty vector
    if no bots match the criteria or if the internal data is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve bots with performance between 50 and 100
    code: "PerformanceProfile min = {50, 0.5f};\nPerformanceProfile max = {100, 1.0f};\n\
      std::vector<uint32_t> botGuids = analytics.GetBotsInPerformanceRange(min, max);\n\
      for (uint32_t guid : botGuids) {\n    std::cout << \"Bot GUID: \" << guid <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other analytics functions
    to provide filtering capabilities for performance data. The PerformanceProfile
    class must define comparison operators to support range checking, and the internal
    storage of bot data should be thread-safe if accessed concurrently.
  warnings: Ensure that the minProfile and maxProfile parameters are valid and logically
    ordered (i.e., minProfile <= maxProfile). If not properly validated, unexpected
    results may occur. Also, this method does not perform any locking or synchronization
    internally; callers must ensure thread safety if needed.
