documentation:
  brief: Initiates loot distribution for a game object's loot node.
  description: The LootNode method in GatheringManager handles the process of distributing
    loot from a specified GameObject. This method is typically invoked when a player
    interacts with a gatherable object such as a mining vein, herbalism node, or treasure
    chest. It manages the loot generation, checks for valid loot templates, and ensures
    proper distribution to players within the loot group or raid. The method returns
    true if the loot distribution was successfully initiated, and false if there was
    an error or no loot could be generated.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the loot distribution was successfully initiated for the
    GameObject, false otherwise. This indicates whether the method completed its core
    functionality without errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GameObject* go = player->GetSelectedGameObject();\nif (go)\n{\n    GatheringManager*\
      \ mgr = sGatheringMgr;\n    bool success = mgr->LootNode(go);\n    if (success)\n\
      \        ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).SendSysMessage(\"Loot distribution\
      \ initiated.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core gathering system in TrinityCore and integrates
    with the existing loot system. It assumes that the GameObject has a valid loot
    template associated with it. The method does not directly handle player interaction
    or item delivery, but rather triggers the internal loot processing mechanism.
  warnings: Ensure that the GameObject passed to this method is valid and has a proper
    loot template defined. Calling this method on an invalid GameObject may result
    in undefined behavior or silent failures. This method should only be called during
    appropriate game events such as player interaction with gatherable objects.
