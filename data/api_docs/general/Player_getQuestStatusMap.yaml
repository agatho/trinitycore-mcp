  class: Player
  method: getQuestStatusMap
  signature: QuestStatusMap & Player::getQuestStatusMap()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the quest status map for the player, containing all active quest
    statuses.
  description: This method retrieves the QuestStatusMap associated with the player,
    which holds all active quest status information for the player. The QuestStatusMap
    is a collection of quest entries that tracks the progress and status of quests
    assigned to the player. It provides access to the current state of all active
    quests, including quest completion status, objectives, and progress tracking.
    This method is essential for managing quest-related data and is typically used
    in conjunction with other quest management functions within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a reference to the QuestStatusMap object which contains all active
    quest statuses for this player. The returned reference allows direct access to
    quest status information without creating a copy, making it efficient for performance-critical
    operations.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Quest Status Map
    code: "QuestStatusMap& questMap = player->getQuestStatusMap();\nfor (auto& questEntry\
      \ : questMap)\n{\n    uint32 questId = questEntry.first;\n    QuestStatus status\
      \ = questEntry.second;\n    // Process quest status\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to the actual internal quest status map of
    the player, so modifications to this map directly affect the player's quest data.
    This method is thread-safe as long as no concurrent modifications occur during
    access.
  warnings: Be cautious when modifying the returned QuestStatusMap directly, as changes
    may affect quest tracking and completion status. Avoid modifying quest entries
    while iterating through them.
