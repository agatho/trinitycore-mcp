api:
  class: InteractionManager
  method: CancelAuction
  signature: bool InteractionManager::CancelAuction(Player * bot, Creature * auctioneer,
    uint32 auctionId)
documentation:
  brief: Cancels an active auction on behalf of a bot player at a specified auctioneer.
  description: The CancelAuction method attempts to cancel an existing auction item
    that was listed by the provided bot player at the given auctioneer. This function
    typically interacts with the auction house system in TrinityCore to remove or
    invalidate an auction entry. It ensures that the auction being canceled belongs
    to the specified player and is currently active. The method returns a boolean
    value indicating whether the cancellation was successful, which may depend on
    various game mechanics such as auction status, time limits, or permissions.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot attempting to cancel
      the auction. Must be a valid player instance with an active auction.
  - name: auctioneer
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the auctioneer NPC where
      the auction is hosted. Must be a valid auctioneer creature.
  - name: auctionId
    description: Unique identifier of the auction to be canceled. This ID corresponds
      to an active auction entry in the auction house system.
  returns: True if the auction was successfully canceled; false otherwise. Failure
    may occur due to invalid auction ID, incorrect ownership, or auction already expired.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Auction Cancellation
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nCreature* auctioneer = ...;\nuint32 auctionId = 12345;\n\
      bool success = sInteractionManager->CancelAuction(bot, auctioneer, auctionId);\n\
      if (success)\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"auction\", \"Auction %u canceled successfully.\"\
      , auctionId);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the AuctionHouseMgr class internally to
    validate and remove auction entries. Ensure that the bot player has sufficient
    permissions or that the auction is still within cancellation time limits as per
    game rules.
  warnings: Do not call this function without verifying that the auction actually
    exists and belongs to the specified player. Attempting to cancel a non-existent
    or foreign auction may result in unexpected behavior or errors.
