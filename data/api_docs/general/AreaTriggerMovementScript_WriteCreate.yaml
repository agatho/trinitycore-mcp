  class: AreaTriggerMovementScript
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void AreaTriggerMovementScript::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const
    AreaTrigger * owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes area trigger movement data to a ByteBuffer for client synchronization.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes area trigger movement information
    into a ByteBuffer format suitable for sending to players. This method is typically
    invoked during the creation or initialization phase of an area trigger, ensuring
    that relevant client-side data such as position, orientation, and movement parameters
    are properly transmitted. It plays a crucial role in synchronizing area trigger
    states between the server and connected clients, particularly when area triggers
    are first encountered by players or when their properties change dynamically.
    The method utilizes the provided owner AreaTrigger object to extract necessary
    data and formats it according to the client protocol for proper interpretation.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where serialized area trigger movement
      data will be written. This buffer is typically used to construct network packets
      sent to players.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the AreaTrigger object that owns this movement script.
      Used to extract movement-related properties and state information for serialization.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive the serialized data.
      May be used to determine specific client behavior or filtering based on player
      state.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage in area trigger creation
    code: "void MyAreaTriggerScript::OnCreate(Player* player)\n{\n    ByteBuffer data;\n\
      \    WriteCreate(data, GetOwner(), player);\n    // Send data to player\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage within a custom movement script
    code: "class CustomAreaTriggerMovementScript : public AreaTriggerMovementScript\n\
      {\npublic:\n    void WriteCreate(ByteBuffer& data, const AreaTrigger* owner,\
      \ const Player* receiver) const override\n    {\n        // Custom serialization\
      \ logic here\n        data << owner->GetGUID();\n        data << owner->GetPositionX();\n\
      \        data << owner->GetPositionY();\n        data << owner->GetPositionZ();\n\
      \        data << owner->GetOrientation();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the area trigger movement system and should only be
    called during appropriate lifecycle events such as area trigger creation or state
    changes. The ByteBuffer must be properly initialized before calling this method
    to avoid memory corruption. This method does not perform any validation on input
    parameters beyond basic null checks, so callers should ensure valid objects are
    passed.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null owner or receiver pointer will likely
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the AreaTrigger object is
    fully initialized before calling WriteCreate. The serialized data format may vary
    depending on the client version and patch level, so compatibility should be verified
    across different game versions.
