  class: MageAI
  method: HasTalent
  signature: bool MageAI::HasTalent(uint32 talentId)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the mage has a specific talent unlocked.
  description: The HasTalent method determines whether a Mage AI instance possesses
    a particular talent by comparing the provided talent ID against the mage's current
    talent tree. This method is typically used within AI decision-making logic to
    enable or disable abilities based on the character's talent specialization. The
    method evaluates the talent state at the time of invocation, making it suitable
    for dynamic behavior adjustments during combat or non-combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the mage has the specified talent unlocked; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Talent Check
    code: "if (mageAI->HasTalent(12345)) {\n    // Perform action only if talent is\
      \ active\n    mageAI->CastSpell(target, SPELL_FIREBALL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ability Usage
    code: "if (mageAI->HasTalent(67890)) {\n    // Use a spell that requires the talent\n\
      \    mageAI->CastSpell(target, SPELL_BLAST_WAVE);\n} else {\n    // Fallback\
      \ to alternative spell\n    mageAI->CastSpell(target, SPELL_FROST_NOVA);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal talent state of the Mage AI instance and
    should be called after the AI has been initialized with valid talent data. It
    does not perform any runtime updates to the talent tree; changes in talents must
    be reflected through external systems before calling this method.
  warnings: Ensure that the talent ID passed to this method corresponds to a valid
    talent defined in the game's talent system. Invalid or undefined talent IDs may
    produce unexpected results or cause assertion failures depending on implementation
    details.
