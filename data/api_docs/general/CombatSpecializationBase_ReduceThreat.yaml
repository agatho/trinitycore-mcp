documentation:
  brief: Reduces threat generated by the combat specialization ability.
  description: The ReduceThreat method is used to decrease the amount of threat generated
    by a player's combat specialization ability. This functionality is typically employed
    in scenarios where a specialization should not contribute as much to aggro, such
    as when using certain healing abilities or defensive maneuvers. The method modifies
    internal threat calculations without directly affecting the target's hostility
    levels. It is commonly invoked during spell or ability execution to adjust the
    character's threat generation for better tank management and group coordination.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Specialization
    code: "void MyCombatSpecialization::OnCast()\n{\n    // Perform specialization-specific\
      \ actions\n    ReduceThreat();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the base combat specialization class and should be
    overridden or extended in derived classes to implement specific threat reduction
    logic. The actual implementation details may vary depending on the specialization
    type and game mechanics.
