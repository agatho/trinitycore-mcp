  method: ExecuteSingleTargetRotation
  signature: void FireMageRefactored::ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the fire mage's single-target rotation logic for the specified target.
  description: The ExecuteSingleTargetRotation method implements the core single-target
    spell rotation behavior for a fire mage class. This method determines which spells
    to cast based on current game state, cooldowns, mana availability, and combat
    conditions. It typically follows a priority system where higher-damage or more
    efficient spells are cast first, considering factors such as debuff durations,
    arcane charges, and combustion buff status. The method is designed to be called
    during the AI's decision-making cycle when targeting a single enemy unit.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or index
      within the game world. This parameter specifies which enemy unit the fire mage
      should focus its rotation on.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI context
    code: "void FireMageAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        int targetId = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n        ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(&targetId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat state management
    code: "void FireMageRefactored::ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(int* target)\n{\n\
      \    if (!target || *target <= 0) return;\n    \n    Unit* unitTarget = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*this,\
      \ ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player, *target));\n    if (!unitTarget || !unitTarget->IsAlive())\
      \ return;\n    \n    // Core rotation logic would go here\n    // e.g., cast\
      \ Scorch, Pyroblast, etc.\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the target is valid and alive before execution.
    The implementation may include internal state tracking for spell cooldowns and
    resource management. Performance considerations are important as this method may
    be called frequently during combat.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is properly validated to prevent null dereference
    errors. The method should not be called when the fire mage is not in combat or
    when the target is invalid.
