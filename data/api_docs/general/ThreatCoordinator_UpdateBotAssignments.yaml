documentation:
  brief: Updates the threat assignments for all bots in the system based on current
    combat state and AI priorities.
  description: The UpdateBotAssignments method is responsible for recalculating and
    reassigning threat targets for all active bot characters within the ThreatCoordinator
    system. This method evaluates each bot's current combat situation, including target
    selection, threat levels, and AI behavior patterns to ensure optimal group threat
    distribution. It typically runs during combat updates or when new threats are
    detected, ensuring that bots maintain proper aggro management according to predefined
    rules and priorities. The method does not directly modify combat state but rather
    orchestrates the assignment process based on internal threat calculations.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update Loop
    code: "void CombatUpdate()\n{\n    // ... other combat logic ...\n    threatCoordinator.UpdateBotAssignments();\n\
      \    // ... continue with other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the main game loop or combat
    update cycle. It's designed to be lightweight and efficient, avoiding heavy computations
    that could impact performance during active combat scenarios.
