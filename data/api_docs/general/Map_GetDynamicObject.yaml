  class: Map
  method: GetDynamicObject
  signature: int * Map::GetDynamicObject(const int & guid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the dynamic object associated with a given GUID from the map.
  description: This method returns a pointer to a dynamic object based on the provided
    GUID. It is used to access specific dynamic objects within the game world, such
    as those representing environmental effects, traps, or other interactive elements.
    The method operates on the map's internal data structures and allows developers
    to retrieve and manipulate these objects for various game mechanics purposes.
    The returned pointer may be null if no object exists with the given GUID.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the dynamic object to retrieve. This
      is typically a 32-bit integer representing the object's ID within the game world.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the dynamic object associated with the given GUID,
    or nullptr if no such object exists. The return value represents an object that
    can be manipulated or queried for its properties and behavior within the game
    world.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Dynamic Object
    code: "DynamicObject* obj = map->GetDynamicObject(guid);\nif (obj != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Use the object\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other map-related functions
    to manage dynamic objects. Performance considerations include checking for null
    returns and ensuring proper GUID validation before calling this method.
  warnings: This method should not be called on invalid GUIDs without proper validation,
    as it may lead to memory access violations or undefined behavior. Also, the returned
    pointer must be used carefully to avoid dangling pointers if the object is destroyed.
