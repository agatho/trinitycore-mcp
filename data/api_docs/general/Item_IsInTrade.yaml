documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the item is currently in a trade transaction.
  description: This method checks if an item is currently being traded between players,
    typically within the context of a trade window or auction house. It returns true
    when the item is in a trade state, indicating that it cannot be moved or modified
    until the trade completes. This method is crucial for preventing items from being
    moved during active trades and ensures proper game mechanics handling of item
    transactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item is currently in a trade transaction, false otherwise.
    The return value indicates whether the item's state prevents movement or modification
    due to active trading.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Item Trade Status
    code: "if (item->IsInTrade()) {\n    // Item is currently being traded\n    //\
      \ Do not allow any modifications\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include checking the item's trade status flag and
    ensuring proper synchronization with trade window states. This method should be
    used in conjunction with other trade-related methods to maintain game integrity
    during transactions.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if an item is in a trade window,
    as it only checks for active trading state. It does not account for items being
    in auction house or vendor transactions.
