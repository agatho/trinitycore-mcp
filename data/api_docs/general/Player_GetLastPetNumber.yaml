documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the player's last summoned pet.
  description: The GetLastPetNumber method retrieves the GUID of the most recently
    summoned pet by the player. This method is commonly used in game mechanics to
    track pet ownership and manage pet-related actions within the TrinityCore framework.
    The returned value represents a unique identifier that can be used for various
    pet tracking operations, including identifying the pet's owner or performing specific
    actions on the pet. It's important to note that this method only returns the GUID
    of the last summoned pet, not necessarily the current active pet.
  parameters: []
  returns: The return value represents a uint32 unique identifier (GUID) of the player's
    last summoned pet, which can be used for pet tracking and management operations
    within the game mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 lastPetGUID = player->GetLastPetNumber();\n// Use the GUID to perform\
      \ actions on the pet\nif (lastPetGUID != 0)\n{\n    // Pet exists, proceed with\
      \ pet-related operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely involves internal tracking of
    pet summoning events within the player object. Performance considerations: The
    method is lightweight and does not involve complex computations. Thread safety:
    This method should be safe to use in multi-threaded environments as it only reads
    from internal state without modifying it.'
  warnings: 'Common mistake: Using this method expecting it to return the current
    active pet''s GUID rather than the last summoned pet. Dangerous edge cases: If
    no pets have been summoned yet, the method returns 0, which might be misinterpreted
    as an error condition.'
