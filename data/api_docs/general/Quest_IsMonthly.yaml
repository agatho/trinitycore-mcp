  method: IsMonthly
  signature: bool Quest::IsMonthly() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a quest is flagged as monthly.
  description: The IsMonthly method checks if a quest has the monthly flag set in
    its database entry. This flag indicates that the quest is intended to be completed
    once per month, typically used for quests that reset their availability after
    a specific time period. The method returns true if the quest is marked as monthly,
    false otherwise. This functionality is essential for managing quest progression
    and ensuring proper quest completion timing within World of Warcraft's game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest is flagged as monthly, false otherwise. The return
    value represents whether the quest's database entry contains the monthly flag,
    which affects how often the quest can be completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (quest->IsMonthly()) {\n    // Handle monthly quest logic\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the quest's database entry and may not reflect real-time
    changes during runtime. The implementation typically checks against the quest's
    flags field in the database, which is set at server startup or when the quest
    is loaded into memory.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method for quest progression logic,
    as it only reflects the database flag and not actual game mechanics behavior.
    Some quests may have additional conditions that override the monthly flag.
