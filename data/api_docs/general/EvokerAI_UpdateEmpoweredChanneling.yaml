  brief: Updates the empowered channelling state for an evoker AI unit.
  description: The UpdateEmpoweredChanneling method manages the internal state and
    behavior of an evoker's empowered channelling ability. This method is typically
    invoked during the AI update cycle to handle the progression, duration, and effects
    of empowered channeling spells. It ensures that the evoker maintains proper targeting,
    spell casting mechanics, and cooldown management while channeling empowered abilities.
    The method may also handle interactions with other AI systems such as threat generation
    or target switching during the channelling process.
