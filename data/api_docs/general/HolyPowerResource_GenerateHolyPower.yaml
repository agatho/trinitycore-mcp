  signature: void HolyPowerResource::GenerateHolyPower(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates holy power for the player or unit associated with this resource.
  description: The GenerateHolyPower method increases the holy power amount for the
    unit that owns this HolyPowerResource. This method is typically invoked by game
    mechanics such as spell effects, abilities, or passive traits that grant holy
    power. The amount of holy power generated is specified by the input parameter
    and is added to the current holy power value. This method does not directly interact
    with the player's UI or visual feedback; it only modifies the internal resource
    state. It is commonly used in conjunction with other HolyPowerResource methods
    like GetHolyPower() and SetHolyPower().
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of holy power to generate. Must be a non-negative integer
      value representing the quantity of holy power to add to the current resource.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'HolyPowerResource* holyPower = player->GetHolyPowerResource();

      holyPower->GenerateHolyPower(1); // Adds 1 holy power'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Spell Effects
    code: "if (spellInfo->Id == 12345) // Example spell that generates holy power\n\
      {\n    HolyPowerResource* holyPower = unit->GetHolyPowerResource();\n    holyPower->GenerateHolyPower(2);\
      \ // Grants 2 holy power on successful cast\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the HolyPowerResource is properly initialized and
    associated with a valid unit. It does not perform any validation on the input
    amount, so calling with negative values may lead to unexpected behavior if the
    underlying resource implementation doesn't handle underflow.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring the HolyPowerResource exists or is
    correctly linked to a unit may result in undefined behavior. Also, be cautious
    when using large amounts as it might overflow the internal storage if not handled
    properly by the resource's implementation.
