  class: BotLocalHostileCache
  method: BotLocalHostileCache
  signature: void BotLocalHostileCache::BotLocalHostileCache(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new BotLocalHostileCache instance for the specified bot player.
  description: The BotLocalHostileCache constructor initializes a cache object that
    tracks hostile targets for a given bot player. This cache is used to maintain
    a list of nearby hostile units that the bot should consider attacking or avoiding
    based on AI behavior rules. The method sets up internal data structures and prepares
    the cache for tracking hostile entities within the bot's detection range. It ensures
    that the cache is properly associated with the specific bot instance and initializes
    any necessary state variables for hostile target management.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which the hostile
      cache is being initialized. This parameter must be a valid, non-null pointer
      to an existing player object that has been properly constructed and is in a
      valid state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic BotLocalHostileCache Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this points to a valid bot player

      BotLocalHostileCache hostileCache(myBot);

      // The hostileCache is now initialized and ready to track hostile targets for
      myBot'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called during the initialization phase of
    a bot's lifecycle. The cache will automatically update based on the bot's current
    position and detection range. The internal implementation may use caching strategies
    to optimize performance when checking hostile targets.
