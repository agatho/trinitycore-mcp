  class: KitingUtils
  method: AdjustKitingForGroupFormation
  signature: int KitingUtils::AdjustKitingForGroupFormation(const int & intended,
    const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts kiting behavior based on group formation settings
  description: The AdjustKitingForGroupFormation method modifies the intended kiting
    value to account for group formation constraints and positioning. This utility
    function ensures that individual player kiting behaviors align with the overall
    group strategy, particularly when players are in close proximity or following
    specific formation patterns. The method considers both the base intended kiting
    value and the current group configuration to determine an adjusted kiting value
    that promotes better group coordination and combat effectiveness.
  parameters:
  - name: intended
    description: The base kiting value that would normally be applied, typically representing
      a desired distance or positioning behavior for individual movement
  - name: group
    description: The current group formation setting or configuration that affects
      how kiting should be adjusted to maintain proper group cohesion and positioning
  returns: Returns the adjusted kiting value that accounts for group formation requirements,
    ensuring optimal positioning while maintaining individual player mobility
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat scenario
    code: 'int baseKiting = 10;

      int groupFormation = 5;

      int adjustedKiting = KitingUtils::AdjustKitingForGroupFormation(baseKiting,
      groupFormation);

      // Resulting adjustedKiting value reflects modified positioning for group coordination'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI movement logic
    code: "class PlayerAI {\n    int UpdateMovement() {\n        int baseKiting =\
      \ GetBaseKitingValue();\n        int groupKiting = GetGroupFormationSetting();\n\
      \        return KitingUtils::AdjustKitingForGroupFormation(baseKiting, groupKiting);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in AI pathfinding and movement logic to ensure
    that individual player behaviors align with group strategies. The adjustment algorithm
    likely considers factors such as group size, formation type, and player positioning
    relative to group members.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input values for both parameters. Invalid or
    negative values may produce unexpected results. This function should only be called
    during active combat or movement scenarios where group coordination is important.
