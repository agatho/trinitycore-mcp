  class: InterruptAwareness
  method: GetCastsFromUnit
  signature: int InterruptAwareness::GetCastsFromUnit(int casterGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of ongoing spell casts originating from a specified
    unit.
  description: The GetCastsFromUnit method returns an integer value representing the
    count of active spell casts initiated by the unit identified by the provided casterGuid.
    This method is typically used in interrupt-awareness systems to determine how
    many spells are currently being cast by a specific unit, which can be crucial
    for determining when and how interrupts should be applied. The method does not
    differentiate between different types of casts but provides a total count for
    all active spells from that unit. It's commonly used in combat AI logic, spell
    interruption mechanics, or tracking unit activity during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: casterGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the unit whose spell casts are being
      counted. This should be a valid GameObject, Creature, or Player GUID within
      the game world.
  returns: An integer representing the total number of active spell casts originating
    from the specified caster. Returns 0 if no casts are found or if the casterGuid
    is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Count Active Casts
    code: "int castCount = interruptAwareness->GetCastsFromUnit(playerGuid);\nif (castCount\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Player has ongoing spell casts\n    // Implement interrupt\
      \ logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Cast Count for AI Decision Making
    code: "uint64 targetGuid = unit->GetTarget();\nint targetCasts = interruptAwareness->GetCastsFromUnit(targetGuid);\n\
      if (targetCasts >= 2) {\n    // Target is casting multiple spells, prioritize\
      \ interrupt\n    unit->CastSpell(target, SPELL_INTERRUPT, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on internal tracking data structures maintained
    by the InterruptAwareness system. It may have performance implications if called
    frequently during combat loops, especially with many units involved. The method
    assumes that the casterGuid is valid and refers to an existing unit in the game
    world.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided casterGuid corresponds to a valid unit before
    calling this method; otherwise, unexpected behavior or errors might occur. This
    method should not be used as a direct replacement for checking specific spell
    states, but rather as a general indicator of casting activity.
