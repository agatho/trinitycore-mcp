  class: EmpowermentController
  method: Update
  signature: void EmpowermentController::Update(int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the empowerment controller state based on elapsed time
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and managing the state
    of an empowerment effect or system within the game world. It typically handles
    timer-based logic, cooldown updates, and state transitions for empowered abilities
    or effects. This method is called regularly by the game loop to ensure that empowerment
    states are properly maintained and updated according to in-game time progression.
    The method processes any pending changes and ensures that the empowerment controller
    reflects the current game state accurately.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed since the last update call, measured in milliseconds.
      This value is used to determine how much time has passed for updating timers
      and cooldowns within the empowerment system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void SomeAI::Update(int diff)\n{\n    m_empowermentController->Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Update with Conditional Logic
    code: "void Player::UpdateEmpowerment(int diff)\n{\n    if (HasEmpowerment())\n\
      \    {\n        m_empowermentController->Update(diff);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game loop or AI update routines.
    It's important to ensure that diff values are accurate and consistent for proper
    time-based calculations. The implementation may involve checking for expired timers,
    updating visual effects, and managing state transitions.
  warnings: Calling this method with incorrect diff values can lead to inaccurate
    empowerment timing and potential gameplay inconsistencies. Ensure that the diff
    parameter accurately reflects real elapsed time for correct behavior.
