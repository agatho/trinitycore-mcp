  method: ReleasePet
  signature: bool BattlePetManager::ReleasePet(int * player, uint32 speciesId)
documentation:
  brief: Releases a battle pet from the player's collection, removing it from their
    active battle pet team.
  description: The ReleasePet method removes a specified battle pet species from the
    player's collection. This action typically occurs when a player wishes to release
    a pet they no longer want to keep or use in battles. The method takes a pointer
    to the player object and the species ID of the pet to be released. It returns
    true if the pet was successfully released, and false if the operation failed,
    which may happen if the pet does not exist in the player's collection or if there
    are other game logic constraints preventing the release. This function is part
    of the BattlePetManager class that handles all aspects of battle pet management
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player whose battle
      pet will be released. Must not be null.
  - name: speciesId
    description: The unique identifier for the battle pet species to be released.
      This corresponds to the BattlePetSpecies ID used in the game's database and
      determines which specific pet type is removed from the player's collection.
  returns: Returns true if the battle pet was successfully released from the player's
    collection, false otherwise. Failure may occur if the specified pet does not exist
    in the player's collection or if other game logic prevents the release.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player object\nuint32 speciesId = 12345; //\
      \ Example battle pet species ID\nbool success = sBattlePetManager->ReleasePet(&player,\
      \ speciesId);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Pet successfully released\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_BATTLEPET_RELEASED);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: With Error Handling
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 speciesId = 12345;\n\nif (!player)\n{\n \
      \   sLog->outError(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"ReleasePet: Invalid player pointer\"\
      );\n    return false;\n}\n\nbool result = sBattlePetManager->ReleasePet(&player,\
      \ speciesId);\nif (!result)\n{\n    sLog->outError(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Failed\
      \ to release battle pet with species ID %u\", speciesId);\n    return false;\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"Successfully released battle pet with species\
      \ ID %u\", speciesId);\n}\nreturn true;"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the BattlePetManager class which handles all aspects
    of battle pet management in TrinityCore. The release operation typically removes
    the pet from the player's active team and updates the database accordingly. It
    may also trigger UI updates or notifications to the player.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer will likely cause undefined behavior. Also, verify that
    the speciesId corresponds to an actual battle pet in the player's collection to
    avoid unnecessary operations or errors.
