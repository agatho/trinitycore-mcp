documentation:
  brief: Checks if the group is in combat and returns true if so.
  description: The GroupCombatTrigger::Check method evaluates whether the current
    player's group is currently engaged in combat. It examines the combat status of
    all group members and determines if any of them are involved in active combat.
    This method is typically used by AI systems to make decisions about when to engage
    or disengage from combat situations. The check considers both direct combat involvement
    and indirect indicators such as being under attack or having aggro on enemies.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if any group member is in combat, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the group should be considered in an active combat state for AI decision-making
    purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (groupCombatTrigger.Check(ai)) {\n    // Group is in combat, take defensive\
      \ actions\n    ai->SetState(BotAI::STATE_DEFENSIVE);\n} else {\n    // Group\
      \ is not in combat, proceed with normal behavior\n    ai->SetState(BotAI::STATE_NORMAL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state tracking of group members and their
    combat status. It may not immediately reflect changes in combat state due to potential
    caching or update delays in the AI system. The implementation assumes that the
    BotAI parameter provides access to current group information.
