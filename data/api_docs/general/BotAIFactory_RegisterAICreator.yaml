  class: BotAIFactory
  method: RegisterAICreator
  signature: void BotAIFactory::RegisterAICreator(const std::string & type, int creator)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a new AI creator function for the specified bot type within the
    BotAIFactory.
  description: The RegisterAICreator method allows developers to register a factory
    function that creates instances of a specific bot AI type. This mechanism is used
    by the TrinityCore bot system to dynamically instantiate different types of AI
    behaviors for game bots. The method takes a string identifier for the AI type
    and an integer representing the creator function index, which maps to a registered
    AI creation callback. This registration process enables the system to create appropriate
    AI instances based on configuration or runtime requirements without hardcoding
    instantiation logic.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: A string identifier that uniquely defines the type of AI to be created.
      This string is used as a key to look up the corresponding AI creator function
      in the factory registry.
  - name: creator
    description: An integer index or identifier that references a registered AI creator
      callback function. This value typically corresponds to an entry in an internal
      function pointer table or registry maintained by the BotAIFactory.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Registration Example
    code: BotAIFactory::instance()->RegisterAICreator("warrior", 1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple AI Type Registration
    code: 'BotAIFactory::instance()->RegisterAICreator("mage", 2);

      BotAIFactory::instance()->RegisterAICreator("rogue", 3);

      BotAIFactory::instance()->RegisterAICreator("healer", 4);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during system initialization or when extending
    bot AI capabilities. The creator index must correspond to a valid registered AI
    creation function; otherwise, attempting to create bots of that type will likely
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. The factory maintains an internal mapping
    from type strings to creator indices, so duplicate registrations for the same
    type may overwrite previous mappings.
  warnings: Registering invalid creator indices can lead to segmentation faults or
    other runtime errors when bot instances are created. Ensure that all creator functions
    are properly registered before calling RegisterAICreator with those indices. Avoid
    registering multiple creators for the same type unless intentional override behavior
    is desired.
