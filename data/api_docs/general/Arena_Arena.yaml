  class: Arena
  method: Arena
  signature: void Arena::Arena(const BattlegroundTemplate * battlegroundTemplate)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an Arena object with the specified battleground template.
  description: The Arena constructor initializes an Arena object by setting its internal
    battleground template to the provided BattlegroundTemplate pointer. This method
    is typically called during the creation of arena instances to configure their
    properties and behavior according to the specified template. The battleground
    template defines key characteristics such as team sizes, scoring rules, and game
    mechanics specific to the arena type being instantiated.
  parameters:
  - name: battlegroundTemplate
    description: A pointer to a BattlegroundTemplate structure that defines the configuration
      and behavior of this arena instance. This template contains settings like maximum
      players per team, scoring system, and other arena-specific rules.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating an Arena Instance
    code: 'BattlegroundTemplate* bgTemplate = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattlegroundTemplate(BG_TYPE_ARENA_2v2);

      Arena* arena = new Arena(bgTemplate);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the Arena class initialization process and should
    only be called when creating a new arena instance. The BattlegroundTemplate pointer
    must not be null, as it's essential for configuring the arena's behavior.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this constructor will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the BattlegroundTemplate is valid and properly
    initialized before passing it to this constructor.
