  method: SetCalendarEventCreationCooldown
  signature: void WorldSession::SetCalendarEventCreationCooldown(time_t cooldown)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the cooldown period for calendar event creation for the session's player.
  description: This method configures the cooldown timer that prevents a player from
    creating new calendar events too frequently. The cooldown is specified as a time_t
    value representing the number of seconds until the player can create another event.
    This mechanism helps prevent spamming and ensures balanced gameplay mechanics
    within the World of Warcraft calendar system. The setting is applied directly
    to the current session's player state and affects subsequent calendar interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: cooldown
    description: The cooldown period in seconds that must pass before the player can
      create another calendar event. A value of 0 removes the cooldown restriction.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set a 30-second cooldown for calendar events
    code: 'WorldSession* session = ...;

      session->SetCalendarEventCreationCooldown(30);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove calendar event creation cooldown
    code: 'WorldSession* session = ...;

      session->SetCalendarEventCreationCooldown(0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's internal cooldown state without
    requiring a database update. The cooldown is enforced client-side and server-side
    to prevent abuse. It's typically used in conjunction with other calendar-related
    methods to manage event creation timing.
  warnings: Setting a very short cooldown (e.g., less than 5 seconds) may lead to
    abuse or performance issues if not properly monitored. This method should only
    be called when necessary as it directly impacts player experience and game balance.
