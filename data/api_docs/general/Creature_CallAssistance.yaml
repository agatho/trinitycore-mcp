documentation:
  brief: Calls nearby assistance from other creatures within the same group
  description: This method triggers a creature to call for assistance from nearby
    allies in the same group, typically used during combat or when the creature is
    under attack. The method utilizes the creature's AI behavior to summon help from
    companions or other creatures that are part of the same group, enhancing the creature's
    ability to engage in battle. It is commonly used in scenarios where a creature
    needs to quickly gather support from nearby allies to handle multiple attackers
    or to maintain group cohesion during combat.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->CallAssistance();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other AI methods like 'AttackStart'
    or 'Aggro' to ensure that the creature properly engages with its group members
    during combat. It may be called automatically by the game engine when certain
    conditions are met, such as when a creature is attacked and needs support.
  warnings: This method should not be used in isolation without proper context, as
    it may lead to unintended behavior if used incorrectly. The method relies on AI
    logic and group management, so improper usage can cause creatures to call for
    assistance at inappropriate times or without proper group members present.
