    SpellInfo * affectedSpell) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum negative aura modifier value for a given aura type and
    affected spell.
  description: This method retrieves the highest negative modifier value from all
    applied auras of a specific type that affect a particular spell. It is commonly
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to determine the strength of debuffs or
    negative effects applied to units. The method considers the aura type and the
    spell that is affected, returning an integer value representing the magnitude
    of the modifier. This functionality is essential for calculating damage reduction,
    debuff stacking, and other game mechanics involving negative effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the maximum negative aura modifier.
    A value of 0 indicates no negative modifiers found, while negative values indicate
    the strength of the modifier applied to the affected spell.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int32 modifier = unit->GetMaxNegativeAuraModifierByAffectMask(SPELL_AURA_MOD_DECREASE_SPEED,
      spellInfo);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other aura-related functions
    to determine overall effect strength. Performance-wise, it should be used carefully
    as it involves iterating through all applied auras. Thread safety depends on the
    context of use; if used in combat or during spell processing, proper synchronization
    must be ensured.
  warnings: This method may return 0 if no negative modifiers are found for the specified
    aura type and affected spell. It is important to note that this method does not
    account for positive modifiers, only negative ones. Also, the method may behave
    differently depending on how the spell is applied or whether it's a direct or
    indirect effect.
