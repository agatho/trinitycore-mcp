  brief: Loads and initializes a pet stable for the player, handling summoned pet
    data and result processing
  description: This method is responsible for loading and initializing a pet stable
    for the player within the TrinityCore framework. It handles the process of summoning
    a pet and processing the result of that summoning operation. The method manages
    the pet's stable data including its position in the pet slot array, and ensures
    proper initialization of the pet's data structures. This functionality is crucial
    for maintaining the player's pet management system within the game mechanics context,
    particularly when dealing with pet summoning operations and their corresponding
    results.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->_LoadPetStable(1, 0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include handling of pet data structures and ensuring
    proper initialization of the pet's stable position. Performance considerations
    involve memory management for pet data structures and avoiding race conditions
    during pet loading operations.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without proper context; it requires
    specific game state conditions to function correctly. Common mistakes include
    calling this method without proper pet summoning context or ignoring result processing.
