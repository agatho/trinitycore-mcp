documentation:
  brief: Processes pending teleport acknowledgments for players who have died and
    are being revived.
  description: The HandlePendingTeleportAck method is responsible for managing the
    acknowledgment of teleportation requests that occur during the death recovery
    process in TrinityCore. This method typically processes queued teleport actions
    that were deferred until after a player's death sequence has completed, ensuring
    proper positioning and state synchronization upon resurrection or revival. It
    handles timing-based checks to determine when pending teleports should be executed,
    particularly in scenarios involving death-related mechanics such as spirit release,
    corpse retrieval, or resurrection events.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within game loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    deathRecoveryManager.HandlePendingTeleportAck(100);\
      \ // Process pending teleports with 100ms delta\n    // ... other game logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within the main game update loop or
    during specific death/recovery events. The 'diff' parameter likely represents
    time elapsed since last call, used for timing-based processing of pending actions.
    It's important to ensure that this method is called regularly to prevent teleportation
    delays or inconsistencies during player resurrection sequences.
  warnings: Improper handling of pending teleport acknowledgments may result in players
    being teleported to incorrect locations after death, or failing to be teleported
    at all. This could lead to gameplay inconsistencies or exploits related to death
    mechanics and corpse management.
