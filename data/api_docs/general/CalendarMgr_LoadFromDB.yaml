  class: CalendarMgr
  method: LoadFromDB
  signature: void CalendarMgr::LoadFromDB()
documentation:
  brief: Loads calendar events and data from the database into memory for the CalendarMgr.
  description: The LoadFromDB method initializes the calendar system by retrieving
    all stored calendar events, invitations, and related data from the database. This
    method is typically called during server startup or when the calendar manager
    needs to refresh its internal state with the latest data from the persistent storage.
    It ensures that all calendar-related information is available for player interactions
    and event management within the game world. The method performs database queries
    to fetch event details, attendee information, and invitation statuses, then populates
    the in-memory structures used by the calendar system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeCalendarSystem()\n{\n    CalendarMgr* calendarMgr = sCalendarMgr;\n\
      \    calendarMgr->LoadFromDB();\n    // Calendar is now ready for player interactions\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during system initialization to avoid
    duplicate data loading. The method performs database operations and may cause
    a temporary performance impact during server startup. It's designed to be thread-safe
    as it's typically called from the main thread during server boot.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can result in
    duplicate calendar entries or memory leaks. Ensure that no active calendar operations
    are occurring when this method is invoked, as it may invalidate existing calendar
    state.
