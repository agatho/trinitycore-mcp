  class: ArenaTeam
  method: GetId
  signature: uint32 ArenaTeam::GetId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the arena team.
  description: The GetId method retrieves the unique database identifier (ID) assigned
    to an arena team within the TrinityCore database system. This ID is used internally
    by the server to reference specific arena teams and is essential for operations
    involving team management, member tracking, and match scheduling. The returned
    value corresponds to the primary key in the arena_team table of the world database.
    This method is typically called when working with arena team data structures to
    ensure proper identification and retrieval of team-specific information.
  parameters: []
  returns: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the unique identifier of the arena
    team. This ID serves as the primary key in the arena_team database table and is
    used for internal referencing throughout the TrinityCore system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\nif (team)\n\
      {\n    uint32 teamId = team->GetId();\n    printf(\"Arena Team ID: %u\\n\",\
      \ teamId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Team Management
    code: "void PrintTeamInfo(ArenaTeam* team)\n{\n    if (!team) return;\n    \n\
      \    uint32 id = team->GetId();\n    std::string name = team->GetName();\n \
      \   uint32 type = team->GetType();\n    \n    printf(\"Team ID: %u, Name: %s,\
      \ Type: %u\\n\", id, name.c_str(), type);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned ID is guaranteed to be unique within the context of the database
    and should not change during the lifetime of the arena team. This method performs
    no database queries and simply returns a cached value stored in the ArenaTeam
    object's internal state.
