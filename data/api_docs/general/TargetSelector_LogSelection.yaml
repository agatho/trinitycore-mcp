  class: TargetSelector
  method: LogSelection
  signature: void TargetSelector::LogSelection(const SelectionResult & result, const
    SelectionContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Logs the selection result and context for debugging purposes.
  description: The LogSelection method records detailed information about a target
    selection decision made by the AI system. It takes a SelectionResult object containing
    the chosen target and associated data, along with a SelectionContext object that
    provides contextual information such as the caster, spell, or situation that led
    to the selection. This method is primarily used for debugging and monitoring AI
    behavior in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation. The logging
    output helps developers understand why certain targets were selected and can be
    crucial for balancing AI decisions and identifying potential issues with target
    selection logic.
  parameters:
  - name: result
    description: The SelectionResult object containing the target selection data including
      the chosen target, selection priority, and related metadata.
  - name: context
    description: The SelectionContext object providing contextual information about
      the selection scenario such as the caster unit, spell information, or environmental
      factors that influenced the decision.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Script
    code: "void MyAIScript::OnUpdate(Unit* caster)\n{\n    SelectionResult result\
      \ = SelectTarget(caster);\n    SelectionContext context;\n    context.caster\
      \ = caster;\n    context.spellId = 12345;\n    LogSelection(result, context);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Debugging Target Selection Logic
    code: "void CombatAI::DoTargetSelection()\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectBestTarget())\n\
      \    {\n        SelectionResult result;\n        result.target = target;\n \
      \       result.priority = 0.8f;\n        \n        SelectionContext context;\n\
      \        context.caster = me;\n        context.spellId = currentSpell->Id;\n\
      \        context.isMelee = IsMeleeSpell(currentSpell);\n        \n        LogSelection(result,\
      \ context);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically outputs to the server's log files and may include performance
    overhead during intensive AI operations. The logging level should be configured
    appropriately in the TrinityCore configuration to avoid excessive disk I/O. It
    is recommended to use this method sparingly in production environments due to
    potential performance impact.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input parameters and will likely crash or produce
    undefined behavior if either result or context objects are null or improperly
    initialized. Ensure that all required fields in both objects are properly populated
    before calling this method.
