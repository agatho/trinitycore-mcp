documentation:
  brief: Continues the player login process after initial authentication
  description: The HandleContinuePlayerLogin method is responsible for finalizing
    the player login sequence in TrinityCore's WorldSession. This method typically
    executes after a successful authentication has been completed, and it handles
    the transition from the login screen to the character selection or world loading
    phase. It performs necessary setup operations such as loading player data, initializing
    session state, and sending required packets to the client to progress the login
    flow. The method is part of the core login workflow and ensures that all preconditions
    for a successful player entry into the game world are met before proceeding.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in login flow
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleContinuePlayerLogin()\n{\n    // Finalize player\
      \ login\n    LoadPlayerData();\n    SendCharacterList();\n    SetPlayerState(PLAYER_STATE_IN_WORLD);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically as part of the login sequence
    and should not be called directly by other methods unless specifically required
    for custom login flows. It assumes that authentication has already been completed
    successfully.
