  method: SummonCreatureGroup
  signature: void Map::SummonCreatureGroup(uint8 group, int * list)
documentation:
  brief: Summons a group of creatures defined by a group ID and creature list on the
    map.
  description: The SummonCreatureGroup method is used to spawn a predefined group
    of creatures on a specific map. It takes a group identifier and an array of creature
    IDs, then summons all creatures in that group at their designated positions. This
    functionality is commonly used for scripted events, boss encounters, or dynamic
    creature spawning within the game world. The method operates synchronously and
    ensures that all creatures are properly initialized and added to the map's object
    registry. The list parameter should be an array of creature entry IDs that correspond
    to the creatures defined in the database.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier used to define which set of creatures to summon.
      This corresponds to a predefined group in the database, typically defined in
      the creature_group table.
  - name: list
    description: An array of creature entry IDs that defines the specific creatures
      to be summoned. Each element in the array should correspond to a valid creature
      template ID from the creature_template table.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Creature Group Summon
    code: 'Map* map = ...; // Get current map

      int creatureList[] = {12345, 12346, 12347};

      map->SummonCreatureGroup(1, creatureList);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Summoning Boss Encounter Group
    code: 'Map* map = ...;

      int bossGroup[] = {50001, 50002, 50003};

      map->SummonCreatureGroup(10, bossGroup); // Summon a boss encounter group'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the creature group and individual creature templates
    are properly defined in the database. It does not validate the existence of creatures
    or groups before attempting to summon them, which may lead to runtime errors if
    invalid IDs are provided. The summoned creatures will be added to the map's object
    registry and will be managed by the core's update system.
  warnings: Using invalid group or creature IDs can cause crashes or undefined behavior.
    Ensure that all creature entries in the list exist in the database before calling
    this method. The list parameter must not be null, and should contain valid creature
    template IDs.
