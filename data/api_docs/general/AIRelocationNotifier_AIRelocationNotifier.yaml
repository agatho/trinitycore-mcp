  class: AIRelocationNotifier
  method: AIRelocationNotifier
  signature: void AIRelocationNotifier::AIRelocationNotifier(int & unit)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new AIRelocationNotifier instance with the specified unit reference.
  description: The AIRelocationNotifier constructor initializes a new instance of
    the AIRelocationNotifier class, which is responsible for handling AI-related relocation
    events for a given unit. This notifier typically manages how AI-controlled creatures
    respond to changes in their position or environment within the game world. The
    method sets up internal state and references needed to track and react to location-based
    events such as movement, zone changes, or environmental triggers that may affect
    AI behavior. It is commonly used during AI initialization phases when setting
    up event handlers for unit relocation.
  parameters:
  - name: unit
    description: Reference to an integer representing the unit identifier (GUID) that
      this notifier will monitor for relocation events. This parameter should point
      to a valid unit object within the game world's entity system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of AIRelocationNotifier
    code: 'int myUnitGuid = 12345;

      AIRelocationNotifier notifier(myUnitGuid);

      // Initializes a new relocation notifier for unit with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely performs initialization of internal data structures
    and may register the notifier with global AI event systems. It's important to
    ensure that the unit reference passed is valid before calling this constructor,
    as invalid references could lead to undefined behavior or crashes during AI processing.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or uninitialized unit reference can cause memory corruption
    or access violations. Always verify that the unit exists and is properly initialized
    in the game world before creating an AIRelocationNotifier instance.
