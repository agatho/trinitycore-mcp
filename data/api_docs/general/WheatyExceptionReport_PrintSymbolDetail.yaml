  brief: Prints detailed symbol information for exception handling in TrinityCore.
  description: The PrintSymbolDetail method is used within the WheatyExceptionReport
    class to output detailed debugging information about symbols when an exception
    occurs. This functionality is crucial for developers to diagnose crashes or unexpected
    behavior in the TrinityCore server. The method typically retrieves and displays
    symbol names, addresses, and other relevant debug data that helps identify where
    in the codebase an exception was triggered. It's commonly invoked during crash
    reporting or debugging sessions to provide comprehensive stack trace details.

  - title: Basic Usage in Exception Handler
    code: "try {\n    // Some code that may throw\n} catch (const std::exception&\
      \ e) {\n    WheatyExceptionReport report;\n    report.PrintSymbolDetail();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in debug builds and may not produce output
    in release configurations. It relies on the underlying operating system's symbol
    resolution capabilities and requires debug symbols to be available.
  warnings: The method may not work correctly if debug symbols are not properly loaded
    or if running in an environment without proper exception handling support. It
    should only be called from within an exception handler context.
