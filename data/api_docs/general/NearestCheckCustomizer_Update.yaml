  class: NearestCheckCustomizer
  method: Update
  signature: void NearestCheckCustomizer::Update(const int * o)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the nearest check customizer with the provided object reference.
  description: The Update method in the NearestCheckCustomizer class is responsible
    for refreshing or applying changes to the nearest check logic using the specified
    object reference. This method likely modifies internal state or configuration
    parameters that influence how the system determines the nearest entity during
    AI or targeting calculations. It is typically invoked when an object's properties
    change and need to be reflected in subsequent nearest checks, such as in creature
    AI behavior or player targeting systems. The method does not return any value
    but may affect the behavior of related methods that depend on the updated state.
  parameters:
  - name: o
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the object reference used for
      updating the nearest check customizer. This parameter is expected to point to
      a valid object identifier or index within the game's internal data structures.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Usage
    code: 'int targetId = 12345;

      NearestCheckCustomizer customizer;

      customizer.Update(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI or targeting system and may be
    called frequently during gameplay. Ensure that the object reference passed to
    this method remains valid throughout its lifetime to prevent undefined behavior.
