  class: AreaTrigger
  method: GetDuration
  signature: int32 AreaTrigger::GetDuration() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the duration in milliseconds of the area trigger.
  description: The GetDuration method returns the remaining lifetime of an area trigger
    in milliseconds. This value determines how long the area trigger will remain active
    before it expires and is removed from the world. The duration is typically set
    when the area trigger is created and can be influenced by various game mechanics
    such as spell effects, aura durations, or scripted behaviors. This method is commonly
    used in event handling, AI logic, and gameplay systems that need to know how much
    time remains for an area trigger to expire.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int32 value representing the duration of the area trigger in milliseconds.
    A return value of 0 or less indicates that the area trigger has expired or is
    no longer active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = player->GetAreaTrigger(12345);\nif (trigger)\n{\n\
      \    int32 duration = trigger->GetDuration();\n    if (duration > 0)\n    {\n\
      \        // Area trigger is still active\n        sLog->outString(\"Area trigger\
      \ will expire in %d milliseconds\", duration);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Expiration Status
    code: "void CheckAreaTriggerExpiration(Player* player)\n{\n    AreaTrigger* trigger\
      \ = player->GetAreaTrigger(54321);\n    if (trigger)\n    {\n        int32 remaining\
      \ = trigger->GetDuration();\n        if (remaining <= 0)\n        {\n      \
      \      // Trigger has expired\n            sLog->outString(\"Area trigger has\
      \ expired\");\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            // Trigger is\
      \ still active\n            sLog->outString(\"Area trigger expires in %d ms\"\
      , remaining);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a real-time view of the area trigger's remaining duration,
    which may change dynamically based on game events or scripted modifications. The
    returned value is not cached and reflects the current state at the time of calling.
  warnings: Be aware that calling this method on an expired or invalid area trigger
    may return unexpected values. Always validate the area trigger pointer before
    calling GetDuration() to avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior.
