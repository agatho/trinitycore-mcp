  method: HandleDirectHealing
  signature: bool DisciplinePriestRefactored::HandleDirectHealing(const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Executes direct healing logic for a specified group in the Discipline Priest
    AI.
  description: The HandleDirectHealing method is responsible for performing direct
    healing actions on a targeted group of units within the Discipline Priest's AI
    framework. This method evaluates the current state of the group, determines appropriate
    healing targets based on priority rules, and applies healing effects using the
    priest's direct healing spells. It integrates with the overall AI decision-making
    process to ensure optimal resource allocation and team survivability. The method
    returns true if healing was successfully applied to at least one target, or false
    if no suitable targets were found or healing could not be executed due to constraints
    such as mana availability or spell cooldowns.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: An integer identifier representing the group of units to be healed.
      This value typically corresponds to a predefined group index within the AI system,
      determining which set of targets will receive healing.
  returns: Returns true if direct healing was successfully applied to at least one
    target in the specified group; returns false if no healing could be performed
    due to lack of targets, insufficient resources, or other execution constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleDirectHealing
    code: "if (priest->HandleDirectHealing(0)) {\n    // Healing was applied to group\
      \ 0\n    // Continue with AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using HandleDirectHealing in a conditional healing routine
    code: "void DisciplinePriestRefactored::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff) {\n    if\
      \ (me->GetHealthPct() < 50 && HandleDirectHealing(1)) {\n        // Heal group\
      \ 1 when health drops below 50%\n        return;\n    }\n    // Other AI logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the priest has sufficient mana and that healing
    spells are not on cooldown. It is designed to be called within the context of
    an AI update cycle where group targeting and spell availability can be dynamically
    evaluated.
  warnings: Ensure that the group parameter refers to a valid group index; invalid
    indices may lead to undefined behavior or no healing being applied. The method
    does not perform any explicit mana checks beyond what is implied by its return
    value, so calling code should verify resource availability before invoking this
    method.
