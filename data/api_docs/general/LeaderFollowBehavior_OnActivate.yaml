  class: LeaderFollowBehavior

  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::OnActivate(BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the leader-follow behavior for a bot AI instance
  description: The OnActivate method is called when a LeaderFollowBehavior is activated
    within a bot's AI system. This method sets up the necessary internal state and
    configurations required for the bot to properly follow a designated leader. It
    typically initializes tracking variables, registers event handlers, and prepares
    the behavior for execution. The method ensures that the bot's AI context is correctly
    configured to maintain follower status and respond to leader movements.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that owns this behavior. This parameter
      provides access to the bot's AI context, including current target information,
      movement capabilities, and other relevant data needed for leader-follow mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic activation of leader-follow behavior
    code: "void ExampleUsage()\n{\n    BotAI* botAI = new BotAI();\n    LeaderFollowBehavior*\
      \ behavior = new LeaderFollowBehavior();\n    behavior->OnActivate(botAI);\n\
      \    // Behavior is now active and will follow the leader\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per behavior instance during the AI
    initialization phase. Repeated calls may cause undefined behavior or state corruption.
    The method assumes that the provided BotAI pointer is valid and properly initialized.
