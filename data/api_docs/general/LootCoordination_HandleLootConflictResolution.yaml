  signature: void LootCoordination::HandleLootConflictResolution(Group * group, const
    LootItem & item)
documentation:
  brief: Resolves loot conflict within a group by determining the final loot recipient
    based on group loot rules and player participation.
  description: The HandleLootConflictResolution method is responsible for resolving
    situations where multiple players have expressed interest in the same loot item,
    typically occurring during group loot distribution. This method evaluates the
    group's loot settings, such as master looting or round-robin distribution, and
    determines which player should receive the item. It ensures fair and consistent
    loot allocation according to World of Warcraft's group loot mechanics. The method
    operates on a provided group and specific loot item, updating internal state to
    reflect the resolution decision. This function is typically invoked when a loot
    conflict arises during group looting processes.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group where the loot
      conflict occurred. Must be a valid group instance with active members.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing details about the
      conflicting item, including item ID, stack size, and other loot properties.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic loot conflict resolution
    code: 'Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      LootItem item;

      // Assume item is populated with relevant data

      LootCoordination::HandleLootConflictResolution(group, item);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using within a loot processing context
    code: "void ProcessLootConflict(Player* player, LootItem& item)\n{\n    Group*\
      \ group = player->GetGroup();\n    if (group && group->isLootMaster(player))\n\
      \    {\n        LootCoordination::HandleLootConflictResolution(group, item);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal loot coordination state and should only be
    called when a legitimate conflict exists. It assumes the group has valid loot
    settings and active members. The method does not directly send messages to players;
    it updates internal state that may trigger subsequent UI updates or notifications.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid parameters (null group or item) can lead
    to undefined behavior. Ensure that the group is valid and contains at least one
    member before invoking this function. This method should not be called outside
    of proper loot processing contexts.
