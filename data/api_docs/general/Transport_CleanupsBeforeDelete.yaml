  class: Transport
  method: CleanupsBeforeDelete
  signature: void Transport::CleanupsBeforeDelete(bool finalCleanup)
documentation:
  brief: Performs necessary cleanup operations before a transport object is deleted.
  description: The CleanupsBeforeDelete method prepares a Transport object for deletion
    by performing essential cleanup tasks. This includes removing the transport from
    any active maps, notifying relevant systems about the impending removal, and ensuring
    that all references to the transport are properly cleared. The method is typically
    called internally during the destruction process of a transport entity, and it
    may be invoked with a finalCleanup flag to indicate whether this is the last cleanup
    operation before complete deletion. This ensures that no dangling references or
    invalid states remain in the game world when the transport is destroyed.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Transport Destruction
    code: 'Transport* transport = ...; // Assume transport is initialized

      transport->CleanupsBeforeDelete(true);

      // Transport is now ready for deletion'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during the destruction sequence of a Transport
    object. It is not intended to be used manually in regular gameplay code. The finalCleanup
    parameter determines whether additional cleanup steps are performed, such as sending
    removal packets to clients.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of the normal destruction flow may lead to
    undefined behavior or memory corruption. Do not invoke this method unless you
    are certain that the transport object is about to be deleted.
