  class: CombatSpecializationBase
  method: ValidateBuffs
  signature: void CombatSpecializationBase::ValidateBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Validates active buffs for combat specialization rules and updates affected
    unit states accordingly.
  description: The ValidateBuffs method ensures that all currently active buffs on
    a unit comply with the rules defined by the combat specialization system. It checks
    whether buffs are allowed based on the current specialization, removes invalid
    buffs, and applies any necessary state changes to maintain game balance and adherence
    to class-specific mechanics. This method is typically invoked during combat state
    transitions or when specialization changes occur, ensuring that units maintain
    valid buff configurations according to their active combat specialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Buff Validation Call
    code: "CombatSpecializationBase* spec = player->GetCombatSpecialization();\nif\
      \ (spec)\n{\n    spec->ValidateBuffs();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may trigger additional internal state updates and should not
    be called excessively during high-frequency combat events. It internally performs
    checks against active spell effects and specialization constraints, so performance
    impact is moderate.
  warnings: Calling this method during active combat without proper synchronization
    can lead to inconsistent buff states or unexpected behavior in unit mechanics.
    Ensure that the calling context has appropriate locking mechanisms if used in
    multithreaded environments.
