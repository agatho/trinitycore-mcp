  signature: int DB2Manager::GetArtifactPowers(uint8 artifactId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the artifact powers associated with a specified artifact ID from
    the DB2 database.
  description: The GetArtifactPowers method fetches artifact power data linked to
    a given artifact identifier. This method is used within the TrinityCore framework
    to access stored artifact power information, which typically includes abilities
    and enhancements that can be applied to artifacts in World of Warcraft. The returned
    value likely represents an index or identifier pointing to the artifact powers
    in internal data structures. This method is part of the DB2Manager class responsible
    for managing database table lookups and is commonly used during artifact-related
    gameplay mechanics such as power selection and upgrade systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the artifact powers index or identifier
    associated with the specified artifact ID. A negative value may indicate an error
    or invalid artifact ID, while a positive value corresponds to a valid entry in
    the internal artifact powers data structure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int artifactPowers = sDB2Manager->GetArtifactPowers(123);\nif (artifactPowers\
      \ >= 0)\n{\n    // Process valid artifact powers\n    printf(\"Artifact powers\
      \ ID: %d\\n\", artifactPowers);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid artifact\
      \ ID\n    printf(\"Invalid artifact ID provided.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses pre-loaded DB2 data tables and assumes that the
    artifact data has been properly initialized in memory. The internal implementation
    may involve hash lookups or indexed access patterns for performance optimization.
  warnings: Ensure that the artifactId parameter is within valid range to avoid accessing
    invalid memory locations or returning undefined behavior. This method should not
    be called before DB2 tables are fully loaded during server initialization.
