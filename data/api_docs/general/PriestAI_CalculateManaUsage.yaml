  class: PriestAI
  method: CalculateManaUsage
  signature: int PriestAI::CalculateManaUsage() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal mana usage for the priest AI during spell
    casting.
  description: The CalculateManaUsage method determines the appropriate amount of
    mana a priest AI should consume when casting spells, based on current mana levels,
    spell requirements, and AI decision-making logic. This method is integral to the
    PriestAI's resource management system, ensuring that the AI casts spells efficiently
    without depleting mana unnecessarily. The calculation considers factors such as
    available mana, spell cost, and strategic priorities to maintain optimal performance
    during combat situations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the calculated mana usage amount. A positive
    value indicates the mana cost of the spell being considered for casting, while
    a zero or negative value may indicate no mana consumption or an error condition.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int manaCost = priestAI->CalculateManaUsage();\nif (manaCost > 0 && player->GetPower(POWER_MANA)\
      \ >= manaCost)\n{\n    // Proceed with spell casting\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the PriestAI system during
    spell selection and execution phases. It relies on the AI's internal state and
    current target information to make decisions about mana consumption. The returned
    value should be used in conjunction with the player's actual mana pool to determine
    if a spell can be cast.
  warnings: This method may return unexpected values if called outside of proper AI
    context or when the AI state is not initialized correctly. Always validate the
    returned mana usage against available resources before attempting spell casting
    operations.
