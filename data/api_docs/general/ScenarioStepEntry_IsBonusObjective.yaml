documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the scenario step represents a bonus objective.
  description: The IsBonusObjective method checks if the current scenario step is
    classified as a bonus objective within the context of a World of Warcraft scenario.
    Bonus objectives are typically optional goals that provide additional rewards
    or progression benefits beyond the primary objectives. This method returns true
    if the step is marked as a bonus objective, and false otherwise. The implementation
    likely relies on internal flags or data stored in the scenario step entry to make
    this determination.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the scenario step is a bonus objective.
    Returns true if the step represents a bonus objective, false if it is a regular
    objective.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Scenario Step is Bonus Objective
    code: "ScenarioStepEntry* step = sScenarioMgr->GetScenarioStep(1234);\nif (step\
      \ && step->IsBonusObjective())\n{\n    // Handle bonus objective logic\n   \
      \ sLog->outString(\"Step 1234 is a bonus objective.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in scenario progression systems to determine
    special handling for bonus objectives. The underlying data structure likely contains
    flags or bitmask values that define the objective type. This check may be performed
    frequently during scenario updates, so performance should be considered in high-frequency
    contexts.
