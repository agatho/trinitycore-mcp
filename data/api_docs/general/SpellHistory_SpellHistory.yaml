  brief: Moves a SpellHistory object's resources to another SpellHistory instance.
  description: The SpellHistory move constructor initializes a new SpellHistory object
    by transferring ownership of resources from an existing SpellHistory object. This
    operation is typically used when creating new instances of SpellHistory objects
    or when passing them by value in scenarios where the source object will no longer
    be used. The move constructor ensures efficient resource management by avoiding
    unnecessary copying of internal data structures such as cooldown tracking information
    and spell history records. In the context of TrinityCore's spell system, this
    constructor is essential for managing spell cooldowns and history tracking during
    player actions and spell casting.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move SpellHistory to new variable
    code: 'SpellHistory sourceHistory;

      // ... populate sourceHistory with spell data ...

      SpellHistory newHistory = std::move(sourceHistory);

      // sourceHistory is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move SpellHistory in function parameter
    code: "void ProcessSpellHistory(SpellHistory&& history) {\n    // Use the moved\
      \ history object\n    // history now owns all resources from the caller\n}\n\
      \n// Usage:\nSpellHistory myHistory;\nProcessSpellHistory(std::move(myHistory));"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs a move operation, which means that after calling
    it, the source SpellHistory object is left in a valid but unspecified state. It's
    important to not use the moved-from object afterward unless properly reinitialized.
    The move constructor is part of C++11's rvalue reference functionality and is
    used extensively in TrinityCore for efficient resource management.
  warnings: Using the moved-from SpellHistory object after this constructor call results
    in undefined behavior. Always ensure that you don't attempt to use the source
    object after moving its resources. This is particularly important in spell systems
    where cooldown tracking relies on consistent state management.
