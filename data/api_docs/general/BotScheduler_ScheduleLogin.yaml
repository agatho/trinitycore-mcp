  class: BotScheduler
  method: ScheduleLogin
  signature: void BotScheduler::ScheduleLogin(int guid, int when)
documentation:
  brief: Schedules a bot login for a specified GUID at a given time.
  description: The ScheduleLogin method in the BotScheduler class is used to queue
    a bot login operation for a specific player identified by their GUID. The login
    will be executed at the specified time, which is represented as an integer value
    (likely a timestamp or game tick). This method allows for delayed execution of
    bot logins, enabling controlled and timed access to the game world. It is typically
    used in automated systems where bots need to log in at specific intervals or times
    without immediate execution.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot player that needs to be logged
      in. This value uniquely identifies a specific player character within the TrinityCore
      database.
  - name: when
    description: The time when the bot login should occur, represented as an integer.
      This could be a Unix timestamp, game tick count, or other time-based value depending
      on the internal implementation of the scheduler.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Login Scheduling
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler;

      scheduler.ScheduleLogin(12345, 1678886400); // Schedule login for GUID 12345
      at Unix timestamp 1678886400'
    language: cpp
  - title: Scheduling Multiple Bot Logins
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler;

      scheduler.ScheduleLogin(1001, time(nullptr) + 30); // Login in 30 seconds

      scheduler.ScheduleLogin(1002, time(nullptr) + 60); // Login in 60 seconds

      scheduler.ScheduleLogin(1003, time(nullptr) + 90); // Login in 90 seconds'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses an internal queue or timer system to manage scheduled
    tasks. The 'when' parameter should be carefully considered to ensure it represents
    a valid future time. The implementation may involve thread synchronization if
    multiple threads are accessing the scheduler concurrently.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID provided corresponds to an actual bot character in
    the database, otherwise the login attempt will likely fail. Also, avoid scheduling
    logins too far in the past as they might be processed immediately or ignored depending
    on the internal logic.
