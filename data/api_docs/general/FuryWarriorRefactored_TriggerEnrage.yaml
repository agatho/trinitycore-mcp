documentation:
  brief: Activates the Fury Warrior's Enrage ability, increasing attack speed and
    damage output.
  description: The TriggerEnrage method activates the Fury Warrior's Enrage ability,
    which temporarily increases the warrior's attack speed and damage output. This
    ability is typically used during combat to boost offensive capabilities when the
    warrior's rage threshold is met. The method likely applies a temporary buff or
    aura to the warrior character, modifying their attack statistics for a specified
    duration. It may also consume a portion of the warrior's rage resources as part
    of the activation cost. The enrage effect usually provides a significant damage
    increase while reducing the warrior's attack speed, creating a trade-off between
    damage output and attack frequency.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Enrage Activation
    code: 'FuryWarriorRefactored* warrior = ...;

      warrior->TriggerEnrage();

      // Warrior now has increased attack speed and damage for duration'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the warrior's rage system and combat state
    management. The enrage effect may stack with other similar abilities or have specific
    interaction rules with other buffs/debuffs in the game. Implementation details
    may involve aura application, stat modification, and visual effects for the player.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper rage management or combat context may
    result in unexpected behavior. The warrior should be in a valid combat state before
    triggering enrage to ensure proper activation and resource consumption.
