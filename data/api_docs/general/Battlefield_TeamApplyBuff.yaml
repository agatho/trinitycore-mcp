  class: Battlefield
  method: TeamApplyBuff
  signature: void Battlefield::TeamApplyBuff(int team, int spellId, int spellId2)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a spell buff to all players on the specified team within the battlefield.
  description: The TeamApplyBuff method is used to apply one or two spell effects
    to all members of a specific team (either Alliance or Horde) currently active
    in the battlefield. This function typically handles the distribution of buffs
    such as haste, damage increases, or other temporary enhancements that affect the
    entire team during combat. It ensures synchronization of buff application across
    all players on the designated team and is commonly invoked during battle start
    events or strategic moments within the battlefield mechanics. The method does
    not return any value but modifies the state of players in the battlefield by applying
    the specified spells.
  parameters:
  - name: team
    description: The team identifier to which the buff will be applied. Valid values
      are 0 for Alliance and 1 for Horde.
  - name: spellId
    description: The ID of the primary spell effect to apply to all players on the
      specified team.
  - name: spellId2
    description: Optional second spell ID to apply. If set to 0 or invalid, only spellId
      will be applied.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Apply Buff to Alliance Team
    code: battlefield->TeamApplyBuff(0, 12345, 0); // Applies spell ID 12345 to all
      Alliance players
    language: cpp
  - title: Apply Dual Buffs to Horde Team
    code: battlefield->TeamApplyBuff(1, 67890, 54321); // Applies both spell IDs to
      all Horde players
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during battlefield initialization or strategic
    events. Buffs applied via this function are usually temporary and may be removed
    when the battlefield ends or upon specific conditions being met. Ensure that the
    provided spell IDs correspond to valid spells in the game's database.
  warnings: Incorrect team identifiers (e.g., values other than 0 or 1) may lead to
    undefined behavior or no effect. Also, applying invalid spell IDs can cause errors
    or silent failures during execution.
