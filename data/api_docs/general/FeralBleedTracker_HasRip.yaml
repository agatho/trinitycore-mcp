documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has an active Rip effect.
  description: The HasRip method determines whether a specific player currently has
    the Rip ability applied to them. This method is typically used in feral druid
    combat logic to track ongoing damage-over-time effects on targets. The method
    performs a lookup within the internal tracking system of the FeralBleedTracker
    class, which maintains state information about active bleed effects on players.
    It returns true if the specified player has an active Rip effect, and false otherwise.
    This functionality is crucial for proper spell interaction handling in the game's
    combat system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player with the given GUID has an active Rip effect;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (feralBleedTracker.HasRip(playerGuid)) {\n    // Player has active Rip\
      \ effect\n    // Handle accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Logic
    code: "void FeralDruidAI::UpdateCombatState() {\n    for (auto& target : GetTargets())\
      \ {\n        if (HasRip(target.GetGUID())) {\n            // Apply additional\
      \ effects or modify behavior\n            // e.g., increase damage multiplier\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the FeralBleedTracker instance has been properly
    initialized with tracking data. The GUID parameter should refer to a valid player
    entity within the game world. Implementation likely uses an internal map or set
    structure for O(1) lookup performance.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method corresponds to a valid player
    entity, as invalid GUIDs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
    This method should not be called on non-player entities.
