  class: Battleground
  method: FindBgMap
  signature: BattlegroundMap * Battleground::FindBgMap() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the battleground map associated with this battleground instance.
  description: The FindBgMap method returns a pointer to the BattlegroundMap object
    that represents the specific map instance where this battleground is currently
    running. This method is used internally by the battleground system to access map-specific
    data and functionality. The returned pointer may be null if the battleground has
    not yet been initialized or if it's in a state where no valid map reference exists.
    This is typically called during battleground lifecycle events such as initialization,
    start, and cleanup phases.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the BattlegroundMap object representing the battleground's
    map instance, or nullptr if no valid map reference exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Battleground Context
    code: "BattlegroundMap* bgMap = bg->FindBgMap();\nif (bgMap)\n{\n    // Use the\
      \ battleground map\n    sLog->outString(\"Found battleground map: %u\", bgMap->GetId());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Map Validity Before Access
    code: "BattlegroundMap* bgMap = bg->FindBgMap();\nif (bgMap && bgMap->IsInitialized())\n\
      {\n    // Safe to access map data\n    uint32 mapId = bgMap->GetId();\n    //\
      \ Perform operations on the battleground map\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by TrinityCore's battleground system.
    The returned pointer should not be stored long-term as it may become invalid during
    battleground lifecycle transitions. It's recommended to call this method when
    needed rather than caching the result.
  warnings: Avoid storing the returned pointer for extended periods as the battleground
    map might be destroyed or replaced during battleground cleanup phases. Always
    validate the return value before using it in critical code paths.
