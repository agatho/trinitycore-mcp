  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: OnDeactivate
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::OnDeactivate(BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Deactivates the leader follow behavior for a bot AI instance
  description: The OnDeactivate method is called when the LeaderFollowBehavior is
    being deactivated, typically during the cleanup or transition phase of a bot's
    AI state. This method handles necessary cleanup operations such as releasing references
    to the leader, resetting internal tracking variables, and ensuring that the bot
    returns to a neutral state. It may also trigger events or notifications to other
    systems in the game engine to indicate that the follow behavior has ended. The
    method is part of the bot AI lifecycle management system and ensures proper resource
    deallocation when the behavior is no longer active.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Deactivation Usage
    code: "void exampleUsage() {\n    BotAI* ai = new BotAI();\n    LeaderFollowBehavior*\
      \ behavior = new LeaderFollowBehavior();\n    // ... setup behavior ...\n  \
      \  behavior->OnDeactivate(ai);\n    // Behavior is now deactivated\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called as part of the normal AI state transition process.
    It's important that all internal references are properly cleared to prevent memory
    leaks or dangling pointers. The method assumes that the BotAI instance remains
    valid during execution.
  warnings: Calling OnDeactivate on a behavior that is already deactivated may lead
    to undefined behavior if the implementation does not include guards against multiple
    calls. Ensure proper state tracking before calling this method.
