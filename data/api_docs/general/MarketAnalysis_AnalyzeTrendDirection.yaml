  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: AnalyzeTrendDirection
  signature: MarketTrend MarketAnalysis::AnalyzeTrendDirection(const int & prices)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes the trend direction of market prices and returns a MarketTrend enum
    indicating whether the trend is increasing, decreasing, or stable.
  description: 'The AnalyzeTrendDirection method evaluates the historical price data
    provided through the ''prices'' parameter to determine the overall market trend.
    It processes the input data to identify if prices are generally rising, falling,
    or remaining consistent over time. This functionality is essential for in-game
    economic analysis and player decision-making regarding item purchases or sales.
    The method assumes that the input prices represent a sequence of values ordered
    chronologically, with each value corresponding to a specific point in time. Precondition:
    The ''prices'' parameter must contain valid integer price data; postcondition:
    Returns a MarketTrend enum value representing the calculated trend direction.'
  parameters:
  - name: prices
    description: A reference to an integer containing historical market price data
      used for trend analysis. This parameter should represent a sequence of price
      points ordered chronologically, where each integer corresponds to a specific
      timestamp or transaction.
  returns: 'Returns a MarketTrend enum value indicating the direction of the market
    trend. Possible values include: INCREASING if prices are generally rising, DECREASING
    if prices are generally falling, and STABLE if there is no significant upward
    or downward movement in prices over the analyzed period.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trend Analysis Example
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analyzer;

      int priceData[] = {100, 120, 130, 145, 160};

      MarketTrend trend = analyzer.AnalyzeTrendDirection(priceData);

      // Returns INCREASING if the prices show a consistent upward movement'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs basic linear trend analysis on the provided price data.
    It does not account for external factors such as market events or seasonal variations.
    For more complex analyses, additional methods may be required to incorporate these
    variables. The performance of this method scales linearly with the number of price
    points in the input array.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'prices' parameter contains valid numerical data and is
    properly ordered chronologically for accurate trend analysis. Passing an empty
    or invalid array could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
