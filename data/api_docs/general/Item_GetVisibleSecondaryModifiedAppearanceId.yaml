documentation:
  brief: Returns the visible secondary modified appearance ID for the item.
  description: This method retrieves the secondary modified appearance ID that is
    visible to a specific player for the item. It is used in World of Warcraft's modified
    appearance system, which allows items to display different cosmetic appearances
    based on player-specific conditions. The method returns an integer value representing
    the ID of the modified appearance, or -1 if no such appearance exists. This functionality
    is crucial for handling item appearance customization and ensuring proper display
    of cosmetic modifications in the game.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the visible secondary modified appearance
    ID, or -1 if none exists. The value corresponds to a unique identifier used in
    the modified appearance system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(0, 1);

      int32 appearanceId = item->GetVisibleSecondaryModifiedAppearanceId(player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method requires a valid Player pointer to function correctly. It is
    typically used in conjunction with other modified appearance methods and may involve
    caching or lookup operations depending on the implementation. Performance considerations
    include potential overhead from player-specific checks.
  warnings: The method may return -1 if no secondary modified appearance is set for
    the item, which can be confused with a valid ID of 0. Developers should ensure
    proper handling of negative values in their code.
