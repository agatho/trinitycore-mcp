documentation:
  brief: Processes a game object use request from a client, handling interactions
    with interactive objects like doors, chests, or quest items.
  description: The HandleGameObjectUseOpcode method is responsible for processing
    client requests to interact with game objects in the World of Warcraft environment.
    When a player attempts to use a game object such as a door, chest, lever, or quest
    item, this method is invoked to determine the appropriate response based on the
    object's type, the player's permissions, and any associated triggers or scripts.
    It validates the interaction, checks for proper conditions (such as proximity,
    ownership, or quest requirements), and executes the relevant game logic including
    triggering events, updating object states, or awarding rewards. This method is
    part of the core session handling system and ensures that all GameObject interactions
    are processed securely and consistently across the server.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic GameObject Use Handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleGameObjectUseOpcode(WorldPackets::GameObject::GameObjUse&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    if (!packet.GameObjectGUID)\n        return;\n\n    GameObject*\
      \ go = GetPlayer()->GetMap()->GetGameObject(packet.GameObjectGUID);\n    if\
      \ (!go)\n        return;\n\n    // Process the game object interaction\n   \
      \ go->Use(this);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the main packet processing loop
    and should not be invoked directly. The underlying GameObject::Use() function
    handles most of the actual logic, including script execution and state changes.
    Ensure that proper access control checks are performed before allowing interactions
    with sensitive game objects.
  warnings: Improper handling of GameObject use requests can lead to exploits such
    as exploiting quest items or bypassing security checks. Always validate the player's
    ability to interact with the object based on their current location, faction,
    and any relevant conditions before proceeding.
