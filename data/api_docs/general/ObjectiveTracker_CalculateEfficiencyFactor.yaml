  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: CalculateEfficiencyFactor
  signature: float ObjectiveTracker::CalculateEfficiencyFactor(Player * bot, const
    ObjectiveState & state)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns an efficiency factor for a bot's objective completion
    based on player state.
  description: The CalculateEfficiencyFactor method computes a floating-point value
    that represents how efficiently a bot is progressing toward completing objectives
    within the World of Warcraft TrinityCore environment. This factor is typically
    used to determine resource allocation, priority adjustments, or performance metrics
    for AI-controlled characters (bots). The calculation takes into account various
    aspects of the player's current state, such as progress, time spent, and objective
    difficulty. It serves as a key metric in bot behavior decision-making systems
    where efficiency directly impacts strategic choices.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the AI-controlled character
      (bot) for which the efficiency factor is being calculated.
  - name: state
    description: Reference to an ObjectiveState structure containing current progress
      and contextual data about the objective being evaluated.
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 indicates maximum efficiency
    and 0.0 indicates no progress or inefficiency. Values may exceed 1.0 in certain
    exceptional cases depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: float efficiency = objectiveTracker->CalculateEfficiencyFactor(botPlayer,
      currentObjectiveState);
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in Bot Decision Logic
    code: "if (objectiveTracker->CalculateEfficiencyFactor(bot, state) > 0.8f)\n{\n\
      \    // Prioritize this objective\n    bot->SetCurrentObjectivePriority(OBJECTIVE_PRIORITY_HIGH);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI system that evaluates bot performance
    and adjusts behavior dynamically. The efficiency factor may be influenced by external
    factors such as server load, quest difficulty modifiers, or player activity levels.
    Ensure that the provided Player object and ObjectiveState are valid before calling
    to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or null pointers for 'bot' or an uninitialized
    'state' can result in crashes or incorrect calculations. Always validate input
    parameters before invoking the function.
