  brief: Parses and executes command-line input for the TrinityCore server console
    interface
  description: The ParseCommands method processes command-line input received from
    the CLI (Command Line Interface) handler within the TrinityCore server environment.
    It interprets user-entered commands and routes them to appropriate handler functions,
    enabling administrative control over the running server instance. This method
    is typically invoked when a user types a command into the console and presses
    enter, allowing real-time server management through text-based inputs. The method
    handles both built-in server commands and custom admin commands registered with
    the CLI system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the command was successfully parsed and executed, false
    if the command was invalid or could not be processed. A return value of false
    may indicate syntax errors in the input or that the command does not exist in
    the system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Command Parsing
    code: "CliHandler handler;\nbool result = handler.ParseCommands(0); // Parses\
      \ commands from stdin\nif (result) {\n    printf(\"Command executed successfully\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"Failed to execute command\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates synchronously and blocks until command processing is
    complete. It relies on the underlying console input system and assumes that command-line
    input has been properly buffered or received from the terminal. The method may
    internally call various subsystems to perform actual command execution, including
    authentication checks for privileged commands.
  warnings: The method should only be called in a thread-safe context where CLI input
    is being handled. Improper use of this method without proper console handling
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Additionally, commands executed through
    this interface have full administrative privileges and could potentially compromise
    server security if not properly validated.
