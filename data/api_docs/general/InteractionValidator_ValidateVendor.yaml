  class: InteractionValidator
  method: ValidateVendor
  signature: bool InteractionValidator::ValidateVendor(::Player * bot, ::Creature
    * vendor) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a bot can interact with a vendor creature for trading.
  description: The ValidateVendor method checks if a given bot player is allowed to
    interact with a specific vendor creature within the game world. This validation
    typically includes verifying that the vendor is within acceptable range, that
    the bot has sufficient permissions or conditions to trade, and that the vendor
    is in a valid state for interaction. The method ensures proper game mechanics
    are followed during NPC vendor interactions, such as preventing invalid trades
    or unauthorized access to vendor services.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot attempting to interact
      with the vendor.
  - name: vendor
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the vendor NPC that the
      bot wants to interact with.
  returns: Returns true if the bot is allowed to interact with the vendor; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vendor Interaction Validation
    code: "if (validator.ValidateVendor(botPlayer, npcVendor)) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ vendor interaction logic\n    botPlayer->GetSession()->SendListInventory(npcVendor->GetGUID());\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle invalid interaction attempt\n    botPlayer->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      You cannot interact with this vendor.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform checks related to player state, distance, faction,
    and quest requirements before allowing vendor interactions. It's commonly used
    in AI scripts or botting systems to ensure valid NPC interactions.
  warnings: Ensure that both the bot and vendor pointers are valid before calling
    this method; otherwise, it could lead to a crash or undefined behavior. Also,
    be aware that this validation might not cover all edge cases in custom game mechanics.
