documentation:
  brief: Removes all pending invites from the group
  description: The RemoveAllInvites method clears all pending invitations within a
    group, effectively canceling any outstanding invite requests that have not yet
    been accepted. This function is typically used when managing group composition
    or when preparing to disband a group. The method operates on the internal invite
    list of the group and does not affect players who are already members of the group.
    It ensures that no further invitations can be processed for the group, which is
    useful during cleanup operations or when transitioning between different group
    states.

    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->RemoveAllInvites();\n\
      \    // All pending invites are now cleared\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only affects pending invites and does not modify the current
    members of the group. It is typically called during group cleanup or before changing
    group leadership.
