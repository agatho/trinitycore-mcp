  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: CalculateOverallPerformance
  signature: double BotPerformanceAnalytics::CalculateOverallPerformance(uint32_t
    botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the overall performance score of a specified bot based
    on various performance metrics.
  description: The CalculateOverallPerformance method computes a composite performance
    score for a given bot identified by its GUID. This score is derived from multiple
    performance indicators such as response time, task completion rate, resource utilization,
    and error frequency. The method aggregates these metrics into a single double-precision
    floating-point value that represents the bot's overall efficiency and effectiveness
    within the TrinityCore environment. The calculation may involve weighted averages
    or normalized scoring mechanisms depending on the internal implementation. This
    method is typically used for monitoring bot performance, identifying underperforming
    bots, and making decisions regarding bot allocation or optimization.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which to calculate the
      overall performance score. Must be a valid GUID that corresponds to an existing
      bot in the system.
  returns: A double-precision floating-point value representing the overall performance
    score of the specified bot. Higher values typically indicate better performance,
    though the exact scale and interpretation depend on the internal scoring algorithm
    used by the system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      double performanceScore = analytics.CalculateOverallPerformance(botGuid);

      printf("Bot %u performance score: %.2f\n", botGuid, performanceScore);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Loop
    code: "BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;\nfor (uint32_t i = 1000; i < 2000; ++i)\n\
      {\n    double score = analytics.CalculateOverallPerformance(i);\n    if (score\
      \ < 0.5)\n    {\n        // Log low performing bot\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Low performance bot detected: %u with score %.2f\", i, score);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve significant computational overhead as it processes
    multiple performance metrics for each bot. It is recommended to cache results
    when frequent calls are needed. The method assumes that the bot with the given
    GUID exists and has been properly initialized with performance data. Performance
    calculations might be influenced by system load and may vary between different
    TrinityCore configurations.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID may result
    in undefined behavior or exceptions. Ensure that the bot GUID is validated before
    calling this method. The returned score is relative and should not be used for
    absolute comparisons across different systems or time periods without proper normalization.
