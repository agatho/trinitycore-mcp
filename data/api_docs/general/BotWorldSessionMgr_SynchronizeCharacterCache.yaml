  method: SynchronizeCharacterCache
  signature: bool BotWorldSessionMgr::SynchronizeCharacterCache(int playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Synchronizes the character cache for a specified player GUID with the current
    session data.
  description: The SynchronizeCharacterCache method updates the cached character information
    for a given player GUID by retrieving and applying the latest data from the active
    session. This ensures that any changes made to the character's state, such as
    inventory updates or status modifications, are reflected in the cache. The method
    is typically used during bot initialization or when significant character state
    changes occur. It performs validation on the provided GUID to ensure it corresponds
    to a valid player before attempting synchronization.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose character cache
      needs to be synchronized. Must be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the character cache was successfully synchronized for the
    specified player; otherwise, returns false if synchronization failed due to invalid
    GUID or other internal errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (botWorldSessionMgr.SynchronizeCharacterCache(12345)) {\n    // Cache\
      \ updated successfully\n    std::cout << \"Character cache synchronized for\
      \ player 12345\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle synchronization failure\n\
      \    std::cerr << \"Failed to synchronize character cache for player 12345\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: In Bot Initialization
    code: "void InitializeBot(Bot* bot) {\n    uint32 playerGuid = bot->GetPlayer()->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      \    if (!botWorldSessionMgr.SynchronizeCharacterCache(playerGuid)) {\n    \
      \    // Log error and potentially disable bot\n        sLog->outError(\"Failed\
      \ to synchronize character cache for bot %u\", playerGuid);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the session is active and the player
    is connected. It may block temporarily while retrieving data from the database
    or session state. The synchronization process updates internal caches used by
    the bot system to maintain accurate character state information.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent player GUID can result
    in undefined behavior or errors. Ensure that the player GUID corresponds to an
    actual logged-in player before invoking this method.
