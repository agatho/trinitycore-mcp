  class: SnapshotManager
  method: GetSnapshot
  signature: const Snapshot & SnapshotManager::GetSnapshot(uint32 spellId, int * target)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a snapshot associated with the specified spell ID and target.
  description: The GetSnapshot method retrieves a const reference to a Snapshot object
    that corresponds to the given spell ID and optional target parameter. This method
    is typically used in the context of spell simulation or combat analysis within
    TrinityCore's framework, where snapshots capture the state of a spell at a specific
    point in time. The snapshot may contain information such as damage values, effects,
    or other relevant data depending on how it was initialized. The target parameter
    allows for retrieving different snapshots based on varying targets or conditions,
    though its exact usage depends on internal implementation details of the SnapshotManager
    class.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell for which to retrieve the snapshot.
      This ID must correspond to a valid spell in the game's database.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target index or identifier.
      May be null if targeting is not required or handled differently within the context
      of this method.
  returns: A const reference to a Snapshot object that contains the captured state
    data for the specified spell and target. The returned snapshot should not be modified
    directly as it's intended to be read-only.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: const Snapshot& snap = snapshotManager.GetSnapshot(12345, nullptr);
    language: cpp
  - title: With Target Parameter
    code: 'int targetIndex = 0;

      const Snapshot& snap = snapshotManager.GetSnapshot(12345, &targetIndex);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the SnapshotManager has already initialized snapshots
    for the given spell ID. If no snapshot exists for the specified parameters, behavior
    is undefined and may result in a crash or invalid data access. It's recommended
    to verify existence of snapshots before calling this method.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned Snapshot reference as it is const. Modifying
    it could lead to inconsistent state or unexpected behavior in combat simulations.
    Also, ensure that the spellId passed is valid and exists in the game's spell database.
