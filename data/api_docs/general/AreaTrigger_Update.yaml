  method: Update
  signature: void AreaTrigger::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the area trigger's state and handles its associated effects based
    on the elapsed time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing the area trigger's
    behavior over time. It is called regularly by the game loop to manage the trigger's
    active state, handle player interactions, and execute any associated scripts or
    effects. This method typically processes cooldowns, checks for player entry/exit
    conditions, and updates the visual or functional state of the area trigger. The
    method uses the provided delta time (diff) parameter to ensure timing-sensitive
    operations are accurately handled across different frame rates. Area triggers
    are commonly used in World of Warcraft for quest events, combat encounters, and
    environmental interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::UpdateAreaTriggers(uint32 diff)\n{\n    for (auto& trigger\
      \ : m_areaTriggers)\n    {\n        trigger->Update(diff);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Area Trigger Update with Player Interaction
    code: "void AreaTrigger::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_active)\n    {\n  \
      \      m_timeUntilReset -= diff;\n        if (m_timeUntilReset <= 0)\n     \
      \   {\n            // Reset trigger and notify players\n            Reset();\n\
      \        }\n        \n        // Check for player proximity\n        CheckPlayersInTrigger();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game update loop. It's important
    to note that area triggers may be updated even when no players are nearby, but
    their behavior should still be optimized for performance. The diff parameter represents
    milliseconds since last update and should be used for time-based calculations.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy operations in this method as it's called frequently.
    Ensure all player interaction checks are efficient to prevent performance bottlenecks.
    Be careful with state changes that might affect multiple players simultaneously.
