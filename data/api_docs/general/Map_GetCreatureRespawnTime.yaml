  signature: time_t Map::GetCreatureRespawnTime(int spawnId) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the respawn time of a creature based on its spawn ID.
  description: This method retrieves the respawn time for a specific creature identified
    by its spawn ID within the map. The respawn time represents the moment when the
    creature will reappear in the world, typically used for tracking and managing
    creature spawning behavior. It is commonly employed in conjunction with other
    map-related methods to determine creature status or to handle dynamic respawn
    mechanics. This method is particularly useful for developers working with creature
    spawn management systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a time_t value representing the respawn time of the creature, or
    zero if no respawn information is available for the given spawn ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Map* map = GetMap();\ntime_t respawnTime = map->GetCreatureRespawnTime(12345);\n\
      if (respawnTime > 0)\n{\n    // Creature will respawn at this time\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with creature spawn data management
    systems. It may return zero if the spawn ID does not correspond to a valid creature
    or if the creature has already respawned.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may return zero for invalid spawn
    IDs, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about creature status or respawn
    behavior.
