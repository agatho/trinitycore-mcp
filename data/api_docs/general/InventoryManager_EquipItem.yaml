  signature: bool InventoryManager::EquipItem(Item * item)
documentation:
  brief: Equips an item to the player's inventory, handling slot validation and update
    notifications.
  description: The EquipItem method attempts to equip a given Item to the appropriate
    slot in the player's inventory. It performs necessary checks such as item type
    compatibility, required level, and equipment slot availability. The method ensures
    that any previously equipped item in the same slot is properly unequipped before
    placing the new item. This process includes updating the player's stats, sending
    visual updates to the client, and triggering appropriate events or callbacks within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item was successfully equipped, false otherwise. Failure
    may occur due to invalid item type, insufficient level, incompatible slot, or
    other equip restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Item Equipment
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByEntry(12345);\nif (item)\n{\n    bool success\
      \ = inventoryManager->EquipItem(item);\n    if (success)\n        ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Item equipped successfully.\");\n    else\n        ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Failed to equip item.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the Item pointer is valid and properly initialized. It
    does not perform any database operations directly; changes are typically persisted
    through the standard item management system. The method may trigger client-side
    updates, so it should be called from a context where such updates are acceptable.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or uninitialized Item pointer will
    likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all preconditions
    for item equipping (such as proper item initialization and valid player state)
    are met before invoking this function.
