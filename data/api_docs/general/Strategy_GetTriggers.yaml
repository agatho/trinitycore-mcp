  method: GetTriggers
  signature: int Strategy::GetTriggers() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total number of triggers associated with this AI strategy.
  description: The GetTriggers method returns an integer value representing the count
    of triggers currently configured for this AI strategy. In the context of TrinityCore's
    AI system, strategies define how NPCs behave under certain conditions, and triggers
    are the events or conditions that activate these behaviors. This method allows
    developers to query the number of triggers without having to iterate through them
    directly. The returned value is typically used for debugging, validation, or determining
    the complexity of an AI strategy at runtime.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of triggers configured in this
    strategy. A return value of zero indicates that no triggers are defined for this
    strategy.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Strategy* myStrategy = ...;\nint triggerCount = myStrategy->GetTriggers();\n\
      if (triggerCount > 0) {\n    // Strategy has triggers defined\n    printf(\"\
      Strategy has %d triggers\\n\", triggerCount);\n} else {\n    // Strategy is\
      \ empty\n    printf(\"No triggers defined for this strategy\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple count operation and should have minimal performance
    impact. It's safe to call from any thread context where the strategy object is
    accessible, assuming proper synchronization mechanisms are in place if the strategy
    is modified concurrently.
