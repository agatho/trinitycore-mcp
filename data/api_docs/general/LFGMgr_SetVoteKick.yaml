  class: LFGMgr
  method: SetVoteKick
  signature: void LFGMgr::SetVoteKick(int gguid, bool active)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the vote kick status for a given group GUID.
  description: The SetVoteKick method is used to enable or disable vote kick functionality
    for a specific group identified by its GUID. This method is typically invoked
    during LFG (Looking For Group) operations to manage group dynamics and player
    participation. When active is set to true, the group allows members to initiate
    vote kicks; when false, vote kick functionality is disabled for that group. The
    method operates within the context of TrinityCore's LFG system and affects how
    group members interact with each other during group activities.
  parameters:
  - name: gguid
    description: The global group identifier (GUID) of the group for which to set
      vote kick status. This value uniquely identifies the group within the LFG system.
  - name: active
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether vote kick functionality should be
      enabled (true) or disabled (false) for the specified group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Vote Kick for a Group
    code: LFGMgr::instance()->SetVoteKick(12345, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Vote Kick for a Group
    code: LFGMgr::instance()->SetVoteKick(67890, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG system and should only be called when managing
    group states during LFG operations. The implementation likely updates internal
    group state tracking and may affect player permissions within the group context.
