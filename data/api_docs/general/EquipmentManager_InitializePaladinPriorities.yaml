  method: InitializePaladinPriorities
  signature: void EquipmentManager::InitializePaladinPriorities()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the priority order for paladin equipment slots based on class-specific
    optimization rules.
  description: The InitializePaladinPriorities method sets up the default equipment
    priority list for paladins, determining the optimal order in which items should
    be equipped across different inventory slots. This method is typically invoked
    during character initialization or when switching to a paladin class to ensure
    that the equipment manager applies appropriate prioritization logic for holy,
    protection, and retribution paladin specializations. The priorities are determined
    based on game mechanics such as stat weights, spell power, attack power, and defensive
    capabilities relevant to each paladin specialization. This method does not take
    any parameters and performs no direct return operations; it modifies internal
    state within the EquipmentManager class.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Character Load
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterWorld(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->getClass()\
      \ == CLASS_PALADIN)\n    {\n        player->GetEquipmentMgr()->InitializePaladinPriorities();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per player instance during initialization.
    It modifies internal data structures that are used by the equipment manager's
    optimization algorithms, so calling it multiple times may lead to unexpected behavior
    or redundant operations.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of appropriate initialization contexts
    as it might interfere with existing equipment state and cause inconsistencies
    in item equipping logic.
