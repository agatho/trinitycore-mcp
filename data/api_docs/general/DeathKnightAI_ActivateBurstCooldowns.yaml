  class: DeathKnightAI
  method: ActivateBurstCooldowns
  signature: void DeathKnightAI::ActivateBurstCooldowns(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Activates burst cooldowns for the Death Knight AI, enabling powerful abilities
    in response to target engagement.
  description: The ActivateBurstCooldowns method is responsible for triggering and
    managing the activation of burst cooldown abilities within the Death Knight's
    AI behavior. This function typically enables high-damage or utility abilities
    that are on cooldown, allowing the AI to respond dynamically to combat situations.
    The method likely evaluates the current state of the Death Knight's cooldowns
    and activates those that are ready or appropriate for the target's threat level.
    It may also consider factors such as mana availability, target proximity, and
    overall combat strategy when determining which abilities to activate.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The Unit object representing the current combat target. This parameter
      determines the context and priority for burst cooldown activation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void DeathKnightAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        ActivateBurstCooldowns(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with cooldown checking
    code: "void DeathKnightAI::DoBurstStrategy(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    if (CanActivateBurstCooldowns())\n    {\n      \
      \  ActivateBurstCooldowns(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles when the Death Knight
    is in combat. It may be part of a larger strategy system that evaluates multiple
    factors before activating burst abilities. The implementation likely interacts
    with the AI's cooldown tracking system and ability selection logic.
  warnings: Ensure that target is valid before calling this method to avoid null pointer
    dereferences. This method should only be called during active combat scenarios
    where burst cooldowns are appropriate.
