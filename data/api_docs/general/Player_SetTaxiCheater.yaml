documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's taxi cheater status to enable or disable taxi cheating.
  description: The SetTaxiCheater method allows developers to control whether a player
    can use taxi cheats, which typically enables or disables the ability to fly to
    any location without having to visit the proper flight path nodes. This method
    is commonly used in development and testing scenarios where players need to bypass
    normal gameplay restrictions. When enabled, it allows players to access all taxi
    nodes regardless of their current progress in the game. The method affects the
    player's behavior within the game world and can be toggled on or off based on
    developer needs.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetTaxiCheater(true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in development environments and should not
    be used in production servers as it can disrupt game balance. The implementation
    relies on internal flags that control taxi access, and may affect other player
    behaviors related to travel and movement.
  warnings: Using this method in a production environment can cause gameplay imbalance
    and may lead to unexpected behavior or penalties from the server. It should only
    be used during development or testing phases.
