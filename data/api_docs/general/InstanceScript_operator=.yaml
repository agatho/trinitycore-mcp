documentation:
  brief: Moves an InstanceScript object, transferring ownership of its resources to
    the target object.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment operation on an InstanceScript
    object. This method transfers all resources and state from the right-hand side
    rvalue reference to the left-hand side object, effectively moving the instance
    script's data without copying it. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft
    server implementation, this is typically used when reassigning or swapping instance
    script instances, particularly during zone loading/unloading or when managing
    dynamic instance creation and destruction. The move operation ensures efficient
    resource management by avoiding unnecessary deep copies while maintaining proper
    object state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the left-hand side InstanceScript object after the move
    assignment has been completed, allowing for chaining of assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'InstanceScript* script1 = new InstanceScript();

      InstanceScript script2 = std::move(*script1);

      // script1 is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // script2 contains the moved resources'
    language: cpp
  - title: Assignment in Container
    code: 'std::vector<InstanceScript> scripts;

      scripts.emplace_back();

      InstanceScript newScript = std::move(scripts[0]);

      // The original script at index 0 is moved into newScript

      // scripts[0] is left in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the standard C++ move semantics. After a move operation,
    the source object should not be used for any operations that require its previous
    state, as it may be left in a valid but unspecified state. The implementation
    typically involves transferring internal pointers, resource handles, and state
    variables from the source to destination object.
  warnings: Using this operator after a move operation on the source object results
    in undefined behavior. Always ensure that moved-from objects are not accessed
    or used for operations requiring their previous state. This method should only
    be called with rvalue references to avoid accidental copying.
