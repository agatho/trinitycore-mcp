  brief: Sends tutorial data to the connected client
  description: The SendTutorialsData method transmits the current state of tutorial
    progress and related information to the player's client. This method is typically
    invoked during session initialization or when a player logs in to ensure that
    their tutorial status is synchronized with the server. It handles encoding and
    sending the appropriate tutorial data packet, which includes flags indicating
    completed tutorials and any pending tutorial steps. The method ensures that players
    receive proper tutorial guidance based on their character's progression and game
    state.

      \ login logic ...\n}"

  notes: This method is typically called automatically during player login and session
    establishment. It's important to ensure that tutorial data is properly initialized
    before calling this method, as it sends a complete snapshot of tutorial state
    to the client.
