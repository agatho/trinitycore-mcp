  method: CheckOneGameEventConditions
  signature: bool GameEventMgr::CheckOneGameEventConditions(uint16 event_id)
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the specified game event meets all its defined conditions.
  description: The CheckOneGameEventConditions method evaluates whether a given game
    event, identified by its unique event ID, satisfies all the conditions required
    for it to be active or triggered. This includes checking time restrictions, player
    requirements, and other contextual criteria that may affect the event's activation
    state. The method is typically used internally by the GameEventMgr to determine
    if an event should be started, stopped, or remain in its current state. It ensures
    that game events behave correctly based on real-world conditions such as server
    time, player presence, and specific in-game triggers.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all conditions for the specified game event are met and
    the event is considered active or eligible to proceed; otherwise returns false
    if any condition fails or the event is not currently applicable.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a holiday event is active
    code: "if (sGameEventMgr->CheckOneGameEventConditions(123)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with holiday event logic\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(\"Holiday Event Active!\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often called during server tick processing or when game events
    are initialized. It's important to note that this function does not modify the
    event state directly but only evaluates it. The actual activation or deactivation
    of events usually happens through other methods like StartEvent() or StopEvent().
