documentation:
  brief: Updates the instance map state based on the provided time parameter
  description: The InstanceMap::Update method is responsible for processing and maintaining
    the state of an instance map during gameplay. It handles various game mechanics
    such as updating GameObjects, Creatures, and other dynamic elements within the
    instance. The method takes a uint32 parameter representing the time elapsed since
    the last update, which is used to determine how much to advance the simulation.
    This method is typically called by the core game loop to ensure that all instance-specific
    behaviors are properly maintained and synchronized with the overall game state.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Time elapsed in milliseconds since the last update call. This value
      determines how much time has passed for simulation advancement within the instance
      map.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = getMSTime();\n    instanceMap->Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Update with Delta Time Handling
    code: "class InstanceManager\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAllInstances(uint32 diff)\n\
      \    {\n        for (auto& instance : instanceList)\n        {\n           \
      \ if (instance->IsLoaded())\n                instance->Update(diff);\n     \
      \   }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from the main game thread. The parameter
    represents delta time in milliseconds and is used to maintain consistent simulation
    speed regardless of frame rate variations. Performance considerations include
    avoiding heavy operations within this method as it's called frequently during
    gameplay.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from game logic that might cause race
    conditions. Ensure proper synchronization if calling from multiple threads. Improper
    handling of the time parameter can lead to inconsistent game state or visual glitches.
