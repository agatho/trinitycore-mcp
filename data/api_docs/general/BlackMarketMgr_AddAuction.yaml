  class: BlackMarketMgr
  method: AddAuction
  signature: void BlackMarketMgr::AddAuction(BlackMarketEntry * auction)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a black market auction entry to the manager's collection.
  description: The AddAuction method is responsible for inserting a new BlackMarketEntry
    into the BlackMarketMgr's internal data structure. This method is typically invoked
    when a player places an item on the black market, making it available for bidding.
    The auction entry contains information such as the item template, bid amount,
    and duration. The method ensures that the auction is properly registered within
    the manager's tracking system, allowing other players to view and participate
    in the bidding process. It does not validate the auction data beyond basic insertion;
    it is assumed that the provided BlackMarketEntry has been correctly initialized
    before calling this method.
  parameters:
  - name: auction
    description: A pointer to a BlackMarketEntry object representing the auction to
      be added. This entry must contain valid data for item, bid amount, duration,
      and other relevant auction properties.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Black Market Auction
    code: 'BlackMarketEntry* entry = new BlackMarketEntry();

      entry->ItemID = 12345;

      entry->BidAmount = 10000;

      entry->Duration = 3600;

      // Initialize other fields as needed

      blackMarketMgr->AddAuction(entry);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the BlackMarketMgr. It
    should only be called after ensuring that the BlackMarketEntry is properly initialized
    and valid. The manager does not perform any automatic cleanup or validation of
    the auction data, so it's up to the caller to ensure data integrity.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Always verify that the auction parameter is not null before invoking AddAuction.
    Additionally, adding duplicate entries without proper handling may lead to unexpected
    results in the black market system.
