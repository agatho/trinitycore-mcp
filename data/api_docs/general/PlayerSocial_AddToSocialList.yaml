  class: PlayerSocial
  method: AddToSocialList
  signature: bool PlayerSocial::AddToSocialList(const int & guid, const int & accountGuid,
    SocialFlag flag)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a player to the social list with specified flags.
  description: The AddToSocialList method adds a player to the current player's social
    list in World of Warcraft. This method is used to manage friend, ignore, and other
    social relationships within the game. It takes a GUID and account GUID of the
    target player along with a SocialFlag that determines the type of relationship
    being established. The method returns true if the operation was successful, or
    false if it failed due to invalid parameters or internal errors. This functionality
    is essential for implementing in-game social features such as friend lists, ignore
    lists, and guild member management.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target player to be added to
      the social list. Must be a valid player GUID.
  - name: accountGuid
    description: The account GUID associated with the target player. Used for identifying
      the player's account across different realms.
  - name: flag
    description: A SocialFlag value that specifies the type of relationship to establish
      (e.g., friend, ignore). Valid values are defined in the SocialFlag enumeration.
  returns: Returns true if the player was successfully added to the social list, false
    otherwise. Failure can occur due to invalid GUIDs, invalid flag values, or internal
    database errors.
  examples:
  - title: Add a friend to social list
    code: "PlayerSocial* social = player->GetSocial();\nuint32 targetGuid = 12345;\n\
      uint32 targetAccountGuid = 67890;\nbool result = social->AddToSocialList(targetGuid,\
      \ targetAccountGuid, SOCIAL_FLAG_FRIEND);\nif (result)\n{\n    // Friend added\
      \ successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Add player to ignore list
    code: "PlayerSocial* social = player->GetSocial();\nuint32 targetGuid = 54321;\n\
      uint32 targetAccountGuid = 98765;\nbool result = social->AddToSocialList(targetGuid,\
      \ targetAccountGuid, SOCIAL_FLAG_IGNORE);\nif (!result)\n{\n    // Handle error\
      \ - could not add to ignore list\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the player's social database entries.
    It should only be called when the player is logged in and the social system is
    properly initialized. The method performs validation on GUIDs and flags before
    attempting to store the relationship. Changes made through this method are typically
    persisted to the database immediately.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid GUIDs or account GUIDs can lead to undefined
    behavior or database corruption. Always validate input parameters before calling
    this method. Be aware that adding a player to the ignore list may affect communication
    and interaction with that player in-game.
