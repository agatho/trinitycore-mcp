  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: CanCastAoEAtPosition
  signature: bool LineOfSightManager::CanCastAoEAtPosition(const int & targetPos,
    uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an Area of Effect spell can be cast at a specified position
    based on line of sight and spell restrictions.
  description: The CanCastAoEAtPosition method evaluates if a given Area of Effect
    (AoE) spell can be successfully cast at a specific target position. It checks
    for valid line of sight between the caster and the target location, ensuring that
    no obstacles block the spell's area of effect. This method is crucial for maintaining
    game balance and preventing impossible spell casts in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    environment. The evaluation considers both the physical positioning of the caster
    and target, as well as any spell-specific restrictions or requirements that may
    prevent casting at certain locations.
  parameters:
  - name: targetPos
    description: The target position where the AoE spell is intended to be cast. This
      parameter represents a coordinate or location in the game world that must be
      validated for line of sight and spell restrictions.
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell being evaluated for casting. This
      ID determines which spell-specific rules and restrictions apply to the AoE cast
      validation, including range limitations, spell targeting requirements, and obstacle
      interactions.
  returns: Returns true if the Area of Effect spell can be cast at the specified position
    with valid line of sight and no blocking restrictions; returns false otherwise.
    The method will return false if there are obstacles between the caster and target
    position, or if the spell cannot be cast at that location due to game mechanics
    or spell properties.
  examples:
  - title: Basic AoE Cast Validation
    code: "if (lineOfSightManager->CanCastAoEAtPosition(targetPos, 12345)) {\n   \
      \ // Proceed with casting the AoE spell\n    caster->CastSpell(targetPos, 12345);\n\
      } else {\n    // Cannot cast at this position\n    SendCastFailedMessage();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Spell Validation with Multiple Checks
    code: "uint32 spellId = 98765;\nPosition targetPos = {100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f};\n\
      if (lineOfSightManager->CanCastAoEAtPosition(targetPos, spellId)) {\n    //\
      \ Validate additional conditions before casting\n    if (caster->IsInRange(targetPos,\
      \ GetSpellRange(spellId))) {\n        caster->CastSpell(targetPos, spellId);\n\
      \    }\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid cast position\n    SendInvalidTargetMessage();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs line of sight calculations which can be computationally
    expensive in complex environments with many obstacles. The implementation may
    cache certain results for performance optimization. Developers should be aware
    that this method does not validate spell cooldowns or mana requirements, only
    positional and obstacle-related restrictions.
  warnings: The targetPos parameter must represent a valid position in the game world;
    invalid coordinates may cause undefined behavior. This method assumes the caster
    is already positioned correctly and focuses solely on validating the target location
    for AoE spell casting. Using this method without proper pre-validation of spell
    availability or caster state may lead to incorrect spell behavior.
