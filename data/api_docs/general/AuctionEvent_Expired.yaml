  method: Expired
  signature: AuctionEvent AuctionEvent::Expired(int playerGuid, uint32 auctionId,
    uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new AuctionEvent object representing an expired auction.
  description: The Expired method is a static factory function that constructs and
    initializes a new AuctionEvent instance to represent an auction that has reached
    its expiration time. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore auction
    house system to notify relevant systems or players about the completion of an
    auction. The returned AuctionEvent object contains information about the player
    who placed the bid, the specific auction identifier, and the item that was being
    auctioned. It serves as a mechanism for triggering events or updating game state
    when auctions expire without being purchased.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The globally unique identifier of the player who placed the winning
      bid on the expired auction. This value is used to determine which player should
      receive the item or refund.
  - name: auctionId
    description: The unique identifier assigned to the specific auction instance that
      has expired. This ID corresponds to the auction record in the database and is
      used for tracking and reference purposes.
  - name: itemId
    description: The identifier of the item that was being auctioned. This value represents
      the item template ID from the game's item database, determining what object
      is being sold or returned.
  returns: An AuctionEvent object initialized with the provided player GUID, auction
    ID, and item ID to represent an expired auction event.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: AuctionEvent event = AuctionEvent::Expired(12345, 67890, 54321);
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing Expired Auction Event
    code: "AuctionEvent expiredEvent = AuctionEvent::Expired(playerGuid, auctionId,\
      \ itemId);\n// Process the event to handle item delivery or refund\nif (expiredEvent.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Trigger appropriate game logic for expired auction\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the auction house system and may
    be called when an auction timer expires. The returned AuctionEvent object should
    be processed immediately to ensure proper handling of item delivery or refunds.
    This function does not perform any database operations directly but creates a
    representation that can be used by other systems.
  warnings: Ensure that playerGuid, auctionId, and itemId are valid values before
    calling this method. Invalid identifiers may cause issues in downstream processing
    logic. The method assumes all parameters are properly validated as they would
    be from the auction house system's internal state.
