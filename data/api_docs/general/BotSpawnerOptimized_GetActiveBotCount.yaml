  method: GetActiveBotCount
  signature: uint32 BotSpawnerOptimized::GetActiveBotCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of active bot instances managed by this spawner.
  description: The GetActiveBotCount method retrieves the number of currently active
    bot instances that are being managed by the BotSpawnerOptimized class. This count
    typically includes bots that are in an operational state, such as those that are
    spawned, initialized, and actively participating in gameplay or AI routines. The
    method is designed to provide a quick overview of the current bot population under
    the spawner's control without requiring iteration through all managed entities.
    It is commonly used for monitoring, balancing, or triggering events based on active
    bot thresholds.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of active bots currently managed
    by this spawner instance. Returns zero if no bots are active or if the spawner
    has not been initialized with any active bots.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Active Bots
    code: "uint32 activeCount = botSpawner->GetActiveBotCount();\nif (activeCount\
      \ > 10)\n{\n    // Trigger some action when more than 10 bots are active\n \
      \   sLog->outString(\"Warning: %u bots currently active.\", activeCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Active Bot Count for Resource Management
    code: "uint32 currentBots = botSpawner->GetActiveBotCount();\nif (currentBots\
      \ < MAX_BOTS_ALLOWED)\n{\n    // Spawn a new bot if under the limit\n    botSpawner->SpawnNextBot();\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Log or handle when max bots reached\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Maximum bot limit reached (%u)\", currentBots);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented using a cached or atomic counter for
    performance reasons, especially in high-frequency scenarios. It may not reflect
    real-time changes if the internal state is updated asynchronously. The method
    is thread-safe if the underlying data structure supports concurrent access.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotSpawnerOptimized instance is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as it might return unexpected values if used on an uninitialized
    or improperly configured spawner. Avoid relying on this count for critical game
    logic without verifying the actual bot states.
