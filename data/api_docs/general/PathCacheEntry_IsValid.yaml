  class: PathCacheEntry
  method: IsValid
  signature: bool PathCacheEntry::IsValid(const int & start, const int & goal, float
    tolerance) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the path cache entry is valid for the given start and goal nodes
    within the specified tolerance.
  description: The IsValid method determines whether a cached path in the PathCacheEntry
    is still considered valid for navigation purposes. It evaluates if the start and
    goal node indices match the provided values, ensuring that the cached path can
    be used without recalculation. This validation is crucial for performance optimization
    in pathfinding systems where recalculating paths frequently would be costly. The
    tolerance parameter allows for minor variations in positions to account for dynamic
    changes in the environment or small discrepancies in node positioning. The method
    returns true if all conditions are met, indicating that the cached path can be
    safely used.
  parameters:
  - name: start
    description: The index of the starting node in the pathfinding graph. Must be
      a valid node index within the navigation mesh.
  - name: goal
    description: The index of the goal node in the pathfinding graph. Must be a valid
      node index within the navigation mesh.
  - name: tolerance
    description: A floating-point value representing the acceptable deviation from
      the original start and goal positions. Used to account for minor environmental
      changes or positioning inaccuracies.
  returns: Returns true if the path cache entry is valid for the specified start and
    goal nodes within the given tolerance; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of IsValid
    code: "PathCacheEntry cacheEntry;\n// Assume cacheEntry has been populated with\
      \ a valid cached path\nbool isValid = cacheEntry.IsValid(10, 25, 0.5f);\nif\
      \ (isValid) {\n    // Use the cached path\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsValid in a pathfinding context
    code: "class NavigationSystem {\npublic:\n    bool FindPath(int startNode, int\
      \ goalNode, float tolerance) {\n        PathCacheEntry* entry = GetCachedPath(startNode,\
      \ goalNode);\n        if (entry && entry->IsValid(startNode, goalNode, tolerance))\
      \ {\n            // Use cached path\n            return true;\n        }\n \
      \       // Recalculate path\n        return false;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other pathfinding utilities
    to avoid unnecessary recalculation of paths. It's important to note that the tolerance
    value should be tuned based on the specific requirements of your game world to
    balance between performance and accuracy.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of the tolerance parameter may lead to either excessive
    recalculation or invalid path usage, potentially causing navigation issues in
    the game world.
