  class: AIDecisionProfiler
  method: SetAlertThresholds
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::SetAlertThresholds(double maxDecisionTime, double
    minSuccessRate)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum decision time and minimum success rate thresholds for AI
    decision profiling.
  description: The SetAlertThresholds method configures two critical thresholds used
    by the AIDecisionProfiler to monitor and alert on AI performance issues. The maxDecisionTime
    parameter defines the upper limit (in seconds) for acceptable AI decision-making
    duration, while minSuccessRate specifies the minimum acceptable success rate for
    AI decisions. When AI decision times exceed maxDecisionTime or success rates fall
    below minSuccessRate, the profiler will trigger alerts to help identify potential
    performance bottlenecks or AI logic issues. This method is typically used during
    development and debugging phases to maintain optimal AI behavior in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore environment.
  parameters:
  - name: maxDecisionTime
    description: Maximum allowed time (in seconds) for a single AI decision to be
      processed. If any AI decision exceeds this threshold, an alert will be triggered.
  - name: minSuccessRate
    description: Minimum acceptable success rate (as a decimal between 0.0 and 1.0)
      for AI decisions. If the overall success rate falls below this value, an alert
      will be triggered.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      profiler.SetAlertThresholds(0.1, 0.85); // Alert if decision time > 100ms or
      success rate < 85%'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Setup
    code: "AIDecisionProfiler* aiProfiler = sObjectMgr->GetAIDecisionProfiler();\n\
      if (aiProfiler)\n{\n    aiProfiler->SetAlertThresholds(0.05, 0.90); // Strict\
      \ thresholds for performance monitoring\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the profiling behavior of AI decisions in TrinityCore.
    The thresholds are applied immediately upon calling this method and will impact
    all subsequent AI decision evaluations. For optimal performance, set these values
    based on empirical data from your specific server environment.
  warnings: Setting thresholds too low may cause false positive alerts during normal
    operation. Setting thresholds too high might miss actual performance issues. Ensure
    that the maxDecisionTime value accounts for potential server load variations and
    network latency.
