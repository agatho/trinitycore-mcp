  class: PlayerAtMinimumRangeAway
  method: PlayerAtMinimumRangeAway
  signature: void PlayerAtMinimumRangeAway::PlayerAtMinimumRangeAway(const int * unit,
    float fMinRange)
documentation:
  brief: Moves a player to the minimum specified range away from a given unit.
  description: The PlayerAtMinimumRangeAway method is used in TrinityCore's AI system
    to instruct a player character to move to a position that maintains a minimum
    distance from a specified unit. This functionality is commonly utilized in AI
    behaviors where characters need to maintain a safe or optimal distance from targets,
    such as during combat or scripted events. The method operates by calculating the
    appropriate movement vector and initiating a movement action to ensure the player
    remains at least the specified minimum range away from the target unit.
  parameters:
  - name: unit
    description: Pointer to the target unit from which the player should maintain
      minimum range. Must be a valid pointer to a Unit object, or nullptr to indicate
      no target.
  - name: fMinRange
    description: The minimum distance (in yards) that the player should maintain away
      from the specified unit. Must be a non-negative floating-point value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to maintain minimum range from a target unit
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetVictim();\nif (target)\n{\n    PlayerAtMinimumRangeAway(player,\
      \ target, 5.0f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with nullptr to clear range behavior
    code: PlayerAtMinimumRangeAway(player, nullptr, 0.0f);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within AI update loops or event handlers where
    dynamic positioning is required. It may interact with the player's movement queue
    and could potentially override existing movement commands. The implementation
    likely uses pathfinding algorithms to determine the correct position.
  warnings: Ensure that the unit pointer passed is valid and not destroyed before
    the movement completes. Passing invalid pointers can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Also, be aware that this method may conflict with other movement-related
    AI behaviors if not properly synchronized.
