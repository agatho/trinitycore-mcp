  method: SetDisplayId
  signature: void Creature::SetDisplayId(uint32 displayId, bool setNative)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the display ID of a creature to change its visual appearance.
  description: The SetDisplayId method allows developers to modify a creature's visual
    representation by changing its model display ID. This method is commonly used
    in creature AI scripts or when creating custom NPC behavior. The display ID determines
    what the creature looks like in-game, including its size, shape, and visual characteristics.
    When setNative is true, the native display ID of the creature is preserved; otherwise,
    it will be overridden with the new display ID.
  parameters:
  - name: displayId
    description: The new display ID to set for the creature. This value corresponds
      to the creature's model ID in the game database and determines its visual appearance.
  - name: setNative
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether to preserve or override the native
      display ID of the creature. If true, the native display ID is maintained; if
      false, it is overridden by the new displayId.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = GetCreature();

      creature->SetDisplayId(12345, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = GetCreature();

      uint32 displayId = 98765;

      bool setNative = true;

      creature->SetDisplayId(displayId, setNative);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the creature's visual appearance in real-time and should
    be used carefully during creature AI scripting. The display ID must correspond
    to valid models in the game database; invalid display IDs may cause visual glitches
    or crashes. This method is typically used in conjunction with other creature methods
    like SetDisplayId() or when creating custom NPC behavior.
  warnings: Setting an invalid display ID can cause visual artifacts or crashes. Care
    should be taken when using this method during creature AI scripts, especially
    when dealing with multiple creatures simultaneously. Avoid setting display IDs
    that are not present in the database.
