documentation:
  brief: Sets or removes the favorite status of a collection item for the player.
  description: The HandleCollectionItemSetFavorite method processes a client request
    to mark or unmark a specific item in the player's collections as a favorite. This
    functionality allows players to organize their collected items by flagging important
    ones for quick access or personal preference. The method typically handles communication
    between the client and server, updating internal collection data structures and
    potentially synchronizing changes with the database. It is part of the Collections
    system introduced in World of Warcraft to manage player achievements, mounts,
    pets, and other collectible content.
  parameters:
  - name: collectionItemSetFavorite
    description: A packet object containing information about which collection item
      to set as favorite and its new favorite status. This includes the item's ID
      and a boolean flag indicating whether it should be marked as favorite or not.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Marking an Item as Favorite
    code: 'WorldPackets::Collections::CollectionItemSetFavorite packet;

      packet.ItemID = 12345;

      packet.IsFavorite = true;

      this->HandleCollectionItemSetFavorite(packet);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers database updates to persist the favorite status
    across sessions. It may also send feedback packets back to the client to visually
    update the UI state of the collection item.
