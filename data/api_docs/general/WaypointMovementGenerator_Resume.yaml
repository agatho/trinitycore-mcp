  signature: void WaypointMovementGenerator::Resume(uint32 overrideTimer)
documentation:
  brief: Resumes waypoint movement for a creature with an optional override timer.
  description: The Resume method is used to continue waypoint-based movement for a
    creature that was previously paused or stopped. It allows the creature to resume
    its path from where it left off, optionally overriding the default delay timer.
    This method is typically called when a creature needs to continue following a
    predefined path after an interruption, such as during combat or scripted events.
    The overrideTimer parameter can be used to specify a custom delay before the next
    waypoint is reached, which may be useful for creating dynamic movement behaviors
    or synchronizing with other game events.
  parameters:
  - name: overrideTimer
    description: An optional timer value in milliseconds that overrides the default
      waypoint delay. If set to 0, the original waypoint timer is used. This allows
      for dynamic adjustment of movement speed or timing during scripted sequences.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resume Usage
    code: 'WaypointMovementGenerator* movementGen = ...;

      movementGen->Resume(); // Resumes with default timer'
    language: cpp
  - title: Resume with Custom Timer Override
    code: 'WaypointMovementGenerator* movementGen = ...;

      movementGen->Resume(2000); // Resumes with 2 second override timer'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on creatures that are currently using a
    WaypointMovementGenerator. The method does not validate whether the creature is
    actually paused or stopped; it simply resumes movement according to the generator's
    state. The overrideTimer value will affect subsequent waypoints until another
    Resume call is made.
  warnings: Calling Resume on a creature that is not actively following waypoints
    may lead to undefined behavior or movement glitches. Ensure the creature has an
    active waypoint path before calling this method. Using a very small overrideTimer
    value (e.g., less than 10ms) may cause performance issues due to excessive movement
    updates.
