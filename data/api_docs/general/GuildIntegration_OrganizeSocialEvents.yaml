  brief: Organizes and schedules social events for guild members
  description: The OrganizeSocialEvents method handles the coordination and scheduling
    of social gatherings within a guild context. This function likely manages event
    creation, member invitations, time coordination, and event logistics to facilitate
    guild social activities. The method operates on the guild's social infrastructure
    and may interact with player data structures to ensure proper event participation.
    It serves as a central hub for organizing community-building activities that enhance
    guild cohesion and player engagement.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier or index
      within the guild's social system. This parameter likely specifies which player's
      data should be processed for event organization, though exact usage depends
      on internal implementation details.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Organization
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildIntegration;

      guildIntegration.OrganizeSocialEvents(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild data structures and may
    require proper guild membership validation. Implementation details are speculative
    as source code is not provided, but it's expected to handle player synchronization
    and event state management.
  warnings: The parameter 'player' should be a valid pointer to ensure proper memory
    access. Improper handling of this pointer could lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes in the game environment.
