  class: ObstacleUtils
  method: PredictPosition
  signature: int ObstacleUtils::PredictPosition(const int & current, const int & velocity,
    float timeAhead)
documentation:
  brief: Predicts the future position of an object based on its current position,
    velocity, and time ahead.
  description: The PredictPosition method calculates the expected location of an object
    at a specified future time by using its current position, velocity, and the time
    interval. This utility is commonly used in game mechanics for anticipating movement,
    pathfinding, or collision detection. The calculation assumes linear motion without
    acceleration or external forces. It's particularly useful in scenarios where objects
    move with constant velocity over time, such as projectiles, NPCs, or player characters
    in real-time simulations.
  parameters:
  - name: current
    description: The current position of the object as an integer value. This represents
      the starting point for prediction.
  - name: velocity
    description: The velocity of the object as an integer value. Positive values indicate
      movement in the forward direction, negative in reverse.
  - name: timeAhead
    description: The time interval (in seconds) into the future for which to predict
      the position. Must be a non-negative floating-point number.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the predicted position of the object after
    the specified time interval. The value is calculated as current + (velocity *
    timeAhead).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Position Prediction
    code: 'int currentPosition = 100;

      int velocity = 50;

      float time = 2.0f;

      int predictedPosition = ObstacleUtils::PredictPosition(currentPosition, velocity,
      time);

      // Result: 200 (100 + 50 * 2)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Negative Velocity Prediction
    code: 'int currentPosition = 150;

      int velocity = -30;

      float time = 3.0f;

      int predictedPosition = ObstacleUtils::PredictPosition(currentPosition, velocity,
      time);

      // Result: 60 (150 + (-30) * 3)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs simple linear extrapolation and does not account for
    acceleration, gravity, or other dynamic forces. It's intended for basic movement
    prediction in environments where velocity remains constant. The method is thread-safe
    as it only performs read-only calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that timeAhead is non-negative to avoid unexpected behavior. Be
    cautious when using large time values with high velocities, as they may result
    in integer overflow if the resulting position exceeds the range of int type.
