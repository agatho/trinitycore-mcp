  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: CalculateTravelTime
  signature: float QuestTurnIn::CalculateTravelTime(Player * bot, const int & destination)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the travel time in seconds for a bot to reach a specified destination
    quest location.
  description: The CalculateTravelTime method computes the estimated time required
    for a player bot to travel from its current position to a given quest destination.
    This calculation takes into account various factors such as distance, movement
    speed, and potential obstacles or pathfinding complexities within the game world.
    The returned float value represents the time in seconds needed to complete the
    journey. This method is typically used in automated questing systems to determine
    optimal timing for quest turn-ins or to manage bot behavior based on travel duration.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will perform
      the travel
  - name: destination
    description: Integer identifier representing the quest destination, likely corresponding
      to a quest objective or NPC location
  returns: A float value representing the estimated travel time in seconds required
    for the bot to reach the specified destination. Returns 0.0 if the destination
    is invalid or unreachable.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CalculateTravelTime
    code: "Player* myBot = ...;\nint questDestination = 12345;\nfloat travelTime =\
      \ QuestTurnIn::CalculateTravelTime(myBot, questDestination);\nif (travelTime\
      \ > 0.0f) {\n    // Proceed with quest turn-in logic\n    printf(\"Estimated\
      \ travel time: %.2f seconds\\n\", travelTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using travel time for decision making
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nint destinationId = GetQuestDestinationId();\nfloat\
      \ timeToDestination = QuestTurnIn::CalculateTravelTime(bot, destinationId);\n\
      if (timeToDestination < 30.0f) {\n    // Travel is quick, proceed immediately\n\
      \    CompleteQuest();\n} else {\n    // Travel takes too long, consider alternative\
      \ strategy\n    ScheduleForLater();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses pathfinding algorithms internally to determine the
    most efficient route between the bot's current location and the destination. The
    accuracy of the travel time calculation depends on the game's pathfinding system
    and may vary based on terrain, obstacles, or dynamic world conditions. Performance-wise,
    this method should be called sparingly in high-frequency loops as it may involve
    complex calculations.
  warnings: The method assumes that the bot is capable of reaching the destination
    without encountering any temporary blockers or dynamic changes to the environment.
    If the destination ID is invalid or the path cannot be calculated, the method
    may return 0.0 or an unexpectedly large value, which should be handled gracefully
    by calling code.
