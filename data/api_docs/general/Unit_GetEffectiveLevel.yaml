  method: GetEffectiveLevel
  signature: uint8 Unit::GetEffectiveLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the effective level of the unit, accounting for level scaling and
    other game mechanics.
  description: The GetEffectiveLevel method retrieves the actual level of a Unit object,
    which may differ from the standard level due to game mechanics such as level scaling,
    experience penalties, or other factors. This method is commonly used in World
    of Warcraft client-side scripting and server-side code to determine a unit's true
    level for combat calculations, quest progression, and other gameplay interactions.
    The effective level can be higher or lower than the regular level depending on
    the unit's circumstances.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the effective level of the unit. This
    value may be greater than or less than the standard level depending on game mechanics
    such as level scaling, experience penalties, or other factors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint8 level = unit->GetEffectiveLevel();\n// Use level in calculations\n\
      if (level > 10)\n{\n    // Perform actions based on effective level\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other unit-related methods
    to determine overall unit stats. The value returned may vary depending on the
    unit's type (player, npc, pet, etc.) and game mechanics applied.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it may return different
    values than expected due to level scaling or experience penalties. This method
    is not suitable for direct comparison with standard level without considering
    game mechanics.
