  brief: Unregisters all registered callbacks from the bot spawner event system
  description: The UnregisterCallbacks method removes all previously registered callback
    functions from the IBotSpawnerEvents interface. This method is typically called
    when cleaning up or shutting down bot spawning functionality to prevent memory
    leaks and ensure proper resource management. The method does not take any parameters
    and performs no return operations. It is designed to be called after all necessary
    callbacks have been registered using RegisterCallbacks, ensuring that no dangling
    references remain in the event system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'IBotSpawnerEvents* spawnerEvents = GetBotSpawnerEvents();

      spawnerEvents->UnregisterCallbacks();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before destroying the IBotSpawnerEvents instance
    to prevent potential memory leaks or access violations. The method assumes that
    all callbacks were properly registered through the corresponding RegisterCallbacks
    method.
