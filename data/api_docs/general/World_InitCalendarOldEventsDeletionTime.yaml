  class: World

  signature: void World::InitCalendarOldEventsDeletionTime()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the calendar old events deletion time for the world.
  description: This method sets up the initial timestamp for when old calendar events
    should be deleted from the database. It is typically called during server startup
    or initialization to establish the baseline for event cleanup operations. The
    method ensures that the system knows when to begin purging expired calendar events,
    which helps maintain database performance and keeps the calendar system clean
    of outdated entries. This functionality is part of the broader calendar management
    system in TrinityCore, ensuring that old events are automatically removed after
    a configurable time period.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: World::instance()->InitCalendarOldEventsDeletionTime();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked during World::Initialize() or similar startup
    routines. It does not perform the actual deletion but rather sets up the timing
    mechanism for future cleanup operations. The actual deletion of old events is
    handled by a separate periodic task that checks against this initialized timestamp.
