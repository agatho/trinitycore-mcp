  class: EquipmentManager
  method: GetEquippedItemInSlot
  signature: int * EquipmentManager::GetEquippedItemInSlot(int * player, uint8 slot)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the item ID of the equipped item in the specified inventory slot
    for a given player.
  description: The GetEquippedItemInSlot method retrieves the item ID of an item currently
    equipped in a specific inventory slot for the provided player. This method is
    commonly used in World of Warcraft server-side scripting and addon development
    to query a player's current equipment state. The method takes a pointer to a player
    object and a slot index, returning a pointer to an integer that represents the
    item's ID. If no item is equipped in the specified slot, or if the player or slot
    is invalid, the method may return NULL or a default value indicating no item.
    This functionality is essential for implementing gear-related game mechanics such
    as stat calculation, item validation, and equipment management.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the player whose equipped
      items are being queried. Must be a valid player instance or the method will
      likely result in undefined behavior.
  - name: slot
    description: The inventory slot index to query for an equipped item. Valid values
      typically range from 0 to 18, representing different equipment slots such as
      head, shoulders, chest, hands, etc. Slot indices are defined by the game's internal
      inventory system.
  returns: Returns a pointer to an integer representing the item ID of the equipped
    item in the specified slot. If no item is equipped or if an error occurs (e.g.,
    invalid player or slot), the method may return NULL or a default value indicating
    no item.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player object\nint* itemId = EquipmentManager::GetEquippedItemInSlot(player,\
      \ EQUIPMENT_SLOT_HEAD);\nif (itemId != nullptr) {\n    printf(\"Head item ID:\
      \ %d\\n\", *itemId);\n} else {\n    printf(\"No item equipped in head slot.\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterating Through All Equipment Slots
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player object\nfor (int slot = EQUIPMENT_SLOT_START;\
      \ slot < EQUIPMENT_SLOT_END; ++slot) {\n    int* itemId = EquipmentManager::GetEquippedItemInSlot(player,\
      \ slot);\n    if (itemId != nullptr && *itemId > 0) {\n        printf(\"Slot\
      \ %d: Item ID %d\\n\", slot, *itemId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'This method is part of the EquipmentManager class and assumes that the player
    object passed is valid and properly initialized. The slot parameter must be within
    the valid range for equipment slots. Performance considerations: This method accesses
    player inventory data, which may involve database lookups or cached data access
    depending on implementation. Thread safety: If used in a multi-threaded environment,
    ensure proper synchronization of player data access.'
  warnings: Passing an invalid player pointer or an out-of-range slot index can lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate the input parameters before
    calling this method. Be cautious when using returned pointers; they may become
    invalid if the player's equipment changes during the same execution cycle.
