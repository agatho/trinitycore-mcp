  method: SetRated
  signature: void Battleground::SetRated(bool state)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the rated status flag for the battleground.
  description: The SetRated method configures whether the battleground is designated
    as a rated match. This flag affects how player ratings are updated, rewards are
    distributed, and the battleground is categorized within the game's matchmaking
    system. When set to true, the battleground will apply rated matchmaking rules
    and update player arena or Battleground ratings accordingly. When set to false,
    it operates as an unrated match with no rating changes. This method is typically
    called during battleground initialization or when transitioning between rated
    and unrated modes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Battleground as Rated
    code: 'Battleground* bg = sObjectMgr->GetBattleground(1234);

      bg->SetRated(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting a Battleground as Unrated
    code: 'Battleground* bg = sObjectMgr->GetBattleground(5678);

      bg->SetRated(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the battleground and
    should only be called during appropriate initialization or state transition phases.
    The rated status affects player statistics, rewards, and matchmaking behavior,
    so it must be set before players join the battleground.
  warnings: Setting the rated status after players have joined the battleground may
    lead to inconsistent rating updates or reward distribution. Always ensure this
    method is called before the battleground becomes active for players.
