  signature: bool Unit::SetEnableFullSpeedTurning(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables full-speed turning for the unit.
  description: This method controls whether a unit can perform full-speed turning,
    which allows it to rotate at maximum speed without any movement restrictions.
    It is commonly used in game mechanics where units need to be able to turn quickly,
    such as during combat or when executing specific actions. The method returns true
    if the operation was successful, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit's turning behavior was successfully enabled or
    disabled, false if the operation failed or was not applicable.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* unit = new Unit();\nbool result = unit->SetEnableFullSpeedTurning(true);\n\
      if (result) {\n    // Turning behavior enabled\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the unit's movement speed and rotation capabilities.
    It should be used carefully in scenarios involving combat or movement restrictions,
    as it may impact performance or game balance.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior during gameplay,
    especially if the unit is moving while turning at full speed. Avoid using this
    method in situations where precise control over movement and rotation is required.
