  class: Spell
  method: GetChannelDuration
  signature: int32 Spell::GetChannelDuration() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the channel duration of the spell in milliseconds.
  description: This method retrieves the channel duration of a spell, which represents
    the time period during which a spell is actively being channeled. The value is
    typically used for determining how long a player must remain in position to maintain
    a channel. This is particularly relevant for spells that require sustained casting
    or channeling, such as certain healing spells or damage-over-time effects. The
    method returns the duration in milliseconds, which can be used for calculating
    time-based mechanics and cooldowns.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the channel duration in milliseconds, representing how long the
    spell will remain channeled. A value of 0 indicates no channeling is required
    or that the spell has no channel duration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int32 duration = spell->GetChannelDuration();\nif (duration > 0)\n{\n \
      \   // Process channel duration\n    // Do something with duration\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related functions
    to determine the timing of channeling effects. It may be affected by various factors
    such as spell modifiers, talent effects, or player buffs that alter channel duration.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with spells that have no channel duration,
    as it may return 0 which can lead to incorrect assumptions about the spell's behavior.
    Always verify the context of the spell being examined.
