  signature: bool AttackAction::IsUseful(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the attack action is beneficial or useful for the bot
    AI in the current game context.
  description: The IsUseful method evaluates if a specific attack action should be
    considered for execution by the bot's AI. It takes into account various factors
    such as the bot's current health, target status, available resources, and combat
    situation to decide whether performing this particular attack would be advantageous.
    This method is typically called during the AI decision-making process to filter
    out ineffective or counterproductive actions before they are executed. The evaluation
    considers both immediate tactical benefits and long-term strategic implications
    of executing the attack.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the attack action is deemed beneficial or useful in the
    current context, false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the AI
    should consider executing this attack action, while false suggests it should be
    avoided or skipped.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (attackAction.IsUseful(ai)) {\n    ai->ExecuteAction(attackAction);\n\
      } else {\n    // Consider alternative actions\n    ai->SelectNextAction();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot AI's decision-making framework and should
    be called frequently during combat situations. The implementation likely includes
    checks for target validity, resource availability, and situational awareness to
    determine action usefulness.
