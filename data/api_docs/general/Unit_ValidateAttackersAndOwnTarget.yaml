documentation:
  brief: Validates and updates attacker lists and target references for unit
  description: This method ensures that a Unit's attacker list and target reference
    are properly validated and updated. It typically occurs during combat or when
    the unit's state changes, ensuring that the unit maintains accurate references
    to its attackers and target. The method is crucial for maintaining proper game
    mechanics related to combat behavior and target selection. This validation helps
    prevent issues with targeting and attacker tracking during active combat situations.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->ValidateAttackersAndOwnTarget();

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat state changes or when the unit's
    target reference needs to be refreshed. It may involve updating internal attacker
    lists and target references, which could impact performance if called frequently
    during active combat.
  warnings: This method should not be called outside of combat context unless explicitly
    required by game mechanics. Improper use can lead to incorrect targeting behavior
    or attacker tracking issues.
