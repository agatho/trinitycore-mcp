documentation:
  brief: Calculates the chance for a proc to occur based on weapon speed and PPM rate
  description: The GetPPMProcChance method determines the probability that a spell
    will proc based on the weapon speed of the attacking weapon and the PPM (Parts
    Per Minute) rate specified in the spell's data. This method is commonly used in
    World of Warcraft to calculate proc chances for abilities that have a PPM-based
    chance to trigger, such as those found on weapons or gear items. It takes into
    account the weapon's attack speed and the PPM value defined in the spell's information
    to compute the final proc chance.
  parameters:
  - name: WeaponSpeed
    description: The speed of the weapon being used, typically measured in milliseconds
      (ms). This parameter affects how often a proc can occur based on the weapon's
      attack rate.
  - name: PPM
    description: The PPM (Parts Per Minute) value for the spell, representing how
      many times per minute the spell will proc. This value is usually defined in
      the SpellInfo structure and affects the final chance calculation.
  - name: spellProto
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure that defines the spell being evaluated.
      This contains information about the spell's properties, including PPM rate,
      which is used in the calculation.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the probability (in percent) that the
    spell will proc. The value ranges from 0.0 to 100.0, where 0.0 means no chance
    of proc and 100.0 means full chance of proc occurring.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: float chance = unit->GetPPMProcChance(1000, 1.5f, spellInfo);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "float chance = unit->GetPPMProcChance(WeaponSpeed, PPM, spellProto);\n\
      if (chance > 0.0f) {\n    // Proc will occur with this probability\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is used in conjunction with other proc-related calculations to
    determine how often a spell will trigger based on weapon speed and PPM rate. It
    is typically used in the context of calculating proc chances for abilities that
    are not directly tied to base attack speed but rather to PPM values.
  warnings: The method assumes that the spellProto parameter is valid and contains
    correct PPM information. If the SpellInfo structure is malformed or missing PPM
    data, the result may be incorrect or undefined.
