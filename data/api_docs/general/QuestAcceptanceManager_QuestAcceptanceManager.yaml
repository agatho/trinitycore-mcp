  class: QuestAcceptanceManager
  method: QuestAcceptanceManager
  signature: void QuestAcceptanceManager::QuestAcceptanceManager(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new QuestAcceptanceManager instance for the specified bot.
  description: The QuestAcceptanceManager constructor initializes a new instance of
    the QuestAcceptanceManager class, which is responsible for handling quest acceptance
    logic within the TrinityCore framework. This method sets up internal state and
    data structures necessary for managing quest acceptance behavior for a specific
    bot character. The manager typically handles quest-related events such as quest
    start, completion, and acceptance validation. It ensures that the bot follows
    proper quest progression rules and maintains consistency with the game's quest
    system mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot character instance that this manager will handle
      quest acceptance for. This parameter must be a valid pointer to a Bot object
      or derived class, otherwise undefined behavior may occur.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic QuestAcceptanceManager Initialization
    code: 'Bot* myBot = new Bot();

      QuestAcceptanceManager manager(myBot);

      // The manager is now initialized and ready to handle quest acceptance for myBot'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using QuestAcceptanceManager with Existing Bot Instance
    code: "class MyBot : public Bot {\npublic:\n    void InitializeQuestManager()\
      \ {\n        questAcceptanceManager = new QuestAcceptanceManager(this);\n  \
      \  }\n};\n\nMyBot* bot = new MyBot();\nbot->InitializeQuestManager();"
    language: cpp
  notes: The QuestAcceptanceManager constructor does not perform any asynchronous
    operations. It's recommended to initialize this manager after the bot object has
    been fully constructed and configured. The manager assumes that the provided bot
    pointer remains valid for the lifetime of the manager instance.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the bot parameter will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the bot object is properly initialized before passing it to this constructor.
    The manager does not take ownership of the bot pointer, so the caller must ensure
    proper memory management.
