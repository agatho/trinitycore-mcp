  signature: void QuestCompletion::HandleObjectiveTimeout(Player * bot, QuestObjectiveData
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Handles timeout events for quest objectives in the bot's quest completion
    system.
  description: The HandleObjectiveTimeout method processes timeout scenarios for individual
    quest objectives assigned to a player bot. This method is typically invoked when
    a quest objective reaches its time limit without being completed, triggering appropriate
    cleanup or alternative behavior within the quest completion logic. The method
    ensures that timed quest elements are properly managed and that the bot's quest
    state reflects the timeout condition. It may update internal tracking data, send
    notifications, or modify quest progress depending on the specific implementation
    details of the quest system.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose quest objective
      has timed out. Must not be null.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to QuestObjectiveData structure containing details about
      the specific quest objective that timed out. This includes objective type, progress
      state, and associated quest information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic timeout handling for a bot
    code: "void example() {\n    Player* bot = ...; // Get bot player instance\n \
      \   QuestObjectiveData objective;\n    // Initialize objective data\n    QuestCompletion\
      \ completion;\n    completion.HandleObjectiveTimeout(bot, objective);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the automated quest handling system and should be
    called only when a quest objective has actually timed out. The method assumes
    that all necessary validation has been performed before invocation.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot pointer and objective data are valid before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior or crashes. This method may modify internal
    quest state, so it should not be called during other concurrent quest operations.
