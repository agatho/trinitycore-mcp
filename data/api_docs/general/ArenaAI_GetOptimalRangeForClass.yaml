  class: ArenaAI
  method: GetOptimalRangeForClass
  signature: float ArenaAI::GetOptimalRangeForClass(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal attack range for a player class within
    an arena environment.
  description: The GetOptimalRangeForClass method determines the ideal distance at
    which a player should engage enemies during arena combat based on their class-specific
    mechanics. This method is typically used by the ArenaAI system to guide NPC behavior
    and decision-making during competitive gameplay. The returned float value represents
    the squared distance (to avoid expensive square root calculations) that defines
    the optimal engagement range for the specified player class. This calculation
    considers class-specific abilities, weapon types, and movement characteristics
    relevant to arena combat dynamics.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's class identifier.
      Valid values correspond to TrinityCore's PlayerClassFlag constants (e.g., CLASS_WARRIOR
      = 1, CLASS_PALADIN = 2, etc.). The value must be a valid class enumeration or
      the method may return incorrect results.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the squared optimal attack range for
    the given player class. This value is typically used in distance comparisons to
    determine when an enemy is within acceptable combat range. A negative or zero
    value indicates an invalid class identifier or calculation error.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int playerClass = CLASS_WARRIOR;\nfloat optimalRange = arenaAI->GetOptimalRangeForClass(&playerClass);\n\
      if (optimalRange > 0)\n{\n    // Use the calculated range for AI decision making\n\
      \    printf(\"Optimal range for warrior: %f\\n\", sqrt(optimalRange));\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple Classes
    code: "enum PlayerClass {\n    CLASS_WARRIOR = 1,\n    CLASS_MAGE = 8,\n    CLASS_ROGUE\
      \ = 4\n};\n\nint classes[] = {CLASS_WARRIOR, CLASS_MAGE, CLASS_ROGUE};\nfor\
      \ (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i)\n{\n    float range = arenaAI->GetOptimalRangeForClass(&classes[i]);\n\
      \    printf(\"Class %d optimal range: %f\\n\", classes[i], range);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ArenaAI system and assumes that player class data
    has been properly initialized. The returned value represents squared distance
    for performance reasons, so users should take care when comparing with regular
    distance values. The implementation may vary based on game balance adjustments
    or patch updates.
  warnings: Passing an invalid class identifier through the player parameter may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect range calculations. Always validate input parameters
    before calling this method. Since this is a const method, it does not modify internal
    state but relies on external class data for accurate results.
