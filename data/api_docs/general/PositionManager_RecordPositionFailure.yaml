documentation:
  brief: Records a position failure with associated reason for debugging and logging
    purposes
  description: The RecordPositionFailure method logs information about a position-related
    failure within the TrinityCore system. This method is typically used during movement
    validation, pathfinding, or position synchronization processes to track when a
    position cannot be properly handled or validated. The recorded data includes the
    position identifier and a descriptive reason for the failure, which can be invaluable
    for debugging issues related to player movement, object placement, or spatial
    calculations in the game world. This method does not alter any game state but
    serves purely as a diagnostic tool for developers and system administrators.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position identifier or index that failed validation. This is
      typically an integer representing a specific location within the game world's
      coordinate system or a reference to a particular position in a list or array.
  - name: reason
    description: A descriptive string explaining why the position failed. This should
      contain meaningful information about the nature of the failure, such as 'Invalid
      coordinates', 'Out of bounds', or 'Collision detected'.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Position Failure Recording
    code: 'PositionManager::RecordPositionFailure(12345, "Invalid coordinates: X=100000,
      Y=200000");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Movement Validation Failure
    code: "if (!ValidateMovementPosition(playerPos)) {\n    PositionManager::RecordPositionFailure(playerPos.GetPositionX(),\
      \ \"Movement validation failed for player at X:\" + std::to_string(playerPos.GetPositionX()));\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with logging systems to maintain
    a history of position-related issues. It may be called from multiple threads during
    concurrent movement processing, so thread safety considerations should be taken
    into account if the underlying logging mechanism isn't thread-safe.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'pos' parameter represents a valid position identifier
    to avoid confusion in logs. The reason string should be sanitized to prevent injection
    of malicious content if it originates from user input or external sources.
