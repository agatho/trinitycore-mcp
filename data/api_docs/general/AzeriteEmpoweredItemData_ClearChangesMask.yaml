  signature: void AzeriteEmpoweredItemData::ClearChangesMask()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the Azerite empowered item data.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with an Azerite empowered item. This mask is typically used to track which properties
    or aspects of the item have been modified since the last synchronization or update.
    Clearing the mask effectively marks all changes as 'processed' or 'synced', ensuring
    that subsequent operations will not consider previously modified state as dirty.
    In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this method is commonly used
    during item serialization, network updates, or when preparing data for transmission
    to clients.

  - title: Basic usage in item update logic
    code: 'AzeriteEmpoweredItemData* itemData = player->GetAzeriteEmpoweredItemData();

      itemData->ClearChangesMask();

      // Item data is now considered clean for synchronization'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after applying changes to an Azerite empowered
    item and before sending updates to the client. It ensures that only new modifications
    are transmitted, improving network efficiency.
