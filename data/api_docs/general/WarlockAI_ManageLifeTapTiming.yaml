documentation:
  brief: Manages the timing and execution of Life Tap spell casts for warlock AI.
  description: The ManageLifeTapTiming method controls when a warlock AI character
    should cast the Life Tap spell based on mana and health conditions. This method
    evaluates the current state of the warlock's resources and determines whether
    it is optimal to use Life Tap to gain mana at the cost of health. It ensures that
    the spell is not cast too frequently or in situations where it would be detrimental
    to the warlock's survival. The method integrates with the overall AI decision-making
    process to maintain balanced resource management for warlock characters.

  - title: Basic Usage in Warlock AI Loop
    code: "void WarlockAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    ManageLifeTapTiming();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the main AI update loop. It should
    be used in conjunction with other warlock-specific AI methods to ensure proper
    spell selection and timing. The method does not directly cast spells but rather
    makes decisions about when it would be appropriate to do so.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may result in inefficient mana management
    or unnecessary health loss for the warlock. It should only be called when the
    AI has sufficient context about the warlock's current state and available actions.
