  class: ChaseMovementGenerator
  method: Initialize
  signature: void ChaseMovementGenerator::Initialize(Unit * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the chase movement generator with the target unit to follow.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the ChaseMovementGenerator to begin pursuing
    a specified target unit. This method is typically called when a creature or NPC
    starts chasing a player or another unit. It configures internal state variables
    such as the target unit reference, distance parameters, and movement flags required
    for the chase behavior. The generator will then use these settings in subsequent
    updates to control the movement of the unit towards its target.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that this movement generator should chase.
      This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid unit in the game
      world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chase Initialization
    code: 'ChaseMovementGenerator* chaseGen = new ChaseMovementGenerator();

      Unit* target = player;

      chaseGen->Initialize(target);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Chase with Creature Target
    code: "Creature* enemy = unit->GetAI()->SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_NEAREST, 0);\n\
      if (enemy)\n{\n    ChaseMovementGenerator* chaseGen = new ChaseMovementGenerator();\n\
      \    chaseGen->Initialize(enemy);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per movement generator instance. Reinitialization
    may lead to undefined behavior if not properly managed. The target unit must remain
    valid throughout the lifetime of this movement generator.
  warnings: Never pass a null pointer to this method as it will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the target unit is in the same map and is not
    being destroyed when this method is called.
