documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of subscribers currently registered with the resource
    event bus.
  description: The GetSubscriberCount method retrieves the current count of all active
    subscribers registered with the ResourceEventBus. This count represents how many
    objects or systems are currently listening for events on the bus. The method is
    typically used for monitoring, debugging, or performance analysis purposes to
    understand the event subscription load. It provides a snapshot of subscriber activity
    at the time of the call and does not account for any subscribers that may be added
    or removed during the execution of this method. This functionality is particularly
    useful in systems where event-driven architecture is employed, such as resource
    management, game state updates, or synchronization mechanisms within TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of subscribers currently registered
    with the ResourceEventBus. Returns zero if no subscribers are registered.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 subscriberCount = ResourceEventBus::GetSubscriberCount();\nif (subscriberCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"server\", \"Resource event bus has {} active subscribers.\"\
      , subscriberCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Subscriber Count for Debugging
    code: "void DebugResourceEventBus()\n{\n    uint32 count = sResourceEventBus->GetSubscriberCount();\n\
      \    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"event\", \"Current subscriber count: {}\", count);\n   \
      \ // Additional debugging logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a read operation on an internal counter and is generally
    fast. However, in high-frequency event systems, frequent calls to this method
    may introduce minor overhead. The returned value reflects the state at the moment
    of invocation and may not represent real-time subscriber activity if subscriptions
    are actively changing.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method for critical system decisions or performance
    optimizations, as the subscriber count can change between the time it's retrieved
    and when subsequent operations occur. This method does not provide thread safety
    guarantees for concurrent access; if used in a multi-threaded environment, external
    synchronization may be required.
