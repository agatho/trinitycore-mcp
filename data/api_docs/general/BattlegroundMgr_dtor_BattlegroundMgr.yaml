  class: BattlegroundMgr
  method: ~BattlegroundMgr
  signature: void BattlegroundMgr::~BattlegroundMgr()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BattlegroundMgr instance and cleans up all associated battleground
    resources.
  description: The ~BattlegroundMgr destructor is responsible for properly cleaning
    up all battleground-related data structures and resources when the BattlegroundMgr
    object is destroyed. This includes removing references to active battlegrounds,
    cleaning up any allocated memory for battleground templates, and ensuring that
    no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur. The destructor ensures that all battleground
    instances are gracefully shut down before the manager itself is deallocated. This
    method is automatically invoked during the destruction of the global BattlegroundMgr
    singleton instance, typically during server shutdown or when the game world is
    being torn down.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destructor Call During Server Shutdown
    code: '// The destructor is automatically called when the global BattlegroundMgr

      // singleton goes out of scope during server shutdown

      // No explicit call needed - handled by C++ RAII


      // Example of how it might be used internally:

      BattlegroundMgr* bgMgr = sBattlegroundMgr;

      // ... other operations ...

      // When bgMgr is destroyed (e.g., at program exit), ~BattlegroundMgr() is called
      automatically'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is part of the standard C++ RAII pattern and should never
    be called manually. It's designed to be invoked only by the C++ runtime when the
    singleton instance is destroyed. The cleanup process includes ensuring all battleground
    instances are properly terminated before memory is freed.
