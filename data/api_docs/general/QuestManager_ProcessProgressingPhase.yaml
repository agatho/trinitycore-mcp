documentation:
  brief: Updates and processes the current quest progression phase for a player
  description: The ProcessProgressingPhase method handles the internal logic for advancing
    or maintaining the active quest state within a player's quest log. This includes
    checking quest conditions, updating quest objectives, and managing quest state
    transitions such as progressing from one phase to another. The method is typically
    invoked during player activity events like item collection, NPC interactions,
    or area exploration that may affect quest progress. It ensures that quest data
    remains consistent with the game world state and player actions.

  - title: Basic Usage in Player Update Loop
    code: "void Player::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    _questManager->ProcessProgressingPhase();\n    // ... more update logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during player updates to ensure quest
    progression remains synchronized with game events. It may internally trigger quest
    completion checks and objective updates, so performance impact should be considered
    in high-frequency update scenarios.
