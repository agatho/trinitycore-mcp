  class: AfflictionDoTTracker
  method: ApplyDoT
  signature: void AfflictionDoTTracker::ApplyDoT(int targetGuid, uint32 spellId, uint32
    duration, uint32 stacks)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a DoT effect to a target with specified spell ID, duration, and stack
    count.
  description: The ApplyDoT method is responsible for applying a Damage over Time
    (DoT) effect to a specified target in the game world. It takes parameters including
    the target's GUID, the spell ID of the DoT effect, the duration of the effect
    in milliseconds, and the number of stacks the DoT should have. This method is
    typically used by affliction-based warlocks or other classes that utilize DoT
    mechanics. The method updates internal tracking structures to manage the DoT's
    lifecycle, including expiration and stacking behavior. It does not directly modify
    the target's health but rather registers the effect for proper application during
    combat updates.
  parameters:
  - name: targetGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit that will receive
      the DoT effect. Must be a valid GameObjectGuid or PlayerGuid.
  - name: spellId
    description: The Spell ID associated with the DoT effect being applied. This identifies
      the specific spell mechanics and properties to be used for damage calculation.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration of the DoT effect in milliseconds. Determines how long
      the effect will remain active on the target.
  - name: stacks
    description: The number of stacks the DoT effect should have. Represents how many
      times the DoT will be applied or how much potency it has.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic DoT Application
    code: 'AfflictionDoTTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyDoT(12345, 34835, 18000, 1); // Apply Curse of Agony to target
      with GUID 12345 for 18 seconds with 1 stack'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Stack DoT Application
    code: 'AfflictionDoTTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyDoT(98765, 172, 12000, 5); // Apply Corruption to target with GUID
      98765 for 12 seconds with 5 stacks'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the target is valid and exists in the game world.
    The actual damage application occurs during combat update cycles, not immediately
    upon calling this method. The DoT tracking system may enforce maximum stack limits
    or prevent stacking of certain spells.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid targetGuid may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that spellId corresponds to a valid DoT spell in the
    game database. Duration values should be within reasonable bounds to avoid overflow
    issues.
