  class: Unit
  method: IsStopped
  signature: bool Unit::IsStopped() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns whether the unit is currently stopped and not moving.
  description: The IsStopped method checks if a Unit object is currently halted, meaning
    it has no movement velocity and is not actively moving. This method is commonly
    used in game mechanics to determine if an NPC or player is stationary, such as
    during combat or when performing actions that require the unit to remain in place.
    It typically returns true when the unit's movement is suspended, regardless of
    whether it's due to a stop command, combat state, or other conditions that prevent
    motion.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is stopped and not moving, false otherwise. The
    method does not distinguish between different causes of stopping, such as being
    in combat versus having no movement velocity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (unit->IsStopped()) {\n    // Do something when unit is stopped\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often used in conjunction with movement-related logic to determine
    if a unit should be allowed to move or not. It may also be used to check for combat
    state or other conditions that prevent movement.
  warnings: The method does not account for different types of stopping, such as being
    in combat versus having no velocity. Developers should ensure they understand
    the context in which this method is called.
