  class: MotionMaster
  method: MoveTaxiFlight
  signature: void MotionMaster::MoveTaxiFlight(uint32 path, uint32 pathnode, int speed,
    int param3)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a taxi flight motion for a creature or player along a specified
    path with optional speed and node parameters.
  description: The MoveTaxiFlight method starts a taxi flight animation for an object
    (typically a player or creature) using a predefined path ID. This method is used
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to handle NPC or player movement via the taxi
    system. The path parameter defines which taxi route to follow, while pathnode
    specifies the starting node within that path. Speed and param3 parameters can
    be used to modify the flight behavior, such as adjusting travel speed or applying
    additional effects. This method typically integrates with the existing motion
    system to queue the taxi flight movement and update the object's state accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: path
    description: The unique identifier of the taxi path to follow. This corresponds
      to entries in the `taxi_path` table in the database.
  - name: pathnode
    description: The starting node index within the specified taxi path. Nodes are
      ordered from 0 onwards, with 0 being the first point of the flight.
  - name: speed
    description: Adjusts the speed of the taxi flight. Negative values may indicate
      reverse or special behavior depending on implementation.
  - name: param3
    description: An additional parameter that can be used for customizing flight behavior,
      such as applying specific effects or modifying movement properties.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Taxi Flight Initiation
    code: motionMaster->MoveTaxiFlight(1234, 0, 100, 0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Custom Speed Taxi Flight
    code: motionMaster->MoveTaxiFlight(5678, 2, -50, 1);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the object has valid access to the taxi system and
    that the path ID is registered in the database. It should not be called directly
    unless the motion state allows for taxi movement. The pathnode parameter must
    be within valid bounds of the specified path.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper setup may result in undefined behavior
    or client-side errors. Ensure that the path exists and is valid before invoking
    this function. Incorrect use of speed or param3 values could lead to unexpected
    flight behavior.
