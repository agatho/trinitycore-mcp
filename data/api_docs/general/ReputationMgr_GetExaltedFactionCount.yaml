documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of factions that have reached exalted reputation level
    for the player
  description: The GetExaltedFactionCount method retrieves the total number of factions
    in a player's reputation list that have been elevated to the maximum exalted standing
    (21000). This value is used internally by the game engine to determine various
    rewards, quest completions, and achievements related to faction progression. The
    method iterates through all known factions for the player and counts those with
    a standing of at least exalted level. This count is particularly important for
    determining if a player has achieved maximum reputation with enough factions to
    unlock certain in-game benefits or bonuses.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the number of factions that have reached exalted
    reputation level (0-255). Returns 0 if no factions are at exalted standing, and
    can return up to 255 if all factions are exalted.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check exalted faction count
    code: "uint8 exaltedCount = player->GetReputationMgr()->GetExaltedFactionCount();\n\
      if (exaltedCount > 0)\n{\n    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      You have %u exalted factions.\", exaltedCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the count to unlock rewards
    code: "ReputationMgr* repMgr = player->GetReputationMgr();\nuint8 exaltedCount\
      \ = repMgr->GetExaltedFactionCount();\nif (exaltedCount >= 5)\n{\n    // Grant\
      \ special reward for having 5+ exalted factions\n    player->AddItem(ITEM_ID_EXALTED_REWARD,\
      \ 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear scan of all faction entries in the reputation
    manager. The maximum possible return value is limited by the number of factions
    defined in the game's database, typically around 200-300 factions. The method
    does not account for temporary reputation changes or faction-specific modifiers
    that might affect standing during combat or quest completion.
  warnings: The returned count may be misleading if faction data has been modified
    through addons or server modifications. This method should not be used in performance-critical
    code paths as it iterates through all factions. Be aware that some factions may
    not be available to players depending on their expansion level or character class
    restrictions.
