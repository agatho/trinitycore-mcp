  method: GetCreatureClassification
  signature: int Creature::GetCreatureClassification() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the classification type of the creature, determining its role in
    the game world.
  description: The GetCreatureClassification method retrieves the classification type
    of a creature, which defines whether it is a normal, elite, rare, or boss creature.
    This classification affects how the creature behaves in combat, drops loot, and
    interacts with players. The method is essential for determining creature behavior
    and game mechanics within TrinityCore's framework. It provides information about
    the creature's role in the world without requiring additional data access.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the creature's classification type. Possible
    values include 0 (normal), 1 (elite), 2 (rare), 3 (rare elite), and 4 (world boss).
    The value determines how the creature interacts with players and what loot it
    may drop.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int classification = creature->GetCreatureClassification();\nif (classification\
      \ == 1)\n{\n    // This is an elite creature\n    // Handle special behavior\
      \ accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Creature class and should be used in conjunction
    with other creature-related methods to determine full creature behavior. The classification
    value directly affects how the creature's AI behaves and what loot it drops.
  warnings: Be careful when using this method as different classifications may require
    different handling for player interactions, loot drops, and combat mechanics.
    Incorrect use can lead to improper game balance.
