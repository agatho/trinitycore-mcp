  class: LootCoordination
  method: UpdateLootSession
  signature: void LootCoordination::UpdateLootSession(uint32 sessionId, const LootSession
    & session)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the loot session state for a given session ID with the provided loot
    session data.
  description: The UpdateLootSession method is responsible for updating the internal
    state of a loot session within the LootCoordination system. It takes a session
    identifier and a reference to a LootSession object, which contains all relevant
    information about the current loot distribution. This method ensures that the
    loot coordination system maintains accurate and up-to-date information regarding
    ongoing loot sessions, including item assignments, roll results, and player participation.
    The method is typically invoked when changes occur in the loot distribution process,
    such as when a player rolls for an item or when a loot item is awarded to a specific
    player. It plays a crucial role in maintaining synchronization across multiple
    players and ensuring fair loot distribution according to the configured loot rules.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionId
    description: A unique identifier for the loot session that needs to be updated.
      This ID corresponds to a specific loot distribution event within the game world.
  - name: session
    description: A constant reference to a LootSession object containing the updated
      state information for the specified session, including item details, player
      rolls, and award assignments.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating a loot session with new roll results
    code: 'LootCoordination lootCoord;

      LootSession currentSession;

      // ... populate currentSession with updated loot data ...

      lootCoord.UpdateLootSession(12345, currentSession);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating session after a player wins an item
    code: 'LootCoordination lootCoord;

      LootSession session;

      // ... set up session with item awarded to player 67890 ...

      lootCoord.UpdateLootSession(54321, session);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the loot coordination system
    and should not be invoked directly by external code unless specifically required
    for advanced customization. The method assumes that the provided session data
    is valid and properly formatted. It's important to note that this method does
    not perform any validation on the input parameters, so callers must ensure data
    integrity before calling.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid session ID may lead to undefined behavior
    or corruption of internal loot state. Always verify that the sessionId corresponds
    to an active loot session before invoking this method. Additionally, concurrent
    access to the same session from multiple threads should be avoided as it can cause
    race conditions and inconsistent loot distribution.
