documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can gather resources from a specified gathering
    node.
  description: The CanGatherFromNode method evaluates if a player is eligible to collect
    materials or resources from a given gathering node. This check typically considers
    factors such as the player's skill level, required tools, proximity to the node,
    and any temporary restrictions or cooldowns. The method returns true if all conditions
    are met for gathering, otherwise false. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment,
    this function is crucial for ensuring proper resource collection mechanics during
    professions like Mining, Herbalism, or Skinning.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player can gather from the specified node based on
    all applicable conditions; returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (gatheringManager->CanGatherFromNode(node)) {\n    // Proceed with gathering\
      \ logic\n    player->GatherResource(node);\n} else {\n    // Notify player they\
      \ cannot gather from this node\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"You cannot gather\
      \ from this node.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against the player's current profession
    level, tool requirements, and node-specific restrictions. It may also consider
    the node's respawn state or temporary unavailability due to other players interacting
    with it.
