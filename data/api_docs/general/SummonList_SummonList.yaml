  class: SummonList
  method: SummonList
  signature: void SummonList::SummonList(int * creature)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new SummonList object with the specified creature pointer.
  description: The SummonList constructor initializes a new summon list instance,
    typically used in AI or creature behavior systems to manage summoned creatures.
    This method sets up internal data structures for tracking summoned units and their
    relationships to the summoner. The constructor takes a pointer to a creature object
    which serves as the owner or source of the summons. This is commonly used in TrinityCore's
    AI framework where creatures can summon other creatures as part of their behavior
    patterns, such as pets, guardians, or summoned minions.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to a Creature object that acts as the summoner or owner of
      the summons. This parameter is typically used to establish the relationship
      between the summoner and summoned creatures within the SummonList system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic SummonList Initialization
    code: 'Creature* mySummoner = ...; // Some creature object

      SummonList summonList(mySummoner);

      // The summonList is now initialized and ready to manage summons'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using SummonList in AI Behavior
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void JustSummoned(Creature*\
      \ summon) override {\n        // Add summoned creature to our summon list\n\
      \        m_summonList.AddSummons(summon);\n    }\n    \nprivate:\n    SummonList\
      \ m_summonList;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during creature AI initialization or
    when creating summoned creatures. The SummonList maintains a collection of summoned
    units and their associated data, which is crucial for proper cleanup and behavior
    management. It's important to note that the creature pointer passed should remain
    valid throughout the lifetime of the SummonList instance.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer as the creature parameter may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always ensure the creature object exists and is properly
    initialized before creating a SummonList with it. Additionally, be careful about
    object lifetime management when using SummonList in AI systems to prevent dangling
    pointers.
