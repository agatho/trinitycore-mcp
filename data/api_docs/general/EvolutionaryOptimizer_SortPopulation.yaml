documentation:
  brief: Sorts the population of individuals in the evolutionary optimization algorithm
    based on their fitness scores.
  description: The SortPopulation method organizes the current population of candidate
    solutions within the EvolutionaryOptimizer class. It arranges these individuals
    in descending order of fitness, ensuring that the most fit individuals appear
    first in the population list. This sorting operation is crucial for the evolutionary
    process as it determines which individuals are selected for reproduction and which
    are discarded during each generation cycle. The method typically executes after
    fitness evaluation but before selection and crossover operations. It modifies
    the internal state of the optimizer by reordering the population array without
    changing the total number of individuals.

  - title: Basic Population Sorting
    code: 'EvolutionaryOptimizer optimizer;

      // ... population initialized with fitness values ...

      optimizer.SortPopulation();

      // Population is now sorted by fitness in descending order'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that fitness values have already been calculated for
    all individuals in the population. The sorting algorithm used is typically a stable
    sort to maintain relative order of equal fitness individuals. Performance is O(n
    log n) where n is the population size.
