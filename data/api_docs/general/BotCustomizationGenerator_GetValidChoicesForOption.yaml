  class: BotCustomizationGenerator
  method: GetValidChoicesForOption
  signature: int BotCustomizationGenerator::GetValidChoicesForOption(uint32 optionId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of valid customization choices available for a specified
    bot customization option.
  description: The GetValidChoicesForOption method determines how many valid customization
    options are available for a given customization type. This method is typically
    used within the TrinityCore bot system to manage character appearance customization,
    ensuring that bots can be properly customized according to game rules and restrictions.
    The method likely accesses internal data structures that define valid choices
    per option ID, returning an integer count of these choices. It may be invoked
    during bot creation or customization processes to validate available options before
    applying them.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of valid customization choices
    for the specified option ID. A return value of 0 indicates no valid choices exist
    for that option, while a positive integer indicates the count of available choices.
    Negative values are not expected but may indicate an error condition if the option
    ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int choiceCount = botCustomizationGenerator->GetValidChoicesForOption(12345);\n\
      if (choiceCount > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with customization logic\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Available choices: \" << choiceCount << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n    //\
      \ Handle invalid or no-choice scenario\n    std::cout << \"No valid choices\
      \ for this option.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal bot customization data tables and should
    be called only after the bot system has been properly initialized. The optionId
    parameter is expected to correspond to predefined customization types within the
    TrinityCore bot framework.
  warnings: Ensure that the optionId passed to this method corresponds to a valid
    customization option; invalid IDs may result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    counts. This method should not be called during critical bot initialization phases
    where data structures might not be fully loaded.
