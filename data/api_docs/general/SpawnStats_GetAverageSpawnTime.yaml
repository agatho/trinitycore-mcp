  class: SpawnStats
  method: GetAverageSpawnTime
  signature: float SpawnStats::GetAverageSpawnTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the average time taken for creatures or game objects
    to spawn in the world.
  description: 'The GetAverageSpawnTime method computes the average duration between
    when a creature or game object was scheduled to spawn and when it actually became
    active in the game world. This metric is typically used by server administrators
    and developers to monitor performance, identify potential bottlenecks in spawning
    logic, or analyze the efficiency of spawn timers. The value returned represents
    the average spawn time in seconds. It''s important to note that this method may
    aggregate data from multiple spawn events over a period of time, and the result
    can be influenced by factors such as server load, spawn point availability, and
    object type (e.g., creatures vs. game objects). Precondition: The SpawnStats instance
    must have collected spawn timing data previously; postcondition: Returns a float
    representing average spawn time in seconds.'
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value indicating the average spawn time in seconds. If no spawn
    data has been recorded, this may return zero or an undefined value depending on
    implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Spawn Performance
    code: 'SpawnStats stats;

      // ... populate stats with spawn data ...

      float avgTime = stats.GetAverageSpawnTime();

      printf("Average spawn time: %.2f seconds\n", avgTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Average Spawn Time in Server Metrics
    code: "void LogSpawnMetrics(SpawnStats& stats) {\n    float avgSpawnTime = stats.GetAverageSpawnTime();\n\
      \    if (avgSpawnTime > 5.0f) {\n        sLog->outError(\"High average spawn\
      \ time detected: %.2f seconds\", avgSpawnTime);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely aggregates historical spawn timing data from internal
    tracking mechanisms within TrinityCore. It may not be thread-safe if accessed
    concurrently without proper synchronization. Developers should ensure that spawn
    statistics are properly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or empty SpawnStats object might
    result in undefined behavior or incorrect results. Ensure that spawn events have
    occurred and been recorded prior to invoking this function.
