  brief: Initializes an asynchronous bot with the provided configuration parameters
  description: The AsyncBotInitializer constructor initializes a new instance of the
    AsyncBotInitializer class, setting up internal state for handling asynchronous
    bot operations. This method prepares the necessary resources and configurations
    required for bot initialization in a TrinityCore environment. The initialization
    process typically involves setting up thread pools, configuring communication
    channels, and preparing data structures needed for bot behavior execution. This
    constructor is part of the asynchronous bot framework designed to manage multiple
    bots concurrently without blocking the main game loop.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AsyncBotInitializer instantiation
    code: 'AsyncBotInitializer initializer;

      // This creates a new AsyncBotInitializer instance ready for configuration'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during server startup or when dynamically
    creating new bot instances. The initialization process may involve asynchronous
    operations that complete in the background, so it's important to ensure proper
    synchronization when accessing initialized resources. This class likely implements
    reference counting or smart pointer patterns for memory management.
  warnings: Attempting to use an uninitialized AsyncBotInitializer instance may result
    in undefined behavior. Ensure all required configuration parameters are set before
    starting bot operations. The constructor may perform resource-intensive operations
    that could block the calling thread if not properly managed.
