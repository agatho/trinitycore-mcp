  class: BotPriorityManager
  method: RemoveBot
  signature: void BotPriorityManager::RemoveBot(int botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a bot with the specified GUID from the priority manager's tracking
    list.
  description: The RemoveBot method removes a bot identified by its unique global
    identifier (GUID) from the internal tracking structures of the BotPriorityManager.
    This method ensures that the specified bot is no longer considered in priority
    calculations or scheduling decisions within the manager. It typically involves
    removing the bot from any internal data structures such as maps, lists, or queues
    used to manage bot priorities. The operation is usually performed when a bot is
    destroyed, disconnected, or explicitly removed from the system.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique global identifier (GUID) of the bot to be removed from
      the priority manager.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a Bot by GUID
    code: 'BotPriorityManager* manager = sObjectAccessor->GetBotPriorityManager();

      manager->RemoveBot(12345); // Removes bot with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided botGuid is valid and corresponds to
    an existing bot in the system. The implementation may include checks for null
    or invalid GUIDs, but this behavior depends on the internal validation logic of
    the BotPriorityManager class.
  warnings: Calling RemoveBot with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID may result
    in undefined behavior or silent failures if proper error handling is not implemented
    within the method. Ensure that the GUID corresponds to a known bot before calling
    this method.
