  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::DetectAnomalousDecisions()
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes AI decision-making patterns to identify potentially anomalous or
    suspicious behavior in NPC actions.
  description: The DetectAnomalousDecisions method performs a comprehensive analysis
    of AI decision-making data collected by the AIDecisionProfiler. It evaluates patterns
    in NPC behavior, comparing current decisions against established baselines and
    statistical models to detect outliers that may indicate bugs, exploits, or unexpected
    AI behavior. This method is typically invoked during profiling sessions or when
    monitoring AI performance in real-time scenarios. The analysis considers factors
    such as decision frequency, choice distribution, and temporal patterns of AI actions.
    It does not modify any game state but rather logs findings for further investigation
    by developers or system administrators.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Profiling Context
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      profiler.DetectAnomalousDecisions();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Monitoring System
    code: "void MonitorAIActivity()\n{\n    AIDecisionProfiler profiler;\n    profiler.CollectDecisionData();\n\
      \    profiler.DetectAnomalousDecisions();\n    // Log results for further analysis\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on historical data being collected prior to execution.
    It is recommended to call CollectDecisionData() before invoking this method. The
    detection algorithm uses statistical thresholds and may require sufficient sample
    size for accurate anomaly identification. Performance impact is minimal during
    normal operation but increases with larger datasets.
  warnings: The method does not automatically correct or prevent anomalous AI behavior;
    it only identifies potential issues. Results should be reviewed by experienced
    developers before taking action. In high-frequency AI environments, repeated calls
    may generate excessive logging output.
