documentation:
  brief: Removes the object from the world, making it invisible to all players and
    creatures.
  description: The RemoveFromWorld method removes an object from the active world
    state, effectively taking it out of the game's world simulation. This method is
    typically called when an object needs to be destroyed or moved out of the player's
    view. The object will no longer be visible to any players or creatures in the
    world, and its associated data will be cleared from memory unless explicitly preserved.
    This action is commonly used during object destruction, despawning, or when transitioning
    objects between different zones or instances.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Object Removal
    code: 'Object* obj = new Object();

      obj->RemoveFromWorld();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it may cause issues if used on
    objects that are still referenced by other systems. It is recommended to ensure
    the object is no longer needed before calling RemoveFromWorld.
  warnings: Calling this method on an object that is still actively being used or
    referenced can lead to memory corruption or crashes. Always verify that no references
    exist before removal.
