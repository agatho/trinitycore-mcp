documentation:
  brief: Handles instance-related events for bot AI behavior
  description: The OnInstanceEvent method is a callback function in the BotAI class
    that processes various instance-related events such as instance creation, player
    entry, exit, or completion. This method allows bots to respond dynamically to
    changes in the instance environment and adjust their behavior accordingly. It
    is typically invoked by the TrinityCore framework when significant instance state
    transitions occur, enabling bots to maintain appropriate AI logic based on the
    current instance context.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: A const reference to an InstanceEvent object containing details about
      the triggered instance event including event type, instance ID, and associated
      player or group information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Handling
    code: "void BotAI::OnInstanceEvent(const InstanceEvent& event) {\n    switch (event.GetType())\
      \ {\n        case INSTANCE_EVENT_PLAYER_ENTER:\n            // Bot logic when\
      \ player enters instance\n            break;\n        case INSTANCE_EVENT_PLAYER_EXIT:\n\
      \            // Bot logic when player leaves instance\n            break;\n\
      \        default:\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot AI system and should be implemented to handle
    specific instance events without blocking the main thread. The event object passed
    in contains immutable data that can be safely read but not modified.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy computations or blocking operations within this
    method as it may impact performance of the entire instance. Ensure all event handling
    logic is thread-safe since this method might be called from different execution
    contexts.
