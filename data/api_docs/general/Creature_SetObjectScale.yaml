  signature: void Creature::SetObjectScale(float scale)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the scale factor of the creature object.
  description: This method allows developers to modify the scale of a creature object,
    which affects how large the creature appears in the game world. The scale value
    determines the visual size of the creature and can influence various gameplay
    mechanics such as collision detection, attack range, and visual representation.
    This method is typically used during creature spawning or modification processes
    to adjust the appearance and behavior of NPCs.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetObjectScale(1.5f);

      // Sets the creature''s scale to 1.5 times its original size'
    language: cpp
  notes: The scale parameter is typically a positive float value, and values below
    0.1 or above 10.0 may cause visual anomalies or game balance issues. This method
    directly modifies the object's scale property without requiring additional calculations.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to visual inconsistencies or gameplay
    imbalance. Setting scale values outside recommended ranges (0.1-10.0) may result
    in unexpected behavior during combat or interaction with other objects.
