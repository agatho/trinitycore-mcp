  method: IsComplete
  signature: bool BotWorldEntry::IsComplete() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot world entry has been fully initialized and configured.
  description: The IsComplete method checks if a BotWorldEntry object has all required
    data fields populated and configuration settings applied. This method is typically
    used to verify that a bot's world state is ready for operation before attempting
    to execute actions or interact with the game environment. The check may involve
    validating internal flags, ensuring necessary resources are loaded, or confirming
    that prerequisite conditions have been met. This method does not modify the object
    state and is safe to call multiple times.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot world entry is fully initialized and ready for
    use; returns false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that
    initialization is incomplete or that required data has not yet been loaded.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (botEntry->IsComplete()) {\n    // Proceed with bot operations\n   \
      \ botEntry->ExecuteAction();\n} else {\n    // Handle incomplete initialization\n\
      \    LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Bot entry not complete: {}\", botEntry->GetGUID());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Manager
    code: "class BotManager {\npublic:\n    void UpdateBots() {\n        for (auto&\
      \ entry : m_botEntries) {\n            if (entry->IsComplete()) {\n        \
      \        entry->Update();\n            } else {\n                entry->Initialize();\n\
      \            }\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a lightweight check on internal state flags rather
    than expensive operations. It's recommended to cache the result of this check
    if it's called frequently in performance-critical sections of code.
  warnings: Calling this method before the BotWorldEntry has been properly constructed
    or initialized may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that all required initialization
    steps have completed before invoking IsComplete().
