  class: HealerPositioning
  method: CalculateMultiHealerPositions
  signature: int HealerPositioning::CalculateMultiHealerPositions(const int & healers,
    const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates optimal positioning for multiple healers in a group scenario.
  description: The CalculateMultiHealerPositions method determines the ideal spatial
    arrangement for a specified number of healers within a group context. This method
    is typically used in group-based encounters or raids where healer positioning
    significantly impacts damage mitigation and overall group survival. The calculation
    considers factors such as healer count, group size, and potential threat distribution
    to compute an efficient layout that maximizes healing coverage and minimizes overlap
    or gaps in support. It returns a configuration identifier that can be used to
    apply the calculated positions to healer units.
  parameters:
  - name: healers
    description: The number of healers in the group (positive integer). Represents
      how many healer units need positioning calculations.
  - name: group
    description: The size or identifier of the group (positive integer). Defines the
      scope of the positioning calculation, typically representing the total number
      of players in the encounter.
  returns: An integer value representing the calculated healer positioning configuration.
    A positive return indicates a valid configuration ID; zero or negative values
    may indicate an error or invalid input parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: int configId = healerPositioning.CalculateMultiHealerPositions(3, 5);
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling Example
    code: "int result = healerPositioning.CalculateMultiHealerPositions(-1, 4);\n\
      if (result <= 0) {\n    // Handle invalid input\n    std::cout << \"Invalid\
      \ healer count provided.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group composition and healer capabilities are
    already defined elsewhere in the system. The positioning algorithm may vary depending
    on encounter type, map layout, or specific game mechanics implemented by the TrinityCore
    module. For performance reasons, it's recommended to cache results when multiple
    calls with similar parameters are expected.
  warnings: Passing negative values for either parameter may lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect calculations. Ensure that healer and group counts are validated before
    calling this method to avoid unexpected outcomes in gameplay scenarios.
