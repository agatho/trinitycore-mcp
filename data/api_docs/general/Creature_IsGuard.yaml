documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature is a guard.
  description: This method checks if the creature instance is classified as a guard
    within the game world. Guards are typically NPCs that enforce faction-based rules
    and can be identified by their specific AI behavior or flags. The method returns
    true when the creature is recognized as a guard, false otherwise. This functionality
    is crucial for determining NPC behavior in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is classified as a guard, false otherwise.
    The return value indicates whether the creature's AI type or faction flags designate
    it as a guard entity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (creature->IsGuard()) {\n    // Handle guard behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation relies on internal creature flags and AI type checks. Performance
    impact is minimal as this method only performs simple flag comparisons.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a creature is a guard in
    all contexts, as some guards may have different behaviors or may not be explicitly
    flagged as such. Ensure proper context when using this method.
