  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void Player::LoadInstanceTimeRestrictions(int result)\n{\n    // Implementation\
      \ would load instance time restrictions\n    // from database for the player\n\
      }\n\n// Called during player login process\nPlayer->LoadInstanceTimeRestrictions(0);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal player loading process and should not
    be called directly by external code. Implementation details include database queries
    for instance time restriction data, which may involve multiple tables including
    instance_reset, cooldowns, and other time-based restrictions.
  warnings: This method should only be called during player login or when entering
    instances. Calling it at inappropriate times may cause incorrect time restrictions
    to be applied, leading to gameplay issues.
