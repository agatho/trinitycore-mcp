  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: OptimizeBotPerformance
  signature: void PerformanceOptimizer::OptimizeBotPerformance(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes performance settings for a specific bot identified by its GUID.
  description: The OptimizeBotPerformance method adjusts various performance-related
    configurations and settings for a specified bot within the TrinityCore environment.
    This function is typically used to enhance the efficiency of AI-controlled bots,
    reducing resource consumption while maintaining gameplay quality. It may modify
    parameters such as update frequencies, pathfinding algorithms, or decision-making
    intervals based on the bot's GUID. The method assumes that the bot exists and
    is properly initialized within the system before execution.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot to be optimized. Must correspond
      to an existing bot instance in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      optimizer.OptimizeBotPerformance(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after ensuring the bot has been properly
    initialized and registered with the game world. Improper use may lead to undefined
    behavior or performance degradation if the GUID does not correspond to a valid
    bot.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-existent or uninitialized bot GUID can cause
    crashes or unexpected behavior. Always validate the existence of the bot before
    invoking this function.
