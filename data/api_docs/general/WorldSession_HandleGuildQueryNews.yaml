  signature: void WorldSession::HandleGuildQueryNews(WorldPackets::Guild::GuildQueryNews
    & newsQuery)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a guild news query request from a player and sends the guild's
    recent news updates.
  description: The HandleGuildQueryNews method is responsible for handling incoming
    guild news query packets sent by players in World of Warcraft. When a player requests
    to view their guild's recent news, this method processes the request, retrieves
    the relevant guild news data from the database or internal structures, and sends
    back a formatted response packet containing the news entries. This functionality
    allows players to stay updated on guild activities, announcements, and other important
    information posted by guild officers. The method typically operates within the
    context of a WorldSession, which manages the communication channel between the
    client and server.
  parameters:
  - name: newsQuery
    description: A reference to a GuildQueryNews packet containing the player's request
      for guild news information. This parameter includes details such as the guild
      ID and potentially pagination or filtering options.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in WorldSession context
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleGuildQueryNews(WorldPackets::Guild::GuildQueryNews&\
      \ newsQuery)\n{\n    if (!GetPlayer() || !GetPlayer()->GetGuild())\n       \
      \ return;\n    \n    Guild* guild = GetPlayer()->GetGuild();\n    // Process\
      \ the query and send response\n    WorldPackets::Guild::GuildNews newsPacket;\n\
      \    // Populate newsPacket with guild news data\n    SendPacket(newsPacket.Write());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked when a player opens their guild window and
    requests to see recent news updates. The implementation may involve database queries
    for recent announcements, caching mechanisms for performance optimization, and
    proper packet formatting according to the TrinityCore protocol specifications.
