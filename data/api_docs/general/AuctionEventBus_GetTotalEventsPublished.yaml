documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of events published through the auction event bus
  description: The GetTotalEventsPublished method retrieves the cumulative number
    of events that have been dispatched via the AuctionEventBus. This counter is typically
    used for monitoring and debugging purposes to track how many auction-related events
    (such as item listings, bids, or sales) have occurred since the event bus was
    initialized. The value is incremented each time an event is published through
    the system, making it useful for performance analysis, logging, or ensuring proper
    event handling within the auction system. This method is thread-safe and provides
    a consistent view of the total event count across all threads.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the total number of events that have been published
    through the AuctionEventBus since its initialization. Returns zero if no events
    have been published yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Event Count
    code: 'uint64 totalEvents = auctionEventBus.GetTotalEventsPublished();

      TC_LOG_INFO("auction", "Total auction events published: {}", totalEvents);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Event Growth Over Time
    code: 'uint64 initialCount = auctionEventBus.GetTotalEventsPublished();

      // ... perform some auction operations ...

      uint64 finalCount = auctionEventBus.GetTotalEventsPublished();

      TC_LOG_INFO("auction", "Events added: {}", finalCount - initialCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a read-only snapshot of the event count and does not
    modify any internal state. The counter is maintained atomically to ensure thread
    safety in multi-threaded environments such as those found in TrinityCore's auction
    house system.
