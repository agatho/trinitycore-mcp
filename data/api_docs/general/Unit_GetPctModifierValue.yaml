  method: GetPctModifierValue
  signature: float Unit::GetPctModifierValue(UnitMods unitMod, UnitModifierPctType
    modifierType) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the percentage modifier value for a specified unit mod and modifier
    type.
  description: This method retrieves the percentage modifier value associated with
    a specific unit modifier type for a given unit mod. It is commonly used in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to calculate various stat modifiers, such
    as critical strike chance, haste, or spell power. The method operates on the principle
    that unit mods represent different categories of stats (e.g., attack power, spell
    power), while modifier types indicate specific aspects of those stats (e.g., percentage
    bonus, flat value). This function is essential for accurately calculating combat-related
    statistics and gameplay mechanics in player versus player scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the percentage modifier applied to the
    specified unit mod and modifier type. The value can be positive or negative depending
    on the modifier applied, and may represent a percentage change from base values.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: float criticalStrikeChance = unit->GetPctModifierValue(UnitMods::UNIT_MOD_ATTACK_POWER,
      UnitModifierPctType::MODIFIER_PCT_CRITICAL_STRIKE);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core unit modifier system in TrinityCore. It should
    be used carefully as it may involve multiple internal calculations and caching
    mechanisms. Performance considerations include potential overhead from repeated
    calls to get modifier values, especially during combat calculations.
  warnings: The method may return unexpected values if the unit mod or modifier type
    is not properly initialized or if there are conflicting modifiers applied. Care
    must be taken when using this method in scenarios involving multiple modifiers
    or when calculating complex stat combinations.
