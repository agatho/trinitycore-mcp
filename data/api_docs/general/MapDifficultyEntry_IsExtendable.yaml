  method: IsExtendable
  signature: bool MapDifficultyEntry::IsExtendable() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the map difficulty entry allows for extension or additional
    content.
  description: The IsExtendable method checks if a MapDifficultyEntry supports extending
    its content, typically used in World of Warcraft instances to determine if additional
    raid content or difficulty levels can be added. This flag is crucial for managing
    dynamic instance scaling and ensuring that only appropriate content is loaded
    based on server configuration and player requirements. The method returns true
    when the map difficulty entry has been configured to allow extensions, such as
    adding more bosses or increasing the number of players supported in a raid.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map difficulty entry allows for extension (e.g., additional
    content or scaling), false otherwise. This indicates whether the instance can
    be dynamically modified or expanded beyond its base configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a Map Difficulty is Extendable
    code: "MapDifficultyEntry const* difficultyEntry = sMapDifficultyStore.LookupEntry(1234);\
      \ // Example entry ID\nif (difficultyEntry && difficultyEntry->IsExtendable())\
      \ {\n    // Handle extendable map logic here\n    printf(\"This map supports\
      \ extended content\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"This map does not support\
      \ extended content\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in TrinityCore's instance management system
    to control how raid and dungeon content scales. It's important for server administrators
    to understand that extending content may require additional resources and careful
    configuration to maintain balance.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of this flag can lead to loading invalid or unsupported
    content, potentially causing crashes or unexpected behavior during instance creation
    or player entry. Always verify the map difficulty entry before assuming it supports
    extension.
