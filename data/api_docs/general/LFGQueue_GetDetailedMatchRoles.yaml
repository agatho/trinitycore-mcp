  class: LFGQueue
  method: GetDetailedMatchRoles
  signature: std::string LFGQueue::GetDetailedMatchRoles(const int & check) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a formatted string describing the detailed match roles for a given
    check value.
  description: The GetDetailedMatchRoles method returns a string representation of
    the detailed match roles associated with a specific check value within the LFG
    (Looking for Group) queue system. This function is typically used to provide verbose
    information about role requirements or assignments for group matching purposes
    in World of Warcraft's LFG framework. The method processes internal data structures
    related to player roles and group composition to generate a human-readable output
    that can be used for debugging, logging, or UI display. It operates on the internal
    check parameter which likely corresponds to a specific queue or match scenario
    within the LFG system.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A std::string containing a formatted description of the detailed match
    roles. The string typically includes role names and their corresponding status
    or requirements in a readable format, such as ''Tank: Required, Healer: Optional,
    Damage: Required''. Returns an empty string if no matching roles are found or
    if the internal check value is invalid.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'LFGQueue* queue = sLFGMgr->GetQueue(12345);

      std::string roles = queue->GetDetailedMatchRoles(1);

      printf("Match roles: %s\n", roles.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the LFG system for debugging and
    logging purposes. The check parameter probably corresponds to different queue
    states or match scenarios, with each value representing a specific context within
    the LFG matching algorithm. The returned string format may vary depending on the
    internal state of the LFG queue.
  warnings: The method relies on internal LFG queue data structures that may not be
    fully initialized or may change during runtime. Calling this method outside of
    appropriate LFG contexts might result in undefined behavior or empty return values.
    Ensure proper synchronization if accessed from multiple threads.
