documentation:
  brief: Returns the current emote state of the unit
  description: The GetEmoteState method retrieves the active emote state for a Unit
    object, which represents the current animation or behavior being performed by
    the unit. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework
    to determine what kind of emote or animation is currently active on the unit.
    The emote state typically corresponds to specific animation IDs that are used
    for various game mechanics such as combat actions, non-combat behaviors, or interaction
    with players. The returned value represents a numeric identifier that can be used
    to check if a particular emote is active or to determine the current behavior
    of the unit.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the current emote state of the unit. This
    value typically corresponds to an animation ID or emote type, where different
    values indicate different emote states such as standing, sitting, or other specific
    behaviors. The method returns 0 when no emote is active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int emoteState = unit->GetEmoteState();\nif (emoteState == 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ No emote is active\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Some emote is active\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and typically used in conjunction with other unit-related
    methods. Performance considerations are minimal as it simply returns a stored
    value without complex computations.
  warnings: The method does not validate whether the emote state corresponds to valid
    animation IDs; developers should ensure proper handling of returned values to
    avoid unexpected behavior or errors in game mechanics.
