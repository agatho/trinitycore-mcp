documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AuraEventBus instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the AuraEventBus class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the lifetime
    of the AuraEventBus object. This includes unregistering event listeners, clearing
    internal data structures, and ensuring no dangling pointers remain. In the context
    of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this method ensures proper cleanup
    of aura-related events and their handlers when an AuraEventBus instance is no
    longer needed. The destructor is automatically invoked when the object goes out
    of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Destruction of AuraEventBus
    code: 'AuraEventBus* eventBus = new AuraEventBus();

      // ... use the event bus ...

      delete eventBus; // Triggers ~AuraEventBus()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called when an object goes out of scope or is
    deleted. It's important to ensure that no references to the AuraEventBus remain
    after deletion to prevent use-after-free errors. The implementation should be
    thread-safe if the event bus might be accessed from multiple threads.
