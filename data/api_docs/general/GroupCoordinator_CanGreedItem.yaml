  signature: bool GroupCoordinator::CanGreedItem(uint32 itemId) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the group coordinator can greed on a specified item.
  description: The CanGreedItem method evaluates if the group coordinator is eligible
    to greed on a specific item based on group loot rules and player permissions.
    This method typically checks if the item is under group loot settings, if the
    coordinator has sufficient permissions, and whether the item meets criteria for
    greed (such as being bind-on-pickup or having a specific quality). It does not
    directly interact with the item itself but rather assesses the eligibility of
    the group coordinator to perform a greed roll on the given item.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group coordinator is allowed to greed on the specified
    item, false otherwise. The result depends on group loot settings, item properties,
    and coordinator permissions.
  examples:
  - title: Check if coordinator can greed on an item
    code: "if (groupCoordinator->CanGreedItem(12345)) {\n    // Coordinator can greed\
      \ on item with ID 12345\n    // Proceed with greed logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in the context of group loot management within
    TrinityCore's group system. It assumes that the group coordinator has already
    been established and that the item ID corresponds to a valid item in the game
    database.
