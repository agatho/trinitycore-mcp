  class: VehicleAccessory
  method: VehicleAccessory
  signature: void VehicleAccessory::VehicleAccessory(uint32 entry, int8 seatId, bool
    isMinion, uint8 summonType, uint32 summonTime, int rideSpellID)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a vehicle accessory with specified properties including entry,
    seat ID, minion status, summon type, summon time, and ride spell ID.
  description: The VehicleAccessory constructor initializes a vehicle accessory object
    with the provided parameters. This method sets up essential properties for a vehicle
    accessory such as its creature entry ID, seat position on the vehicle, whether
    it behaves as a minion, the summoning behavior type, the duration of the summon,
    and an optional spell ID for riding mechanics. The accessory is typically used
    in conjunction with vehicle systems where creatures or objects are mounted as
    passengers or accessories to vehicles within the game world. This initialization
    directly affects how the accessory interacts with the vehicle's passenger system
    and summoning logic.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The creature entry ID of the accessory to be summoned. This identifies
      what type of creature (or object) will act as the vehicle accessory.
  - name: seatId
    description: The seat ID on the vehicle where this accessory will be mounted.
      Negative values may indicate specific seat types or special behavior, while
      positive values usually represent standard passenger seats.
  - name: isMinion
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the accessory is a minion (true)
      or not (false). Minions typically have different AI behaviors and are often
      automatically dismissed when their master dies.
  - name: summonType
    description: The summon type that defines how the accessory is summoned. Common
      values include temporary summons, permanent summons, or specific summoning mechanics
      like 'summon by spell' or 'summon by aura'.
  - name: summonTime
    description: The time (in milliseconds) after which the accessory will be automatically
      dismissed or removed from the vehicle. Zero means no automatic removal.
  - name: rideSpellID
    description: Optional spell ID that is cast when the accessory mounts the vehicle.
      This can define specific ride mechanics, such as mounting animations or special
      effects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vehicle Accessory Initialization
    code: VehicleAccessory accessory(12345, 0, true, SUMMON_TYPE_CREATURE, 30000,
      12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Vehicle Accessory with Ride Spell
    code: VehicleAccessory accessory(98765, 2, false, SUMMON_TYPE_PET, 0, 54321);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the vehicle system when adding
    accessories to a vehicle. It does not directly interact with the game world or
    create visible objects; instead, it prepares internal data structures for later
    use during vehicle operations.
  warnings: Improperly setting the seatId can cause access violations or incorrect
    passenger positioning on vehicles. The summonTime parameter should be carefully
    considered to avoid premature removal of important accessories.
