documentation:
  brief: Moves a loot template into this instance, transferring ownership of its resources.
  description: The LootTemplate constructor taking a move-assignment parameter initializes
    this loot template by transferring all resources from the provided source template.
    This operation is typically used when reassigning or replacing loot templates
    in memory, allowing efficient resource management without unnecessary copying.
    The method is part of the standard C++ move semantics implementation for the LootTemplate
    class, enabling optimized handling of temporary or intermediate loot template
    objects during game data loading or runtime modifications.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to another LootTemplate object whose resources
      will be moved into this instance. After the operation, the source template should
      be considered in a valid but unspecified state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Assigning a Loot Template
    code: 'LootTemplate newTemplate;

      LootTemplate oldTemplate = CreateSomeLootTemplate();

      newTemplate = std::move(oldTemplate); // Move-assigns the loot template'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically invoked internally by the compiler during move
    operations. Developers should be aware that after a move, the source object's
    state is undefined but still valid for destruction or assignment.
