  class: Unit
  method: CountPctFromMaxHealth
  signature: uint64 Unit::CountPctFromMaxHealth(int32 pct) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the health value corresponding to a specified percentage
    of maximum health.
  description: This method computes the health value that represents a given percentage
    of the unit's maximum health. It is commonly used in World of Warcraft scripting
    to determine health thresholds for various mechanics, such as boss fights, healing
    spells, or damage calculations. The method takes an integer percentage value and
    returns the corresponding health amount as a uint64. This function is particularly
    useful when dealing with health-based calculations where the unit's current health
    needs to be compared against a percentage of their maximum health.
  parameters:
  - name: pct
    description: The percentage value (positive or negative) to calculate from maximum
      health. A positive value represents a percentage of maximum health, while a
      negative value may represent a percentage below maximum health.
  returns: Returns the calculated health value corresponding to the specified percentage
    of maximum health. The returned value is a uint64 representing the health amount
    in the unit's current health system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: uint64 healthValue = unit->CountPctFromMaxHealth(50); // Returns 50% of
      maximum health
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetTarget();

      uint64 healthThreshold = target->CountPctFromMaxHealth(-25);

      // This calculates 25% below maximum health, useful for detecting low health
      states'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs calculations based on the unit's maximum health value.
    It is important to note that this function does not modify or update the actual
    health values of the unit; it only calculates what the health would be at a given
    percentage. This method is typically used in conjunction with other health-related
    functions for comprehensive health management.
  warnings: This method may return zero if the maximum health is zero, which can occur
    in certain edge cases such as when a unit has no health or is dead. Care should
    be taken when using negative percentages, as they might result in values that
    exceed the actual maximum health if not properly handled.
