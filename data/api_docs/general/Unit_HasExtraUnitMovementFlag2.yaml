documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit has a specific extra movement flag set.
  description: This method determines whether a Unit object has a particular extra
    movement flag enabled. It is used to verify specific movement behaviors or states
    within the game mechanics, particularly for handling special movement types that
    are not covered by standard movement flags. The method returns true if the specified
    flag is set, false otherwise. This functionality is essential for implementing
    custom movement logic and ensuring proper handling of special movement states
    in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit has the specified extra movement flag set, false
    otherwise. The return value represents the state of the movement flag within the
    unit's movement data structure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (unit->HasExtraUnitMovementFlag2(MOVEMENTFLAG2_WALKING)) {\n    // Handle\
      \ walking movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related
    methods to determine the complete movement state of a unit. It should be noted
    that this flag is part of a larger movement system and may interact with other
    movement flags in complex ways.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it can affect performance
    if used excessively. Also, this flag may not be available in all versions of TrinityCore,
    so compatibility should be checked before use.
