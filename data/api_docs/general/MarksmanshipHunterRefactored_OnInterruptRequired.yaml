  class: MarksmanshipHunterRefactored
  method: OnInterruptRequired
  signature: void MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::OnInterruptRequired(int * target,
    uint32 param1)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the required interrupt event for a marksmanship hunter, processing
    target and parameter data.
  description: The OnInterruptRequired method is invoked when a marksmanship hunter
    needs to respond to an interrupt event. This typically occurs during combat when
    the hunter's current action is interrupted by external factors such as incoming
    damage or enemy abilities. The method takes a pointer to a target integer and
    a uint32 parameter, allowing it to process specific interrupt conditions based
    on the provided data. It serves as part of the AI behavior system for marksmanship
    hunters in TrinityCore, enabling custom interrupt handling logic that may affect
    targeting, ability usage, or state transitions.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target entity that triggered
      the interrupt. This value is modified by the method to reflect updated target
      information or state changes.
  - name: param1
    description: A 32-bit unsigned integer parameter that provides additional context
      for the interrupt event, such as spell ID, damage type, or interrupt source
      identifier.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupt Handling
    code: 'int targetId = 12345;

      uint32 interruptType = 1001;

      hunter->OnInterruptRequired(&targetId, interruptType);

      // Processes the interrupt event for the hunter''s current target'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Interrupt with Target Update
    code: "int currentTarget = player->GetTargetGuid().GetRawValue();\nuint32 spellId\
      \ = 50001;\nif (currentTarget != 0)\n{\n    hunter->OnInterruptRequired(&currentTarget,\
      \ spellId);\n    // Updates target and handles interrupt logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI framework for marksmanship hunters in TrinityCore.
    It should be called only during active combat scenarios where interrupts are likely
    to occur. The target parameter may be modified by this function, so callers should
    account for potential changes to the value.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid and points to a legitimate entity
    before calling this method. Passing invalid or null pointers can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes in the game engine.
