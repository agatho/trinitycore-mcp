    spellItemEnchantmentId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the transmog illusion entry associated with a given enchantment
    ID.
  description: This method looks up and returns a pointer to the TransmogIllusionEntry
    structure that corresponds to the specified spell item enchantment ID. It is used
    in the context of World of Warcraft's transmogrification system, where enchantments
    can be linked to visual illusions that change how items appear. The method performs
    a lookup within the internal DB2 database manager's transmog illusion cache and
    returns a pointer to the matching entry if found, or nullptr if no such mapping
    exists. This functionality is essential for determining which visual effects should
    be applied when an item with a specific enchantment is transmogrified.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to a TransmogIllusionEntry object if a matching enchantment
    ID is found; otherwise, returns nullptr if no corresponding illusion entry exists
    in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const TransmogIllusionEntry* illusion = sDB2Manager->GetTransmogIllusionForEnchantment(12345);\n\
      if (illusion)\n{\n    // Use the illusion entry\n    printf(\"Illusion ID: %u\\\
      n\", illusion->ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the DB2Manager has already loaded the relevant transmog
    illusion data. This lookup is typically fast due to internal caching mechanisms,
    but performance may degrade if the cache is not properly initialized or if large
    numbers of lookups are performed without proper indexing.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellItemEnchantmentId parameter corresponds to a valid
    enchantment ID in the game's database; otherwise, the method will return nullptr.
    Do not assume that returned pointers remain valid beyond the lifetime of the DB2Manager
    instance or after data reloads.
