documentation:
  brief: Registers all built-in player bot migrations with the migration manager.
  description: The RegisterBuiltInMigrations method initializes and registers all
    predefined player bot migrations within the PlayerbotMigrationMgr class. This
    method is typically called during system startup or initialization to ensure that
    all available migration scripts are properly registered and ready for execution.
    It handles the setup of migration pathways for player bots, which may include
    updating bot behavior configurations, adjusting AI strategies, or modifying bot-related
    data structures to maintain compatibility with current game mechanics. The method
    does not take any parameters and performs no direct return operations; its purpose
    is purely to register the migrations in memory for later use.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance()->RegisterBuiltInMigrations();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be invoked once during server initialization
    to ensure all migrations are registered. It is not thread-safe and should only
    be called from the main thread.
