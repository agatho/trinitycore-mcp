  class: MythicPlusInterruptScaling
  method: GetRequiredInterrupters
  signature: uint32 MythicPlusInterruptScaling::GetRequiredInterrupters(uint8 level)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the number of interrupters required for a specific mythic+ dungeon
    level.
  description: The GetRequiredInterrupters method determines how many players are
    needed to successfully interrupt enemy abilities during a mythic+ dungeon run,
    based on the dungeon's level. This value is used internally by TrinityCore to
    enforce requirements for successful interrupting in mythic+ content. The method
    takes a single parameter representing the dungeon level and returns the corresponding
    number of required interrupters. This calculation is crucial for maintaining game
    balance and ensuring proper progression mechanics in mythic+ dungeons.
  parameters:
  - name: level
    description: The dungeon level (1-20) for which to calculate required interrupters.
      Valid values are typically between 1 and 20, though specific game mechanics
      may define different ranges.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of players required to successfully
    interrupt enemy abilities at the specified dungeon level. The return value is
    always a positive integer, with higher dungeon levels generally requiring more
    interrupters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 required = MythicPlusInterruptScaling::GetRequiredInterrupters(5);

      // Returns the number of interrupters needed for level 5 mythic+ dungeon'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Dungeon Scaling Logic
    code: "void ApplyDungeonScaling(uint8 dungeonLevel) {\n    uint32 interrupters\
      \ = MythicPlusInterruptScaling::GetRequiredInterrupters(dungeonLevel);\n   \
      \ // Use interrupters value to determine if player group meets requirements\n\
      \    if (playerGroupSize >= interrupters) {\n        // Allow dungeon progression\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's mythic+ scaling system and likely uses
    pre-defined tables or formulas to determine required interrupter counts. The exact
    algorithm may vary based on game balance updates, but typically increases with
    dungeon level to maintain challenge progression.
  warnings: Ensure that the input level parameter is within valid bounds (typically
    1-20) as invalid values could lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect scaling
    calculations in mythic+ content.
