documentation:
  brief: Loads throttler configuration settings from the TrinityCore configuration
    file
  description: The LoadFromConfig method initializes and populates the ThrottlerConfig
    class with values defined in the server's configuration file. This method is typically
    called during server startup or configuration reload to ensure that throttling
    parameters such as rate limits, timeouts, and concurrency controls are properly
    set according to administrator-defined settings. The method reads configuration
    entries related to throttling mechanisms and applies them to internal class members,
    affecting how the server handles request limiting and resource allocation for
    various subsystems.

  - title: Basic Configuration Loading
    code: 'ThrottlerConfig config;

      config.LoadFromConfig();

      // Configuration is now loaded from worldserver.conf'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the configuration system has been
    initialized. It's typically invoked during server initialization or when reloading
    configuration settings at runtime. The method does not return any error codes,
    but it may silently ignore invalid configuration values.
