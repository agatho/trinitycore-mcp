api:
  class: OutdoorPvP
  method: RegisterZone
  signature: void OutdoorPvP::RegisterZone(int zoneid)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a zone with the OutdoorPvP system for handling territorial control
    and player interactions.
  description: The RegisterZone method integrates a specific zone ID into the OutdoorPvP
    framework, enabling the system to track and manage player activities, territorial
    claims, and dynamic events within that zone. This method is typically invoked
    during server initialization or when adding new outdoor PvP areas to the game
    world. It sets up internal data structures and event handlers necessary for the
    OutdoorPvP system to function correctly in the specified zone. The zone ID must
    correspond to a valid area in the game world, and this registration is essential
    for any territorial gameplay mechanics to be active in that region.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneid
    description: The unique identifier of the zone to register with the OutdoorPvP
      system. This ID must match a valid area in the game world's database and typically
      corresponds to an entry in the AreaTable.dbc file.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Zone Registration
    code: 'OutdoorPvP* pvp = new OutdoorPvP();

      pvp->RegisterZone(1234); // Registers zone with ID 1234 for Outdoor PvP handling'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Zone Registration During Initialization
    code: "void InitializeOutdoorPvP() {\n    OutdoorPvP* pvp = new OutdoorPvP();\n\
      \    pvp->RegisterZone(1234);\n    pvp->RegisterZone(5678);\n    pvp->RegisterZone(9012);\n\
      \    // Additional zones can be registered here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per zone ID to avoid duplicate registrations.
    The zone must already exist in the game world's area data for successful registration.
    It is recommended to call this during server startup or when dynamically adding
    new zones to ensure proper initialization of OutdoorPvP systems.
  warnings: Calling RegisterZone with an invalid or non-existent zone ID may lead
    to undefined behavior or runtime errors. Ensure that all zone IDs passed to this
    method are valid and correspond to actual areas in the game world before calling
    this function.
