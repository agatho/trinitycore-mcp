  class: UnholyDeathKnightRefactored
  method: ConsumeRunicPower
  signature: void UnholyDeathKnightRefactored::ConsumeRunicPower(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes the specified amount of runic power from the Unholy Death Knight's
    resource pool.
  description: The ConsumeRunicPower method reduces the current runic power available
    to an Unholy Death Knight by the specified amount. This method is typically invoked
    when a spell or ability requiring runic power is cast. In the context of World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, this action directly affects the player's
    resource management system for death knights, particularly those specializing
    in the unholy tree. The method does not perform any validation on the requested
    amount, so it's expected that callers ensure sufficient runic power exists before
    invoking this function. If the requested amount exceeds available runic power,
    the behavior depends on implementation details but generally results in consuming
    all remaining runic power.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of runic power to consume from the Death Knight's resource
      pool. Must be a non-negative integer representing the amount of power units
      to deduct.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'UnholyDeathKnightRefactored* dk = ...;

      dk->ConsumeRunicPower(10);

      // Consumes 10 units of runic power from the death knight.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Consumption
    code: "UnholyDeathKnightRefactored* dk = ...;\nuint32 requiredPower = 25;\nif\
      \ (dk->GetRunicPower() >= requiredPower) {\n    dk->ConsumeRunicPower(requiredPower);\n\
      \    // Proceed with spell casting or ability activation\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core resource management system for Death Knights
    in TrinityCore. It directly modifies the internal runic power state and should
    be used carefully to avoid over-consumption. The method does not trigger any visual
    feedback or event notifications; it only updates the underlying resource value.
  warnings: Ensure that sufficient runic power exists before calling this method,
    as there is no built-in validation. Calling with a large amount may result in
    negative resource values if not properly checked by the caller.
