documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the ticket system within the support manager.
  description: The SetTicketSystemStatus method controls whether the ticket system
    is active or inactive in the TrinityCore server. This function allows administrators
    to toggle the availability of player support tickets, which are used for reporting
    issues, requesting assistance, or submitting feedback. When enabled, players can
    submit new tickets; when disabled, no new tickets can be created but existing
    ones remain accessible. The status change affects all connected clients immediately
    and persists across server restarts if configured in the database.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Ticket System
    code: SupportMgr::SetTicketSystemStatus(true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Ticket System
    code: SupportMgr::SetTicketSystemStatus(false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies a global server setting that impacts all players. It
    should be used carefully during maintenance windows or when communicating with
    players about system downtime. The actual implementation likely involves updating
    a database flag and broadcasting the change to all connected sessions.
  warnings: Disabling the ticket system while active tickets exist may prevent players
    from receiving support for ongoing issues. Ensure proper communication with players
    before disabling the system.
