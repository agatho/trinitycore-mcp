  class: AreaTrigger
  method: HandleUnitExit
  signature: void AreaTrigger::HandleUnitExit(Unit * unit)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a unit exits an area trigger.
  description: The HandleUnitExit method is invoked when a Unit (such as a player
    or creature) leaves the boundaries of an AreaTrigger. This method typically manages
    cleanup operations, sends relevant packets to clients, and may trigger additional
    game logic such as quest updates or spell effects. It ensures that proper state
    transitions occur for both the unit and the area trigger upon exit.
  parameters:
  - name: unit
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is exiting the area trigger. Must
      not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in custom area trigger handler
    code: "void MyAreaTrigger::HandleUnitExit(Unit* unit)\n{\n    if (!unit)\n   \
      \     return;\n\n    // Perform cleanup or notify related systems\n    unit->RemoveAurasDueToSpell(12345);\n\
      \    SendAreaTriggerExitPacket(unit);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called from the core's area trigger system during
    movement updates. Ensure that any modifications to the unit or trigger state are
    thread-safe if accessed concurrently.
  warnings: Do not assume that the unit pointer remains valid after calling this function
    unless explicitly documented otherwise. Avoid performing operations that could
    cause recursion or infinite loops in the area trigger logic.
