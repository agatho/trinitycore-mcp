  method: SetBotToPlayerRatio
  signature: void LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter::SetBotToPlayerRatio(float ratio)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the ratio of bots to players in the legacy bot spawner adapter.
  description: The SetBotToPlayerRatio method configures the proportion of artificial
    intelligence-controlled bots relative to real players within the legacy bot spawner
    system. This setting affects how many bots are spawned in relation to active player
    connections, allowing administrators or developers to control server population
    density and gameplay dynamics. The ratio is typically expressed as a floating-point
    value where 1.0 represents one bot for every player, 0.5 represents half as many
    bots as players, and so forth. This method likely influences the internal spawning
    logic of the bot system and may require a reload or restart to take full effect
    depending on implementation details.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Bot-to-Player Ratio to 1:1
    code: 'LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter adapter;

      adapter.SetBotToPlayerRatio(1.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configure Low Bot Density
    code: 'LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter adapter;

      adapter.SetBotToPlayerRatio(0.25f); // Only 1 bot for every 4 players'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal state variables used by the legacy bot
    spawner to determine spawn rates. It may not immediately affect existing spawns
    but will influence future bot generation. Depending on the implementation, changes
    might only take effect after a server reload or specific command execution.
  warnings: Setting this ratio too high could lead to excessive CPU usage or gameplay
    imbalance. Ensure that the value is within reasonable bounds for your server's
    capacity and desired player experience. Avoid setting it to zero if bot functionality
    is expected to remain active.
