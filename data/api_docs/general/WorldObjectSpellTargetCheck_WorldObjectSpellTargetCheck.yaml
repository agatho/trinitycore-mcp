  class: WorldObjectSpellTargetCheck
  method: WorldObjectSpellTargetCheck
  signature: void WorldObjectSpellTargetCheck::WorldObjectSpellTargetCheck(WorldObject
    * caster, WorldObject * referer, const SpellInfo * spellInfo, SpellTargetCheckTypes
    selectionType, const int * condList, SpellTargetObjectTypes objectType)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a spell target check context for evaluating valid spell targets
    based on caster, referer, spell info, and selection criteria.
  description: The WorldObjectSpellTargetCheck constructor initializes a spell target
    checking context used by the TrinityCore spell system to validate potential spell
    targets. It sets up internal state including the casting object, reference point,
    spell information, target selection type, conditional list, and expected object
    type. This mechanism is crucial for determining which objects in the game world
    can be valid targets for spells based on various criteria such as line of sight,
    faction, health status, and custom conditions defined by the spell. The system
    ensures that spells behave correctly according to their design specifications
    and game rules.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: The WorldObject that is casting the spell. This object defines the
      perspective and capabilities for target selection.
  - name: referer
    description: The reference WorldObject used to determine target positioning and
      spatial relationships during validation.
  - name: spellInfo
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure containing detailed spell configuration
      and targeting rules.
  - name: selectionType
    description: Enum value specifying how targets should be selected (e.g., nearest,
      farthest, random, etc.).
  - name: condList
    description: Array of condition IDs that must be satisfied for an object to qualify
      as a valid target.
  - name: objectType
    description: Expected type of target objects (e.g., unit, game object, item) to
      filter valid targets.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Target Check Initialization
    code: WorldObjectSpellTargetCheck checker(player, target, spellInfo, TARGET_SELECT_NEARBY,
      nullptr, TARGET_OBJECT_TYPE_UNIT);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Spell Target Check with Conditions
    code: 'int conditions[] = {1001, 1002, 1003};

      WorldObjectSpellTargetCheck checker(mob, player, spellInfo, TARGET_SELECT_RANDOM,
      conditions, TARGET_OBJECT_TYPE_UNIT);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the spell system and should not
    be called directly in most cases. The SpellTargetCheckTypes enum values are defined
    within the TrinityCore codebase and may vary between different versions. Performance
    considerations include avoiding unnecessary condition checks when possible, as
    these can impact spell execution speed.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values, especially for spellInfo or selectionType,
    can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. The condList should be properly null-terminated
    if used with variable-length arrays. Do not use this constructor outside of the
    spell targeting system context unless you fully understand its internal workings.
