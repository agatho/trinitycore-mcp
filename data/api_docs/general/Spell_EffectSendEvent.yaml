documentation:
  brief: Sends an event to the target of a spell effect, typically used for triggering
    special actions or effects.
  description: The EffectSendEvent method is used to trigger specific events or actions
    on the target of a spell effect. This method is commonly employed in spell scripts
    to handle special mechanics such as sending custom events to objects, activating
    certain triggers, or performing actions that are not directly handled by standard
    spell effects. It is often used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    to implement complex game mechanics involving event handling and object interaction.

    code: "void Spell::EffectSendEvent() {\n    // Implementation example\n    if\
      \ (m_caster && m_targets)\n        m_caster->SendEvent(m_targets, 0);\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method requires proper handling of spell target objects and may involve
    thread safety considerations when dealing with multiple targets. Performance impact
    is minimal but depends on event type being sent.
  warnings: Improper use can lead to invalid target references or incorrect event
    handling, potentially causing game crashes or unexpected behavior.
