documentation:
  brief: Initializes the auction house system for handling player auctions and transactions.
  description: The AuctionHouse constructor initializes the auction house functionality
    within the TrinityCore server. This method sets up internal data structures, registers
    necessary callbacks, and prepares the system to process auction listings, bids,
    and sales. It is typically called during server startup or when the auction house
    module is loaded. The initialization includes setting up database connections
    for auction data persistence, configuring auction timers, and preparing the auction
    house UI elements for player interaction.

  examples:
  - title: Basic AuctionHouse Initialization
    code: 'AuctionHouse auctionHouse;

      // Constructor automatically initializes the auction system

      // No explicit call needed as it''s handled during object creation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called implicitly when an AuctionHouse object is
    instantiated. The initialization process may involve database queries to load
    existing auctions and setup internal timers for auction expiration. Developers
    should ensure that the server has proper database connectivity before this constructor
    is invoked.
