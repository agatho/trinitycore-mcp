  class: QuestCompletion
  method: HandleTalkToNpcObjective
  signature: void QuestCompletion::HandleTalkToNpcObjective(Player * bot, QuestObjectiveData
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Processes quest objective completion when a player talks to an NPC.
  description: The HandleTalkToNpcObjective method is responsible for managing the
    logic associated with completing a quest objective that requires the player to
    interact with a specific NPC. This method typically verifies if the player has
    talked to the correct NPC, updates the quest progress, and may trigger subsequent
    quest events or rewards. It's part of the broader quest completion system within
    TrinityCore, ensuring proper progression through quest chains by validating player
    interactions with quest-giving or quest-ending NPCs.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or player who is
      interacting with the NPC. This parameter must not be null and should represent
      a valid player instance.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing information
      about the specific objective being processed, including target NPC ID, quest
      ID, and completion state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleTalkToNpcObjective
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player instance

      QuestObjectiveData questObj;

      questObj.npcId = 12345;

      questObj.questId = 67890;

      questObj.type = QUEST_OBJECTIVE_TALK_TO_NPC;


      // Call the method to process the objective

      questCompletion->HandleTalkToNpcObjective(player, questObj);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has already initiated conversation with
    the NPC and that the interaction has been validated by the game's core systems.
    The method does not handle NPC dialogue logic itself but rather processes the
    outcome of such interactions in terms of quest progression.
  warnings: Ensure that the objective data passed to this method is properly initialized
    and contains valid quest and NPC identifiers. Passing invalid or uninitialized
    data may result in undefined behavior or quest progression issues.
