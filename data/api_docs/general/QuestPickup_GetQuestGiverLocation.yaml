  signature: int QuestPickup::GetQuestGiverLocation(uint32 questGiverGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the location of a quest giver based on their GUID.
  description: The GetQuestGiverLocation method is used to determine the geographical
    position of a quest giver within the World of Warcraft world. This function takes
    a unique identifier (GUID) for a quest giver and returns an integer representing
    the location data, which typically corresponds to a specific zone or area in the
    game world. The method is commonly used during quest interaction logic to ensure
    proper quest tracking and to provide contextual information about where the player
    should go to complete or turn in quests. It's important to note that this method
    operates within the TrinityCore framework and relies on internal quest giver data
    structures.
  parameters:
  - name: questGiverGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the quest giver entity. This value
      must correspond to a valid NPC or object in the game world that is registered
      as a quest giver.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the location identifier of the quest giver.
    The exact meaning of this integer depends on the internal mapping system used
    by TrinityCore, typically corresponding to zone IDs or area IDs. A return value
    of -1 may indicate an error or invalid GUID was provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 questGiverGuid = 12345;\nint location = questPickup->GetQuestGiverLocation(questGiverGuid);\n\
      if (location != -1) {\n    // Process the quest giver's location\n    printf(\"\
      Quest giver is located in area: %d\\n\", location);\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ invalid GUID case\n    printf(\"Invalid quest giver GUID provided.\\n\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the quest giver GUID is valid and corresponds to
    an existing entity in the game world. The returned integer value represents a
    location identifier which may be used for zone-based quest logic, area tracking,
    or other spatial gameplay mechanics. Ensure that the GUID passed to this function
    is properly validated before calling.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or non-existent quest giver GUID may result in undefined
    behavior or incorrect return values. Always validate input parameters and handle
    potential error conditions appropriately when using this method.
