  class: FarmingCoordinator
  method: ReturnToOriginalPosition
  signature: void FarmingCoordinator::ReturnToOriginalPosition(int * player, const
    FarmingSession & session)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the player to their original position after a farming session.
  description: The ReturnToOriginalPosition method is responsible for teleporting
    a player back to their starting location after completing a farming session. This
    ensures that players are not left stranded at the end of a farming operation and
    maintains proper game flow. The method uses the FarmingSession data to determine
    the original position and performs the necessary teleportation logic. It is typically
    called when a farming session ends, either naturally or through player interaction.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object that needs to be teleported back to
      their original position.
  - name: session
    description: Reference to the FarmingSession object containing session data including
      original position coordinates and session metadata.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ReturnToOriginalPosition
    code: 'FarmingCoordinator coordinator;

      Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      FarmingSession session = ...; // Get session data

      coordinator.ReturnToOriginalPosition(player, session);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves coordinate validation and may perform checks
    to ensure the original position is valid before teleporting. It might also update
    player state or send relevant packets to synchronize the client with the new position.
