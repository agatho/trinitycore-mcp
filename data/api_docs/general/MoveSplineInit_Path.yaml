  class: MoveSplineInit
  method: Path
  signature: PointsArray & MoveSplineInit::Path()
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the internal path points array used for spline movement
    calculations.
  description: The Path() method provides access to the internal collection of waypoints
    that define the movement path for a spline-based motion. This array contains the
    sequence of points through which an object (such as a creature or player) will
    move using the MoveSpline system. The returned reference allows direct manipulation
    of these path points, enabling dynamic modification of movement trajectories during
    runtime. This is commonly used in AI behaviors, scripted movements, and custom
    pathfinding implementations within TrinityCore's movement system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A non-const reference to the internal PointsArray that holds all the waypoints
    defining the current spline path. Modifications to this array directly affect
    the movement path calculation.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing and modifying path points
    code: 'MoveSplineInit splineInit;

      // ... initialize spline with some path ...

      auto& path = splineInit.Path();

      path.push_back(G3D::Vector3(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f)); // Add new waypoint

      path[0] = G3D::Vector3(50.0f, 150.0f, 250.0f);       // Modify first waypoint'
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterating through path points for debugging
    code: "MoveSplineInit splineInit;\n// ... initialize spline with some path ...\n\
      const auto& path = splineInit.Path();\nfor (size_t i = 0; i < path.size(); ++i)\n\
      {\n    const auto& point = path[i];\n    printf(\"Waypoint %zu: (%.2f, %.2f,\
      \ %.2f)\\n\", i, point.x, point.y, point.z);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned PointsArray reference points directly to internal data structures.
    Modifying the array contents affects the spline path immediately. Be cautious
    when modifying during active movement calculations as it may cause unexpected
    behavior or inconsistencies in movement interpolation.
  warnings: Direct modification of the returned array can lead to undefined behavior
    if done during active spline execution. Always ensure proper synchronization when
    modifying path points in multi-threaded environments. Changes made to this array
    will immediately impact the movement calculation without additional validation.
