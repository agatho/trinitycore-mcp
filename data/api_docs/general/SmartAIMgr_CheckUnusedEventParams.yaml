  signature: bool SmartAIMgr::CheckUnusedEventParams(const SmartScriptHolder & e)
documentation:
  brief: Validates that all event parameters in a SmartScriptHolder are properly initialized
    and unused.
  description: The CheckUnusedEventParams method performs validation on a SmartScriptHolder
    object to ensure that all event parameters have been correctly set and are not
    left in an uninitialized or invalid state. This method is typically used during
    script loading or validation phases to catch potential configuration errors in
    AI scripts. It checks for proper initialization of event-related fields and verifies
    that no required parameters are missing or improperly configured. The method returns
    true if all parameters are valid, false otherwise. This validation helps maintain
    script integrity and prevents runtime issues caused by malformed AI event configurations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all event parameters in the SmartScriptHolder are properly
    initialized and valid; returns false if any parameter is uninitialized, invalid,
    or missing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Script Validation
    code: "SmartScriptHolder holder;\n// ... populate holder with event data ...\n\
      bool isValid = sSmartAIMgr->CheckUnusedEventParams(holder);\nif (!isValid)\n\
      {\n    // Handle invalid script configuration\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid\
      \ SmartAI event parameters detected\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used during AI script loading and validation phases.
    It's important to note that this validation occurs at runtime, so performance
    impact should be considered in high-frequency scenarios. The method assumes that
    the SmartScriptHolder has already been partially populated with event data before
    calling.
  warnings: This method may return false for valid configurations if event parameters
    are not properly initialized. Developers should ensure all required fields are
    set before calling this validation method. Improper handling of the return value
    can lead to silent failures in AI behavior.
