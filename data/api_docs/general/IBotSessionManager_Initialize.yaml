  class: IBotSessionManager
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool IBotSessionManager::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot session manager, setting up internal structures and preparing
    for bot operations.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the IBotSessionManager for managing
    bot sessions by performing necessary setup operations such as initializing internal
    data structures, registering required callbacks, and ensuring all dependencies
    are ready. This method should be called once during system startup before any
    bot-related operations are performed. The initialization process may involve loading
    configuration settings, establishing connections to necessary subsystems, or allocating
    resources needed for bot management. If initialization fails, subsequent calls
    to bot session methods may not behave correctly.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initialization was successful and all internal components
    were properly set up; returns false if any critical error occurred during setup,
    indicating that the manager is not ready for use.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: "IBotSessionManager* sessionManager = new IBotSessionManager();\nif (sessionManager->Initialize())\
      \ {\n    // Manager is ready for use\n    printf(\"Bot session manager initialized\
      \ successfully.\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n   \
      \ printf(\"Failed to initialize bot session manager.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or when the bot system
    is first enabled. It's important to check the return value and handle initialization
    failures appropriately, as an uninitialized manager may cause crashes or undefined
    behavior when used.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may lead to
    resource leaks or inconsistent internal state. Ensure that Initialize() is only
    called once per instance before any other bot session operations.
