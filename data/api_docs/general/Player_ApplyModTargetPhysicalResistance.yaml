  method: ApplyModTargetPhysicalResistance
  signature: void Player::ApplyModTargetPhysicalResistance(int32 mod, bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes a modifier to the player's target physical resistance.
  description: This method modifies the player's target physical resistance by applying
    or removing a specified modifier value. It is used in various game mechanics including
    combat calculations, damage reduction, and resistance adjustments. The method
    affects the player's ability to resist physical damage from attacks, with the
    modifier potentially being positive (increasing resistance) or negative (decreasing
    resistance). This functionality is commonly used in spell effects, buffs, and
    debuffs within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: mod
    description: The modifier value to apply or remove. Positive values increase resistance,
      while negative values decrease it.
  - name: apply
    description: If true, applies the modifier; if false, removes it. This parameter
      determines whether the modifier is added or subtracted from the current resistance
      value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->ApplyModTargetPhysicalResistance(10, true);

      // Applies +10 to physical resistance'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      int32 modifier = -5;

      bool apply = false;

      player->ApplyModTargetPhysicalResistance(modifier, apply);

      // Removes -5 from physical resistance'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other resistance-related
    functions and may interact with existing resistance calculations. The modification
    affects the player's overall resistance value which impacts combat effectiveness
    against physical attacks.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect resistance calculations,
    potentially affecting combat outcomes. Care should be taken when applying modifiers
    to ensure they align with intended game mechanics.
