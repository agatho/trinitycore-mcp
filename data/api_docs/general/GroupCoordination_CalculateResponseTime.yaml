  class: GroupCoordination
  method: CalculateResponseTime
  signature: float GroupCoordination::CalculateResponseTime(uint32 commandTime)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the response time for a group coordination command based on the
    provided command timestamp.
  description: The CalculateResponseTime method computes the elapsed time in seconds
    between the current moment and a specified command timestamp. This is used within
    the GroupCoordination system to measure how long it takes for group members to
    respond to coordination commands such as movement requests or actions. The method
    relies on internal timing mechanisms to determine the difference between the current
    game time and the provided commandTime parameter. It's typically invoked when
    evaluating the performance of group coordination features or determining if a
    response has timed out.
  parameters:
  - name: commandTime
    description: The timestamp (in milliseconds since epoch) when the coordination
      command was issued. This value is usually obtained from the game's internal
      time system and represents the start time of the command.
  returns: A float value representing the elapsed time in seconds between the current
    time and the provided commandTime. Returns a negative value if the commandTime
    is in the future, or zero if the commandTime equals the current time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 commandTimestamp = WorldTimer::getMSTime();

      float responseTime = groupCoordination->CalculateResponseTime(commandTimestamp);

      // responseTime will be close to 0.0f if called immediately after setting the
      timestamp'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Response Timeout
    code: "uint32 commandTimestamp = WorldTimer::getMSTime();\n// ... some time passes\
      \ ...\nfloat responseTime = groupCoordination->CalculateResponseTime(commandTimestamp);\n\
      if (responseTime > 10.0f) {\n    // Handle timeout - no response within 10 seconds\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method depends on the WorldTimer::getMSTime() function for accurate
    timing. The internal implementation likely uses a high-resolution timer to ensure
    precision in measuring short time intervals. It's important to note that commandTime
    should be obtained from the same time source used by the game engine to avoid
    discrepancies.
  warnings: Ensure that commandTime is always a valid timestamp from the game's time
    system; otherwise, unexpected negative values or large positive values may result.
    This method does not perform any validation on the input parameter and assumes
    it represents a valid point in time.
