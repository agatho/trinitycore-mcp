  class: HealthTrigger
  method: SetThreshold
  signature: void HealthTrigger::SetThreshold(float threshold)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the health threshold value for the HealthTrigger instance
  description: The SetThreshold method configures the health percentage threshold
    that determines when the trigger activates. This value is typically expressed
    as a float between 0.0 and 1.0, representing 0% to 100% of maximum health. When
    the target's health drops below this threshold, the associated AI behavior or
    event will be triggered. The method does not validate the input range but assumes
    values are within expected bounds for proper functionality.
  parameters:
  - name: threshold
    description: The health percentage threshold as a float value between 0.0 (0%)
      and 1.0 (100%). Values outside this range may produce unexpected behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'HealthTrigger* trigger = new HealthTrigger();

      trigger->SetThreshold(0.3f); // Trigger when health drops below 30%'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Critical Threshold
    code: 'HealthTrigger* lowHealthTrigger = new HealthTrigger();

      lowHealthTrigger->SetThreshold(0.1f); // Trigger at 10% health

      HealthTrigger* nearDeathTrigger = new HealthTrigger();

      nearDeathTrigger->SetThreshold(0.05f); // Trigger at 5% health'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with AI behavior systems where
    specific actions should occur when a creature's health falls below certain levels.
    The threshold value is stored internally and compared against current health percentage
    during AI update cycles.
  warnings: Setting the threshold to values outside the 0.0-1.0 range may cause unexpected
    behavior or trigger conditions at inappropriate health levels. Ensure that the
    threshold is properly validated before calling this method in production code.
