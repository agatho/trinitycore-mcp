  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: CaptureCart
  signature: bool BattlegroundAI::CaptureCart(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to capture a cart in a battleground, returning true if successful.
  description: The CaptureCart method is used within battleground AI logic to handle
    the capture of carts, typically found in battlegrounds such as Warsong Gulch or
    Arathi Basin. This method attempts to perform the cart capture action for a player,
    likely updating game state and scoring. It may involve checking if the player
    is eligible to capture the cart, verifying the cart's current status, and applying
    necessary game mechanics like scoring points or updating the cart's ownership.
    The method returns true if the capture was successful, and false otherwise, indicating
    potential failure conditions such as invalid player state, cart already captured,
    or battleground rules preventing capture.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player ID attempting to capture
      the cart. This value is typically used internally to identify and validate the
      capturing player.
  returns: Returns true if the cart capture was successful, false otherwise. Failure
    may occur due to invalid player state, cart already captured, or other game rule
    violations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in battleground AI
    code: "if (bgAI->CaptureCart(&playerId)) {\n    // Cart successfully captured\n\
      \    // Update UI or apply scoring logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking capture result before applying effects
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nif (bgAI->CaptureCart(&playerId)) {\n    // Apply\
      \ capture effects\n    player->ModifyMoney(1000);\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      You captured the cart!\");\n} else {\n    // Handle failed capture attempt\n\
      \    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Capture failed.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger battleground AI system and may interact
    with other game systems like scoring, player state tracking, and cart ownership.
    The parameter 'player' should be validated before use to ensure it refers to a
    valid player in the current battleground context.
  warnings: Ensure that the player ID passed is valid and corresponds to an active
    player in the battleground; otherwise, the method may fail or cause undefined
    behavior. This method might not be thread-safe if used outside of the game's main
    thread context.
