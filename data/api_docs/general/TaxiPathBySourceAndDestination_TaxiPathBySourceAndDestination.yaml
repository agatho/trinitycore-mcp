  method: TaxiPathBySourceAndDestination
  signature: void TaxiPathBySourceAndDestination::TaxiPathBySourceAndDestination(uint32
    _id, uint32 _price)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a taxi path entry with the specified ID and price.
  description: The TaxiPathBySourceAndDestination constructor initializes a taxi path
    object with the provided unique identifier and associated cost. This method is
    typically used within the TrinityCore framework to set up taxi path data structures
    that define travel routes between different locations in Azeroth. The ID parameter
    corresponds to a unique identifier for the taxi path, while the price represents
    the gold cost required to take that particular route. This constructor is part
    of the internal taxi system implementation and is not directly called by game
    scripts or addons.
  parameters:
  - name: _id
    description: Unique identifier for the taxi path entry. This value must correspond
      to a valid taxi path in the database.
  - name: _price
    description: The gold price required to travel along this taxi path. Must be a
      non-negative integer representing the cost in copper coins.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new taxi path entry
    code: TaxiPathBySourceAndDestination path(1234, 5000); // Creates a taxi path
      with ID 1234 costing 50 gold
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the internal taxi path management system and
    should not be directly invoked by external code. The class likely serves as a
    data container for storing taxi path information in memory, with database synchronization
    handled separately.
