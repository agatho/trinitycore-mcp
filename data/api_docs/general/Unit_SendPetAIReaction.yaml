  signature: void Unit::SendPetAIReaction(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a pet AI reaction to the specified GUID
  description: This method triggers a pet AI reaction for a given GUID, typically
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to handle pet behavior and responses
    within the game world. It is commonly employed when a pet needs to react to specific
    events or actions from the player or environment, such as when a pet's owner issues
    commands or when certain combat situations occur. The method ensures that the
    pet's AI state is properly updated and communicated to the client.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the pet that should receive the AI
      reaction. This parameter represents the specific pet object within the game
      world for which the reaction is being triggered.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pet AI Reaction Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SendPetAIReaction(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other pet-related methods
    and should be called within a proper game context where pets are active. Implementation
    details include ensuring that the GUID corresponds to an actual pet object, and
    that the reaction is properly handled by the client's AI system.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect pet behavior or even
    crashes if the GUID does not correspond to an existing pet. Care should be taken
    when calling this method in scenarios involving multiple pets or complex AI interactions.
