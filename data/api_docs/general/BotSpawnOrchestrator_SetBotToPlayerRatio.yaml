  brief: Sets the ratio of bots to players in the world
  description: Configures the bot-to-player ratio that determines how many NPC bots
    should be spawned relative to the number of actual players. This method adjusts
    the spawning logic to maintain the specified ratio dynamically as players join
    or leave the game. The ratio is typically expressed as a decimal value where 1.0
    represents one bot per player, 0.5 represents half a bot per player (rounded),
    and so on. This setting affects the overall bot population in the world and can
    be used to balance gameplay or simulate different server conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Bot-to-Player Ratio to 1:1
    code: BotSpawnOrchestrator::instance()->SetBotToPlayerRatio(1.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Set Bot-to-Player Ratio to 0.5:1 (Half as Many Bots)
    code: BotSpawnOrchestrator::instance()->SetBotToPlayerRatio(0.5f);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers an immediate recalculation of bot population
    based on the new ratio. The implementation may involve checking existing bot counts
    and spawning or despawning bots accordingly to maintain the desired ratio.
  warnings: Setting this value too high may cause performance issues due to excessive
    bot spawning. Setting it too low might result in insufficient bot presence for
    certain game mechanics or activities.
