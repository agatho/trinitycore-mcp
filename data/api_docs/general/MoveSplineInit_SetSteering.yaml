documentation:
  brief: Initializes steering parameters for a spline movement path
  description: The SetSteering method configures the steering behavior for a MoveSplineInit
    object, determining how the movement path will be adjusted to avoid obstacles
    or follow specific directional constraints. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with spline-based movement systems to ensure smooth and realistic character navigation
    through the game world. The implementation likely sets internal flags or parameters
    that influence the spline calculation process, affecting how waypoints are interpolated
    and how the final movement trajectory is computed.

  - title: Basic Steering Initialization
    code: 'MoveSplineInit splineInit;

      splineInit.SetSteering();

      // Initializes default steering behavior for spline movement'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal movement system and typically called
    during the initialization phase of spline-based character movement. It may be
    automatically invoked by higher-level movement APIs in TrinityCore, but can also
    be explicitly called when custom steering behavior is required.
