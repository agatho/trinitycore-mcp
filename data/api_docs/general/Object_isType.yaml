  class: Object
  method: isType
  signature: bool Object::isType(uint16 mask) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the object is of a specific type.
  description: The isType method checks if the current Object instance belongs to
    a specific type category defined by the provided mask. This method is commonly
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to differentiate between various
    object types such as GameObject, Item, Unit, Player, and others. It allows developers
    to perform type-specific operations or validations based on the object's type
    without needing to explicitly cast or check against specific classes. The method
    returns true if the object's type matches the specified mask, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the object's type matches the provided mask, false otherwise.
    The mask parameter represents a bitmask that defines the type category being checked.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (obj->isType(TYPEMASK_PLAYER)) {\n    // Handle player-specific logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'bool isPlayer = obj->isType(TYPEMASK_PLAYER);

      bool isCreature = obj->isType(TYPEMASK_CREATURE);

      bool isGameObject = obj->isType(TYPEMASK_GAMEOBJECT);

      // These checks can be used to determine which type of object we''re dealing
      with'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Object's type system and relies on internal type
    definitions. It should be used carefully when performing type checks, as it may
    impact performance if used excessively in tight loops. The method is thread-safe
    and can be safely called from multiple threads.
  warnings: The mask parameter must be a valid type mask; invalid or malformed masks
    could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. Avoid using this method for complex
    conditional logic without proper validation.
