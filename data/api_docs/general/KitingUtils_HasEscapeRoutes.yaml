  class: KitingUtils
  method: HasEscapeRoutes
  signature: bool KitingUtils::HasEscapeRoutes(const int & pos, uint32 routeCount)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given position has available escape routes for kiting
    mechanics.
  description: The HasEscapeRoutes method evaluates if a specified position in the
    game world contains valid escape routes that can be used by units engaged in kiting
    behavior. This functionality is typically utilized in AI pathfinding and combat
    logic to determine viable retreat paths or evasive maneuvers. The method considers
    factors such as terrain, obstacles, and navigation constraints to assess route
    availability. It is commonly called during NPC movement decisions and player-controlled
    unit behavior calculations.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: Reference to an integer representing the position identifier or index
      within the kiting system's internal data structures. This typically corresponds
      to a specific location in the game world that is being evaluated for escape
      route availability.
  - name: routeCount
    description: The number of potential escape routes to evaluate for validity at
      the specified position. This parameter defines how many possible paths should
      be checked from the given position.
  returns: Returns true if at least one valid escape route exists from the specified
    position, otherwise returns false. A valid route must meet all necessary criteria
    such as navigability and absence of blocking obstacles.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (KitingUtils::HasEscapeRoutes(playerPosition, 3)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with kiting behavior\n    unit->SetFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS, UNIT_FLAG_KITING);\n\
      } else {\n    // No escape routes available, consider alternative actions\n\
      \    unit->AttackStart(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Pathfinding System
    code: "uint32 escapeRoutes = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {\n    if (KitingUtils::HasEscapeRoutes(playerPosition\
      \ + i, 1)) {\n        escapeRoutes++;\n    }\n}\nif (escapeRoutes >= 2) {\n\
      \    // Safe to initiate kiting\n    unit->StartKiting();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is performance-sensitive and should not be called excessively
    in tight loops. The implementation likely caches route evaluation results for
    better efficiency when the same positions are checked repeatedly. The 'pos' parameter
    must refer to a valid location within the kiting system's defined range.
  warnings: Do not use this method without ensuring that the position value is valid
    and within expected bounds, as invalid positions may cause undefined behavior
    or crashes. The routeCount parameter should be limited to reasonable values to
    prevent excessive computation overhead.
