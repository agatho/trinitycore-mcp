  class: DynamicObject
  method: UnbindFromCaster
  signature: void DynamicObject::UnbindFromCaster()
documentation:
  brief: Removes the dynamic object's binding to its caster, detaching it from the
    source that created it.
  description: The UnbindFromCaster method releases the association between a DynamicObject
    and its original caster. This typically occurs when a spell effect that created
    the dynamic object expires or is removed. The method ensures that the dynamic
    object no longer maintains a reference to its creator, allowing proper cleanup
    of resources. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, this is commonly called
    during spell effect expiration or removal to prevent dangling references and ensure
    clean object lifecycle management.

  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Effect Cleanup
    code: "void MySpellEffect::OnRemove()\n{\n    if (m_dynamicObject)\n        m_dynamicObject->UnbindFromCaster();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the core spell system when
    a dynamic object's duration expires or when the caster removes the effect. It
    should not be called manually unless implementing custom spell behavior that requires
    explicit unbinding.
  warnings: Calling this method on a dynamic object that has already been destroyed
    or removed can lead to undefined behavior. Always verify object validity before
    calling this method.
