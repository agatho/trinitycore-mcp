documentation:
  brief: Interrupts power regeneration for the specified amount of time.
  description: This method interrupts the player's power regeneration, typically used
    to stop mana or focus regeneration during specific game mechanics such as combat
    or when a spell is cast. It prevents the player from regenerating power while
    the interruption is active. The method is commonly used in conjunction with other
    power-related functions to control player behavior during gameplay events.
  parameters:
  - name: power
    description: The amount of time (in milliseconds) to interrupt power regeneration.
      This parameter determines how long the regeneration will be suspended.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player;

      player->InterruptPowerRegen(5000); // Interrupts power regeneration for 5 seconds'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in combination with other power management
    functions. It may affect the player's ability to regenerate power during combat
    or spell casting, and should be used carefully to avoid unintended consequences.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior in gameplay
    mechanics, especially when combined with other power regeneration control methods.
