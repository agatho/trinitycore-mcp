  signature: float MarketAnalysis::CalculateLiquidityScore(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a liquidity score for a specified item based on market
    activity and trading volume.
  description: The CalculateLiquidityScore method computes a numerical liquidity score
    for a given item ID, which reflects how easily the item can be bought or sold
    in the game's economy. This score is typically derived from factors such as recent
    transaction frequency, average trade price, and market demand. The method is used
    to assess the health of an item's market presence and can influence gameplay mechanics
    like auction house pricing strategies or vendor buyback rates. It requires a valid
    item ID that exists in the game's database. The returned score is normalized to
    a float value between 0.0 (least liquid) and 1.0 (most liquid), making it easy
    to compare liquidity across different items.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the liquidity score of the specified item, ranging
    from 0.0 (least liquid) to 1.0 (most liquid). Returns 0.0 if the item ID is invalid
    or no market data is available for the item.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: float liquidity = marketAnalysis.CalculateLiquidityScore(18732); // Calculates
      liquidity for a common weapon
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Conditional Logic
    code: "float score = marketAnalysis.CalculateLiquidityScore(12345);\nif (score\
      \ > 0.7f) {\n    // Item is highly liquid, good for trading\n} else if (score\
      \ < 0.3f) {\n    // Item has low liquidity, may be hard to sell\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal market data structures and may involve
    database queries or cached statistics. It is recommended to cache results for
    frequently accessed item IDs to improve performance. The exact algorithm used
    to calculate the score is not exposed, but it's designed to reflect real-time
    trading behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid item ID (e.g., one that does not exist
    in the game's item database) will return a score of 0.0 and may log warnings or
    errors depending on implementation. Ensure all item IDs passed are valid before
    calling to avoid unexpected behavior.
