api:
  class: RoleAssignment
  method: FindPlayersForRole
  signature: int RoleAssignment::FindPlayersForRole(GroupRole role, const int & candidates)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the number of players assigned to a specific role within
    a group.
  description: The FindPlayersForRole method is used to determine how many players
    in the current group have been assigned a particular role. This method is typically
    utilized in group management systems, such as those found in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework, where roles like tank, healer, or damage dealer are assigned
    to players for organized gameplay. It allows the system to quickly assess role
    distribution and can be used for balancing groups, assigning loot, or triggering
    specific game mechanics based on role composition. The method operates on a predefined
    set of group roles and requires a valid role identifier to function correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: role
    description: The GroupRole enum value specifying the role to search for within
      the group. Valid values are typically defined as constants such as GROUP_ROLE_TANK,
      GROUP_ROLE_HEALER, or GROUP_ROLE_DAMAGE.
  - name: candidates
    description: An integer reference that represents the number of players eligible
      for the specified role. This parameter is used to pass in the candidate count
      and may be modified by the method during execution.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the total number of players in the group
    who have been assigned the specified role. A return value of zero indicates no
    players are assigned to that role, while a positive integer reflects the actual
    count of players with that role.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int candidates = 10;

      GroupRole role = GROUP_ROLE_HEALER;

      int healerCount = roleAssignment.FindPlayersForRole(role, candidates);

      // healerCount now holds the number of healers in the group'
    language: cpp
  - title: Role Distribution Check
    code: 'int totalPlayers = 5;

      int tankCount = roleAssignment.FindPlayersForRole(GROUP_ROLE_TANK, totalPlayers);

      int healerCount = roleAssignment.FindPlayersForRole(GROUP_ROLE_HEALER, totalPlayers);

      int damageCount = roleAssignment.FindPlayersForRole(GROUP_ROLE_DAMAGE, totalPlayers);

      // Use counts to verify balanced group composition'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that player roles are already established within the
    group and does not perform any role assignment or validation. It is primarily
    a lookup function and should be used in conjunction with other methods that manage
    role assignments. Performance may vary depending on the number of players in the
    group, though it's optimized for typical group sizes.
  warnings: Ensure that the GroupRole enum values passed to this method are valid
    and defined within the system; passing invalid role values may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect results. The candidates parameter should be initialized
    with a meaningful value before calling this method.
