documentation:
  brief: Called when a boss creature returns to its home position after being engaged
    in combat.
  description: The JustReachedHome method is invoked by the BossAI framework when
    a boss creature successfully returns to its predefined home location, typically
    after being defeated or fleeing from combat. This method serves as a callback
    for custom AI logic that should execute upon the boss's return to its original
    position. It is commonly used to reset the boss's state, trigger events, or perform
    cleanup operations after an encounter has concluded. The method does not take
    any parameters and performs no direct actions itself; it simply signals that the
    home position has been reached.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "class MyBossAI : public BossAI\n{\npublic:\n    void JustReachedHome()\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Reset boss state upon returning home\n       \
      \ me->SetReactState(REACT_IDLE);\n        me->RemoveAllAuras();\n        BossAI::JustReachedHome();\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the BossAI base class and should be overridden in
    derived boss AI classes to implement custom behavior. It is typically called after
    a boss has completed its retreat sequence or after being defeated and returning
    to its spawn point.
