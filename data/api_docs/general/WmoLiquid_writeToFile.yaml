  class: WmoLiquid
  method: writeToFile
  signature: bool WmoLiquid::writeToFile(int * wf)
documentation:
  brief: Writes WMO liquid data to a file using the provided write function pointer.
  description: The writeToFile method serializes the WMO (World Map Object) liquid
    data into a file format. This method is typically used during map generation or
    export processes where WMO liquid information needs to be persisted to disk. The
    method takes a pointer to a write function that handles the actual file writing
    operations. It returns true if the operation was successful, false otherwise.
    The WMO liquid data includes information about water surfaces, such as their height,
    type, and boundaries within the world map.
  parameters:
  - name: wf
    description: Pointer to an integer function that handles file writing operations.
      This parameter is expected to be a valid function pointer that can write data
      to a file stream.
  returns: True if the WMO liquid data was successfully written to the file, false
    if the operation failed or encountered an error during the writing process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of writeToFile with a custom write function
    code: "int customWriteFunction(int* data) {\n    // Implementation of custom write\
      \ logic\n    return 0;\n}\n\nWmoLiquid liquid;\nbool success = liquid.writeToFile(&customWriteFunction);\n\
      if (success) {\n    printf(\"WMO liquid data written successfully\\n\");\n}\
      \ else {\n    printf(\"Failed to write WMO liquid data\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the provided function pointer 'wf' to perform actual
    file I/O operations. Ensure that the function pointed to by 'wf' is properly implemented
    and handles potential errors during write operations. The method does not manage
    file opening or closing; it assumes these are handled externally.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the 'wf' parameter will likely result in a
    crash or undefined behavior. Always validate that the function pointer is valid
    before calling this method. Additionally, ensure thread safety if multiple threads
    attempt to write to the same file simultaneously.
