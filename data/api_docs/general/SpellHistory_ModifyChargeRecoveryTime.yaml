  class: SpellHistory
  method: ModifyChargeRecoveryTime
  signature: void SpellHistory::ModifyChargeRecoveryTime(int chargeCategoryId, int
    cooldownMod)
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the recovery time of spell charges for a specified charge category.
  description: The ModifyChargeRecoveryTime method adjusts the cooldown modification
    value applied to spell charges within a given charge category. This functionality
    is typically used to alter how quickly charges replenish, which can affect gameplay
    mechanics such as ability usage frequency or resource management. The method operates
    on internal charge recovery data structures and may influence the behavior of
    abilities that utilize charged resources. It's commonly invoked during spell effects,
    buff/debuff applications, or other game events that modify cooldown behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: chargeCategoryId
    description: 'An integer identifier representing the specific charge category
      to modify. This corresponds to predefined charge categories in the spell system,
      such as those used for abilities like Shadow Word: Death or other charged spells.'
  - name: cooldownMod
    description: An integer value that modifies the cooldown time of charges in the
      specified category. Positive values increase recovery time, while negative values
      decrease it. Zero means no change to the base recovery time.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reduce Charge Recovery Time by 50%
    code: 'SpellHistory* spellHistory = player->GetSpellHistory();

      spellHistory->ModifyChargeRecoveryTime(123, -500); // Reduces recovery time
      by 500ms for category 123'
    language: cpp
  - title: Increase Charge Recovery Time for a Specific Ability
    code: 'SpellHistory* spellHistory = player->GetSpellHistory();

      spellHistory->ModifyChargeRecoveryTime(456, 1000); // Increases recovery time
      by 1 second for category 456'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal cooldown tracking data and should be used carefully
    to avoid unintended side effects on spell behavior. Changes made through this
    method are temporary unless persisted in a saved state or applied via a lasting
    effect.
  warnings: Incorrect charge category IDs can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
    Ensure that the provided category ID corresponds to an existing charge category
    defined in the game's spell system.
