  class: ObjectGuidFactory
  method: CreateWebObj
  signature: ObjectGuid ObjectGuidFactory::CreateWebObj(uint32 realmId, uint8 arg1,
    uint8 arg2, uint64 counter)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new ObjectGuid for a web object using specified realm, arguments,
    and counter values.
  description: The CreateWebObj method generates a unique ObjectGuid identifier specifically
    designed for web-related game objects within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    constructs the GUID by combining a realm ID, two 8-bit arguments, and a 64-bit
    counter value to ensure global uniqueness across the game world. The resulting
    ObjectGuid can be used to uniquely identify and reference web objects such as
    virtual items, interactive elements, or server-side representations of web content
    within the game's object management system.
  parameters:
  - name: realmId
    description: The unique identifier of the realm where the web object exists. This
      value determines which realm context the GUID belongs to and helps prevent collisions
      between different realms.
  - name: arg1
    description: First 8-bit argument used to encode specific properties or types
      of the web object. Valid values are in the range 0-255, with meaning dependent
      on the calling context.
  - name: arg2
    description: Second 8-bit argument used for additional encoding of web object
      properties. Valid values are in the range 0-255, and its interpretation depends
      on the specific implementation or subsystem using this GUID.
  - name: counter
    description: A 64-bit counter value that ensures uniqueness among multiple objects
      created with identical realmId and arguments. This value typically increments
      to provide sequential identification for similar objects.
  returns: Returns an ObjectGuid object representing the unique identifier for the
    web object. The returned GUID is constructed using the provided parameters in
    a format consistent with TrinityCore's object ID management system, suitable for
    use in game world operations and networking.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CreateWebObj
    code: 'ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuidFactory::CreateWebObj(1, 0x05, 0x10, 123456);

      // Creates a GUID for a web object in realm 1 with args 5 and 16, counter 123456'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating multiple unique web object GUIDs
    code: "std::vector<ObjectGuid> webGuids;\nfor (uint64 i = 0; i < 10; ++i)\n{\n\
      \    webGuids.push_back(ObjectGuidFactory::CreateWebObj(2, 0x20, 0x30, i));\n\
      }\n// Generates 10 unique GUIDs for web objects in realm 2 with fixed args and\
      \ incrementing counters"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used when creating server-side representations of
    web content or virtual items that need to be tracked within the game world. The
    ObjectGuid returned by this method follows TrinityCore's standard GUID layout
    conventions, ensuring compatibility with existing object management systems. The
    counter parameter should be managed carefully to avoid collisions, especially
    in high-frequency creation scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that realmId values are valid and correspond to actual realms in
    your server configuration. Incorrect realm IDs may lead to invalid GUIDs or unexpected
    behavior in object resolution. Also note that arg1 and arg2 values should be chosen
    carefully to maintain semantic meaning within the calling subsystem, as these
    values may be used for type discrimination.
