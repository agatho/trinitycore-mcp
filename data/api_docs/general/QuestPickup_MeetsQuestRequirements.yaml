  class: QuestPickup
  method: MeetsQuestRequirements
  signature: bool QuestPickup::MeetsQuestRequirements(uint32 questId, Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player meets all requirements to start or continue a specific
    quest.
  description: The MeetsQuestRequirements method evaluates whether a given player
    has satisfied all prerequisites necessary to accept or progress through a specified
    quest. This includes checking for required level, previous quest completion, item
    inventory, and other conditional criteria defined in the quest's data. The method
    is typically used by quest pickup systems to determine if a quest can be offered
    to a player or if the player can advance to the next stage of the quest. It ensures
    that players cannot bypass quest requirements through invalid means.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to check requirements for. Must
      correspond to a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose quest
      requirements are being validated. Cannot be null.
  returns: Returns true if all quest requirements are met for the specified player,
    otherwise returns false. A return value of false indicates that one or more conditions
    (such as level, previous quests, items, etc.) have not been satisfied.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Requirement Check
    code: "if (questPickup->MeetsQuestRequirements(12345, player)) {\n    // Player\
      \ can accept or continue the quest\n    player->AddQuest(12345);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Player does not meet requirements\n    player->SendNotification(\"You\
      \ do not meet the requirements for this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Quest Gossip Logic
    code: "void OnGossipHello(Player* player, Creature* creature) {\n    uint32 questId\
      \ = 67890;\n    if (questPickup->MeetsQuestRequirements(questId, player)) {\n\
      \        AddGossipItemFor(player, GOSSIP_ICON_CHAT, \"Accept Quest\", GOSSIP_SENDER_MAIN,\
      \ GOSSIP_ACTION_INFO_DEF + questId);\n    } else {\n        AddGossipItemFor(player,\
      \ GOSSIP_ICON_CHAT, \"Quest Not Available\", GOSSIP_SENDER_MAIN, 0);\n    }\n\
      \    SendGossipMenuFor(player, DEFAULT_GOSSIP_MESSAGE, creature->GetGUID());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally utilizes the TrinityCore quest system's built-in validation
    logic which includes checking player level, completed quests, required items in
    inventory, and faction standings. The function is designed to be efficient and
    should not cause noticeable performance impact during normal gameplay operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the questId parameter corresponds to a valid quest entry;
    invalid IDs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. Always verify
    that the player pointer is valid before calling this method to prevent crashes.
