  method: RefreshTimers
  signature: void Aura::RefreshTimers(bool resetPeriodicTimer)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the timers and periodic effects of an aura, optionally resetting
    the periodic timer.
  description: The RefreshTimers method is used to update the internal timers and
    periodic tick behavior of an Aura object. This function ensures that the aura's
    duration and periodic effects are properly synchronized with the current game
    state. When resetPeriodicTimer is set to true, it will reset the periodic tick
    timer, causing the next periodic effect to occur immediately. This method is typically
    invoked when an aura is refreshed or re-applied to a unit, ensuring that all timers
    are correctly updated. The method does not modify the aura's duration or application
    state, but rather resets internal timing mechanisms.
  parameters:
  - name: resetPeriodicTimer
    description: If true, resets the periodic tick timer causing the next periodic
      effect to occur immediately. If false, only updates the duration timer without
      affecting the periodic ticking behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Aura Timer Refresh
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    aura->RefreshTimers(false);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset Periodic Timer for Immediate Effect
    code: "Aura* aura = unit->GetAura(67890);\nif (aura)\n{\n    aura->RefreshTimers(true);\n\
      \    // This will cause the next periodic tick to happen immediately\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it affects timing of periodic effects.
    It is commonly used during aura refreshes or reapplications to ensure proper synchronization
    with the game's time system. The method does not perform any validation on the
    aura itself, so calling it on a null or invalid aura may result in undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method on an aura that has been removed from a unit may cause
    issues. Ensure that the aura is still active and valid before calling RefreshTimers.
    Improper use can lead to incorrect periodic effect timing or missed ticks.
