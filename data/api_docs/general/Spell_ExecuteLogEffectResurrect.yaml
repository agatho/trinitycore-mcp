  method: ExecuteLogEffectResurrect
  signature: void Spell::ExecuteLogEffectResurrect(int effect, Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes log effect for resurrecting target unit
  description: This method handles the execution of resurrection-related logging effects
    within the spell system. It processes the specified effect index and target unit
    to determine how resurrection mechanics should be logged in the game context.
    The method is typically invoked during spell execution when a player is being
    resurrected, ensuring proper logging of the resurrection event for tracking purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: effect
    description: The effect index that represents the specific resurrection-related
      effect being executed. This parameter determines which part of the resurrection
      process is being logged.
  - name: target
    description: The target unit being resurrected, typically a player character or
      creature. This parameter specifies which entity receives the resurrection effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      Unit* target = new Unit();

      spell->ExecuteLogEffectResurrect(0, target);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves logging mechanisms that track player resurrection
    events for game analytics and achievement systems. The implementation may involve
    checking if the target is a valid player character before proceeding with logging.
  warnings: Improper handling of target unit could lead to invalid memory access or
    incorrect logging behavior. Ensure target is properly initialized before calling
    this method.
