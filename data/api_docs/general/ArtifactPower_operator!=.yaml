documentation:
  brief: Compares two ArtifactPower objects for inequality.
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this ArtifactPower
    object and another ArtifactPower object to determine if they are not equal. This
    comparison typically evaluates the underlying data members such as artifact power
    ID, rank, or other relevant properties that define an artifact power's state.
    In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, artifact powers represent unique
    abilities or enhancements associated with artifact weapons, and this operator
    allows for logical comparisons between different instances of these powers. The
    method returns true if the two objects differ in any significant way, and false
    if they are considered equivalent.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether the current ArtifactPower object
    is not equal to the provided right-hand side ArtifactPower object. A return value
    of true signifies that at least one aspect of the two objects differs, while false
    indicates they are equal.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Inequality Check
    code: 'ArtifactPower power1;

      ArtifactPower power2;

      bool result = (power1 != power2); // Returns true if powers are different'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Conditional Logic
    code: "if (playerArtifactPower != targetArtifactPower) {\n    // Handle case where\
      \ artifact powers differ\n    SendErrorMessage(\"Artifact powers do not match\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely uses a member-wise comparison of key fields that define
    an ArtifactPower. It's important to note that this comparison may be used in sorting
    or filtering operations within the artifact system, so performance could be relevant
    when comparing many objects.
