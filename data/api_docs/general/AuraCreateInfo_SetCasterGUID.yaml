  class: AuraCreateInfo
  method: SetCasterGUID
  signature: AuraCreateInfo & AuraCreateInfo::SetCasterGUID(const int & guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the GUID of the aura's caster in the AuraCreateInfo structure.
  description: The SetCasterGUID method assigns the unique identifier (GUID) of the
    entity that created or applied the aura. This is a crucial component for tracking
    aura sources, particularly in World of Warcraft mechanics where auras are often
    tied to specific casters such as players, creatures, or game objects. The method
    returns a reference to the same AuraCreateInfo object, enabling method chaining
    for fluent interface patterns. It's typically used when constructing aura application
    data before applying it to a target. This method should be called before applying
    the aura to ensure proper caster tracking and associated gameplay effects.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The GUID of the caster entity that is applying or creating the aura.
      This value must represent a valid object in the game world (player, creature,
      game object, etc.) and should be compatible with TrinityCore's GUID system.
  returns: A reference to the AuraCreateInfo object, allowing for method chaining.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AuraCreateInfo createInfo;

      createInfo.SetCasterGUID(12345);

      // Further setup and application of aura

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Method Chaining
    code: "AuraCreateInfo createInfo;\ncreateInfo.SetCasterGUID(12345)\n        .SetSpellId(45678)\n\
      \        .SetDuration(30000);\n// Apply aura with all properties set\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AuraCreateInfo class which is used internally
    by TrinityCore to manage aura creation parameters. The GUID passed should be a
    valid identifier from the game world, otherwise behavior may be undefined or cause
    errors during aura application.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to an existing entity in the
    game world. Using an invalid or non-existent GUID can lead to unexpected behavior
    or crashes when the aura is applied.
