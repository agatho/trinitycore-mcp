  class: LootCoordination
  method: AnalyzeGroupLootBehavior
  signature: void LootCoordination::AnalyzeGroupLootBehavior(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes group loot behavior for a given group and updates loot coordination
    settings accordingly.
  description: The AnalyzeGroupLootBehavior method evaluates the current loot distribution
    settings and player behavior within a specified group to determine optimal loot
    coordination strategies. This method is typically invoked during group loot events
    or when group composition changes, ensuring that loot is distributed fairly according
    to the group's configured loot rules such as round-robin, free-for-all, or master
    loot. It examines each group member's loot settings and adjusts internal state
    to maintain proper coordination during loot distribution.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Loot Behavior Analysis
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    LootCoordination::AnalyzeGroupLootBehavior(group);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the loot coordination system
    and typically called when group loot settings change or during loot distribution
    events. It does not directly modify player loot settings but rather analyzes them
    to determine appropriate coordination behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Group pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as passing an invalid pointer may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
