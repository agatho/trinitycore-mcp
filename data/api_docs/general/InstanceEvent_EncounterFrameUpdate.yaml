  class: InstanceEvent

  signature: InstanceEvent InstanceEvent::EncounterFrameUpdate(int playerGuid, uint32
    encounterId, uint32 frame)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the encounter frame for a player in an instance event
  description: The EncounterFrameUpdate method is responsible for updating the visual
    encounter frame displayed to a player during instance events, such as boss encounters.
    This method handles the synchronization of encounter progress and frame states
    between the server and client. It typically gets called when an encounter state
    changes, such as when a boss is engaged, defeated, or when players enter/leave
    the encounter area. The method ensures that all players in the instance receive
    consistent updates about the current encounter status.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose encounter frame
      needs to be updated
  - name: encounterId
    description: The identifier of the specific encounter being updated, typically
      corresponding to a boss or event in the instance
  - name: frame
    description: The frame state value representing the current encounter progress
      or status (e.g., 0 = not started, 1 = in progress, 2 = defeated)
  returns: Returns an InstanceEvent object representing the updated encounter event
    state
  examples:
  - title: Basic Encounter Frame Update
    code: InstanceEvent event = instanceEvent.EncounterFrameUpdate(playerGuid, 12345,
      1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Defeat Encounter Frame Update
    code: 'InstanceEvent event = instanceEvent.EncounterFrameUpdate(playerGuid, 12345,
      2);

      // This would indicate that the encounter with ID 12345 has been defeated'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore instance management
    system when encounter states change. Developers should not call this method directly
    unless implementing custom encounter logic. The frame parameter values are usually
    defined by the encounter script or database entries.
  warnings: Incorrect frame state values may cause client-side display issues or desynchronization
    between players. Ensure that encounter IDs and player GUIDs are valid before calling
    this method to avoid runtime errors.
