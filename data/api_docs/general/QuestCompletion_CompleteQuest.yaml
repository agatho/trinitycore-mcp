  class: QuestCompletion
  method: CompleteQuest
  signature: void QuestCompletion::CompleteQuest(uint32 questId, Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Completes a specified quest for the given player character.
  description: The CompleteQuest method is responsible for finalizing a quest completion
    process for a specific player in the TrinityCore framework. It handles the necessary
    game state updates, reward distribution, quest status changes, and any associated
    quest-related events. This method ensures that all quest requirements are met
    and properly processes the quest's conclusion within the game world. The method
    typically integrates with the player's quest log system and may trigger additional
    quest-related callbacks or notifications.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to be completed. Must correspond
      to a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character for whom
      the quest is being completed. Must not be null and must represent an active
      player in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Completion
    code: 'QuestCompletion completion;

      Player* player = ...; // Valid player pointer

      completion.CompleteQuest(12345, player);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Quest Completion with Error Handling
    code: "QuestCompletion completion;\nPlayer* player = ...; // Valid player pointer\n\
      if (player != nullptr)\n{\n    completion.CompleteQuest(12345, player);\n}\n\
      else\n{\n    // Handle invalid player pointer\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that all quest prerequisites have already been validated
    and that the player has met all necessary conditions for quest completion. The
    implementation likely interacts with the database to update quest status and may
    trigger additional systems such as quest reward processing, achievement updates,
    or quest log modifications.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring the player is valid or the quest
    exists can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate that both parameters
    are non-null and that the quest ID corresponds to an existing quest before calling
    this method.
