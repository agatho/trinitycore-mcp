documentation:
  brief: Updates the management of aspect abilities for a Beast Mastery hunter.
  description: The UpdateAspectManagement method is responsible for handling the internal
    logic and state updates related to aspect abilities in the Beast Mastery hunter
    class. This includes managing the application, removal, and duration of aspects
    such as Aspect of the Hawk or Aspect of the Cheetah. The method ensures that the
    hunter's current aspect is properly synchronized with their active pet and combat
    state. It typically runs during combat updates or when aspect-related events occur,
    maintaining proper cooldowns, buff stacks, and interaction between the aspect
    and other hunter abilities.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void HunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    if (m_hunter->GetClass() == CLASS_HUNTER && m_hunter->getClass() == CLASS_HUNTER)\n\
      \    {\n        if (BeastMasteryHunterRefactored* bmHunter = dynamic_cast<BeastMasteryHunterRefactored*>(m_hunter))\n\
      \        {\n            bmHunter->UpdateAspectManagement();\n        }\n   \
      \ }\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the main AI update loop or in
    response to specific aspect-related events. It may interact with pet management
    systems and should be called regularly during active combat to maintain proper
    aspect state.
