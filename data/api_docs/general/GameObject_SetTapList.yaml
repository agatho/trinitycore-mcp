  class: GameObject
  method: SetTapList
  signature: void GameObject::SetTapList(int tapList)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the tap list for the GameObject, determining which players can interact
    with it.
  description: The SetTapList method configures the interaction permissions for a
    GameObject by defining which players or groups can access and interact with it.
    This is commonly used in World of Warcraft to control quest-related interactions,
    where only specific players or groups may be allowed to interact with certain
    objects. The method typically affects how the GameObject behaves when players
    attempt to use it, particularly in relation to quest completion mechanics and
    player interaction.
  parameters:
  - name: tapList
    description: An integer value representing the tap list identifier that determines
      which players or groups can interact with this GameObject. A value of 0 typically
      means no restrictions, while higher values may indicate specific player groups
      or quest-related access.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->SetTapList(1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->SetTapList(5);

      // This would restrict interaction to players with specific quest requirements'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other GameObject methods
    that control interaction behavior. It's important to note that the tap list value
    directly affects how the GameObject interacts with players, particularly in terms
    of quest completion and player access. Performance considerations are minimal
    as this method simply sets an internal flag.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect quest progression or
    player interaction issues. Care should be taken when setting tap lists for objects
    that are part of active quests, as incorrect values may prevent players from completing
    quests properly.
