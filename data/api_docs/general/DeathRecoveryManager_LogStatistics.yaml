documentation:
  brief: Logs statistical information about death recovery events to the system log.
  description: The LogStatistics method records and outputs various metrics related
    to death recovery operations within the TrinityCore server. This includes tracking
    how many times players have been revived, the success rate of resurrection attempts,
    and other relevant performance data. The method is typically invoked during server
    shutdown or at regular intervals to provide administrators with insights into
    the death recovery system's behavior. It does not modify any game state but rather
    serves as a diagnostic tool for monitoring and debugging purposes.

  notes: This method is primarily intended for server administrators and developers
    to monitor system performance. It may produce significant log output depending
    on the volume of death recovery events, so it should be used judiciously in production
    environments.
