  class: MostHPMissingInRange
  method: MostHPMissingInRange
  signature: void MostHPMissingInRange::MostHPMissingInRange(const int * obj, float
    range, int hp)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the GameObject with the highest HP missing within a specified
    range.
  description: The MostHPMissingInRange method identifies the GameObject within a
    given range that has the greatest difference between its maximum health and current
    health. This is commonly used in AI behavior scripting to target the most injured
    unit for healing or attack purposes. The method operates on a list of GameObjects,
    evaluates their health status, and returns the one with the highest HP deficit.
    It's particularly useful in scenarios where prioritization based on damage taken
    is required, such as in healer AI or damage-dealing strategies.
  parameters:
  - name: obj
    description: Pointer to an array of GameObject pointers representing potential
      targets within range.
  - name: range
    description: Maximum distance in yards from the source object to consider for
      target selection.
  - name: hp
    description: Minimum HP threshold that a target must have missing to be considered
      for selection.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Script
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    const int* targets[10];\n    float range\
      \ = 30.0f;\n    int minHPMissing = 50;\n    MostHPMissingInRange(targets, range,\
      \ minHPMissing);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GameObjects in the input array are valid and
    have health information accessible. The implementation may vary depending on how
    HP is tracked within the TrinityCore framework.
  warnings: Ensure that all GameObject pointers in the obj array are properly initialized
    to avoid null pointer dereferences. The range parameter should be validated to
    prevent excessive computation or invalid behavior.
