  class: Guild
  method: SendCommandResult
  signature: void Guild::SendCommandResult(WorldSession * session, GuildCommandType
    type, GuildCommandError errCode, std::string_view param)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a guild command result message to the specified session with the given
    error code and optional parameter.
  description: The SendCommandResult method is used by the Guild class to communicate
    the outcome of a guild command executed by a player. It sends a formatted message
    back to the client through the provided WorldSession, indicating whether the command
    succeeded or failed along with an appropriate error code. This method is essential
    for providing user feedback in the game's guild interface and ensures that players
    receive clear information about their actions. The method handles the serialization
    and transmission of the response data to maintain consistency with the TrinityCore
    protocol for guild-related communications.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession associated with the player who executed
      the command. This session is used to send the response message back to the client.
  - name: type
    description: The GuildCommandType enum value indicating which specific guild command
      was processed. This determines the context of the result message.
  - name: errCode
    description: The GuildCommandError enum value representing the outcome of the
      command execution. Zero typically indicates success, while non-zero values represent
      various error conditions.
  - name: param
    description: Optional string parameter that may contain additional information
      related to the command result, such as a player name or guild name, depending
      on the specific command type.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Sending a successful guild promotion result
    code: 'Guild* guild = ...; // Assume valid guild pointer

      WorldSession* session = ...; // Assume valid session

      guild->SendCommandResult(session, GUILD_COMMAND_PROMOTE, GUILD_COMMAND_ERROR_NONE,
      "PlayerName");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending a failed guild creation result with error message
    code: 'Guild* guild = ...;

      WorldSession* session = ...;

      guild->SendCommandResult(session, GUILD_COMMAND_CREATE, GUILD_COMMAND_ERROR_NAME_EXISTS,
      "MyGuild");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the network layer through WorldSession
    to deliver messages. It should only be called when a guild command has been processed
    and a response is required. The method does not perform any validation on the
    input parameters beyond basic type checking, so callers must ensure valid values
    are passed.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid session pointer will likely cause
    a crash or undefined behavior. Ensure that the GuildCommandType and GuildCommandError
    enums match the expected values for the specific command being handled to avoid
    confusing users with incorrect error messages.
