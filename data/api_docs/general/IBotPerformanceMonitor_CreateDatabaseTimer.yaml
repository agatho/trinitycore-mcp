  signature: std::unique_ptr<class IBotPerformanceTimer> IBotPerformanceMonitor::CreateDatabaseTimer()
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new database performance timer instance for monitoring
    query execution times.
  description: The CreateDatabaseTimer method instantiates a new IBotPerformanceTimer
    object specifically designed for tracking database operation performance. This
    timer can be used to measure the execution time of SQL queries and other database
    interactions within the TrinityCore framework. The returned timer is automatically
    managed through a std::unique_ptr, ensuring proper resource cleanup when it goes
    out of scope. This functionality is particularly useful for bot developers who
    need to optimize database access patterns or diagnose performance bottlenecks
    in their AI scripts.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::unique_ptr to an IBotPerformanceTimer interface instance that can
    be used to start and stop timing measurements for database operations. The pointer
    will never be null upon successful creation, but may throw an exception if system
    resources are insufficient.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Database Timer Usage
    code: 'auto dbTimer = performanceMonitor->CreateDatabaseTimer();

      dbTimer->Start();

      // Execute some database query here

      // ...

      dbTimer->Stop();

      std::cout << "Query took " << dbTimer->GetElapsedMilliseconds() << " ms" <<
      std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned IBotPerformanceTimer instance is specifically tailored for database
    timing operations and may not be suitable for general-purpose performance measurement.
    The timer's accuracy depends on the underlying system clock resolution and may
    vary between different platforms. Consider that creating multiple timers simultaneously
    could impact performance in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure proper cleanup of timer instances to avoid memory leaks. The timer
    should be used within a single thread context unless explicitly designed for multi-threaded
    use. Be cautious when measuring very fast operations as the timer resolution might
    not capture sub-millisecond timings accurately.
