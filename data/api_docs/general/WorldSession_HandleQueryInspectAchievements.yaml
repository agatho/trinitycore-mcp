documentation:
  brief: Handles incoming inspect achievements query from a client, retrieving and
    sending achievement data for the inspected player.
  description: The HandleQueryInspectAchievements method processes an incoming packet
    from a client requesting achievement information about another player. When a
    player inspects another player's character, this method is invoked to gather the
    inspected player's achievement data and send it back to the requesting client.
    The method typically retrieves achievement statistics, completion status, and
    related metadata for the target player. It ensures that only valid, visible achievements
    are sent based on game rules and player permissions. This method is part of the
    inspection system in World of Warcraft, allowing players to view each other's
    accomplishments.

  - title: Basic usage when inspecting another player
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleQueryInspectAchievements(WorldPackets::Inspect::QueryInspectAchievements&\
      \ inspect)\n{\n    // Method implementation retrieves and sends achievement\
      \ data\n    // for the inspected player to the requesting client\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the inspection system when a player
    uses the inspect command or clicks on another player's character in the UI. The
    implementation should validate that the requesting player has permission to inspect
    the target player and that the target player's achievements are publicly visible.
    Achievement data may be filtered based on visibility settings, faction, and other
    game rules.
  warnings: Improper handling of achievement data could expose private or hidden achievements
    to unauthorized players. Ensure proper validation of inspection permissions before
    sending any achievement information. The method should not send incomplete or
    corrupted achievement data that could cause client-side errors.
