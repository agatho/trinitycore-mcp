  class: SmartAI
  method: OnCharmed
  signature: void SmartAI::OnCharmed(bool isNew)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a creature is charmed by a player in SmartAI.
  description: The OnCharmed method is invoked when a creature controlled by SmartAI
    becomes charmed by a player, typically through spells like Charm or similar effects.
    This method allows the AI to respond to the charm event, potentially altering
    behavior, triggering events, or executing custom logic based on whether this is
    a new charm or an existing one. It serves as a callback for handling charm-related
    game mechanics within the SmartAI framework.
  parameters:
  - name: isNew
    description: A boolean flag indicating if this is a newly charmed state (true)
      or if the creature was already charmed previously (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Charm Event Handling
    code: "void MyCreatureAI::OnCharmed(bool isNew)\n{\n    if (isNew)\n    {\n  \
      \      // Perform actions for a newly charmed creature\n        Talk(0);\n \
      \   }\n    else\n    {\n        // Handle re-charming or already charmed state\n\
      \        SetReactState(REACT_PASSIVE);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SmartAI event system and should be overridden
    in custom AI implementations to provide specific behavior when a creature is charmed.
    The 'isNew' parameter allows differentiation between initial charm and re-charming
    scenarios.
