  method: ~OPvPCapturePoint
  signature: void OPvPCapturePoint::~OPvPCapturePoint()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an OPvPCapturePoint instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the OPvPCapturePoint class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the object's
    lifetime. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, OPvPCapturePoint
    objects are used to manage capture points in Outdoor PvP zones, such as those
    found in Wintergrasp or other contested territories. When an OPvPCapturePoint
    instance is destroyed, it ensures proper cleanup of internal data structures and
    prevents memory leaks. This destructor is automatically invoked when the object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted, making it essential for maintaining
    stable performance in PvP environments where many capture points may be created
    and destroyed during gameplay.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of OPvPCapturePoint
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    OPvPCapturePoint* point = new OPvPCapturePoint();\n\
      \    // ... use the capture point ...\n    delete point; // Triggers ~OPvPCapturePoint\
      \ destructor\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack allocation with automatic destruction
    code: "void AnotherExample()\n{\n    OPvPCapturePoint point; // Constructor called\n\
      \    // ... use the capture point ...\n    // Destructor ~OPvPCapturePoint automatically\
      \ called when point goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing object
    lifetime. It is typically invoked by the C++ runtime during stack unwinding or
    explicit deletion. Developers working with OPvPCapturePoint objects must ensure
    proper ownership semantics to avoid memory leaks or double-deletion issues.
