  method: LearnRecipe
  signature: bool ProfessionManager::LearnRecipe(int * player, uint32 recipeId)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to teach a player a crafting recipe by its unique identifier.
  description: The LearnRecipe method is responsible for granting a player access
    to a specific crafting recipe within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically
    checks if the player has the necessary prerequisites, such as required skill levels
    or previously learned recipes, before adding the new recipe to their profession
    list. It integrates with the game's crafting system to ensure that players can
    only learn recipes they are eligible for based on their current profession ranks
    and other in-game conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter identifies which specific player will receive the recipe.
  - name: recipeId
    description: A unique 32-bit unsigned integer identifying the specific crafting
      recipe to be learned. This ID corresponds to entries in the game's recipe database.
  returns: Returns true if the recipe was successfully learned by the player, or false
    if the operation failed due to invalid inputs, missing prerequisites, or other
    game logic constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nuint32 recipeId = 56789;\nbool success = sProfessionManager->LearnRecipe(&playerId,\
      \ recipeId);\nif (success) {\n    // Recipe learned successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nuint32 recipeId = 56789;\nif (sProfessionManager->LearnRecipe(&playerId,\
      \ recipeId)) {\n    // Notify player that recipe was learned\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_RECIPE_LEARNED,\
      \ playerId);\n} else {\n    // Handle failure case\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_RECIPE_FAILED,\
      \ playerId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal databases and player state tracking
    systems. It may perform checks against the player's current skill level, required
    professions, and previous recipe unlocks before committing changes to the player's
    data.
  warnings: Ensure that the player ID passed is valid and corresponds to an active
    player session; otherwise, the operation will fail silently or cause undefined
    behavior. Also, verify that the recipeId exists in the database to avoid invalid
    memory access.
