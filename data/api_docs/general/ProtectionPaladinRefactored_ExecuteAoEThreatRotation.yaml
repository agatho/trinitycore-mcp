  class: ProtectionPaladinRefactored
  method: ExecuteAoEThreatRotation
  signature: void ProtectionPaladinRefactored::ExecuteAoEThreatRotation(int * target,
    uint32 enemyCount)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a threat-increasing AoE rotation for a Protection Paladin, targeting
    multiple enemies.
  description: The ExecuteAoEThreatRotation method performs a series of ability casts
    designed to generate high threat on multiple nearby enemies. This method is typically
    used in AOE combat scenarios where the Protection Paladin needs to maintain aggro
    on several targets simultaneously. The method selects appropriate abilities based
    on current resource levels, cooldowns, and enemy proximity. It prioritizes threat
    generation over damage output, focusing on abilities that apply debuffs or deal
    AoE damage while maintaining proper positioning and defensive cooldown usage.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an array of target identifiers (GUIDs) for the enemies
      to be targeted. The method will iterate through these targets to apply threat-generating
      abilities.
  - name: enemyCount
    description: The number of enemies in the target array that should be processed
      by this rotation. Must be a positive integer representing valid enemy targets.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AoE Threat Rotation Execution
    code: 'int targets[5] = {1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005};

      uint32 count = 5;

      this->ExecuteAoEThreatRotation(targets, count);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Target Count Execution
    code: 'std::vector<int> enemyTargets;

      // Populate enemyTargets with valid GUIDs

      uint32 targetCount = static_cast<uint32>(enemyTargets.size());

      this->ExecuteAoEThreatRotation(enemyTargets.data(), targetCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Paladin has sufficient resources (rage, mana,
    or other relevant resources) to execute all applicable abilities in the rotation.
    It does not perform any resource checks itself and may fail if insufficient resources
    are available. The method is intended for use during active combat situations
    where multiple enemies are present.
  warnings: Ensure that the target array contains valid enemy GUIDs before calling
    this method, as invalid targets could cause undefined behavior or crashes. This
    method should not be called in single-target scenarios unless explicitly designed
    to handle such cases. Avoid calling this method when the Paladin is not in combat
    or when there are no valid enemies present.
