  class: Guild
  method: HandleSetInfo
  signature: void Guild::HandleSetInfo(WorldSession * session, std::string_view info)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the guild's information text field with the provided string.
  description: The HandleSetInfo method is responsible for updating the guild's informational
    text, which is typically displayed in the guild roster and can be viewed by all
    members. This method processes a string input from a WorldSession, validates it
    against game rules (such as length limits), and stores it within the guild's data
    structure. It ensures that only authorized players (typically guild leaders or
    officers) can modify this field, and it may trigger updates to the guild's database
    record and in-game UI elements. The method does not return any value but directly
    modifies internal guild state.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: A pointer to the WorldSession object representing the client connection
      of the player attempting to set the guild info. Used for authentication checks
      and sending responses back to the client.
  - name: info
    description: A std::string_view containing the new information text to be set
      for the guild. This string is validated for length and character restrictions
      before being applied to the guild's data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Guild Info Text
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    std::string_view\
      \ newInfo = \"Welcome to our awesome guild!\";\n    guild->HandleSetInfo(session,\
      \ newInfo);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs validation on the input string to ensure it does
    not exceed maximum allowed length (e.g., 1000 characters) and contains only valid
    characters. It may also send a broadcast message or update packet to all online
    guild members upon successful change.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without checking permissions can lead to unauthorized
    modifications of guild information. Always validate that the calling player has
    sufficient rank (e.g., GuildLeader or Officer) before invoking this function.
