documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player has access to a specific battleground type based
    on their level.
  description: This method checks if the player has the necessary level requirements
    to participate in a specific battleground type. It evaluates the player's current
    level against the minimum level required for that battleground type, returning
    true if access is granted or false if access is denied. The method is commonly
    used in battleground-related logic to validate player eligibility before allowing
    participation in specific battlegrounds.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has access to the specified battleground type
    based on their level, false otherwise.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->GetBGAccessByLevel(1)) {\n    // Player can enter battleground\
      \ 1\n}\nelse {\n    // Player cannot enter battleground 1\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's level being compared against the minimum
    level requirement for the specified battleground type. It does not consider other
    factors like player's faction or reputation.
  warnings: The method may return false even if the player has sufficient level to
    enter the battleground, due to other restrictions such as faction requirements
    or reputation levels.
