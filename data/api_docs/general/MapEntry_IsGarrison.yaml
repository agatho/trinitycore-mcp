documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the map entry represents a garrison.
  description: The IsGarrison method checks if the current MapEntry object corresponds
    to a garrison map within the World of Warcraft game world. This method is used
    internally by TrinityCore to identify special map types that are designated for
    player garrisons, which have unique gameplay mechanics and restrictions compared
    to regular maps. The check typically involves examining internal flags or identifiers
    associated with the map entry to determine its type. This functionality is essential
    for proper handling of garrison-related systems such as building placement, mission
    management, and resource allocation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map entry represents a garrison map; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Garrison Map
    code: "MapEntry const* entry = sMapStore.LookupEntry(mapId);\nif (entry && entry->IsGarrison())\
      \ {\n    // Handle garrison-specific logic\n    printf(\"This map is a garrison\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsGarrison in Garrison Management System
    code: "void GarrisonManager::ProcessMap(MapEntry const* mapEntry) {\n    if (mapEntry->IsGarrison())\
      \ {\n        // Apply garrison-specific rules\n        HandleGarrisonMapLogic(mapEntry);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Apply standard map logic\n        HandleRegularMapLogic(mapEntry);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal map type flags or identifiers that are set
    during server initialization and map loading. It is recommended to cache the result
    of this check if it's used frequently in performance-critical code paths.
  warnings: Ensure that MapEntry is properly initialized before calling this method,
    as accessing an uninitialized or invalid entry may lead to undefined behavior.
    This method should not be used on non-existent maps without proper validation.
