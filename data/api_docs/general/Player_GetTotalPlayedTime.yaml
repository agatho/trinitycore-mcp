    The value represents the total time the player has been logged into the game since
    their character was created, including time spent in the world, in instances,
    and during server maintenance periods. This information is useful for tracking
    player engagement and can be used in various game mechanics such as achievements,
    rewards systems, or player statistics.

    value includes all time spent playing the game, both active and inactive, and
    is calculated from the player's creation date until the current moment.

    code: 'uint32 playTime = player->GetTotalPlayedTime();

      std::cout << "Player has been playing for: " << playTime << " seconds" << std::endl;'

  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other player statistics
    and may be affected by server maintenance or game updates. The value is stored
    persistently in the database and updated regularly during gameplay.
  warnings: Be aware that this value includes inactive time, so it may not reflect
    actual active gameplay time. Also, this method should not be used for real-time
    calculations without considering potential server delays or updates.
