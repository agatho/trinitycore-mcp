  class: DispelCoordinator
  method: IsDatabaseInitialized
  signature: bool DispelCoordinator::IsDatabaseInitialized()
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the dispel coordinator's database has been initialized and
    is ready for use.
  description: The IsDatabaseInitialized method determines if the DispelCoordinator
    class has completed its initialization process with the database. This check is
    crucial for ensuring that dispel-related operations can safely access database
    resources without encountering uninitialized state errors. The method typically
    returns true once all necessary database connections, tables, and schema validations
    have been successfully completed during the system's startup or initialization
    sequence. It helps prevent runtime exceptions when attempting to perform dispel
    operations before the underlying data structures are fully prepared.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the database has been successfully initialized and is ready
    for use; otherwise, returns false if initialization is incomplete or failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Database Initialization Check
    code: "if (dispelCoordinator.IsDatabaseInitialized()) {\n    // Proceed with dispel\
      \ operations\n    dispelCoordinator.ApplyDispel(targetPlayer);\n} else {\n \
      \   // Handle initialization failure\n    sLog->outError(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL,\
      \ \"Dispel coordinator database not initialized\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during system startup and before any dispel
    operations are performed. It's designed to be thread-safe as it's expected to
    be checked from multiple threads during concurrent operation.
  warnings: Calling dispel-related methods without verifying database initialization
    first may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Always ensure this check passes
    before performing any database-dependent dispel actions.
