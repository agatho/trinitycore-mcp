  class: BotProfiler
  method: GetCorrelationAnalysis
  signature: int BotProfiler::GetCorrelationAnalysis(uint64_t sessionId)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes correlation data for a specified bot session and returns the analysis
    result.
  description: The GetCorrelationAnalysis method performs a statistical analysis on
    the correlation between various bot behaviors and outcomes within a given session.
    It processes collected data from the bot profiler to determine relationships between
    actions, decisions, and performance metrics. This method is typically used for
    evaluating bot effectiveness and identifying patterns in bot behavior that may
    influence overall performance or gameplay dynamics. The method requires a valid
    session ID to retrieve and analyze the corresponding profiling data.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the result of the correlation analysis.
    A positive value typically indicates successful analysis with meaningful correlations
    found, while zero or negative values may indicate no significant correlations,
    insufficient data, or errors during processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint64_t sessionId = 123456789ULL;\nint result = botProfiler.GetCorrelationAnalysis(sessionId);\n\
      if (result > 0) {\n    // Correlations found\n    printf(\"Correlation analysis\
      \ completed with result: %d\\n\", result);\n} else {\n    // No correlations\
      \ or error occurred\n    printf(\"No significant correlations found or error\
      \ in analysis\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve computational overhead when processing large amounts
    of bot data. The correlation analysis algorithm might be optimized for performance
    but could still take considerable time on very extensive datasets. Ensure that
    the session ID provided corresponds to an active or recently completed bot session
    for meaningful results.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent session ID may result
    in undefined behavior or return values indicating failure. Always validate the
    session ID before calling this method, especially when dealing with dynamic session
    management.
