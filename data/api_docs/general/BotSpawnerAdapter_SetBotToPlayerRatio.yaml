  brief: Sets the ratio of bots to players in the world
  description: Configures the bot-to-player ratio that determines how many NPC bots
    should be spawned relative to active player characters in the game world. This
    method adjusts the spawning behavior of automated players to maintain the specified
    proportion. The ratio is typically expressed as a decimal value where 1.0 represents
    one bot for every player, 0.5 represents half as many bots as players, and so
    forth. This setting affects the overall density and behavior of AI-controlled
    characters in the game environment.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Bot-to-Player Ratio to 1:1
    code: BotSpawnerAdapter::SetBotToPlayerRatio(1.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Set Bot-to-Player Ratio to 0.5 (Half as Many Bots)
    code: BotSpawnerAdapter::SetBotToPlayerRatio(0.5f);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers an immediate recalculation of bot spawning based
    on current player count. The implementation may involve internal tracking of active
    players and dynamic adjustment of spawn timers or counts. Changes to this ratio
    may not take effect immediately but could be applied during the next spawn cycle.
  warnings: Setting extremely high ratios (e.g., > 10.0) may cause performance issues
    due to excessive bot creation. Setting very low ratios (e.g., < 0.1) might result
    in insufficient AI presence for certain game mechanics or activities that require
    bot participation.
