  method: GetTimeUntilBurnPhase
  signature: uint32 CooldownStackingOptimizer::GetTimeUntilBurnPhase() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the time in milliseconds until the next burn phase
    cooldown window begins.
  description: The GetTimeUntilBurnPhase method determines how long remains before
    a new burn phase becomes available for use. This is commonly used in combat systems
    where abilities have limited usage windows, such as damage-over-time effects or
    burst damage spells that must be timed strategically. The method evaluates the
    current state of cooldowns and returns the time until the next opportunity to
    initiate a burn phase. It's typically called during ability activation checks
    or UI updates to provide timing feedback to players.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of milliseconds until the
    next burn phase can be initiated. If the burn phase is currently available, it
    returns 0. The value represents the time remaining in the cooldown period before
    another burn phase can be used.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 timeRemaining = optimizer->GetTimeUntilBurnPhase();\nif (timeRemaining\
      \ == 0)\n{\n    // Burn phase is available\n    DoBurnPhase();\n}\nelse\n{\n\
      \    // Wait for cooldown to expire\n    SendCooldownMessage(timeRemaining);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: UI Timer Update
    code: "void UpdateBurnPhaseTimer()\n{\n    uint32 timeUntilNext = optimizer->GetTimeUntilBurnPhase();\n\
      \    if (timeUntilNext > 0)\n    {\n        // Update UI with remaining time\n\
      \        UpdateCooldownDisplay(timeUntilNext);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n   \
      \     // Enable burn phase button\n        EnableBurnPhaseButton();\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal cooldown tracking and should only be called
    when the optimizer has been properly initialized with relevant cooldown data.
    The returned value is in milliseconds, which aligns with standard TrinityCore
    time handling. Performance impact is minimal as it's a simple time calculation
    based on stored cooldown values.
  warnings: Do not call this method without ensuring that the CooldownStackingOptimizer
    instance is fully initialized with valid cooldown information. Calling it before
    proper setup may result in incorrect timing calculations or undefined behavior.
