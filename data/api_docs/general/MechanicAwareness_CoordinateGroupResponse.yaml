  signature: void MechanicAwareness::CoordinateGroupResponse(const MechanicInfo &
    mechanic, int group)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates a group response based on mechanic information for handling game
    state transitions.
  description: The CoordinateGroupResponse method is used within the MechanicAwareness
    class to manage and synchronize group-based responses related to specific game
    mechanics. This method takes a reference to a MechanicInfo object, which contains
    details about a particular mechanic, and an integer group identifier. It likely
    updates internal state or triggers events based on the mechanic and group combination.
    The method is typically invoked during gameplay when certain conditions are met
    that require coordinated actions among group members. This functionality is essential
    for maintaining synchronization between game mechanics and player group behaviors
    in TrinityCore's AI systems.
  parameters:
  - name: mechanic
    description: A constant reference to a MechanicInfo object containing details
      about the specific game mechanic that triggered this response. This includes
      information such as mechanic type, duration, and other relevant properties.
  - name: group
    description: An integer identifier representing the group within the game context.
      This value typically corresponds to a specific group or raid instance, allowing
      the method to handle responses appropriately for different group configurations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "void MyAI::OnMechanicTriggered(const MechanicInfo& mechanic, int groupId)\n\
      {\n    m_mechanicAwareness.CoordinateGroupResponse(mechanic, groupId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with group management system
    code: "void GroupManager::HandleMechanicEvent(const MechanicInfo& mechanic, int\
      \ groupId)\n{\n    if (mechanic.type == MECHANIC_STUN)\n    {\n        m_awareness.CoordinateGroupResponse(mechanic,\
      \ groupId);\n        // Additional logic for group-wide stun handling\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system that manages awareness and
    coordination of game mechanics across player groups. The implementation may involve
    internal state tracking or event queuing mechanisms to ensure proper synchronization.
    Developers should be aware that this method operates within the context of TrinityCore's
    AI framework and may interact with other systems such as group management, combat
    state tracking, or spell effect handling.
  warnings: Care should be taken when calling this method from within time-sensitive
    code paths, as it may involve operations that could impact performance. Additionally,
    passing invalid group identifiers or malformed MechanicInfo objects might lead
    to undefined behavior or system instability.
