  class: CombatAIIntegrator
  method: ShouldSwitchTarget
  signature: bool CombatAIIntegrator::ShouldSwitchTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the AI should switch to a different combat target based
    on current threat and priority conditions.
  description: The ShouldSwitchTarget method evaluates the current combat state of
    the unit controlled by CombatAIIntegrator to decide if it is necessary to switch
    targets. This decision is typically made based on factors such as threat levels,
    target validity (e.g., if the current target is dead or out of range), and priority
    rules defined within the AI logic. The method is part of the core combat decision-making
    loop and helps maintain optimal targeting behavior for NPCs during fights. It
    ensures that units prioritize the most dangerous or highest-priority targets according
    to their AI configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI should switch targets, false otherwise. A return
    value of true indicates that the current target is no longer optimal and a new
    target should be selected based on threat or priority criteria.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat loop
    code: "if (combatAIIntegrator->ShouldSwitchTarget()) {\n    combatAIIntegrator->SelectNewTarget();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI's update cycle, often in conjunction
    with other target selection logic. It may be influenced by external factors such
    as aggro tables, target priority settings, and combat state flags.
