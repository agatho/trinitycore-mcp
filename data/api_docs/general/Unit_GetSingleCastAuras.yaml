documentation:
  brief: Returns a list of auras that are currently being cast by this unit
  description: This method retrieves all auras that are currently in the process of
    being cast by the unit, including those that are actively casting and those that
    are in the middle of their casting time. It provides access to the current single-cast
    auras which are typically used for checking active spell effects or managing spell
    casting states. The method is particularly useful for determining what spells
    are currently being cast on the unit and can be used for various game mechanics
    such as interrupting spell casts, checking for specific aura effects, or managing
    spell cooldowns.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const reference to an AuraList containing all the single-cast
    auras currently active on this unit. The list may be empty if no spells are currently
    being cast.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "const AuraList& auras = unit->GetSingleCastAuras();\nfor (auto aura : auras)\n\
      {\n    // Process each aura\n    if (aura && aura->GetSpellInfo())\n    {\n\
      \        // Do something with the spell info\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used for checking active spell casting states and
    should be used carefully as it may affect performance if accessed frequently.
    The returned list contains references to actual auras, so modifying the list directly
    will not affect the original aura state. This method is thread-safe in most contexts
    but should be handled with care when accessing from multiple threads.
  warnings: This method can potentially return empty lists if no spells are currently
    being cast. Care should be taken when using this method to avoid unnecessary performance
    overhead, especially in frequently called functions. Also, be aware that the returned
    list may contain auras that are not yet fully initialized or are in the middle
    of their casting process.
