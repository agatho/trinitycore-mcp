documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified talent tree corresponds to a healer specialization.
  description: The IsHealerSpec method evaluates a given talent tree identifier to
    determine if it represents a healing specialization within World of Warcraft.
    This functionality is crucial for AI behavior decision-making, particularly in
    combat movement strategies where different roles require distinct tactical approaches.
    The method checks against predefined healer talent trees such as Holy Paladin,
    Discipline Priest, or Restoration Shaman. It returns true if the provided talent
    tree is recognized as a healer spec, false otherwise. This check helps the AI
    determine appropriate spell selection, positioning, and target prioritization
    based on the player's role.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified talentTree parameter corresponds to a healer
    specialization; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (strategy->IsHealerSpec(257)) {\n    // This is a Holy Paladin spec\n\
      \    // Execute healing-oriented movement strategy\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Logic
    code: "class MyCombatStrategy : public CombatMovementStrategy {\npublic:\n   \
      \ void UpdateAI(Unit* target) override {\n        if (IsHealerSpec(GetPlayerTalentTree()))\
      \ {\n            // Apply healing-focused movement\n            MoveToHealTarget();\n\
      \        } else {\n            // Apply damage-focused movement\n          \
      \  MoveToDamageTarget();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on hardcoded talent tree IDs that correspond to known healer
    specializations in the TrinityCore codebase. These IDs may vary between different
    expansions or patches, so this method should be updated accordingly when new content
    is added. The implementation assumes that all healer specs are identified by their
    specific talent tree values and does not account for hybrid roles or multi-spec
    scenarios.
  warnings: This method only checks against known healer talent trees and may return
    false for newly added healer specializations if the talent tree IDs are not included
    in the internal mapping. Developers should ensure that any new healer specs are
    properly accounted for when updating this method.
