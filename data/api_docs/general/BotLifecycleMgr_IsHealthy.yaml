documentation:
  brief: Checks if the bot lifecycle manager is in a healthy state
  description: The IsHealthy method determines whether the BotLifecycleMgr instance
    is functioning correctly and has not encountered any critical errors or invalid
    states. This method typically evaluates internal flags, status indicators, or
    resource availability to ensure the manager can safely perform its duties. It
    is commonly used before attempting operations on bot lifecycle management to prevent
    failures due to an unstable system state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the BotLifecycleMgr is in a healthy state and ready for
    operations; otherwise returns false if any critical issues are detected.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Health Check
    code: "if (botLifecycleMgr.IsHealthy()) {\n    // Proceed with bot lifecycle operations\n\
      \    botLifecycleMgr.InitializeBots();\n} else {\n    // Handle unhealthy state\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"BotLifecycleMgr is not healthy\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform lightweight checks such as verifying internal data
    structures or status flags. It's recommended to cache the result if checking health
    frequently in performance-sensitive code paths.
