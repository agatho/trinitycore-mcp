documentation:
  brief: Executes area trigger actions when a unit enters or interacts with the trigger
  description: The DoActions method is responsible for executing the defined behavior
    of an area trigger when a Unit (player or creature) interacts with it. This method
    typically handles spell casting, quest updates, or other game events associated
    with the area trigger. It serves as the core execution point for area trigger
    logic and is usually called internally by the game engine when a unit enters the
    trigger's activation range. The method may perform different actions based on
    the type of area trigger and the unit involved.
  parameters:
  - name: unit
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that triggered the area trigger. This
      can be a Player or Creature instance. Must not be nullptr for valid execution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in custom area trigger handler
    code: "class MyAreaTrigger : public AreaTrigger {\npublic:\n    void DoActions(Unit*\
      \ unit) override {\n        if (unit && unit->IsPlayer()) {\n            Player*\
      \ player = unit->ToPlayer();\n            player->CastSpell(player, 12345, true);\
      \ // Cast a spell on the player\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with conditional logic
    code: "void AreaTrigger::DoActions(Unit* unit) {\n    if (!unit)\n        return;\n\
      \    \n    if (unit->IsPlayer()) {\n        Player* player = unit->ToPlayer();\n\
      \        // Check if player has specific quest\n        if (player->GetQuestStatus(12345)\
      \ == QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE) {\n            player->AreaExploredOrEventHappens(12345);\n\
      \        }\n    } else if (unit->IsCreature()) {\n        // Handle creature-specific\
      \ actions\n        unit->GetAI()->DoAction(ACTION_TRIGGER_ACTIVATED);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the core game engine when a Unit enters
    an area trigger's active zone. Developers should ensure that any spell casting
    or quest updates are properly validated and do not cause infinite loops. The method
    may be invoked multiple times for the same unit if the trigger is re-entered.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy operations in this method as it can block game
    loop execution. Never call DoActions directly from within another DoActions call
    to prevent stack overflow. Ensure that unit parameter is properly validated before
    dereferencing.
