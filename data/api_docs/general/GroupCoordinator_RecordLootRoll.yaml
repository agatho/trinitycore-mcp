  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: RecordLootRoll
  signature: void GroupCoordinator::RecordLootRoll(uint32 itemId, LootDecision decision)
documentation:
  brief: Records a loot roll decision for a specific item within the group coordinator's
    tracking system.
  description: The RecordLootRoll method logs a player's decision regarding a loot
    item, typically used during group loot distribution. It stores the item identifier
    and the associated loot decision (such as accept, reject, or pass) in the group
    coordinator's internal data structures for tracking purposes. This method is essential
    for maintaining accurate loot history and ensuring proper loot distribution mechanics
    within a World of Warcraft group context. The method does not validate the decision
    or item ID beyond basic type safety; it simply records the information provided.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the loot item being rolled on. This corresponds
      to the item's entry in the game's item database.
  - name: decision
    description: The loot decision made by the player, typically representing their
      choice to accept, reject, or pass on the item. The specific enum values depend
      on the internal LootDecision type used by TrinityCore.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GroupCoordinator* coordinator = ...;

      coordinator->RecordLootRoll(12345, LOOT_DECISION_ACCEPT);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording a Pass Decision
    code: 'GroupCoordinator* coordinator = ...;

      coordinator->RecordLootRoll(67890, LOOT_DECISION_PASS);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the loot rolling process when a player
    makes their decision. It's important to note that this method only records the
    decision and does not perform any validation or enforcement of the decision itself.
    The actual loot distribution logic is handled separately by other components in
    the group coordinator system.
