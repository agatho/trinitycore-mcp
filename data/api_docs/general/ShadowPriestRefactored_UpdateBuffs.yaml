  method: UpdateBuffs
  signature: void ShadowPriestRefactored::UpdateBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the shadow priest's buffs and auras based on current game state and
    spell effects.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing all
    active buffs and auras that are applied to the Shadow Priest character. This includes
    handling buff expiration timers, updating aura stacks, recalculating stat modifications
    from active spells, and ensuring that the priest's combat effectiveness remains
    accurate throughout the duration of various magical effects. The method typically
    integrates with the core TrinityCore AI system to synchronize buff states with
    the player's current spell casting, talent selections, and gear bonuses. It may
    also interact with the spell system to trigger additional effects when specific
    buff thresholds are met or exceeded.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void ShadowPriestAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    m_shadowPriest->UpdateBuffs();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should not
    be invoked manually unless implementing custom buff management logic. The implementation
    may involve iterating through active auras, checking their expiration times, and
    applying or removing stat modifications accordingly.
