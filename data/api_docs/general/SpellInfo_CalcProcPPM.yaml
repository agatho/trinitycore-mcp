  signature: float SpellInfo::CalcProcPPM(Unit * caster, int32 itemLevel) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the proc per minute rate for a spell based on caster and item
    level
  description: The CalcProcPPM method determines the probability that a spell will
    trigger a proc based on the caster's level and the item level of the equipped
    gear. This function is essential for calculating spell proc rates in World of
    Warcraft mechanics, particularly for items with enchantments or abilities that
    have a chance to activate. The method takes into account both the caster's level
    and the item level to compute a precise proc rate, which is crucial for balancing
    game mechanics and ensuring accurate spell behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the caster of the spell.
      This parameter determines the caster's level and affects the calculation of
      proc rates.
  - name: itemLevel
    description: Integer value representing the item level of the equipped gear. This
      parameter influences the base proc rate calculation based on item quality and
      rarity.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the calculated proc per minute rate
    for the spell, which determines how often the spell will trigger a proc under
    given conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: float procRate = spellInfo->CalcProcPPM(caster, itemLevel);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "float procRate = spellInfo->CalcProcPPM(caster, 100); // Assuming item\
      \ level 100\nif (procRate > 0.0f) {\n    // Process the proc rate\n    // Do\
      \ something with the calculated rate\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related functions
    to calculate overall spell mechanics. It's important to note that this calculation
    is based on specific game mechanics and may vary depending on the spell type and
    caster's level. Performance considerations include the use of Unit pointer and
    item level calculations, which should be optimized for better performance.
  warnings: This method requires careful handling of Unit pointers and item level
    values. Incorrect usage can lead to inaccurate proc rates and potentially affect
    gameplay balance. Always ensure that the caster is valid and the item level is
    within expected bounds before calling this function.
