documentation:
  brief: Handles game event activation or deactivation for GameObjectAI instances
  description: 'The OnGameEvent method is a virtual callback function in the GameObjectAI
    class that is invoked when a game event is triggered or deactivated. This method
    allows GameObjects to respond dynamically to in-game events such as holidays,
    seasonal changes, or custom event systems. The method receives two parameters:
    a boolean indicating whether the event is starting (true) or ending (false), and
    a uint16 representing the event ID. Implementations of this method should handle
    any necessary visual, functional, or state changes required when an event occurs.'
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the game event is starting (true) or ending
      (false)
  - name: param1
    description: 16-bit unsigned integer representing the unique identifier of the
      game event
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Implementation Example
    code: "class MyGameObjectAI : public GameObjectAI\n{\npublic:\n    void OnGameEvent(bool\
      \ start, uint16 eventId) override\n    {\n        if (start)\n        {\n  \
      \          // Activate event-specific behavior\n            SetDisplayId(12345);\n\
      \            SetGoState(GO_STATE_ACTIVE);\n        }\n        else\n       \
      \ {\n            // Deactivate event-specific behavior\n            SetDisplayId(0);\n\
      \            SetGoState(GO_STATE_READY);\n        }\n    }\n};"

  notes: This method is typically called from the core game event system when events
    are activated or deactivated. Developers should ensure that any changes made to
    GameObject state during this callback do not cause conflicts with other systems
    or lead to visual glitches. The method is expected to be thread-safe as it's invoked
    by the game's main thread.
  warnings: Do not perform heavy computations or blocking operations within this method,
    as it may impact game performance. Avoid calling methods that modify the GameObject's
    position or state in ways that could interfere with other AI systems or event
    handlers.
