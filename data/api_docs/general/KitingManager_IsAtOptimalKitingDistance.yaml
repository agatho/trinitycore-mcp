  method: IsAtOptimalKitingDistance
  signature: bool KitingManager::IsAtOptimalKitingDistance(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is at the optimal distance for kiting behavior.
  description: The IsAtOptimalKitingDistance method evaluates whether the calling
    Unit is positioned at an optimal distance from a target Unit to perform effective
    kiting mechanics. Kiting is a combat technique where a player maintains a specific
    distance from an enemy while dealing damage, typically used by ranged attackers
    or casters. This method likely considers factors such as the target's attack range,
    the unit's own attack range, and possibly environmental constraints. The result
    indicates whether the current positioning allows for optimal kiting behavior without
    being too close (risking melee attacks) or too far (reducing damage output).
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is at an optimal distance for kiting the target,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "if (kitingManager->IsAtOptimalKitingDistance(targetUnit)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with kiting attack\n    unit->CastSpell(targetUnit, SPELL_KITING_ATTACK, true);\n\
      } else {\n    // Move closer or farther to reach optimal distance\n    unit->GetMotionMaster()->MoveChase(targetUnit);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used within AI decision-making logic for kiting-based
    creatures or player characters. It may internally use distance calculations involving
    the unit's and target's combat ranges, and could be influenced by movement speed
    or spell casting requirements.
