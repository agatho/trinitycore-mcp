  class: IVMapManager
  method: isHeightCalcEnabled
  signature: bool IVMapManager::isHeightCalcEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether height calculation is enabled in the VMap manager.
  description: The isHeightCalcEnabled method determines if the VMap (Virtual Map)
    manager has height calculation functionality activated. This feature is crucial
    for determining accurate vertical positioning of objects and characters within
    the game world, particularly for collision detection and line-of-sight calculations.
    When enabled, this system calculates precise height values for terrain and object
    placements, which affects gameplay mechanics such as jumping, climbing, and spell
    targeting. The method returns a boolean value indicating the current state of
    this calculation feature.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if height calculation is currently enabled in the VMap manager;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check height calculation status
    code: "if (VMapManager2::instance()->isHeightCalcEnabled()) {\n    // Height calculations\
      \ are active\n    printf(\"Height calculation is enabled\\n\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Height calculations are disabled\n    printf(\"Height calculation is\
      \ disabled\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the result to conditionally enable/disable gameplay features
    code: "class GameWorld {\npublic:\n    void UpdatePlayerPosition(Player* player)\
      \ {\n        if (VMapManager2::instance()->isHeightCalcEnabled()) {\n      \
      \      // Use precise height calculations for positioning\n            float\
      \ preciseHeight = VMapManager2::instance()->getHeight(player->GetPositionX(),\
      \ player->GetPositionY(), player->GetPositionZ());\n            player->SetPosition(player->GetPositionX(),\
      \ player->GetPositionY(), preciseHeight);\n        } else {\n            //\
      \ Fall back to basic positioning\n            player->UpdatePosition();\n  \
      \      }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore engine for managing
    VMap functionality. The height calculation feature may be disabled for performance
    reasons in certain server configurations or during specific game events. The result
    of this method directly impacts how terrain and object collisions are handled
    within the virtual world.
  warnings: Be cautious when relying on this method's return value for critical gameplay
    logic, as it might change dynamically based on server configuration or runtime
    conditions. Always ensure proper fallback behavior when height calculation is
    disabled.
