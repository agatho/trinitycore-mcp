documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a bot fails to log in to the game server
  description: The OnBotLoginFailed method is invoked by the BotScheduler when a bot
    client fails to authenticate and connect to the World of Warcraft server. This
    method processes the login failure, potentially logging the event, updating internal
    tracking structures, and may trigger cleanup or retry mechanisms for the bot.
    The method is part of the automated bot management system that handles connection
    states and maintains bot availability for gameplay activities. It ensures proper
    state transitions and error reporting when authentication fails due to network
    issues, invalid credentials, or server-side restrictions.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that failed to log in. This
      value typically represents the internal tracking ID assigned to the bot within
      the TrinityCore system.
  - name: reason
    description: A descriptive string explaining why the login attempt failed. The
      reason may include network errors, authentication failures, account restrictions,
      or other server-side issues that prevented successful connection.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot scheduler context
    code: "void MyBotScheduler::HandleLoginFailure(int guid, const std::string& reason)\
      \ {\n    OnBotLoginFailed(guid, reason);\n    // Additional error handling logic\
      \ can be implemented here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging login failures for debugging
    code: "void BotScheduler::OnBotLoginFailed(int guid, const std::string& reason)\
      \ {\n    sLog->outError(\"Bot login failed for GUID %d: %s\", guid, reason.c_str());\n\
      \    // Update internal tracking or trigger cleanup\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the bot connection management
    subsystem. It's important to ensure that any logging or state updates performed
    in this method are thread-safe, especially if multiple bots attempt to connect
    simultaneously. The method should not block execution for extended periods as
    it may be called from network handling threads.
  warnings: Ensure that sensitive information is not included in the reason string,
    as it may be logged or exposed in debug output. Avoid performing heavy operations
    within this method to prevent blocking the connection handling thread.
