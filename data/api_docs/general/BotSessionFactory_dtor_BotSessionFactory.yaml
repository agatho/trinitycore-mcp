documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BotSessionFactory instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotSessionFactory class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This includes
    cleaning up any internal data structures, stopping background threads if applicable,
    and ensuring proper shutdown of bot-related subsystems. In the context of TrinityCore's
    bot framework, this method ensures that no lingering references or active bot
    sessions remain when the factory is destroyed. The destructor should be called
    automatically by the runtime when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BotSessionFactory
    code: "void ExampleFunction() {\n    BotSessionFactory factory;\n    // Use factory...\n\
      \    // Destructor called automatically when factory goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of BotSessionFactory
    code: 'BotSessionFactory* factory = new BotSessionFactory();

      // Use factory...

      delete factory; // Triggers destructor

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is typically invoked automatically by the C++ runtime when
    an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. Developers should not manually
    call this destructor unless implementing custom memory management patterns. The
    destruction process may involve cleanup of bot sessions, thread termination, and
    resource deallocation that could take non-trivial time depending on active bots.
  warnings: Calling the destructor directly (e.g., factory->~BotSessionFactory())
    is generally discouraged as it bypasses normal C++ object lifecycle management.
    This can lead to undefined behavior if other code still references the object
    after destruction. Additionally, destroying a BotSessionFactory while bots are
    actively running may result in abrupt termination of those bot sessions.
