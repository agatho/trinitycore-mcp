  signature: uint32 World::GetMaxQueuedSessionCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum number of queued session connections allowed in the world.
  description: The GetMaxQueuedSessionCount method retrieves the configured limit
    for the number of client sessions that can be queued for connection to the server.
    This value is typically set via configuration options and controls how many players
    can wait in line to log in when the server is at capacity. The method returns
    a uint32 representing this maximum count, which helps manage server load and player
    access during high-traffic periods. It is used internally by the authentication
    system to enforce connection limits.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value indicating the maximum number of queued sessions allowed.
    This represents the upper bound on pending client connections waiting to be accepted
    by the server.
  examples:
  - title: Check Maximum Queued Sessions
    code: 'uint32 maxQueued = sWorld->GetMaxQueuedSessionCount();

      TC_LOG_INFO("server", "Maximum queued sessions: %u", maxQueued);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This value is usually configured via the 'MaxQueuedSessions' setting in the
    worldserver.conf file. The method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread
    context.
