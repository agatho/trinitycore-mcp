  class: BotTalentManager
  method: IsReady
  signature: bool BotTalentManager::IsReady() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot's talent system is ready for use.
  description: The IsReady method determines if the bot's talent manager has completed
    initialization and is prepared to handle talent-related operations such as learning
    or resetting talents. This check ensures that all necessary data structures are
    properly set up before performing any talent management actions. The method typically
    returns true once the bot has been fully initialized with its class-specific talents
    and the talent system is in a stable state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot's talent manager is ready for use, false otherwise.
    A return value of false may indicate that initialization is still in progress
    or that an error occurred during setup.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check talent readiness
    code: "if (botTalentManager.IsReady()) {\n    // Proceed with talent operations\n\
      \    botTalentManager.LearnTalent(12345);\n} else {\n    // Handle case where\
      \ talents are not yet ready\n    LOG_ERROR(\"Bot talent system not ready\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the bot system to ensure proper
    sequencing of operations. It may perform lightweight checks such as verifying
    that required data has been loaded, but does not involve heavy computations or
    database access.
