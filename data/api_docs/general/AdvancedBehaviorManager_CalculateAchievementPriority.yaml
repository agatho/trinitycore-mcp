  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: CalculateAchievementPriority
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::CalculateAchievementPriority()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and updates the priority levels for achievements based on player
    progress and behavior patterns.
  description: The CalculateAchievementPriority method determines the relative importance
    or urgency of various achievements for a player character within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method evaluates the current state of achievement progress, player
    activity, and behavioral data to assign dynamic priority scores that influence
    how achievements are presented or pursued. It is typically invoked during gameplay
    updates or when achievement data changes to ensure that players are guided toward
    relevant objectives based on their current progression and playstyle. The calculated
    priorities may affect UI display order, quest recommendations, or reward distribution
    mechanisms within the game's achievement system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::UpdatePlayerAchievements(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->GetBehaviorManager())\n\
      \    {\n        player->GetBehaviorManager()->CalculateAchievementPriority();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal achievement tracking systems and
    may perform calculations involving player statistics, time-based factors, and
    behavioral heuristics. It is recommended to call this method only when necessary
    to avoid performance overhead during frequent updates.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the behavior manager
    or player context may result in undefined behavior or incorrect priority assignments.
    Ensure that all prerequisite systems are fully loaded before invoking this function.
