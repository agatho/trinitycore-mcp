  class: ChrCustomizationChoice
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void ChrCustomizationChoice::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Object
    * owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Serializes and writes ChrCustomizationChoice data to a ByteBuffer for client
    transmission during object creation.
  description: The WriteCreate method is responsible for serializing the state of
    a ChrCustomizationChoice object into a ByteBuffer, which is then sent to a specific
    player's client as part of the object creation packet. This method ensures that
    the client receives all necessary data about the character customization choice,
    including its properties and associated identifiers. The serialization process
    typically includes fields such as the choice ID, associated item appearance, and
    any relevant flags or modifiers. It is invoked during the network synchronization
    of game objects when a player first encounters or gains access to a specific character
    customization option.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: A reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized data will be written.
      This buffer is used to construct the packet sent to the client.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Object that owns this ChrCustomizationChoice. Used
      for context and potential inheritance-related data during serialization.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player who will receive this data. This allows for
      conditional serialization based on player-specific settings or permissions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in object creation
    code: 'ChrCustomizationChoice choice;

      ByteBuffer data;

      Player* receiver = ...; // Get player reference

      choice.WriteCreate(data, &someObject, receiver);

      // Send ''data'' to client as part of object creation packet'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    network packet construction for character customization objects. Developers should
    not directly invoke this method unless implementing custom object serialization
    logic.
  warnings: Incorrect usage or improper handling of the ByteBuffer may result in malformed
    packets, causing client-side errors or disconnections. Ensure that all required
    fields are properly initialized before calling WriteCreate.
