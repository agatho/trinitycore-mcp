  class: Aura
  method: DropChargeDelayed
  signature: void Aura::DropChargeDelayed(uint32 delay, AuraRemoveMode removeMode)
documentation:
  brief: Schedules the removal of an aura charge with a specified delay and removal
    mode.
  description: The DropChargeDelayed method is used to asynchronously remove a charge
    from an aura after a specified delay. This method is typically invoked when an
    aura's charge needs to be dropped at a later time, such as during spell effects
    or combat mechanics where charges are consumed with a time-based cooldown. The
    delay parameter controls how long the removal is postponed, and the removeMode
    specifies the manner in which the aura should be removed. This method does not
    immediately remove the charge but schedules it for future execution within the
    game's event system.
  parameters:
  - name: delay
    description: The time delay (in milliseconds) before the aura charge is actually
      removed. This determines when the removal operation will be executed.
  - name: removeMode
    description: Specifies the mode of aura removal, which affects how the aura and
      its effects are processed during removal. Valid values typically include AuraRemoveMode
      constants like AURA_REMOVE_BY_EXPIRE, AURA_REMOVE_BY_CANCEL, etc.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of DropChargeDelayed
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    aura->DropChargeDelayed(5000,\
      \ AURA_REMOVE_BY_EXPIRE); // Remove charge after 5 seconds\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method leverages the TrinityCore's event system to schedule the actual
    removal of the aura charge. It is important to ensure that the aura instance remains
    valid during the delay period, as invalidating it before the scheduled removal
    may lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Using this method with a zero or negative delay value might result in
    immediate execution, which could interfere with the intended timing of aura effects.
    Always validate the delay and removeMode parameters before calling this method.
