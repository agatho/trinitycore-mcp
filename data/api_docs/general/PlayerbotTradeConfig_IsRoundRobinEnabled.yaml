  class: PlayerbotTradeConfig
  method: IsRoundRobinEnabled
  signature: bool PlayerbotTradeConfig::IsRoundRobinEnabled()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the round-robin trading algorithm is enabled for player
    bots.
  description: The IsRoundRobinEnabled method checks if the round-robin trading mechanism
    is active within the PlayerbotTradeConfig. This configuration setting controls
    whether player bots will cycle through available trade partners in a sequential
    order when performing trades, rather than selecting randomly or based on other
    criteria. The method returns a boolean value indicating the current state of this
    specific trade behavior configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the round-robin trading algorithm is enabled; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check Round Robin Trade Status
    code: "if (playerbotTradeConfig.IsRoundRobinEnabled()) {\n    // Perform actions\
      \ specific to round-robin trade mode\n    LOG_INFO(\"playerbots\", \"Round-robin\
      \ trading is enabled.\");\n} else {\n    // Handle non-round-robin trade behavior\n\
      \    LOG_INFO(\"playerbots\", \"Round-robin trading is disabled.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely reads from an internal configuration flag or setting that
    can be modified at runtime. The round-robin algorithm typically ensures fair distribution
    of trading opportunities among available bot partners.
