  class: PathOptimizer
  method: CalculateCurvature
  signature: float PathOptimizer::CalculateCurvature(const int & prev, const int &
    current, const int & next) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the curvature of a path segment defined by three consecutive points
    in a navigation mesh.
  description: The CalculateCurvature method computes the curvature of a path at a
    specific point by analyzing the angles formed between three consecutive waypoints.
    This is used in pathfinding and movement optimization to determine how sharply
    a character must turn when navigating through terrain or obstacles. The method
    takes indices of previous, current, and next points in a path and returns a float
    representing the curvature value, which can be used to adjust movement speed or
    turning behavior for more natural-looking motion. It is typically called during
    path smoothing or optimization processes within the TrinityCore AI system.
  parameters:
  - name: prev
    description: Index of the previous point in the path sequence. Must be a valid
      index pointing to a prior waypoint in the path array.
  - name: current
    description: Index of the current point in the path sequence. Must be a valid
      index pointing to the waypoint being evaluated for curvature.
  - name: next
    description: Index of the next point in the path sequence. Must be a valid index
      pointing to a subsequent waypoint in the path array.
  returns: A float value representing the curvature at the current point. Positive
    values indicate leftward curvature, negative values indicate rightward curvature,
    and values near zero suggest straight movement. The magnitude of the value indicates
    how sharply the path turns.
  examples:
  - title: Basic curvature calculation
    code: 'PathOptimizer optimizer;

      int prevIndex = 0;

      int currentIndex = 1;

      int nextIndex = 2;

      float curvature = optimizer.CalculateCurvature(prevIndex, currentIndex, nextIndex);

      // curvature will be a float value indicating turn sharpness at index 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using curvature to adjust movement speed
    code: "PathOptimizer optimizer;\nfloat baseSpeed = 4.0f;\nfor (int i = 1; i <\
      \ path.size() - 1; ++i) {\n    float curvature = optimizer.CalculateCurvature(i\
      \ - 1, i, i + 1);\n    // Reduce speed for sharp turns\n    float adjustedSpeed\
      \ = baseSpeed * (1.0f - std::abs(curvature) * 0.5f);\n    // Apply adjustedSpeed\
      \ to movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the path points are stored in a continuous array
    or container where indices can be directly used to access previous, current, and
    next points. The curvature calculation is based on vector mathematics involving
    angle computation between segments formed by the three points. Performance is
    O(1) as it only performs geometric calculations without iteration.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided indices are valid and within bounds of the path
    array to avoid memory access violations or undefined behavior. The method does
    not validate input parameters, so callers must ensure prev < current < next and
    all indices are valid before calling.
