documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the instance lock key associated with this map database entry.
  description: The GetKey method returns the InstanceLockKey that uniquely identifies
    an instance lock for a specific map entry. This key is used by the TrinityCore
    server to manage instance locking mechanics, ensuring that players are properly
    routed to and from instance dungeons based on their lock status. The returned
    key typically contains information such as the map ID, difficulty level, and instance
    identifier that together form a unique lock reference for the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: An InstanceLockKey object representing the unique lock identifier for this
    map database entry. This key can be used to check instance lock status or perform
    operations related to instance access control.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Use Instance Lock Key
    code: "MapDb2Entries* entry = sMapDb2Store.LookupEntry(1234);\nif (entry)\n{\n\
      \    InstanceLockKey key = entry->GetKey();\n    // Use the key to check instance\
      \ lock status\n    if (sInstanceSaveManager->IsLocked(key))\n    {\n       \
      \ // Handle locked instance case\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with instance management systems
    and should be called only when the map entry is valid. The InstanceLockKey returned
    is immutable for the lifetime of the MapDb2Entries object.
