  brief: Moves a ScenarioPOI object to another ScenarioPOI object using move semantics.
  description: The ScenarioPOI constructor that accepts an rvalue reference to another
    ScenarioPOI object performs a move operation, transferring all member data from
    the source object to the current object. This is a standard C++ move constructor
    implementation designed to efficiently transfer ownership of resources without
    deep copying. The method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when managing ScenarioPOI objects in containers or during object initialization
    where an existing ScenarioPOI is being relocated. It ensures that the moved-from
    object is left in a valid but unspecified state, suitable for subsequent destruction
    or assignment.

  - title: Move Construction Example
    code: 'ScenarioPOI poi1; // Initialize some ScenarioPOI

      ScenarioPOI poi2 = std::move(poi1); // Move construct poi2 from poi1'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically invoked implicitly during move operations.
    It's important to note that after the move, the source object should not be used
    unless it's subsequently assigned or destroyed. The move constructor is part of
    the standard C++ RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) pattern and helps
    avoid expensive deep copies when transferring ownership of objects.
