documentation:
  brief: Destroys an OpcodeTable instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the OpcodeTable class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the lifetime
    of the OpcodeTable object. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server
    implementation, this typically involves freeing memory associated with opcode
    mappings, command handlers, or other internal data structures that may have been
    initialized during construction. This method ensures proper resource management
    and prevents memory leaks when an OpcodeTable instance goes out of scope or is
    explicitly deleted.

  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of OpcodeTable
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    OpcodeTable* table = new OpcodeTable();\n  \
      \  // ... use the table ...\n    delete table; // Triggers ~OpcodeTable()\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-allocated OpcodeTable destruction
    code: "void AnotherFunction() {\n    OpcodeTable table; // Constructor called\n\
      \    // ... use the table ...\n    // ~OpcodeTable() automatically called when\
      \ table goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when an object
    is destroyed. Developers should not manually call this destructor unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. In TrinityCore, OpcodeTable instances are typically
    managed through smart pointers or stack allocation, so manual destruction is rare.
