api:
  class: AuctionManager
  method: ValidateBidPlacement
  signature: bool AuctionManager::ValidateBidPlacement(Player * bot, uint32 auctionId,
    uint64 bidAmount)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a bid can be placed on a specific auction item.
  description: The ValidateBidPlacement method checks if a given bid amount is valid
    for placement on a specified auction. It ensures that the bid meets minimum requirements,
    such as being higher than the current highest bid or meeting the auction's starting
    bid threshold. This validation is crucial for maintaining auction integrity and
    preventing invalid bids from being processed. The method typically performs checks
    against existing auction data and player account state to determine bid eligibility.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot attempting to place
      the bid. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: auctionId
    description: Unique identifier of the auction item for which the bid is being
      placed. Must correspond to an existing active auction in the system.
  - name: bidAmount
    description: The amount the bot wishes to bid, specified as a uint64 value. Must
      be greater than the current highest bid or meet the minimum bid threshold for
      the auction.
  returns: Returns true if the bid is valid and can be placed on the auction; returns
    false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate insufficient bid amount,
    invalid auction ID, or other validation failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bid Validation
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nuint32 auctionId = 12345;\nuint64 bidAmount = 100000;\n\
      bool isValid = sAuctionMgr->ValidateBidPlacement(bot, auctionId, bidAmount);\n\
      if (isValid) {\n    // Proceed with placing the bid\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Validation in Auction Logic
    code: "void HandleAuctionBid(Player* player, uint32 auctionId, uint64 bidAmount)\
      \ {\n    if (!sAuctionMgr->ValidateBidPlacement(player, auctionId, bidAmount))\
      \ {\n        player->SendAuctionPlaceBidError(AUCTION_PLACE_BID_ERROR_INVALID_BID);\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n    // Continue with actual bid placement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the auction database and performs checks
    against current auction state, including verifying that the auction is still active
    and hasn't expired. It may also validate player permissions or account status
    to ensure only eligible players can place bids.
  warnings: "Ensure that the auctionId provided corresponds to an actual active auction;\
    \ otherwise, validation will fail. Also, be aware that this method does not actually\
    \ place the bid\u2014it only validates whether it would be allowed."
