documentation:
  brief: Unlocks a specified Azerite essence milestone for the item.
  description: The AddUnlockedEssenceMilestone method is used to unlock a specific
    Azerite essence milestone associated with an Azerite item. This action typically
    occurs during gameplay when a player progresses through the Azerite armor system,
    allowing them to access new abilities or enhancements. The method takes an identifier
    for the milestone power and updates the internal state of the AzeriteItem to reflect
    that this milestone has been unlocked. It is generally called as part of the game's
    progression mechanics when the player meets certain conditions or requirements
    for unlocking an essence milestone.
  parameters:
  - name: azeriteItemMilestonePowerId
    description: An integer identifier representing the specific Azerite item milestone
      power to be unlocked. This ID corresponds to a defined milestone in the game's
      data files and determines which essence or ability becomes available for the
      player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Unlocking an Azerite Essence Milestone
    code: 'AzeriteItem* item = player->GetAzeriteItem();

      item->AddUnlockedEssenceMilestone(12345); // Unlocks milestone with ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal flags or data structures within the
    AzeriteItem object to track unlocked milestones. It may also trigger UI updates
    or send network packets to synchronize the change across clients.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided milestone ID is valid and corresponds to an existing
    milestone in the game's database; otherwise, behavior is undefined.
