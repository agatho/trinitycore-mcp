documentation:
  brief: Initializes an arcane mage AI bot with the specified player character.
  description: The ArcaneMageRefactored constructor initializes a new instance of
    the Arcane Mage AI bot, setting up the necessary internal state and configuration
    for the player to function as an arcane mage in the TrinityCore environment. This
    method prepares the bot's spell selection, mana management, and combat behavior
    specific to arcane magic. The initialization process includes configuring the
    bot's ability to cast arcane spells, manage arcane power, and execute optimal
    arcane mage tactics during combat encounters.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Arcane Mage Bot Initialization
    code: 'Player* bot = new Player();

      ArcaneMageRefactored arcaneMageBot(bot);

      // The bot is now initialized and ready to perform arcane mage actions'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The player
    object passed must be a valid Player instance with proper character data loaded.
    The AI behavior will automatically adapt based on the player's current level,
    available spells, and equipped items.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor multiple times on the same bot instance as
    it may lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks. Ensure that the Player pointer
    is valid and not null before passing it to this constructor.
