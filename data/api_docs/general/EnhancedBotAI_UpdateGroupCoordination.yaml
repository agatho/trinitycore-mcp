documentation:
  brief: Updates group coordination state for enhanced bot AI behavior.
  description: The UpdateGroupCoordination method manages and synchronizes the coordinated
    actions of enhanced bots within a group context. It processes timing-based updates
    to ensure that bot behaviors remain synchronized with group activities, such as
    movement patterns, combat strategies, or quest-related coordination. This method
    is typically called during the AI update cycle and handles internal state management
    for group-based decision making. The method does not require any specific preconditions
    but relies on the existence of a valid group context and active bot instances.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void EnhancedBotAI::Update()\n{\n    // Other AI updates...\n    UpdateGroupCoordination(100);\
      \ // Update every 100ms\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called regularly within the AI update loop.
    It performs minimal direct operations but manages internal state transitions that
    affect group behavior. The diff parameter represents time elapsed since last update
    and influences timing-sensitive coordination logic.
