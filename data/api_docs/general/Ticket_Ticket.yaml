  brief: Moves a ticket object to another ticket object using move semantics
  description: The Ticket::Ticket constructor with an rvalue reference parameter implements
    move semantics for ticket objects. This constructor transfers ownership of resources
    from the source ticket to the destination ticket, effectively moving the ticket's
    state rather than copying it. The operation is typically used in scenarios where
    a temporary ticket object needs to be efficiently transferred to another ticket
    variable without unnecessary copying overhead. This method is part of the standard
    C++ move semantics implementation and follows the typical pattern for move constructors
    in TrinityCore's object management system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move ticket to new variable
    code: 'Ticket&& tempTicket = Ticket();

      Ticket newTicket = std::move(tempTicket); // Move constructor called'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move in container operations
    code: 'std::vector<Ticket> tickets;

      tickets.emplace_back(Ticket());

      // When vector needs to reallocate, move constructors are used for efficiency'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is automatically generated by the compiler when no explicit
    move constructor is defined. It's important to note that after a move operation,
    the source object should not be used in a meaningful way as its state may be left
    in a valid but unspecified state. This is standard behavior for move semantics
    in C++.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after a move operation results in undefined
    behavior. The source ticket object becomes invalid after this constructor is called,
    and any attempt to access its members may lead to crashes or data corruption.
