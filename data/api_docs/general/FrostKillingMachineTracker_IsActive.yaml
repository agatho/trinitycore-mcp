documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the Frost Killing Machine is currently active.
  description: The IsActive method determines if the Frost Killing Machine effect
    is currently active on the target. This method is typically used in game mechanics
    related to the Frost Killing Machine ability, which may apply a temporary buff
    or debuff to enemies. The check returns true if the machine's effect is currently
    active and false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for managing cooldowns,
    visual effects, and gameplay interactions tied to the machine's operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Frost Killing Machine effect is currently active on
    the target; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (tracker->IsActive()) {\n    // Perform action when machine is active\n\
      \    DoSomething();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic with Active Check
    code: "void OnUpdate() {\n    if (tracker->IsActive()) {\n        // Apply continuous\
      \ effects while active\n        ApplyFrostDamage();\n    } else {\n        //\
      \ Handle deactivation logic\n        ResetEffects();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple state check and should have minimal performance
    impact. It is recommended to cache the result if checking this value multiple
    times within the same game tick.
