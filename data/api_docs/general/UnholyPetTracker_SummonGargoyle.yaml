  brief: Summons a gargoyle pet for the unholy death knight.

    an unholy death knight. This pet is summoned as part of the Unholy Pet Tracker
    functionality, which manages the death knight's summoned creatures. The gargoyle
    typically serves as a damage-dealing or utility pet that can be controlled by
    the player. This method likely interacts with the player's pet system and may
    require specific conditions such as having the appropriate talent or spell available.
    The summoned gargoyle will remain active until dismissed or removed by game mechanics.
