  class: Creature
  method: LoadPath
  signature: void Creature::LoadPath(uint32 pathid)
documentation:
  brief: Loads a path for the creature to follow based on the provided path ID.
  description: The LoadPath method initializes and loads a predefined path for the
    creature to traverse. This method is typically invoked during creature creation
    or when a specific movement behavior needs to be activated. The path is defined
    in the database and referenced by a unique path ID. Once loaded, the creature
    will begin following the waypoints associated with that path. The method does
    not immediately start movement; it prepares the path data for subsequent execution
    via movement commands.
  parameters:
  - name: pathid
    description: The unique identifier of the path to load from the database. This
      ID corresponds to entries in the creature_path table and defines the sequence
      of waypoints the creature will follow.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Loading a Path for a Patrol Creature
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...; // Assume creature is already initialized

      creature->LoadPath(12345);

      // Path with ID 12345 is now loaded and ready to be executed via movement commands'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only loads the path data into memory. To make the creature actually
    follow the path, additional methods like 'StartMovement' or similar movement control
    functions must be called afterward. The path ID should correspond to a valid entry
    in the creature_path database table.
