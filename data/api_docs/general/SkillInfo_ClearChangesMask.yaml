documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of a skill entry, resetting its modified state.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with a SkillInfo object. This typically indicates that any pending modifications
    to the skill's data have been acknowledged and committed, effectively clearing
    the 'dirty' flag that tracks whether the skill has been altered since last synchronization
    or save. In the context of TrinityCore's player skill management system, this
    method is often used after sending updates to clients or persisting changes to
    the database. The operation does not modify the actual skill values themselves
    but only resets their change tracking state.

  examples:
  - title: Clearing Changes Mask After Sending Update
    code: "SkillInfo* skill = player->GetSkillInfo(171); // Get Herbalism skill\n\
      if (skill)\n{\n    skill->SetSkillValue(100);\n    // ... perform other operations\
      \ ...\n    skill->ClearChangesMask(); // Mark as synchronized after update\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the core when skill data is
    successfully sent to a client or persisted. It's important for maintaining consistency
    between in-memory state and database/packet representations. The changes mask
    may be used in conjunction with methods like IsChanged() to determine if synchronization
    is needed.
