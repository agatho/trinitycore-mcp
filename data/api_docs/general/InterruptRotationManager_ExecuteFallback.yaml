  method: ExecuteFallback
  signature: bool InterruptRotationManager::ExecuteFallback(FallbackMethod method,
    Unit * caster)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a fallback behavior for an interrupt rotation manager based on the
    specified method and caster unit.
  description: The ExecuteFallback method is responsible for handling fallback logic
    within an interrupt rotation manager. It takes a FallbackMethod enumeration and
    a Unit pointer representing the caster, and determines whether the fallback action
    should be executed successfully. This method is typically used in AI-driven spell
    casting systems where primary interrupt behaviors fail, triggering alternative
    actions. The method evaluates the provided caster unit's state and the specified
    fallback method to decide on execution outcome.
  parameters:
  - name: method
    description: The FallbackMethod enumeration specifying which fallback behavior
      to execute. This defines the type of fallback action to be performed.
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the caster that is attempting
      to execute the fallback. This unit's state and properties are evaluated during
      execution.
  returns: Returns true if the fallback was successfully executed, false otherwise.
    A return value of false may indicate failure in execution or invalid parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Fallback Execution
    code: "InterruptRotationManager rotationManager;\nUnit* player = ...; // Get player\
      \ unit\nbool result = rotationManager.ExecuteFallback(FallbackMethod::DEFENSIVE,\
      \ player);\nif (result)\n{\n    // Fallback executed successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Fallback Based on Caster State
    code: "InterruptRotationManager rotationManager;\nUnit* target = ...; // Get target\
      \ unit\nif (target->IsInCombat())\n{\n    bool success = rotationManager.ExecuteFallback(FallbackMethod::OFFENSIVE,\
      \ target);\n    if (!success)\n    {\n        // Handle fallback failure\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI interrupt rotation system and should only be
    called when a primary interrupt action fails. The caster parameter must not be
    null, otherwise behavior is undefined. Performance-wise, this method should be
    lightweight as it's often called during combat scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the FallbackMethod enum values are valid before calling this
    function. Passing invalid or uninitialized Unit pointers may lead to crashes or
    undefined behavior. This method does not perform any safety checks on the caster
    unit beyond null validation.
