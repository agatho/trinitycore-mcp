  method: IsInitialized
  signature: bool QuestHubDatabase::IsInitialized() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the QuestHub database has been successfully initialized and
    is ready for use.
  description: The IsInitialized method returns a boolean value indicating if the
    QuestHubDatabase instance has completed its initialization process. This is typically
    used to verify that all necessary database connections, schema setups, and internal
    configurations have been properly established before attempting to perform any
    database operations. The method does not perform any side effects or modify the
    state of the database. It is commonly called during startup routines or before
    executing queries to ensure system stability and prevent runtime errors due to
    uninitialized resources.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the QuestHubDatabase has been successfully initialized and is ready
    for use; false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Check
    code: "if (QuestHubDatabase::instance().IsInitialized()) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ database operations\n    LOG_INFO(\"quest_hub\", \"QuestHub database is ready.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    LOG_ERROR(\"quest_hub\", \"QuestHub database failed to initialize.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple state check and should be fast. It's recommended
    to cache the result of this call if it's checked frequently during runtime, as
    repeated calls may not provide significant performance benefits.
