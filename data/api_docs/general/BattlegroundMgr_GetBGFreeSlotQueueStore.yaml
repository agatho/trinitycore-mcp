api:
  class: BattlegroundMgr
  method: GetBGFreeSlotQueueStore
  signature: BGFreeSlotQueueContainer & BattlegroundMgr::GetBGFreeSlotQueueStore(uint32
    mapId)
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the free slot queue container for the specified battleground
    map.
  description: The GetBGFreeSlotQueueStore method retrieves a reference to the BGFreeSlotQueueContainer
    associated with a specific battleground map ID. This container holds information
    about available slots and queued players for that particular battleground type.
    The method is used internally by the battleground system to manage player queuing
    and slot allocation. It ensures that each battleground map has its own dedicated
    queue storage, allowing for efficient management of multiple concurrent battleground
    instances.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the BGFreeSlotQueueContainer associated with the specified
    battleground map ID. This container manages queued players and free slot information
    for the battleground instance.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Free Slot Queue for Alterac Valley
    code: 'BGFreeSlotQueueContainer& queue = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBGFreeSlotQueueStore(BATTLEGROUND_AV);

      // Use queue to check available slots or add players'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used by the battleground queuing system and internal
    battleground management code. The returned reference should not be stored long-term
    as it may become invalid if the battleground instance is destroyed or recreated.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned container directly unless you understand the
    internal locking mechanisms of the battleground manager. Accessing this container
    from multiple threads without proper synchronization can lead to race conditions
    and data corruption.
