documentation:
  brief: Returns the movement generator type identifier for rotate movement generators.
  description: The GetMovementGeneratorType method retrieves the unique integer identifier
    associated with the RotateMovementGenerator class. This identifier is used internally
    by TrinityCore's movement system to distinguish different types of movement generators
    during pathfinding and movement execution. The returned value typically corresponds
    to a predefined enum or constant that represents the specific behavior of this
    movement generator, which is responsible for rotating units in place without changing
    their position. This method is commonly called by the AI system and movement managers
    to determine how to process and execute movement commands.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the movement generator type identifier for RotateMovementGenerator.
    This value is typically a constant defined within the movement generator system
    that uniquely identifies this specific type of movement behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Context
    code: "void OnAIUpdate(Unit* unit)\n{\n    MovementGenerator* mg = unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator();\n\
      \    if (mg && mg->GetMovementGeneratorType() == ROTATE_MOTION_TYPE)\n    {\n\
      \        // Handle rotate movement specific logic\n        unit->SetFacingTo(unit->GetOrientation()\
      \ + 0.1f);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a const function and does not modify the state of the RotateMovementGenerator
    instance. It's typically used in performance-critical code paths where movement
    type identification is needed quickly. The return value should be compared against
    predefined constants like ROTATE_MOTION_TYPE to determine movement behavior.
