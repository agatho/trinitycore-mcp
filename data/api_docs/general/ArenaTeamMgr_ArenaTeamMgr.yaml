documentation:
  brief: Moves an ArenaTeamMgr object to another ArenaTeamMgr object using move semantics.
  description: This is a move constructor for the ArenaTeamMgr class. It transfers
    ownership of resources from one ArenaTeamMgr instance to another, typically used
    when assigning or returning objects by value. The source object becomes invalid
    after the move operation and should not be used. This constructor is part of the
    C++ standard library's move semantics implementation to optimize resource management
    in scenarios involving temporary objects or explicit moves.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to another ArenaTeamMgr object whose resources
      will be moved to this instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move construction of ArenaTeamMgr
    code: 'ArenaTeamMgr manager1;

      // ... initialize manager1 ...

      ArenaTeamMgr manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Move constructor invoked'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the compiler during move operations
    or explicitly when using std::move(). It's important to understand that after
    a move, the source object is left in a valid but unspecified state and should
    not be accessed.
  warnings: Never use the source object after moving it. Using moved-from objects
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes if they contain pointers or references
    to freed memory.
