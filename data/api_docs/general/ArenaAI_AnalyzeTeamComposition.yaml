  class: ArenaAI
  method: AnalyzeTeamComposition
  signature: void ArenaAI::AnalyzeTeamComposition(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes the composition of the arena team to determine optimal strategy
    and player roles.
  description: The ArenaAI::AnalyzeTeamComposition method evaluates the current state
    of an arena team, including player classes, roles, and abilities. This analysis
    helps the AI make informed decisions about positioning, targeting, and tactical
    approaches during arena battles. The method likely examines player statistics,
    cooldowns, and combat effectiveness to optimize team performance. It serves as
    a core component in determining how the arena AI should behave in different match
    scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player index or identifier
      within the arena team. This parameter is used internally by the AI to access
      specific player data for composition analysis.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Team Composition Analysis
    code: "void MyArenaAI::PerformAnalysis()\n{\n    int playerIndex = 0;\n    AnalyzeTeamComposition(&playerIndex);\n\
      \    // AI now has updated team composition data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal arena AI system and likely called during
    battle initialization or at regular intervals. The analysis may influence spell
    selection, target prioritization, and overall tactical decisions. Implementation
    details are not publicly exposed in the core TrinityCore API.
  warnings: The method signature suggests it modifies player data through a pointer
    parameter, which could lead to unintended side effects if not handled carefully.
    Ensure proper synchronization when accessing shared arena team data.
