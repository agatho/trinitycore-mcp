documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new DetectionContext instance for managing detection-related
    data.
  description: The DetectionContext constructor initializes a new instance of the
    DetectionContext class, setting up internal state for tracking detection-related
    information. This class is typically used within the TrinityCore AI system to
    manage how creatures detect players or other entities in the game world. The constructor
    prepares necessary data structures and default values required for detection operations,
    including initialization of detection ranges, visibility flags, and related tracking
    variables. It ensures that all internal members are properly initialized before
    the context can be used for actual detection logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new DetectionContext instance
    code: 'DetectionContext context;

      // The context is now ready for use in detection operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or resource
    allocation. It simply sets up default values for internal state variables. The
    actual detection behavior is determined by other methods in the class rather than
    this constructor.
