  brief: Copies the state of another BotPriorityManager instance
  description: The BotPriorityManager copy constructor initializes a new BotPriorityManager
    object by copying all member variables and state from an existing BotPriorityManager
    instance. This constructor is typically used when creating a new priority manager
    that should have identical configuration and data as an existing one, which is
    common in AI behavior systems where multiple bot instances need to share the same
    priority settings for consistent decision-making. The copied instance maintains
    its own independent memory space but reflects the exact same priority configurations
    and internal state as the source object.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a Copy of BotPriorityManager
    code: 'BotPriorityManager originalManager;

      // Configure originalManager with priorities...

      BotPriorityManager newManager(originalManager); // Copy constructor usage

      // newManager now has identical state to originalManager'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a standard copy constructor implementation that performs member-wise
    copying of all data members. The implementation should ensure deep copying if
    any member variables contain pointers or dynamic allocations, though in typical
    TrinityCore bot systems this usually involves simple value types and containers.
