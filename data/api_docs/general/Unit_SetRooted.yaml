  class: Unit
  method: SetRooted
  signature: void Unit::SetRooted(bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the rooted status of the unit, preventing movement while maintaining
    the current position.
  description: The SetRooted method controls whether a unit is allowed to move or
    not. When applied, it prevents the unit from moving in any direction, effectively
    'rooting' the unit in place. This method is commonly used for controlling NPC
    behavior during combat or when applying movement restrictions to players. The
    method operates by setting a flag that disables movement capabilities of the unit,
    which can be toggled on or off depending on the boolean parameter provided.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = GetUnit();\n target->SetRooted(true);\n// Unit is now rooted\
      \ and cannot move"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = GetUnit();\n target->SetRooted(false);\n// Unit is now allowed\
      \ to move again\n// This can be used in conjunction with other movement control\
      \ methods"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include that this method likely modifies internal
    movement flags or state variables within the unit's object. Performance considerations
    are minimal as it simply toggles a flag, but it may affect AI processing if used
    frequently in combat situations.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method with player units as it can
    interfere with normal gameplay mechanics and potentially cause client-side issues
    if not properly handled. Avoid applying this to players during active combat or
    movement scenarios where normal movement is expected.
