  method: SyncWithDatabaseOptimizer
  signature: void BotProfiler::SyncWithDatabaseOptimizer()
documentation:
  brief: Synchronizes bot profiler data with the database optimizer to ensure consistent
    profiling metrics and performance tracking.
  description: The SyncWithDatabaseOptimizer method is responsible for aligning internal
    bot profiler statistics with the database optimizer's state. This ensures that
    profiling data accurately reflects the current performance characteristics of
    bot operations within the TrinityCore environment. The method likely handles synchronization
    of timing data, resource usage metrics, and other profiling information to maintain
    consistency between in-memory profiler states and persistent database records.
    It may also trigger updates or flushes to ensure that recent profiling activities
    are properly recorded in the database for later analysis or reporting.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      profiler.SyncWithDatabaseOptimizer();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called periodically or after significant bot activity
    to maintain accurate profiling data. It may involve database I/O operations, so
    frequent calls could impact performance. The synchronization process might be
    optimized to batch updates rather than perform individual writes for each metric.
  warnings: Calling this method during high-frequency bot operations without proper
    throttling may cause performance degradation due to database contention or excessive
    I/O. Ensure that the profiler is not actively collecting data when this synchronization
    occurs to avoid race conditions.
