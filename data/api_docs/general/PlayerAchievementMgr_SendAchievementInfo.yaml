  class: PlayerAchievementMgr

  signature: void PlayerAchievementMgr::SendAchievementInfo(Player * receiver, uint32
    achievementId) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends achievement information to a specified player.
  description: The SendAchievementInfo method is responsible for transmitting detailed
    information about a specific achievement to a targeted player in the game. This
    method is typically used within the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    server implementation to notify players of their progress or completion status
    for achievements. It handles the serialization and network transmission of achievement
    data, ensuring that the player receives accurate updates regarding their accomplishments.
    The method operates on the principle of sending only relevant achievement details
    rather than full achievement lists, optimizing bandwidth usage and performance.
  parameters:
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive the achievement information.
      This parameter must be a valid player instance; passing a null pointer will
      result in undefined behavior or potential crashes.
  - name: achievementId
    description: The unique identifier of the achievement for which information is
      being sent. This ID corresponds to entries in the game's achievement database
      and must reference a valid achievement entry.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Assume this is a valid player pointer

      uint32 achievementId = 12345;

      playerAchievementMgr->SendAchievementInfo(targetPlayer, achievementId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending Achievement Info on Completion
    code: "void OnPlayerAchievementComplete(Player* player, uint32 achievementId)\n\
      {\n    // Send updated achievement info to the player\n    player->GetAchievementMgr()->SendAchievementInfo(player,\
      \ achievementId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal caching or data structures to efficiently
    retrieve and serialize achievement information. It may also trigger additional
    events or callbacks related to achievement progression. The implementation assumes
    that the receiver player is connected and valid. Performance considerations include
    minimizing network overhead by only sending necessary data fields.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null Player pointer can lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the achievementId corresponds to a known achievement in
    the database; otherwise, the method may silently fail or send incomplete data.
    This method should not be called from within critical sections of code where race
    conditions might occur.
