  signature: void EvokerAI::~EvokerAI()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an EvokerAI instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The EvokerAI destructor is automatically invoked when an EvokerAI object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper cleanup
    of any dynamically allocated memory, resets internal state variables, and performs
    necessary deinitialization tasks for the evoker's AI behavior. In the context
    of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this destructor plays a critical
    role in preventing memory leaks when AI controllers are removed from creatures
    or game entities. The destruction process typically involves calling parent class
    destructors and cleaning up any AI-specific data structures such as action queues,
    target tracking information, or spell casting states.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Destruction of EvokerAI Instance
    code: 'EvokerAI* evokerAI = new EvokerAI(creature);

      // ... AI logic execution ...

      delete evokerAI; // Triggers ~EvokerAI() destructor'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic Destruction via Scope
    code: "void SomeFunction(Creature* creature)\n{\n    EvokerAI evokerAI(creature);\n\
      \    // ... AI logic execution ...\n    // ~EvokerAI() automatically called\
      \ when evokerAI goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly virtual in the base AI class hierarchy, ensuring
    proper polymorphic destruction. Developers should avoid manually calling this
    destructor unless implementing custom memory management patterns. Memory allocated
    within the EvokerAI instance (e.g., through new/delete operations) must be properly
    managed to prevent leaks.
  warnings: Never explicitly call the destructor directly unless you are managing
    memory manually in a custom allocator. Calling ~EvokerAI() directly on stack-allocated
    objects will result in undefined behavior as it's meant to be called only during
    object destruction by the runtime.
