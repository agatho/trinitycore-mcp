  class: World
  method: setFloatConfig
  signature: void World::setFloatConfig(WorldFloatConfigs index, float value)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a floating-point configuration value for the world based on the provided
    index.
  description: The setFloatConfig method updates a specific floating-point configuration
    setting within the World object. This method is typically used to modify various
    game-related parameters such as rate multipliers, difficulty settings, or other
    numeric game constants that affect gameplay balance and behavior. The method accepts
    a predefined enumeration index that identifies which configuration value to update
    and a float value to assign to it. Changes made using this method are usually
    applied immediately and may affect ongoing game sessions or future game instances
    depending on how the configuration is implemented internally.
  parameters:
  - name: index
    description: A WorldFloatConfigs enumeration value that specifies which floating-point
      configuration setting to modify. This index maps to a specific configuration
      parameter in the world settings.
  - name: value
    description: The float value to assign to the specified configuration index. This
      represents the new value for the configuration setting being updated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set PvP Kill Honor Rate
    code: World::instance()->setFloatConfig(WORLD_FLOAT_RATE_KILL_HONOR, 2.5f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjust Experience Gain Multiplier
    code: World::instance()->setFloatConfig(WORLD_FLOAT_RATE_EXPERIENCE_KILL, 1.5f);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal world configuration values and should
    be used carefully. Changes may not persist across server restarts unless explicitly
    saved to the database or configuration files. The method is typically thread-safe
    as it operates on global singleton instance, but concurrent modifications from
    multiple threads should be avoided for consistency.
  warnings: Modifying certain configuration values can significantly affect gameplay
    balance and player experience. Always validate input values before calling this
    method to prevent unexpected behavior or server instability. Some configurations
    may require server restart to fully take effect.
