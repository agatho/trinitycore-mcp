  signature: uint32 BotPerformanceMonitor::GetTargetTickTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the target tick time value used for performance monitoring in bot
    behavior.
  description: The GetTargetTickTime method retrieves the configured target tick time
    value that determines how frequently bot AI should update or process actions.
    This value is crucial for maintaining consistent performance across different
    server configurations and ensures bots don't consume excessive CPU resources.
    The returned value represents milliseconds between each tick of the bot's decision-making
    cycle, which directly affects responsiveness and resource usage. This method is
    typically used internally by the BotPerformanceMonitor class to track and adjust
    AI processing intervals based on system load or configuration settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the target tick time in milliseconds. This
    indicates how often the bot's AI should perform its main update cycle, with higher
    values resulting in less frequent but more efficient processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 targetTime = botPerformanceMonitor.GetTargetTickTime();

      TC_LOG_INFO("bot", "Bot target tick time: {} ms", targetTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Integration
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    uint32 targetTick = botPerformanceMonitor.GetTargetTickTime();\n\
      \    if (GetMSTime() - lastUpdateTime >= targetTick)\n    {\n        // Perform\
      \ bot AI logic\n        ProcessBotBehavior();\n        lastUpdateTime = GetMSTime();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    returned value is typically configured via server settings or bot-specific configuration
    files. It's recommended to cache this value if it's accessed frequently within
    tight loops to avoid unnecessary method calls.
  warnings: Modifying the target tick time directly through this method may cause
    unexpected behavior in bot AI processing. Always ensure that changes to this value
    align with overall server performance requirements and bot functionality expectations.
