  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: GetMaxRange
  signature: float LineOfSightManager::GetMaxRange() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum line-of-sight range allowed by the manager.
  description: The GetMaxRange method retrieves the maximum distance at which line-of-sight
    checks can be performed within the LineOfSightManager. This value defines the
    upper limit for visibility calculations and is typically used to determine whether
    an object or point is within the valid range for line-of-sight testing. The returned
    float value represents the distance in yards, which may vary depending on the
    specific implementation or configuration of the manager instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the maximum line-of-sight range in yards. This
    value defines the furthest distance at which a line-of-sight check can be considered
    valid by the manager.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float maxRange = lineOfSightManager->GetMaxRange();\nif (maxRange > 0.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Use maxRange for distance calculations\n    std::cout << \"Maximum\
      \ range: \" << maxRange << \" yards\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other line-of-sight functions
    to validate whether a target is within acceptable range before performing expensive
    visibility checks. The value returned may be influenced by game settings or configuration
    parameters that define the maximum detection distance for different types of entities.
