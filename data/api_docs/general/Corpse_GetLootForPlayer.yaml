  method: GetLootForPlayer
  signature: Loot * Corpse::GetLootForPlayer(const int * param0) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the loot associated with the corpse for a specific player.
  description: The GetLootForPlayer method returns a pointer to the Loot object that
    contains the items dropped by the corpse and available for looting by the specified
    player. This method is typically used in the context of player corpse management
    within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore emulation. It ensures that each player
    only sees loot relevant to their own looting rights, such as items they have permission
    to loot or items that were not previously claimed. The method does not modify
    any internal state and is safe for read-only access. This functionality supports
    the game mechanics where players can loot corpses after defeating enemies, with
    proper permissions and item distribution.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a Loot object representing the loot available for the specified
    player to loot from this corpse. Returns nullptr if no loot is available or if
    there was an error retrieving the loot.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Corpse* corpse = ...; // Assume corpse is initialized\nLoot* loot = corpse->GetLootForPlayer(nullptr);\n\
      if (loot)\n{\n    // Process the loot for the player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal loot state management and assumes that the
    Corpse object has been properly initialized with valid loot data. It is typically
    called during the looting process when a player attempts to loot a corpse.
  warnings: Ensure that the Corpse object is valid before calling this method, as
    calling it on an invalid or uninitialized corpse may result in undefined behavior.
    Also, be aware that the returned Loot pointer should not be deleted by the caller;
    it's managed internally by the Corpse object.
