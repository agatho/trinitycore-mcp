documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the resource event is valid and properly initialized
  description: The IsValid method determines if a ResourceEvent object has been correctly
    initialized and contains valid data. This method performs internal validation
    checks to ensure that the event's state is consistent and can be safely used in
    game logic operations. It typically verifies that required fields are populated,
    references are valid, and the event hasn't been marked as destroyed or invalid
    by the system. The method is commonly used before performing operations on the
    resource event to prevent undefined behavior or crashes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the resource event is valid and properly initialized, false
    otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that the event has been
    destroyed, is in an inconsistent state, or hasn't been properly constructed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "ResourceEvent* event = sResourceMgr->GetEvent(12345);\nif (event && event->IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Safe to use the event\n    event->Process();\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ invalid event\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid resource event encountered\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in Event Handler
    code: "void OnResourceUpdate(ResourceEvent* event) {\n    if (!event || !event->IsValid())\
      \ {\n        sLog->outError(\"Received invalid resource event in handler\");\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with processing valid event\n    ProcessEvent(event);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs lightweight validation checks and should not be called
    excessively in performance-critical code paths. The implementation typically involves
    checking internal flags or pointers rather than complex data validation.
  warnings: Do not assume that a valid ResourceEvent will remain valid throughout
    its lifetime. Events can become invalid due to external factors such as destruction,
    resource cleanup, or system state changes. Always validate before use in critical
    operations.
