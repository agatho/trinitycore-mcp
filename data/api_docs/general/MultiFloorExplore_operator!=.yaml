  signature: bool MultiFloorExplore::operator!=(const MultiFloorExplore & right) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two MultiFloorExplore objects for inequality.
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this MultiFloorExplore
    instance and another MultiFloorExplore object to determine if they are not equal.
    This comparison is typically based on internal state or data members that define
    the identity of the explore object, such as floor levels, area identifiers, or
    exploration flags. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this method
    would be used to check whether two exploration states differ in their configuration
    or explored areas. The operation is const and does not modify either object.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current MultiFloorExplore object is not equal to the
    provided right object; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Inequality Check
    code: 'MultiFloorExplore explore1;

      MultiFloorExplore explore2;

      bool result = (explore1 != explore2); // Returns true if they are different'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely relies on a member-wise comparison of key attributes
    that define the state of a MultiFloorExplore object. It is commonly used in collections
    or when comparing exploration data across different game sessions or zones.
