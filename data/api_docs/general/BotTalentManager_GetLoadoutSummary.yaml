documentation:
  brief: Generates and returns a formatted summary string of the bot's current talent
    loadout.
  description: The GetLoadoutSummary method constructs a human-readable string that
    represents the current talent specialization and selected talents for a bot character.
    This summary typically includes information about the bot's class, spec, and key
    talent selections. The method is useful for debugging, logging, or displaying
    bot talent configurations in-game or through admin tools. It does not modify any
    internal state and can be called at any time during a bot's lifecycle. The returned
    string format may vary depending on implementation but generally follows a consistent
    pattern across different bot instances.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing a formatted summary of the bot's current talent
    loadout, including class, specialization, and selected talents in a readable format.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotTalentManager* talentMgr = bot->GetBotTalentManager();

      std::string summary = talentMgr->GetLoadoutSummary();

      LOG_INFO("misc", "Bot loadout: {}", summary);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for logging or display purposes. It may involve
    iterating through the bot's talent trees and collecting relevant data, which could
    have minor performance implications if called frequently in tight loops.
