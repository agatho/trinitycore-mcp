  class: AzeriteItem
  method: DeleteFromDB
  signature: void AzeriteItem::DeleteFromDB(int trans)
documentation:
  brief: Removes an Azerite item's data from the database
  description: The DeleteFromDB method is responsible for permanently removing all
    stored data related to a specific Azerite item from the TrinityCore database.
    This includes any azerite powers, levels, or other associated properties that
    have been saved for the item. The method takes transaction and item identifiers
    as parameters to ensure accurate deletion of the correct item data. This operation
    is typically used when an Azerite item is destroyed, sold, or otherwise removed
    from a player's inventory in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: trans
    description: Transaction identifier used for database operations. This parameter
      ensures that the deletion occurs within the correct database transaction context,
      maintaining data consistency during multi-step operations.
  - name: item
    description: The unique identifier of the Azerite item to be deleted from the
      database. This is typically the item's GUID or database ID that uniquely identifies
      it within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AzeriteItem azeriteItem;

      azeriteItem.DeleteFromDB(12345, 67890);'
    language: cpp
  - title: In Transaction Context
    code: 'Transaction* trans = new Transaction();

      AzeriteItem azeriteItem;

      azeriteItem.DeleteFromDB(trans, player->GetItemGUID());

      delete trans;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the database and should only be called
    when it's certain that the item data is no longer needed. The method does not
    perform any validation of item ownership or game state - it simply removes the
    data from storage.
  warnings: Calling this method on an item that still exists in a player's inventory
    may result in data inconsistency. Always ensure proper game logic is implemented
    before calling this method to prevent orphaned references or unexpected behavior.
