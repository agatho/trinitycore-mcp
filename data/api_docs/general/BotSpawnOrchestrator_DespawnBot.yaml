  class: BotSpawnOrchestrator
  method: DespawnBot
  signature: bool BotSpawnOrchestrator::DespawnBot(int guid, const int & reason)
documentation:
  brief: Despawns a bot with the specified GUID from the game world.
  description: The DespawnBot method removes a bot character from the game world using
    its unique identifier (GUID). This function is typically used by the BotSpawnOrchestrator
    class to manage the lifecycle of bot characters. The method accepts a reason code
    that indicates why the bot was despawned, which can be useful for logging or debugging
    purposes. The function returns true if the bot was successfully removed from the
    world, and false if the operation failed, such as when the GUID does not correspond
    to an active bot.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character to be despawned.
      This value must correspond to a valid bot in the game world.
  - name: reason
    description: An integer code indicating the reason for despawning the bot. Values
      may include 0 for normal cleanup, 1 for player logout, 2 for server shutdown,
      etc., depending on implementation.
  returns: Returns true if the bot was successfully despawned from the game world;
    otherwise returns false if the GUID is invalid or the bot could not be removed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of DespawnBot
    code: "if (botOrchestrator.DespawnBot(12345, 0)) {\n    std::cout << \"Bot successfully\
      \ despawned.\\n\";\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"Failed to despawn bot.\\n\"\
      ;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Despawning a bot with reason code
    code: "int reasonCode = 1; // Player logout\nif (botOrchestrator.DespawnBot(98765,\
      \ reasonCode)) {\n    LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"Bot despawned due to player logout.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot with the given GUID exists in the game world.
    It is recommended to verify the existence of the bot before calling this method
    to avoid unnecessary failures. The method may involve synchronization mechanisms
    depending on how bots are managed internally.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID can result in
    a failed operation and potential logging errors. Ensure that all GUIDs passed
    to this function are valid and correspond to active bots.
