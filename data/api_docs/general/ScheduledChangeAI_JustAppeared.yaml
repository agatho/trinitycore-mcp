documentation:
  brief: Initializes AI behavior when the creature first appears in the world
  description: The JustAppeared method is called when a creature's AI is first activated
    after being spawned or respawned. This method serves as an entry point for initializing
    AI-specific behaviors, setting up timers, or triggering initial actions that should
    occur immediately upon the creature's appearance. It is typically invoked during
    the creature's transition from inactive to active state within the game world.
    The method allows for custom AI logic to be executed once at spawn time, making
    it ideal for setup routines that shouldn't repeat during the creature's lifetime.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic AI Initialization
    code: "void ScheduledChangeAI::JustAppeared()\n{\n    // Set up initial AI state\n\
      \    me->SetReactState(REACT_PASSIVE);\n    // Schedule first behavior change\n\
      \    events.ScheduleEvent(EVENT_FIRST_BEHAVIOR, 5000);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called only once per creature instance during its initial
    appearance. It should not be used for periodic actions; instead, use event scheduling
    with the Events system for recurring behaviors.
