  signature: void VengeanceSoulFragmentManager::GenerateFragments(uint32 count)
documentation:
  brief: Generates soul fragments for vengeance mechanics based on specified count.
  description: The GenerateFragments method is responsible for creating soul fragments
    within the Vengeance system, typically used during player death or specific combat
    events. This method processes the input count to determine how many fragments
    should be created and distributed to the relevant player or entity. It integrates
    with the broader vengeance mechanics to track soul fragment accumulation and subsequent
    redemption. The method likely interacts with internal data structures that maintain
    fragment counts and player state information.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Fragment Generation
    code: 'VengeanceSoulFragmentManager manager;

      manager.GenerateFragments(5);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal player state and may trigger events
    or updates to the UI. It should only be called when appropriate vengeance conditions
    are met, such as during combat or after specific death scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context or validation may result in
    incorrect fragment accumulation or unexpected behavior in the vengeance system.
    Ensure that the count parameter is validated before execution.
