  signature: void SmartGameObjectAI::SpellHit(WorldObject * caster, const SpellInfo
    * spellInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Handles spell hit events for smart game objects, allowing custom behavior
    when a spell affects the object.
  description: The SpellHit method is invoked when a spell successfully hits the smart
    game object. This method serves as an event handler that enables developers to
    implement custom logic in response to spell interactions. It is part of the SmartGameObjectAI
    framework, which allows for dynamic and conditional AI behavior based on various
    game events. The method receives information about the caster and the spell details,
    enabling complex interactions such as triggering quests, modifying object states,
    or initiating special effects. This method is typically overridden in custom AI
    implementations to provide specific behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that cast the spell. This can be a player,
      creature, or any other game entity capable of casting spells.
  - name: spellInfo
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure containing detailed information
      about the spell that hit the object. Includes spell ID, effects, duration, and
      other spell properties.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Hit Implementation
    code: "void SmartGameObjectAI::SpellHit(WorldObject* caster, const SpellInfo*\
      \ spellInfo)\n{\n    if (spellInfo->Id == 12345) // Example spell ID\n    {\n\
      \        // Trigger custom behavior when specific spell hits the object\n  \
      \      DoAction(ACTION_SPELL_HIT);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Spell Hit with Caster Type Check
    code: "void SmartGameObjectAI::SpellHit(WorldObject* caster, const SpellInfo*\
      \ spellInfo)\n{\n    if (caster && caster->IsPlayer())\n    {\n        Player*\
      \ player = caster->ToPlayer();\n        if (spellInfo->Id == 67890)\n      \
      \  {\n            // Perform action only when a player casts the spell\n   \
      \         player->KilledMonsterCredit(12345);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during the spell's hit processing phase, so it should
    not perform heavy operations that could block the game loop. The SmartGameObjectAI
    framework handles the timing and dispatching of this event. Developers should
    ensure that any custom logic implemented in SpellHit does not interfere with the
    core spell mechanics or cause infinite loops.
  warnings: Avoid modifying the spell's behavior directly within this method, as it
    may lead to unexpected results. Also, be cautious when accessing the caster object,
    as it might be destroyed by the time the method executes if the caster is a temporary
    entity like a summoned creature.
