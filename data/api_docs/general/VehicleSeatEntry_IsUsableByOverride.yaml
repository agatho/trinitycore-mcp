  method: IsUsableByOverride
  signature: bool VehicleSeatEntry::IsUsableByOverride() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the vehicle seat entry is usable by override rules.
  description: The IsUsableByOverride method checks if a specific vehicle seat entry
    allows usage based on override conditions. This typically relates to whether the
    seat can be used regardless of normal restrictions, such as player class or level
    requirements. The method evaluates internal flags or settings within the VehicleSeatEntry
    structure to determine if override behavior is enabled for this particular seat.
    It is commonly used in vehicle interaction logic where certain seats may have
    special access rules that bypass standard validation checks.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the vehicle seat entry is usable by override rules, false
    otherwise. This indicates whether the seat's usage is permitted despite normal
    restrictions or requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a vehicle seat allows override usage
    code: "VehicleSeatEntry* seatEntry = sVehicleSeatStore.LookupEntry(12345);\nif\
      \ (seatEntry && seatEntry->IsUsableByOverride()) {\n    // Allow special access\
      \ to this vehicle seat\n    printf(\"Seat is usable by override rules\\n\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks internal flags or bitmasks within the VehicleSeatEntry
    structure that indicate override permissions. It may be used in conjunction with
    other vehicle-related APIs to determine seat accessibility during player boarding
    operations.
