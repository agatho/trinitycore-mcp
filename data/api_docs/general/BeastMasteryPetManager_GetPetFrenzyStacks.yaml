documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current number of Frenzy stacks on the beast mastery pet.
  description: The GetPetFrenzyStacks method returns the count of Frenzy buff stacks
    currently active on the player's beast mastery pet. This value is used in various
    game mechanics related to pet combat performance, such as damage multipliers and
    attack speed bonuses. The method does not modify any internal state and is read-only.
    It typically reflects the accumulation of Frenzy effects from abilities like Bestial
    Wrath or other sources that apply stacking buffs to the pet.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of active Frenzy stacks on the pet.
    Returns zero if no Frenzy effect is currently applied.
  examples:
  - title: Check Current Frenzy Stacks
    code: "uint32 frenzyStacks = petManager->GetPetFrenzyStacks();\nif (frenzyStacks\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Apply additional logic based on stack count\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Pet has %u Frenzy stacks.\", frenzyStacks);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a valid beast mastery pet exists and
    is under the player's control. The returned value may change dynamically during
    combat as buffs are applied or removed.
