documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new FollowAction instance for controlling NPC following behavior.
  description: The FollowAction constructor initializes a new instance of the FollowAction
    class, which is used to manage and control the following behavior of NPCs in World
    of Warcraft. This class is typically part of the AI system that governs how non-player
    characters interact with players or other entities. The constructor sets up internal
    state variables required for tracking follow targets, maintaining distance, and
    handling movement logic during the follow action. It prepares the action for execution
    within an AI context where NPCs may need to follow specific targets such as players
    or other creatures.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a FollowAction instance
    code: 'FollowAction* followAction = new FollowAction();

      // The instance is now ready to be used in AI logic

      // for controlling NPC following behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any immediate action; it only initializes
    the object state. Actual following behavior must be triggered through other methods
    such as StartFollow() or similar control functions. The FollowAction class is
    typically used within the context of AI decision trees and may require additional
    setup before being effective.
