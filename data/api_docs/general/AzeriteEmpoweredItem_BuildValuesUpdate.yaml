  class: AzeriteEmpoweredItem
  method: BuildValuesUpdate
  signature: void AzeriteEmpoweredItem::BuildValuesUpdate(int * data, int flags, const
    int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Populates update data for an azerite empowered item with its current state
    and properties.
  description: The BuildValuesUpdate method constructs and fills update data for an
    AzeriteEmpoweredItem, preparing it for network transmission to clients. This method
    is typically invoked during packet construction or when sending updates about
    the item's state, such as its azerite powers, levels, or progress. It ensures
    that client-side representations of the item accurately reflect its current properties
    and progression within the game world. The method operates on pre-allocated memory
    buffers provided via the 'data' parameter, using flags to determine what aspects
    of the item should be included in the update.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array where the update data will be written.
      This buffer must be pre-allocated with sufficient space to hold all required
      fields for the item's update packet.
  - name: flags
    description: Integer flags that determine which parts of the item's state should
      be included in the update. These flags typically correspond to specific data
      fields or sections of the azerite item's properties.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer array specifying the target location within
      the data buffer where updates should be written. This allows for more precise
      control over how data is structured in memory during updates.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int updateData[100];

      int flags = 0x01;

      int target[5] = {0};

      item->BuildValuesUpdate(updateData, flags, target);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple Flags
    code: 'int updateBuffer[200];

      int combinedFlags = AzeriteEmpoweredItem::UPDATE_FLAG_POWER_LEVEL | AzeriteEmpoweredItem::UPDATE_FLAG_PROGRESS;

      int targetOffset[3] = {10, 20, 30};

      item->BuildValuesUpdate(updateBuffer, combinedFlags, targetOffset);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal update system for azerite empowered items
    in TrinityCore. It assumes that the item has already been initialized and contains
    valid data. The memory pointed to by 'data' must be large enough to accommodate
    all fields specified by the flags, otherwise buffer overflows may occur.
  warnings: Improperly setting the 'flags' parameter can lead to incomplete or incorrect
    updates being sent to clients. Always ensure that the target buffer is sufficiently
    sized based on the expected number of fields and their sizes when using this method.
