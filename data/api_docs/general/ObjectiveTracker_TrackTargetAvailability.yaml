  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: TrackTargetAvailability
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::TrackTargetAvailability(Player * bot, uint32 questId,
    uint32 targetId)
documentation:
  brief: Tracks the availability status of a quest target for a player bot.
  description: The TrackTargetAvailability method is used to monitor and record whether
    a specific quest target (identified by targetId) is available for a player bot
    to interact with. This functionality is typically employed in automated questing
    systems or AI-driven gameplay mechanics where the system needs to know if a target
    object, NPC, or item is accessible or visible to the player. The method likely
    updates internal tracking structures within the ObjectiveTracker to reflect the
    current state of the target's availability based on the provided quest context.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will track
      the target availability. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest for which the target availability
      is being tracked. Used to associate tracking data with specific quests.
  - name: targetId
    description: Identifier of the specific target (NPC, object, item) whose availability
      status is being monitored. Must correspond to a valid game entity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for tracking quest target availability
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Get reference to bot player

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      uint32 targetId = 67890;

      objectiveTracker->TrackTargetAvailability(bot, questId, targetId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger quest automation or objective tracking
    system. It may interact with internal data structures such as quest state caches
    or target visibility flags. The actual implementation details are not provided,
    but it's expected to update tracking state for the specified bot and quest combination.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player pointer is valid and that the questId
    and targetId correspond to existing game entities; otherwise, behavior may be
    undefined or cause errors in the tracking system.
