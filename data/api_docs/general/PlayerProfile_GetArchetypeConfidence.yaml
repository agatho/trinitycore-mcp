documentation:
  brief: Returns the confidence level of the player's archetype classification.
  description: The GetArchetypeConfidence method retrieves a floating-point value
    representing how confident the system is in the player's assigned archetype. This
    confidence score typically ranges from 0.0 (least confident) to 1.0 (most confident),
    indicating the reliability of the archetype assignment based on player behavior,
    class usage, and other statistical factors. The value can be used by game systems
    to determine whether to display archetype-specific content or to adjust classification
    accuracy over time.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the confidence level of
    the player's archetype classification. Values closer to 1.0 indicate higher confidence
    in the assigned archetype, while values near 0.0 suggest uncertainty or insufficient
    data for accurate classification.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float confidence = playerProfile->GetArchetypeConfidence();\nif (confidence\
      \ > 0.8f) {\n    // Player archetype is highly confident, safe to use archetype-specific\
      \ features\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Archetype Display
    code: "float confidence = playerProfile->GetArchetypeConfidence();\nif (confidence\
      \ >= 0.7f) {\n    // Show archetype-specific quest or reward\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Your role is confirmed as %s.\", GetArchetypeName().c_str());\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Show generic content or prompt for user input\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Role classification is uncertain. Please select your preferred role.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with archetype assignment logic
    and may be recalculated periodically based on player activity. The confidence
    value is not directly modifiable by the player and reflects internal game mechanics
    rather than user choice.
  warnings: Do not assume that a high confidence score always means the archetype
    is accurate for gameplay purposes; it only indicates how certain the system is
    about its classification. Additionally, this method may return inconsistent values
    if called during archetype re-evaluation periods.
