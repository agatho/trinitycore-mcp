documentation:
  brief: Destroys the ArenaTeamMgr instance and cleans up all associated arena team
    data.
  description: The ArenaTeamMgr destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up
    all resources associated with the arena team management system. When an ArenaTeamMgr
    instance is destroyed, it ensures that all active arena teams are properly terminated,
    memory is freed, and any pending operations are completed or canceled. This method
    is automatically invoked when the manager object goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted. The destructor typically handles cleanup tasks such as releasing references
    to arena team members, clearing internal data structures, and ensuring no dangling
    pointers remain in the system. In a TrinityCore context, this is crucial for maintaining
    server stability during shutdown or when reloading arena-related systems.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of ArenaTeamMgr instance
    code: "void CleanupArenaSystem()\n{\n    // ArenaTeamMgr is created locally\n\
      \    ArenaTeamMgr arenaMgr;\n    // When function ends, destructor is automatically\
      \ called\n    // All arena teams and resources are cleaned up here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called manually unless the object was dynamically
    allocated. TrinityCore typically manages ArenaTeamMgr lifecycle through global
    systems or singletons, so manual destruction is rare. The cleanup process may
    involve database operations to persist team data before destruction.
