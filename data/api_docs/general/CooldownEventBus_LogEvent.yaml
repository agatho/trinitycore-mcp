  class: CooldownEventBus
  method: LogEvent
  signature: void CooldownEventBus::LogEvent(const CooldownEvent & event, const std::string
    & action) const
documentation:
  brief: Logs a cooldown event with associated action string to the event bus.
  description: The LogEvent method records a cooldown event along with an action identifier
    into the CooldownEventBus. This method is typically used within World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework to track and manage cooldown-related events for abilities,
    spells, or items. The event data is stored internally for potential later retrieval
    or processing by other systems. It does not return any value and operates as a
    void function. The action parameter allows categorizing the type of cooldown event
    being logged, which can be useful for debugging, analytics, or gameplay logic
    implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The cooldown event object containing details about the event such
      as spell ID, caster, target, and cooldown duration.
  - name: action
    description: A string identifier describing the action associated with the cooldown
      event (e.g., 'cast', 'trigger', 'reset'). Used for categorization and filtering
      of events.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of LogEvent
    code: 'CooldownEvent cooldownEvent;

      cooldownEvent.spellId = 12345;

      cooldownEvent.casterGuid = 67890;

      cooldownEvent.duration = 3000;


      CooldownEventBus eventBus;

      eventBus.LogEvent(cooldownEvent, "cast");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system for tracking cooldowns in TrinityCore.
    It may be used internally by spell systems or cooldown managers to maintain consistency
    across different game mechanics. The internal storage mechanism and potential
    performance implications should be considered when logging high-frequency events.
