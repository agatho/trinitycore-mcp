  signature: int ReadyCheckHandler::GetSubscribedEvents() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the bitmask of events this handler is subscribed to
  description: The GetSubscribedEvents method retrieves the event subscription mask
    for the ReadyCheckHandler class. This bitmask defines which game events the handler
    will process, typically used in the context of player ready checks during group
    instances or raids. The returned value represents a combination of event flags
    that determine when the handler's callback functions should be invoked. In TrinityCore's
    event system, this method is crucial for proper event routing and ensures that
    the ready check functionality responds appropriately to relevant game events such
    as player joining/leaving groups, instance start/end, or other group-related triggers.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer bitmask representing the subscribed events. Each bit in the
    integer corresponds to a specific event type, allowing for multiple event subscriptions
    through bitwise OR operations. Common ready check related event flags might include
    group member changes, instance state transitions, or player status updates.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and inspect subscribed events
    code: "ReadyCheckHandler handler;\nint events = handler.GetSubscribedEvents();\n\
      if (events & GROUP_EVENT_MEMBER_LEFT)\n{\n    // Handle member left event\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the initialization or registration
    phase of event handlers in TrinityCore. The returned bitmask should be interpreted
    according to predefined event flag constants defined within the core's event system.
    The implementation likely uses bit manipulation for efficient event filtering
    and routing.
