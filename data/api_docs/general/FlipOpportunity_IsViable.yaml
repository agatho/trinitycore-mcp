  class: FlipOpportunity
  method: IsViable
  signature: bool FlipOpportunity::IsViable(uint64 minProfit, uint32 maxRisk) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a flip opportunity is viable based on minimum profit and
    maximum risk thresholds.
  description: 'The IsViable method evaluates if a given flip opportunity meets the
    specified criteria for profitability and risk. It checks whether the potential
    profit from the flip exceeds the minimum required profit threshold and whether
    the associated risk remains within the defined maximum risk limit. This method
    is typically used in trading or auction house systems where players or NPCs evaluate
    opportunities to ensure they are both profitable and acceptable in terms of risk.
    The evaluation considers internal state variables of the FlipOpportunity object,
    such as current bid prices, item values, and risk factors. Precondition: The FlipOpportunity
    object must be properly initialized with valid data before calling this method.'
  parameters:
  - name: minProfit
    description: The minimum acceptable profit threshold for the flip opportunity
      to be considered viable.
  - name: maxRisk
    description: The maximum allowable risk level for the flip opportunity to be considered
      viable.
  returns: Returns true if the flip opportunity meets or exceeds the minimum profit
    requirement and stays within the maximum risk limit; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "FlipOpportunity flip;\nbool viable = flip.IsViable(1000, 50);\nif (viable)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with the flip\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in Trading Logic
    code: "void EvaluateAndExecuteFlip(FlipOpportunity& opportunity)\n{\n    const\
      \ uint64 minProfit = 5000;\n    const uint32 maxRisk = 100;\n\n    if (opportunity.IsViable(minProfit,\
      \ maxRisk))\n    {\n        // Execute the trade\n        opportunity.Execute();\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Skip this opportunity\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Flip not viable.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state variables that must be set correctly
    prior to calling. Performance is generally fast, but repeated calls may impact
    performance in high-frequency trading scenarios. The method is thread-safe if
    the underlying FlipOpportunity object is not modified concurrently.
  warnings: Ensure that minProfit and maxRisk values are appropriate for your game's
    economy. Incorrect thresholds can lead to either too many or too few viable opportunities
    being selected, affecting gameplay balance.
