  method: SetScanRadius
  signature: void ObstacleAvoidanceManager::SetScanRadius(float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the scan radius used by the obstacle avoidance manager for detecting
    nearby obstacles.
  description: The SetScanRadius method configures the maximum distance at which the
    ObstacleAvoidanceManager will search for obstacles when calculating movement paths.
    This parameter directly affects how aggressively the AI avoids environmental hazards
    such as walls, furniture, or other solid objects. The scan radius determines the
    area around the unit's current position that is checked for potential collisions
    during pathfinding operations. Adjusting this value can impact both the responsiveness
    of obstacle avoidance and performance, as larger radii require more computational
    resources to evaluate.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ObstacleAvoidanceManager* manager = unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetObstacleAvoidanceManager();

      manager->SetScanRadius(5.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting for Different Unit Types
    code: "if (unit->GetTypeId() == TYPEID_UNIT)\n{\n    if (unit->ToCreature()->GetCreatureTemplate()->UnitFlags\
      \ & UNIT_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE)\n        manager->SetScanRadius(3.0f);\n    else\n\
      \        manager->SetScanRadius(8.0f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not immediately affect existing path calculations; it only
    changes the parameter used for future obstacle detection. The scan radius should
    be set appropriately based on the unit's size and movement characteristics to
    balance between collision avoidance effectiveness and performance.
