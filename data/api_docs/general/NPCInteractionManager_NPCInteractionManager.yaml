  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: NPCInteractionManager
  signature: void NPCInteractionManager::NPCInteractionManager(Player * bot, BotAI
    * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new NPC interaction manager instance with the specified player
    bot and AI context.
  description: The NPCInteractionManager constructor initializes a new instance of
    the NPC interaction manager class. It takes a Player pointer representing the
    bot character and a BotAI pointer for the artificial intelligence context. This
    method sets up internal state variables required for managing NPC interactions,
    such as tracking current target NPCs, interaction states, and AI behavior flags.
    The initialization process ensures that the manager is properly configured to
    handle various NPC-related activities including gossip options, quest interactions,
    and vendor transactions within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character that
      will interact with NPCs. Must not be null.
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI object providing artificial intelligence context
      for the bot's NPC interactions. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic NPC Interaction Manager Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get player bot instance

      BotAI* myAI = ...;   // Get AI instance

      NPCInteractionManager interactionManager(myBot, myAI);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using NPC Interaction Manager in Bot Context
    code: "class MyBot : public Player\n{\npublic:\n    void InitializeNPCInteraction()\n\
      \    {\n        BotAI* ai = new BotAI(this);\n        NPCInteractionManager*\
      \ npcManager = new NPCInteractionManager(this, ai);\n        // Use npcManager\
      \ for NPC interactions\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The manager
    assumes ownership of the provided AI object and will manage its lifecycle. It
    is recommended to initialize this manager after the player bot has been fully
    constructed and added to the world.
  warnings: Passing null pointers for either parameter will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure both parameters are valid before calling this constructor.
    The manager does not perform any validation on the input objects beyond checking
    for null values.
