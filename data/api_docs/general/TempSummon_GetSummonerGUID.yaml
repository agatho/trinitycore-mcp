  class: TempSummon
  method: GetSummonerGUID
  signature: int TempSummon::GetSummonerGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the summoner who created this temporary
    summon.
  description: The GetSummonerGUID method retrieves the globally unique identifier
    of the entity that summoned this TempSummon instance. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework, summons are typically created by players or creatures using spell effects,
    and this method allows access to the original summoner's GUID for tracking purposes.
    The returned value represents a 32-bit integer identifier that uniquely identifies
    the summoner within the game world. This method is commonly used in AI scripts
    and summon-related logic to determine which entity is responsible for creating
    a particular summoned creature.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the summoner who created this temporary
    summon. Returns 0 if no summoner exists or if the summon was not created through
    normal summoning mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check summoner
    code: "void MySummonAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* summoner = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*me,\
      \ m_summonerGUID))\n    {\n        // Perform actions based on summoner\n  \
      \      DoCast(summoner, SPELL_SUMMON_AURA);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GetSummonerGUID in summon cleanup
    code: "void TemporarySummon::JustDied()\n{\n    uint32 summonerGUID = GetSummonerGUID();\n\
      \    if (summonerGUID)\n    {\n        // Notify the summoner that their summon\
      \ has died\n        if (Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(summonerGUID))\n\
      \        {\n            player->SendNotification(\"Your summon has been destroyed.\"\
      );\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the TempSummon was created through standard summoning
    mechanics. The GUID returned is a 32-bit integer value used internally by TrinityCore's
    object management system. It's important to note that some summoned creatures
    might not have a valid summoner, particularly if they were spawned directly rather
    than summoned via spell effects.
  warnings: The method returns 0 when no summoner exists, which could lead to unexpected
    behavior if not properly checked. Always validate the returned GUID before using
    it for object lookups, as invalid GUIDs can cause crashes or undefined behavior
    in TrinityCore's object accessor system.
