documentation:
  brief: Resets the difficulty curve data to its default state
  description: The Reset method clears all currently loaded difficulty curve data
    and restores the DifficultyCurve object to its initial state. This method is typically
    used when switching between different difficulty levels or when reloading configuration
    data. The reset operation ensures that any previously cached values or computed
    metrics are cleared, allowing fresh data to be loaded subsequently. This is particularly
    important in dynamic difficulty adjustment systems where curve parameters may
    change based on player progression or game events.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset Difficulty Curve
    code: 'DifficultyCurve curve;

      curve.Reset(); // Clears all current difficulty data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before loading new difficulty curve configurations
    to ensure no stale data remains in memory. The reset operation is lightweight
    and does not involve disk I/O or network requests.
