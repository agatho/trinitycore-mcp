  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BlackMarketMgr class
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the BlackMarketMgr
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the black market manager exists throughout
    the game server. This method is used to access the global black market functionality,
    including managing black market auctions, item listings, and related game mechanics.
    The returned pointer provides access to all black market operations and data structures
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single BlackMarketMgr instance. Returns nullptr if the
    instance has not been initialized yet, though this scenario should not occur in
    normal operation as the singleton is typically initialized during server startup.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Black Market Manager
    code: "BlackMarketMgr* bmMgr = BlackMarketMgr::Instance();\nif (bmMgr)\n{\n  \
      \  // Use the black market manager\n    bmMgr->Update();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Auction Status
    code: "BlackMarketMgr* bmMgr = BlackMarketMgr::Instance();\nif (bmMgr && bmMgr->IsEnabled())\n\
      {\n    uint32 auctionCount = bmMgr->GetAuctionCount();\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Active black market auctions: %u\", auctionCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows standard singleton pattern conventions. The BlackMarketMgr
    instance is typically initialized during server startup and remains valid for
    the duration of the server's operation. Developers should not attempt to create
    or destroy instances manually as this would violate the singleton principle.
  warnings: Do not assume the returned pointer is always valid - although rare, it
    could return nullptr if called before the singleton has been properly initialized.
    Avoid calling this method in early server initialization phases where the manager
    might not be ready yet.
