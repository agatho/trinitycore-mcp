  method: AddChildTerrain
  signature: void TerrainInfo::AddChildTerrain(std::shared_ptr<TerrainInfo> childTerrain)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a child terrain to this terrain instance for hierarchical terrain management.
  description: The AddChildTerrain method is used to establish a parent-child relationship
    between TerrainInfo objects within the TrinityCore world system. This method allows
    for organizing terrain data in a hierarchical structure, which is essential for
    managing complex world environments such as continents, zones, or sub-zones. The
    child terrain inherits properties from its parent and can be traversed or queried
    through the parent's interface. This functionality supports efficient terrain
    loading, unloading, and spatial queries during gameplay. The method does not perform
    any validation on the input parameter, so it is expected that the caller ensures
    the provided childTerrain is a valid and properly initialized TerrainInfo object.
  parameters:
  - name: childTerrain
    description: A shared pointer to the TerrainInfo object that will be added as
      a child to this terrain instance. This parameter must not be null, otherwise
      undefined behavior may occur.
  returns: None. This method performs an action and does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of AddChildTerrain
    code: 'std::shared_ptr<TerrainInfo> parentTerrain = std::make_shared<TerrainInfo>();

      std::shared_ptr<TerrainInfo> childTerrain = std::make_shared<TerrainInfo>();

      parentTerrain->AddChildTerrain(childTerrain);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding multiple child terrains in a loop
    code: "std::shared_ptr<TerrainInfo> parentTerrain = std::make_shared<TerrainInfo>();\n\
      for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)\n{\n    std::shared_ptr<TerrainInfo> childTerrain\
      \ = std::make_shared<TerrainInfo>();\n    parentTerrain->AddChildTerrain(childTerrain);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal data structure of the TerrainInfo object
    by adding a new child reference. It is recommended to ensure that the child terrain
    has been properly initialized before calling this method. The method assumes thread
    safety for the shared_ptr operations, but external synchronization may be required
    if multiple threads access the same parent terrain concurrently.
  warnings: Passing a null shared_ptr to this method will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always validate that the childTerrain parameter is not null
    before calling AddChildTerrain. Also, be cautious of circular references when
    establishing parent-child relationships between TerrainInfo objects.
