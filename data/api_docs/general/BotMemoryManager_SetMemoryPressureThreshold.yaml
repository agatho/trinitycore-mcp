  class: BotMemoryManager
  method: SetMemoryPressureThreshold
  signature: void BotMemoryManager::SetMemoryPressureThreshold(double threshold)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the memory pressure threshold for bot memory management.
  description: The SetMemoryPressureThreshold method configures the memory pressure
    level at which the BotMemoryManager will begin taking action to reduce memory
    usage. This threshold determines when bots will start releasing cached data, clearing
    unnecessary references, or performing other memory optimization tasks. The value
    is typically expressed as a ratio or percentage of available system memory that
    triggers memory pressure conditions. This method allows administrators and developers
    to fine-tune bot memory behavior based on server resources and performance requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: threshold
    description: A double value representing the memory pressure threshold. Values
      typically range from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 indicates no memory pressure and
      1.0 represents maximum memory pressure. Higher values indicate that bots will
      respond to memory pressure earlier.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Memory Pressure Threshold
    code: 'BotMemoryManager* memoryManager = BotMemoryManager::Instance();

      memoryManager->SetMemoryPressureThreshold(0.75); // Trigger at 75% memory usage'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Memory Pressure for Low-Resource Servers
    code: 'BotMemoryManager* memoryManager = BotMemoryManager::Instance();

      // Configure for servers with limited memory

      memoryManager->SetMemoryPressureThreshold(0.60); // Trigger at 60% memory usage'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects bot behavior during high memory usage scenarios.
    The threshold value should be carefully chosen based on server hardware specifications
    and expected bot load. Changes to this setting take effect immediately without
    requiring a server restart.
  warnings: Setting the threshold too low may cause bots to aggressively release memory,
    potentially degrading performance due to frequent cache misses. Setting it too
    high might delay necessary memory cleanup until critical system resources are
    consumed.
