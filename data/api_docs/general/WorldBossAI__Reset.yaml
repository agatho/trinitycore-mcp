documentation:
  brief: Resets the WorldBossAI state to its initial conditions.
  description: The _Reset method is used to restore a WorldBossAI instance to its
    default state, clearing any active timers, resetting combat status, and preparing
    the AI for a new encounter. This method is typically invoked when a boss fight
    concludes or needs to be restarted, ensuring that all internal AI flags, cooldowns,
    and event tracking are properly cleared. It serves as a core part of the AI lifecycle
    management within TrinityCore's boss encounter framework.

    code: "void BossAI::JustDied()\n{\n    // Perform cleanup and reset\n    _Reset();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the AI system during boss encounter
    lifecycle events. Developers should not call this method directly unless implementing
    custom AI logic that requires explicit state resets.
