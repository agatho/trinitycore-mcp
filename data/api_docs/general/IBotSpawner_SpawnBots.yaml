  brief: Spawns a specified number of AI-controlled bots into the game world
  description: The SpawnBots method is responsible for creating and initializing AI-controlled
    player bots within the TrinityCore emulation environment. This method accepts
    a request count parameter that determines how many bots should be spawned. The
    spawning process involves allocating bot characters, setting up their AI behavior,
    and integrating them into the active world state. Bots are typically used for
    testing, development, or providing additional NPC presence in areas with low player
    activity. The method ensures proper initialization of bot attributes, including
    health, mana, equipment, and AI decision-making systems.
  parameters:
  - name: requests
    description: The number of bots to spawn. Must be a non-negative integer value
      representing the desired quantity of AI-controlled characters to create in the
      game world.
  returns: Returns the actual number of bots successfully spawned. This value may
    be less than the requested count if resource limitations or other constraints
    prevent full fulfillment of the request.
  examples:
  - title: Spawn 5 Bots
    code: 'uint32 spawned = botSpawner->SpawnBots(5);

      // Spawns exactly 5 bots if possible, returns actual count spawned'
    language: cpp
  - title: Spawn Bots with Error Handling
    code: "int requestCount = 10;\nuint32 actualSpawned = botSpawner->SpawnBots(requestCount);\n\
      if (actualSpawned < static_cast<uint32>(requestCount)) {\n    // Handle partial\
      \ spawn due to resource constraints\n    sLog->outString(\"Warning: Only %u\
      \ of %d requested bots were spawned\", actualSpawned, requestCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the context of TrinityCore's bot system and requires
    that the bot subsystem is properly initialized. The spawning process may be subject
    to server resource limitations such as memory allocation or maximum concurrent
    character limits. For performance reasons, large batch spawns should be avoided
    during peak server activity.
  warnings: Calling this method with extremely high values may cause server performance
    degradation or resource exhaustion. Ensure that bot spawning does not exceed server
    capacity limits or violate game balance rules. The method may silently fail to
    spawn all requested bots under resource constraints.
