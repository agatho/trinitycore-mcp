  class: Unit
  method: SetShapeshiftForm
  signature: void Unit::SetShapeshiftForm(int form)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the shapeshift form of the unit to the specified form.
  description: This method allows a unit (such as a player or creature) to change
    into a specific shapeshift form, which can be used for various gameplay mechanics
    including combat, stealth, and special abilities. The form parameter determines
    the type of shapeshift, with different forms corresponding to different visual
    states like cat, bear, wolf, etc. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with other shapeshift-related functions to manage the unit's transformation state
    during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: form
    description: The shapeshift form to set, ranging from 0 to 11. Form 0 represents
      the default state (no shapeshift), while forms 1-11 correspond to various shapeshift
      types including cat, bear, wolf, and others. The exact values depend on the
      game mechanics and player class.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetShapeshiftForm(1); // Set to cat form'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the unit is in a valid state for shapeshifting.
    The implementation typically involves updating the unit's visual appearance and
    associated stats, but does not directly affect combat behavior unless specified
    by game rules.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect visual representation
    or gameplay issues. It should only be called when the unit is allowed to change
    forms, such as during player class abilities or creature transformation mechanics.
