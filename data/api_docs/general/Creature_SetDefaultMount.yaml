  method: SetDefaultMount
  signature: void Creature::SetDefaultMount(int mountCreatureDisplayId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the default mount for a creature based on the provided display ID.
  description: This method configures a creature's default mount by specifying the
    creature display ID that represents the mount. It is used to set the visual appearance
    of a creature when it is mounted, typically in scenarios where the creature needs
    to be visually represented as a mounted entity. The method operates on the creature's
    display information and affects how the creature appears when mounted.
  parameters:
  - name: mountCreatureDisplayId
    description: The creature display ID that represents the mount. This value determines
      the visual appearance of the mounted creature and must correspond to a valid
      mount display in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Default Mount for Creature
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetDefaultMount(12345);

      // Sets the creature''s mount to display ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during creature initialization or when setting
    up specific game events. It may require the creature to be in a valid state before
    applying the mount, and should be called after the creature has been initialized
    with proper data.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to visual glitches or incorrect display
    behavior. Ensure that the provided display ID corresponds to a valid mount entry
    in the game database to avoid errors.
