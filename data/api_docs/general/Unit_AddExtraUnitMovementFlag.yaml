  brief: Adds extra movement flags to a unit's movement data.
  description: This method adds additional movement flags to a unit's internal movement
    data structure, allowing for enhanced control over unit movement behavior. It
    is commonly used in conjunction with other movement-related methods to modify
    how units move within the game world. The method typically affects the unit's
    movement state and can be used to enable specific movement types or behaviors
    that are not normally available.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* targetUnit = GetUnit();\nif (targetUnit)\n{\n    targetUnit->AddExtraUnitMovementFlag(MOVEMENTFLAG_WALKING);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the movement system in TrinityCore and should be used
    carefully to avoid unexpected behavior. It may interact with other movement flags
    and can affect how units are handled during movement updates.
  warnings: Using this method without proper understanding of movement flags can lead
    to incorrect unit behavior or movement anomalies. Care should be taken when applying
    flags that modify movement type.
