documentation:
  brief: Executes emergency defensive abilities for a Protection Paladin during high-threat
    situations.
  description: The HandleEmergencyDefensives method is responsible for activating
    emergency defensive cooldowns and abilities specific to the Protection Paladin
    specialization. This method typically triggers when the player's threat level
    or health drops below critical thresholds, allowing the paladin to automatically
    respond with defensive actions such as Divine Shield, Hand of Protection, or other
    emergency mitigation spells. The implementation evaluates current combat state,
    available resources, and cooldown status before executing any defensive measures.
    It is designed to provide automated protection during intense combat scenarios
    where manual input may be too slow or impossible.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void MyPaladinAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (IsInCombat() && GetHealthPct()\
      \ < 30)\n        HandleEmergencyDefensives();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the paladin is actively engaged in
    combat and under immediate threat. The implementation assumes that all necessary
    checks for spell availability and cooldowns have been performed prior to calling
    this function. Performance-wise, it's recommended to call this method sparingly
    during high-frequency AI updates to avoid unnecessary processing overhead.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat situations as it may trigger
    defensive abilities that are not intended for use in non-combat scenarios. The
    method assumes proper threat management and should not be used as a substitute
    for proper combat positioning or spell management.
