  brief: Handles the death event for a player in the DeathRecoveryManager system
  description: The OnDeath method is invoked when a player character dies within the
    TrinityCore framework. This method manages the death recovery process, which typically
    includes saving the player's state, handling resurrection mechanics, and potentially
    triggering related events or callbacks. The method is part of the DeathRecoveryManager
    class that oversees player death-related logic and ensures proper cleanup and
    restoration procedures are followed during character death scenarios.

    code: "void Player::HandleDeath()\n{\n    // Called when player dies\n    sDeathRecoveryManager->OnDeath();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core game loop when a player's
    health reaches zero. It may be overridden or extended in custom modules to implement
    specialized death recovery behaviors.
