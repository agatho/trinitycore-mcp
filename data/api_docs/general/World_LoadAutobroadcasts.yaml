documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes the autobroadcast messages from the database into memory
    for use in the world server.
  description: The LoadAutobroadcasts method is responsible for retrieving all configured
    autobroadcast messages from the database table and loading them into memory for
    efficient access during runtime. This method is typically called during server
    startup or when the configuration changes, ensuring that all defined broadcast
    messages are available for periodic delivery to players. The loaded messages are
    usually stored in a container or cache within the World class, allowing for quick
    retrieval and dispatch based on configured intervals. This functionality supports
    server administrators in sending automated announcements, events, or important
    information to players without requiring manual intervention.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::Initialize()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n    LoadAutobroadcasts();\n\
      \    // Continue with other startup procedures\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked during the world server's initialization phase.
    It assumes that the database connection is already established and functional.
    The loaded autobroadcasts are typically cached in memory for fast access, reducing
    database query overhead during runtime.
