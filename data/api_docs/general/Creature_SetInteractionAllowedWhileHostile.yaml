  method: SetInteractionAllowedWhileHostile
  signature: void Creature::SetInteractionAllowedWhileHostile(bool interactionAllowed)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether creature interaction is allowed while hostiles are active.
  description: This method controls whether a creature can be interacted with when
    it is in a hostile state. When set to true, the creature allows interaction even
    while hostiles are active; when set to false, interaction is disabled during hostile
    states. This functionality is crucial for managing NPC behavior during combat
    and player interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: interactionAllowed
    description: A boolean value indicating whether interaction should be allowed
      while the creature is hostile. True enables interaction, false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetInteractionAllowedWhileHostile(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Creature* creature = GetCreature();\nif (creature)\n{\n    creature->SetInteractionAllowedWhileHostile(false);\n\
      }\n// This prevents player interaction during combat\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the creature's behavior in hostile state and should be
    used carefully during combat situations. Implementation details include how this
    setting interacts with the creature's AI state and player interaction flags.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to unexpected behavior during combat,
    including potential denial of interaction or incorrect NPC behavior. Use only
    when necessary.
