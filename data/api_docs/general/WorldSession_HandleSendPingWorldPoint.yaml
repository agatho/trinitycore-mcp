documentation:
  brief: Processes a ping world point packet sent by the client to indicate a player's
    position in the world.
  description: The HandleSendPingWorldPoint method is responsible for handling incoming
    SendPingWorldPoint packets from players. These packets are typically sent when
    a player clicks on a location in the world map or uses a ping functionality to
    share their current position with party members or group mates. The method processes
    the received packet data and may trigger appropriate game mechanics such as updating
    player positions, broadcasting location information, or initiating related actions
    like quest tracking updates or coordinate sharing. This method is part of the
    WorldSession class which manages all communication between a connected client
    and the server.
  parameters:
  - name: pingWorldPoint
    description: The incoming SendPingWorldPoint packet containing position data and
      player context information from the client.

  - title: Basic packet handling example
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSendPingWorldPoint(const WorldPackets::Party::SendPingWorldPoint\
      \ & pingWorldPoint)\n{\n    // Process the ping world point data\n    if (Player*\
      \ player = GetPlayer())\n    {\n        // Log the ping location\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Player %s pinged world point at: %.2f, %.2f, %.2f\", \n                    \
      \   player->GetName().c_str(), \n                       pingWorldPoint.X, \n\
      \                       pingWorldPoint.Y, \n                       pingWorldPoint.Z);\n\
      \    }\n}"

  notes: This method is typically invoked during normal gameplay when players interact
    with the world map UI. It's important to note that this packet can be sent by
    any player regardless of their party status, but the server may filter or process
    it differently based on group membership and permissions.
