  signature: bool InterruptDatabase::IsQuickResponseRequired(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell interrupt requires an immediate response based
    on its ID.
  description: The IsQuickResponseRequired method checks if a specific spell interrupt,
    identified by its spell ID, necessitates an immediate reaction from the game system.
    This typically applies to high-priority interrupts such as those that break important
    buffs or debuffs, or those that have time-sensitive effects. The method evaluates
    internal database entries and game mechanics rules to determine if the interrupt
    should be processed with priority over standard execution order. It is commonly
    used in combat systems where timing and responsiveness are critical for gameplay
    balance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell interrupt requires a quick response,
    indicating it should be handled immediately; otherwise returns false if normal
    processing order is acceptable.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (interruptDB.IsQuickResponseRequired(12345)) {\n    // Handle this interrupt\
      \ with priority\n    ProcessInterruptImmediately();\n} else {\n    // Normal\
      \ processing\n    ProcessInterruptStandard();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal spell data tables and may involve database
    lookups. It's recommended to cache results for frequently checked spell IDs to
    improve performance in high-frequency interrupt scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell ID passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an actual interrupt spell, as invalid IDs could lead to unexpected behavior
    or performance issues.
