  class: StartupSpawnOrchestrator
  method: GetMetrics
  signature: OrchestratorMetrics StartupSpawnOrchestrator::GetMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves comprehensive metrics and performance data from the startup spawn
    orchestrator.
  description: The GetMetrics method returns an OrchestratorMetrics object containing
    detailed statistics and performance indicators related to the startup spawn process.
    This includes information about spawned creatures, game objects, and timing data
    that helps monitor and optimize the server's initialization sequence. The returned
    metrics are essential for diagnosing performance bottlenecks during server startup
    and ensuring proper resource allocation. The method is typically called during
    server status checks or diagnostic routines to evaluate how efficiently the spawn
    orchestrator is managing entity creation.
  parameters: []
  returns: An OrchestratorMetrics object containing key performance indicators such
    as spawn counts, timing data, and resource usage metrics collected during the
    startup spawn process. The object provides insights into how many entities were
    spawned, how long the process took, and other relevant operational statistics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Spawn Metrics
    code: "OrchestratorMetrics metrics = sStartupSpawnOrchestrator->GetMetrics();\n\
      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_SERVER, \"Spawned %u creatures and %u game objects in\
      \ %.2f seconds\", \n           metrics.creatureCount, metrics.gameObjectCount,\
      \ metrics.spawnTime);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and should not block execution
    for extended periods. The returned metrics object is immutable and safe to access
    from multiple threads. It's recommended to cache the result if frequent access
    is needed, as recomputing metrics may involve some overhead.
  warnings: The metrics returned by this method reflect data collected up until the
    point of invocation. If the spawn process is still ongoing when called, the results
    may not represent the final state of the system. Avoid calling this method in
    performance-critical sections without considering potential overhead.
