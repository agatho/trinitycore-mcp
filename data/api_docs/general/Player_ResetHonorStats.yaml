  brief: Resets the player's honor points and honor kills for the current week.
  description: The ResetHonorStats method clears all honor-related statistics for
    the player, including honor points, honor kills, and any associated honor rewards.
    This method effectively resets the player's weekly honor progression to zero,
    allowing them to start fresh with honor points and kills. It is typically used
    when players want to reset their honor status or when a new week begins in the
    game. The method does not affect the player's overall honor points or reputation,
    only the weekly statistics.

  notes: This method is typically called during weekly reset events or when players
    manually reset their honor stats. The implementation involves clearing internal
    honor-related variables and updating the player's honor status in the database.
