documentation:
  brief: Destroys the PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface instance and cleans up associated
    resources.
  description: The destructor for the PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface class is responsible
    for releasing any allocated memory and cleaning up internal resources when an
    instance of this class is being destroyed. This method ensures proper resource
    management and prevents memory leaks within the player bot character database
    interface subsystem. The destructor typically handles cleanup of database connections,
    cached data structures, or other resources that were initialized during the object's
    lifetime. In the context of TrinityCore's player bot system, this destructor plays
    a crucial role in maintaining stable performance and preventing resource exhaustion
    when bot instances are terminated or removed from the game world.

  - title: Automatic destruction of PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface instance
    code: "void CleanupBot()\n{\n    // When this function ends, the PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface\
      \ instance\n    // will be automatically destroyed via its destructor\n    PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface*\
      \ dbInterface = new PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface();\n    // ... use dbInterface\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor called automatically here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted. It's important to note that this destructor should not
    be called manually unless the object was allocated on the heap using 'new'. The
    implementation typically ensures thread-safe cleanup if multiple threads are involved
    in managing bot character data.
