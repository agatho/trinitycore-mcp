  signature: void QuestCompletion::HandleKillObjective(Player * bot, QuestObjectiveData
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Processes kill objectives for a player during quest completion.
  description: The HandleKillObjective method is responsible for managing and updating
    kill-based quest objectives when a player engages in combat and eliminates targets
    relevant to active quests. This method typically checks if the killed creature
    or NPC matches the requirements of a specific quest objective, updates the objective
    progress, and potentially triggers quest progression or completion events. It
    integrates with the broader quest system to ensure that players advance through
    quests by fulfilling kill-based criteria as defined in the quest data.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or player whose
      quest objectives are being processed.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing information
      about the specific kill objective that needs to be handled, including target
      type, count required, and other relevant parameters.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleKillObjective
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      QuestObjectiveData questObj = ...;

      questCompletion->HandleKillObjective(player, questObj);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the quest system when a player
    kills an NPC or creature. It assumes that the objective data has been properly
    initialized and validated before calling. The method may modify internal quest
    state and should be called only during appropriate game execution phases.
  warnings: Improper initialization of QuestObjectiveData can lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect quest progression. Ensure that all required fields in the objective
    are correctly populated before invoking this method.
