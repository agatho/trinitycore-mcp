  method: RemoveItemFlag
  signature: void Item::RemoveItemFlag(ItemFieldFlags flags)
documentation:
  brief: Removes specified item flags from the item's flag field.
  description: The RemoveItemFlag method removes one or more flags from an item's
    internal flag field. This operation modifies the item's properties by clearing
    specific bits within its flags field, which can affect how the item behaves in
    the game world. The method takes a bitmask of ItemFieldFlags and clears those
    bits from the item's current flags value. This is commonly used when items need
    to have certain properties disabled or when flag states are dynamically changed
    during gameplay. The operation directly modifies the item object's internal state.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: A bitmask of ItemFieldFlags that specifies which flags should be
      removed from the item. This parameter represents one or more flag values combined
      using bitwise OR operations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove enchantment flag from an item
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByGuid(itemGuid);\nif (item)\n{\n    item->RemoveItemFlag(ITEM_FIELD_FLAG_ENCHANTMENT);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove multiple flags from an item
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByGuid(itemGuid);\nif (item)\n{\n    uint32\
      \ flagsToRemove = ITEM_FIELD_FLAG_BROKEN | ITEM_FIELD_FLAG_LOCKED;\n    item->RemoveItemFlag(flagsToRemove);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the item's internal flag state. Changes made
    are not automatically persisted to the database unless explicitly saved. The method
    performs a bitwise AND operation with the inverse of the provided flags, effectively
    clearing those bits from the current flag value.
  warnings: Calling this method on an item that is currently equipped or in use may
    have unexpected behavior depending on how the removed flags affect the item's
    functionality. Always ensure proper synchronization when modifying item flags
    in multi-threaded environments.
