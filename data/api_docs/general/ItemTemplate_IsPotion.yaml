documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the item template represents a potion.
  description: The IsPotion method checks if the current item template is classified
    as a potion. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore database, items are categorized
    by their class and subclass. This method specifically evaluates whether the item's
    class is 'Consumable' (class ID 0) and its subclass is 'Potion' (subclass ID 1).
    The method returns true if both conditions are met, indicating that the item can
    be consumed to restore health or mana. This functionality is crucial for game
    mechanics such as inventory management, spell casting, and item usage logic within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item template represents a potion (i.e., class = 0
    and subclass = 1), otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nif (itemTemplate\
      \ && itemTemplate->IsPotion()) {\n    // Handle potion-specific logic\n    printf(\"\
      This is a potion item\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Inventory Filtering
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nfor (uint8 i = 0; i < MAX_INVENTORY_SLOT; ++i) {\n\
      \    Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0, i);\n    if (item\
      \ && item->GetTemplate()->IsPotion()) {\n        // Apply potion effect or display\
      \ in potion-only UI\n        printf(\"Found potion at slot %d\\n\", i);\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal item class and subclass values defined
    in the TrinityCore database. It does not consider enchantments or temporary modifiers
    that might change an item's behavior at runtime. The check is performed against
    static template data, making it fast and suitable for frequent calls during gameplay
    logic.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only checks the base item template classification.
    Items may be modified through enchantments or other game effects that could alter
    their actual functionality, but this method will still return based on the original
    template values.
