  brief: Initializes a new guild chat message object with default values.
  description: The GuildChatMessage constructor initializes a new instance of the
    GuildChatMessage class, setting up internal data structures and default state
    for handling guild chat communications. This method prepares the object for use
    in sending or receiving guild messages within the TrinityCore framework. The constructor
    ensures that all necessary member variables are properly initialized before the
    object can be used to interact with the guild chat system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new guild chat message
    code: 'GuildChatMessage msg;

      // The msg object is now ready to be used for guild chat operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any network communication or database access.
    It only initializes internal state. The actual sending or receiving of guild messages
    requires additional methods and proper context setup.
