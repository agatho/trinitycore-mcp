  class: BotThreatManager
  method: ModifyThreat
  signature: void BotThreatManager::ModifyThreat(Unit * target, float modifier)
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the threat level of a bot towards a specified target unit.
  description: The ModifyThreat method adjusts the threat value that a bot has toward
    a specific Unit target. This is commonly used in AI behavior to influence how
    aggressively a bot attacks or focuses on a particular enemy. The modifier parameter
    directly affects the threat amount, which can be positive (increasing threat)
    or negative (decreasing threat). This method interacts with the bot's threat management
    system and may affect its targeting decisions within the game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that represents the target unit for which
      threat is being modified. Must be a valid pointer to an existing Unit in the
      world.
  - name: modifier
    description: Float value representing the amount by which to modify the threat
      level. Positive values increase threat, negative values decrease it. The exact
      impact depends on internal threat calculations and scaling factors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Increase Threat Against Target
    code: "BotThreatManager* threatMgr = bot->GetThreatManager();\nUnit* target =\
      \ bot->GetVictim();\nif (target)\n{\n    threatMgr->ModifyThreat(target, 100.0f);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Reduce Threat to Prevent Aggro
    code: "BotThreatManager* threatMgr = bot->GetThreatManager();\nUnit* target =\
      \ bot->GetVictim();\nif (target)\n{\n    threatMgr->ModifyThreat(target, -50.0f);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly influences AI behavior
    and combat decisions. It's recommended to validate that the target is not null
    before calling this function. The actual threat change may be subject to internal
    scaling, cap limits, or other game mechanics.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid pointers can lead to undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the target unit is valid and alive when modifying threat. Excessive
    use of negative modifiers might cause unexpected targeting behavior in complex
    encounters.
