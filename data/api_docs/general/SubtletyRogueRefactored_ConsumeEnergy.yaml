  class: SubtletyRogueRefactored
  method: ConsumeEnergy
  signature: void SubtletyRogueRefactored::ConsumeEnergy(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes the specified amount of energy from the rogue's energy resource.
  description: The ConsumeEnergy method reduces the energy level of a Subtlety Rogue
    character by the given amount. This method is typically used when executing energy-based
    abilities such as Eviscerate, Backstab, or other stealth-based attacks that require
    energy expenditure. The energy consumption directly affects the rogue's ability
    to perform these actions and influences gameplay mechanics related to resource
    management. The method does not validate whether sufficient energy exists before
    consuming; it simply deducts the specified amount from the current energy pool.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of energy points to be consumed from the rogue's energy
      resource. Valid values are non-negative integers representing energy units.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Energy Consumption
    code: 'SubtletyRogueRefactored rogue;

      rogue.ConsumeEnergy(25); // Consumes 25 energy points'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Energy Consumption
    code: "SubtletyRogueRefactored* rogue = player->GetSubtletyRogue();\nif (rogue->HasSufficientEnergy(30))\
      \ {\n    rogue->ConsumeEnergy(30); // Consumes 30 energy points if available\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal energy state of the rogue. It
    should be used in conjunction with appropriate checks to ensure sufficient energy
    is available before calling, otherwise unexpected behavior may occur. The method
    assumes that the energy value passed is valid and does not perform bounds checking.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying energy availability may lead to
    negative energy values, which could cause undefined behavior or game-breaking
    issues. Always validate energy requirements before consumption.
