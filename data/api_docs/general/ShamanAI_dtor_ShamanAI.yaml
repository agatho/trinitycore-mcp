documentation:
  brief: Destroys a ShamanAI instance and performs necessary cleanup operations.
  description: The destructor for the ShamanAI class is responsible for cleaning up
    all resources associated with the shaman's AI behavior. This includes releasing
    any allocated memory, canceling active spells or abilities, and ensuring proper
    state management before the object is destroyed. In the context of TrinityCore's
    AI system, this method ensures that no dangling references or memory leaks occur
    when a shaman NPC's AI component is removed from the game world. The destructor
    typically handles cleanup tasks such as removing any ongoing spell effects, resetting
    AI state variables, and notifying the parent class or subsystems about the destruction
    event.

  - title: Automatic Destruction of ShamanAI Instance
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    // When this function ends, any local ShamanAI\
      \ instance will be automatically destroyed\n    if (shamanCreature)\n    {\n\
      \        ShamanAI* shamanAI = new ShamanAI(shamanCreature);\n        // ...\
      \ AI logic here ...\n        delete shamanAI; // Triggers destructor\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when a ShamanAI object goes out of
    scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to note that this method should
    not be called directly unless you have a specific reason, as it's part of the
    standard C++ object lifecycle management. The cleanup process may involve calling
    base class destructors and performing any necessary finalization tasks.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke this destructor unless you are implementing custom
    memory management or have a very specific use case. Calling it directly on stack-allocated
    objects will result in undefined behavior. Also, ensure that all references to
    the destroyed object are cleared to prevent dangling pointer issues.
