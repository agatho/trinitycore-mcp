  class: BotWorldSessionMgr
  method: RemovePlayerBot
  signature: void BotWorldSessionMgr::RemovePlayerBot(int playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a player bot associated with the given player GUID from the world
    session manager.
  description: The RemovePlayerBot method is responsible for removing a specific player
    bot from the BotWorldSessionMgr's internal tracking system. This method ensures
    that the bot is properly cleaned up and no longer managed by the session manager.
    It typically involves removing the bot from active sessions, clearing associated
    data structures, and potentially notifying other systems about the bot's removal.
    The method operates on a player GUID which uniquely identifies the bot within
    the game world. This functionality is essential for managing dynamic bot populations
    in player-versus-bot scenarios or when bots are destroyed or disconnected.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player bot to be removed from
      the session manager. This value must correspond to a valid existing bot within
      the system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a specific player bot by GUID
    code: 'BotWorldSessionMgr* sessionMgr = BotWorldSessionMgr::instance();

      uint32 botGuid = 12345;

      sessionMgr->RemovePlayerBot(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs cleanup operations such as removing the bot from
    internal data structures, invalidating session references, and potentially triggering
    additional cleanup routines. It should be called when a player bot is no longer
    needed or has been destroyed.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent playerGuid may result
    in undefined behavior or errors. Ensure that the GUID corresponds to an actual
    bot before invoking this method.
