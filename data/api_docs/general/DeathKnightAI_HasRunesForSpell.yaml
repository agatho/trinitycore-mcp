documentation:
  brief: Checks if the Death Knight has sufficient runes available to cast a specified
    spell.
  description: The HasRunesForSpell method evaluates whether the Death Knight AI character
    possesses enough rune resources to execute a given spell. This method is crucial
    for proper spell selection and execution logic within the Death Knight's AI behavior.
    It typically checks the availability of Blood, Frost, and Unholy runes required
    by the specified spell. The method does not modify any state but provides a boolean
    result indicating resource sufficiency. This check is essential to prevent invalid
    spell casting attempts that would otherwise fail in-game due to insufficient rune
    resources.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Death Knight has sufficient runes to cast the specified
    spell, false otherwise. The method returns false when the spell requires more
    runes than are currently available or when the spell ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (ai->HasRunesForSpell(SPELL_DEATH_COIL))\n{\n    // Execute Death Coil\n\
      \    ai->CastSpell(SPELL_DEATH_COIL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spell Casting with Rune Check
    code: "if (ai->HasRunesForSpell(SPELL_BLOOD_BOIL) && ai->GetHealthPct() < 50)\n\
      {\n    // Cast Blood Boil when health is low and runes are available\n    ai->CastSpell(SPELL_BLOOD_BOIL);\n\
      }\nelse if (ai->HasRunesForSpell(SPELL_FROST_STRIKE))\n{\n    // Fallback to\
      \ Frost Strike if Blood Boil not viable\n    ai->CastSpell(SPELL_FROST_STRIKE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal rune tracking system of the Death Knight
    AI. It assumes that runes are properly managed and updated by the AI framework.
    The method may be called frequently during combat decision-making, so performance
    is optimized for quick evaluation. It does not account for rune regeneration timing
    or cooldowns, only current rune availability.
  warnings: This method should not be used as the sole determinant for spell casting
    decisions in complex scenarios where rune regeneration timing is important. Always
    ensure that the spell ID passed to this method corresponds to a valid Death Knight
    spell. Calling this method with an invalid spell ID may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect return values.
