  method: begin
  signature: const_iterator BossBoundaryData::begin() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant iterator pointing to the beginning of the boss boundary
    data collection.
  description: The begin() method provides access to the start of the BossBoundaryData
    collection by returning a const_iterator. This allows read-only traversal of the
    boundary data elements stored within the class. The returned iterator can be used
    in range-based for loops or standard iterator operations to access each element
    in the collection. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this method
    is typically used when iterating over boss encounter boundaries or trigger zones
    defined for a specific encounter. The method does not modify any internal state
    and is safe to call from const contexts.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const_iterator pointing to the first element in the BossBoundaryData
    collection. If the collection is empty, the returned iterator will be equal to
    the end() iterator.
  examples:
  - title: Basic iteration through boss boundary data
    code: "for (const auto& boundary : bossData)\n{\n    // Process each boundary\
      \ element\n    std::cout << \"Boundary ID: \" << boundary.GetId() << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using begin() with explicit iterator usage
    code: "auto it = bossData.begin();\nwhile (it != bossData.end())\n{\n    ProcessBoundary(*it);\n\
      \    ++it;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with end() to define a range
    for iteration. The returned const_iterator ensures that the data cannot be modified
    through this interface, maintaining data integrity during read operations. Performance-wise,
    this operation is O(1) as it simply returns an internal pointer or index.
