  brief: Constructs a loot distribution plan for items in the trade manager's current
    loot context
  description: The BuildLootDistributionPlan method generates a structured distribution
    plan for loot items within the TradeManager's current context. This method processes
    the active loot distribution and prepares it for evaluation by the trading system,
    determining how items should be allocated among participants based on established
    rules and priorities. The method typically operates within the framework of World
    of Warcraft's auction house and trade mechanics, ensuring proper item allocation
    according to player preferences and game rules. It is designed to be called during
    the loot distribution phase of a trade or auction process.

  - title: Basic Usage in Trade Context
    code: 'TradeManager* tradeMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetTradeManager();

      LootDistribution distribution;

      tradeMgr->BuildLootDistributionPlan(distribution);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the trading system when processing
    loot distributions. Developers should ensure that the LootDistribution object
    passed to this method has been properly initialized with relevant loot data before
    calling this function.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the LootDistribution
    parameter may result in undefined behavior or incorrect loot allocation. The method
    assumes valid trade context and should only be called when appropriate trade mechanics
    are active.
