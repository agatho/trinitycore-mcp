  signature: void InterruptManager::CheckInterruptAvailability()
documentation:
  brief: Checks and updates the availability status of interrupts for active spells
    and abilities.
  description: The CheckInterruptAvailability method evaluates whether any ongoing
    spell or ability interrupts are currently available for processing. This method
    is typically invoked during the game loop to ensure that interrupt mechanics such
    as spell interruption, silence effects, or other gameplay events are properly
    handled. It iterates through active spell casts and determines if any conditions
    have changed that would affect the validity of an interrupt. The method does not
    directly perform the interrupt but rather prepares the system for potential interrupt
    handling by updating internal state flags and readiness indicators.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    m_interruptManager.CheckInterruptAvailability();\n\
      \    // ... continue with other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called as part of the core game loop or spell processing
    system. It's important to note that this method only checks availability and does
    not execute interrupts directly; it merely prepares the system state for potential
    interrupt execution.
