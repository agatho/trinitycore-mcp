  class: Unit
  method: GetHoverOffset
  signature: float Unit::GetHoverOffset() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the hover offset value for the unit, determining vertical positioning
    during flight.
  description: The GetHoverOffset method retrieves the current hover offset value
    for a Unit object, which determines how high above the ground the unit is positioned
    during flight. This value is used by the game engine to calculate vertical positioning
    and is essential for proper movement mechanics when units are in flight mode.
    The method returns a float representing the offset in meters, with typical values
    ranging from 0.0f to 10.0f depending on the unit's type and state. This offset
    affects how units interact with terrain during flight and influences collision
    detection.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the hover offset in meters, where 0.0f
    indicates ground level and higher values indicate increased vertical positioning
    above ground. Values may vary based on unit type, state, and game mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: float offset = unit->GetHoverOffset();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with movement calculations during
    flight. Implementation details may vary based on the specific unit type and game
    state, and should be considered when calculating collision detection or positioning
    during flight.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it may affect collision
    detection and positioning calculations. Values may change dynamically based on
    unit state and should not be used for static positioning calculations without
    proper consideration of changing values.
