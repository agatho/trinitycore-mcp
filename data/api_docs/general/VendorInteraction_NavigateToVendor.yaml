api:
  class: VendorInteraction
  method: NavigateToVendor
  signature: bool VendorInteraction::NavigateToVendor(Player * player, uint32 vendorGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates navigation to a vendor for the specified player using the provided
    vendor GUID.
  description: The NavigateToVendor method is responsible for handling the process
    of moving a player character toward a specific vendor NPC within the World of
    Warcraft game world. This function typically involves pathfinding and movement
    logic to ensure the player reaches the vendor's location. It may also perform
    checks to verify that the vendor exists, is within range, and that the player
    has appropriate permissions or conditions to interact with the vendor. The method
    returns true upon successful initiation of navigation, and false if any error
    occurs during the process.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the character that will
      navigate to the vendor.
  - name: vendorGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the vendor NPC to which the player
      should navigate. This value must correspond to a valid GameObject or Creature
      in the game world.
  returns: Returns true if navigation to the vendor was successfully initiated, otherwise
    false. A return value of false could indicate issues such as invalid GUID, unreachable
    vendor, or movement failure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player object\nuint32 vendorGuid\
      \ = 12345;\nbool result = VendorInteraction::NavigateToVendor(player, vendorGuid);\n\
      if (result)\n{\n    // Navigation started successfully\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Failed\
      \ to start navigation\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on TrinityCore's movement and pathfinding systems.
    It may internally use functions like MovementGenerator or PathFinder classes.
    Ensure that the vendorGuid corresponds to a valid GameObject or Creature; otherwise,
    the function will fail.
  warnings: Do not call this method without verifying that the vendor exists in the
    game world. Passing an invalid or non-existent GUID can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Also, ensure that the player is in a valid state before initiating
    navigation.
