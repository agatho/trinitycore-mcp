  method: ApplyAccountEnhancements
  signature: bool PlayerbotMigrationMgr::ApplyAccountEnhancements()
documentation:
  brief: Applies account-wide enhancements to player bots in the TrinityCore system.
  description: The ApplyAccountEnhancements method is responsible for migrating and
    applying account-specific configurations and settings to player bot accounts within
    the TrinityCore framework. This function typically ensures that all player bots
    associated with an account receive consistent enhancements such as updated behavior
    scripts, improved AI logic, or adjusted gameplay parameters. It may also handle
    version compatibility checks and data synchronization across multiple characters
    under a single account. The method is generally invoked during account migration
    processes or system updates to maintain consistency in bot behavior across the
    entire account.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the enhancements were successfully applied to all player
    bots under the account; otherwise, returns false if any errors occurred during
    the process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance()->ApplyAccountEnhancements()) {\n\
      \    // All enhancements applied successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Account\
      \ enhancements applied successfully.\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to apply some\
      \ or all enhancements\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to apply account enhancements.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after verifying that the player bot migration
    system is initialized and that there are active player bots associated with the
    account. It may involve database operations and could potentially block execution
    until all enhancements are processed.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the PlayerbotMigrationMgr
    instance or during active gameplay sessions might result in inconsistent bot behavior
    or data corruption. Ensure that the system is in a safe state before invoking
    this function.
