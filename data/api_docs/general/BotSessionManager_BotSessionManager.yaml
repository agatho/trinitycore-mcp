  brief: Initializes a new BotSessionManager instance as a copy of an existing one
  description: The BotSessionManager constructor creates a new instance by copying
    the state and configuration from an existing BotSessionManager object. This copy
    constructor ensures that all session-related data, including bot configurations,
    active sessions, and management settings, are properly duplicated to maintain
    consistency across multiple manager instances. The method is typically used when
    creating new manager objects that need to inherit the same session management
    properties as an existing instance. This implementation follows standard C++ copy
    semantics and should be used carefully to avoid unintended sharing of internal
    resources.

  examples:
  - title: Copying a BotSessionManager Instance
    code: 'BotSessionManager originalManager;

      // Configure originalManager...

      BotSessionManager newManager(originalManager); // Copy constructor usage'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a copy constructor, so the new instance will have identical state
    to the source. Be aware that if the original manager holds references to external
    resources or pointers, copying may lead to shared resource issues. Consider deep-copying
    behavior for complex internal structures.
  warnings: Using this constructor with managers containing active bot sessions may
    cause unexpected behavior if session states are not properly synchronized between
    copies. Ensure proper resource management when multiple instances exist.
