  class: BotThreatManager
  method: ClassifyThreatPriority
  signature: void BotThreatManager::ClassifyThreatPriority(ThreatTarget & threatTarget)
documentation:
  brief: Classifies the threat priority level for a given threat target based on current
    combat state and AI logic.
  description: The ClassifyThreatPriority method evaluates the threat level of a specified
    ThreatTarget within the context of a bot's current combat situation. It analyzes
    factors such as the target's aggro status, damage dealt, proximity to the bot,
    and other relevant combat metrics to assign an appropriate threat classification.
    This classification is used by the bot's AI system to determine targeting priority,
    spell selection, and overall combat strategy. The method operates on a pre-existing
    ThreatTarget object that must already contain valid target information. The classification
    process considers both immediate and sustained threat indicators to ensure accurate
    prioritization during dynamic combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: threatTarget
    description: Reference to a ThreatTarget object containing the target entity and
      its current threat-related data. This object must be properly initialized with
      valid target information before calling this method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Classification
    code: 'ThreatTarget target;

      target.SetTarget(unit);

      botThreatManager.ClassifyThreatPriority(target);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat AI Loop
    code: "void BotCombatAI::UpdateThreatLevels()\n{\n    for (auto& target : threatList)\n\
      \    {\n        botThreatManager.ClassifyThreatPriority(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat updates and should not be invoked
    outside of active combat scenarios. The classification algorithm may adjust based
    on the bot's current class, specialization, and equipped gear. Multiple calls
    to this method with the same target will overwrite previous threat classifications.
  warnings: Ensure that the ThreatTarget object passed to this method is properly
    initialized before calling. Failure to do so may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect threat prioritization. This method modifies the internal state of
    the ThreatTarget object and should not be called concurrently from multiple threads
    without proper synchronization.
