documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the stationary position index of the scene object.
  description: The GetStationaryPosition method returns a constant reference to an
    integer representing the stationary position index associated with this scene
    object. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, scene objects are used to
    define visual effects and positioning for various in-game elements such as quests,
    events, or environmental features. This index typically corresponds to a predefined
    set of positions within a scene configuration, allowing the game engine to determine
    where the object should be placed statically during runtime. The returned value
    is read-only and reflects the current stationary state of the object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the stationary position
    index of the scene object. This index usually maps to a specific location within
    the scene's defined positions, indicating where the object should be placed statically.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const int& positionIndex = sceneObject->GetStationaryPosition();\n// Use\
      \ positionIndex to determine static placement\nif (positionIndex >= 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Proceed with static positioning logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with scene management systems
    to ensure proper positioning of visual elements. The returned reference should
    not be modified directly as it represents a constant value from the object's internal
    state.
