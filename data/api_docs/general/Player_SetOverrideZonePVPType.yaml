documentation:
  brief: Sets the override zone PvP type for the player, allowing control over PvP
    flagging behavior in specific zones.
  description: This method allows a player to override the default PvP zone type behavior
    by setting a specific ZonePVPTypeOverride value. It is used primarily to modify
    how the player's PvP status is handled in certain zones, particularly those where
    PvP rules may be overridden or modified. The method affects the player's ability
    to enter PvP flagged zones and can influence their state in terms of PvP flagging
    and zone-based PvP mechanics. This functionality is especially relevant when dealing
    with zones that have special PvP configurations, such as sanctuaries or neutral
    zones.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: 'The ZonePVPTypeOverride value to set for the player''s zone. Valid
      values include: ZonePVPTypeOverride::None (no override), ZonePVPTypeOverride::Hostile
      (override to hostile PvP), ZonePVPTypeOverride::Friendly (override to friendly
      PvP), and ZonePVPTypeOverride::Neutral (override to neutral PvP). This determines
      how the player''s PvP status is handled in the zone.'
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a hostile override
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetOverrideZonePVPType(ZonePVPTypeOverride::Hostile);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting a neutral override for sanctuary zone
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetOverrideZonePVPType(ZonePVPTypeOverride::Neutral);

      // This allows the player to enter a sanctuary zone without being flagged as
      PvP

      // while still maintaining their PvP status in other zones.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with zone-specific PvP mechanics
    and may be overridden by certain game events or zone settings. It should be used
    carefully as it can affect player behavior in PvP zones, particularly when entering
    areas where PvP flagging is normally enforced. The method does not directly change
    the player's PvP status but rather overrides how the zone handles it.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to unexpected PvP flagging behavior
    or player state issues. Care should be taken when setting override types, especially
    in zones that are normally hostile or friendly. This method should not be used
    to bypass normal PvP rules without proper consideration of game balance.
