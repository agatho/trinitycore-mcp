  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::RescheduleConflictingEvents(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Reschedules any conflicting guild events to prevent overlapping occurrences.
  description: The RescheduleConflictingEvents method iterates through all active
    guild events and identifies those that conflict with each other based on time
    slots or resource allocation. It then adjusts the timing of these conflicting
    events to ensure they do not overlap, maintaining proper event scheduling within
    the guild's calendar system. This method is typically invoked when new events
    are added or existing events are modified to maintain consistency in the guild's
    event management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.RescheduleConflictingEvents(nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may modify event times in-place and should be called after any
    changes to guild events that could cause conflicts. The implementation assumes
    that event data is already validated and consistent.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper synchronization can lead to race conditions
    if multiple threads are modifying guild events simultaneously. Ensure thread safety
    when invoking this method in multi-threaded environments.
