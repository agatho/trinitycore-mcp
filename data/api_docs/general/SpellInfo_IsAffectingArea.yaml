  method: IsAffectingArea
  signature: bool SpellInfo::IsAffectingArea() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell affects an area.
  description: This method checks if a spell is classified as an area-of-effect spell,
    which means it impacts a region of space rather than just a single target. The
    function returns true for spells that affect multiple targets within a defined
    radius or area, such as AoE spells like Fireball or Healing Wave. It's commonly
    used in spell processing logic to distinguish between single-target and area-target
    spells. This method is essential for determining spell behavior during spell casting
    and execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell affects an area (i.e., is an area-of-effect spell),
    false otherwise. The return value indicates whether the spell's target type is
    classified as area-based rather than single-target.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spellInfo->IsAffectingArea()) {\n    // Spell is an area-of-effect\
      \ spell\n    // Handle accordingly\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the spell's target type classification and may be used
    in conjunction with other spell properties to determine full spell behavior. Implementation
    depends on internal spell data structure and may vary based on spell type and
    effects.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a direct replacement for checking spell
    effects or target types, as it only indicates area-based targeting. Care must
    be taken when using this in conjunction with other spell properties to avoid misinterpretation
    of spell behavior.
