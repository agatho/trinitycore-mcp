  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: TrackPerformance
  signature: void LineOfSightManager::TrackPerformance(std::chrono::microseconds duration,
    bool cacheHit, bool successful)
documentation:
  brief: Records performance metrics for line-of-sight calculations including duration,
    cache status, and success rate.
  description: The TrackPerformance method is used to log timing and efficiency data
    for line-of-sight (LOS) calculations within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    captures how long a LOS check took, whether it was served from a cache, and if
    the operation was successful. It's typically called internally by the LineOfSightManager
    after performing a visibility test to help monitor system performance and optimize
    caching strategies. The recorded data can be used for profiling, debugging, or
    adjusting LOS calculation thresholds in high-traffic areas of the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: duration
    description: The time taken to complete the line-of-sight check, measured in microseconds.
      This value indicates the performance cost of the operation.
  - name: cacheHit
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the result was retrieved from a
      cached lookup rather than computed fresh. True means a cache hit occurred.
  - name: successful
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the line-of-sight check completed
      successfully. False may indicate an error or invalid input parameters.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in LOS Manager Context
    code: 'auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      bool result = lineOfSightManager.CheckLOS(source, target);

      auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      std::chrono::microseconds duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end
      - start);

      lineOfSightManager.TrackPerformance(duration, false, result);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used for internal performance monitoring and should
    not be called directly by external code. It may aggregate metrics into internal
    statistics or write logs depending on configuration settings. The method assumes
    valid inputs and does not perform input validation.
