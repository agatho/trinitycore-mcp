  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: EmergencyTeleport
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::EmergencyTeleport(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Teleports the specified player to the leader's location during an emergency
    situation.
  description: The EmergencyTeleport method is used in the LeaderFollowBehavior AI
    system to immediately transport a bot player to their leader's current position.
    This functionality is typically invoked when the bot encounters a dangerous or
    unreachable situation, or when the leader needs to quickly reassemble the group.
    The method ensures that the teleportation occurs without any delay or interruption,
    maintaining the integrity of the group's positioning strategy. It operates under
    the assumption that both the bot and leader are in the same map instance and that
    the leader is accessible for teleportation purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will be teleported
      to the leader's location. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Emergency Teleport Usage
    code: "void SomeAI::HandleEmergencySituation(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player\
      \ && player->GetGroup())\n    {\n        LeaderFollowBehavior behavior(player);\n\
      \        behavior.EmergencyTeleport(player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the bot and leader are in the same
    map instance. The teleportation is immediate and does not account for obstacles
    or terrain that might prevent a safe landing at the destination. It's recommended
    to verify the leader's position before invoking this method.
  warnings: Calling EmergencyTeleport on a player who is already at the leader's location
    may cause unexpected behavior or visual glitches. Ensure that the bot is actually
    separated from the leader before calling this function.
