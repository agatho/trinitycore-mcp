  class: WorldSession
  method: SendCharRename
  signature: void WorldSession::SendCharRename(int result, const WorldPackets::Character::CharacterRenameInfo
    * renameInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a character rename result packet to the client.
  description: The SendCharRename method is responsible for transmitting the outcome
    of a character rename operation back to the connected client. It takes a result
    code indicating success or failure and optional rename information, then formats
    and sends the appropriate packet through the session's network connection. This
    method is typically invoked after a player attempts to rename their character
    via the UI or command interface, providing immediate feedback on whether the operation
    was successful.
  parameters:
  - name: result
    description: An integer value indicating the result of the rename operation. Common
      values include 0 for success, and various error codes such as 1 for invalid
      name, 2 for name already taken, etc.
  - name: renameInfo
    description: A pointer to a CharacterRenameInfo packet structure containing detailed
      information about the character being renamed, including the old and new names.
      Can be null if only sending result status without additional data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Successful Character Rename
    code: 'WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();

      WorldPackets::Character::CharacterRenameInfo renameInfo;

      renameInfo.OldName = "OldPlayer";

      renameInfo.NewName = "NewPlayer";

      session->SendCharRename(0, &renameInfo);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Failed Character Rename - Name Already Taken
    code: 'WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();

      // Assume rename failed due to name conflict

      session->SendCharRename(2, nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the network layer to send packets. The
    renameInfo parameter should be properly initialized before calling this function.
    It is typically called from within character management or command handling code
    paths.
  warnings: Ensure that the result parameter accurately reflects the outcome of the
    rename operation, as incorrect values may confuse players. The renameInfo pointer
    must not be accessed after the call if it's a local variable, since the method
    might store or copy its contents.
