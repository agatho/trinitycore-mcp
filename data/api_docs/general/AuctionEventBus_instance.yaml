documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the AuctionEventBus class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the AuctionEventBus
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the auction event bus exists throughout
    the application. This method is typically used to access the global auction event
    handling system within TrinityCore's auction house functionality. The returned
    pointer provides access to all auction-related events and notifications that occur
    during item auctions, including bid placements, auction endings, and item sales.
    This singleton instance is initialized on first call and remains active for the
    lifetime of the application.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single AuctionEventBus instance. The method will never
    return a null pointer as the singleton is guaranteed to be constructed upon first
    access.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the Auction Event Bus
    code: 'AuctionEventBus* bus = AuctionEventBus::instance();

      // Use the bus to subscribe to auction events

      bus->Subscribe(&myEventHandler);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Instance in Auction Handler
    code: "void HandleAuctionBid(AuctionEntry* entry, uint32 bidAmount)\n{\n    AuctionEventBus*\
      \ bus = AuctionEventBus::instance();\n    AuctionBidEvent event(entry, bidAmount);\n\
      \    bus->Publish(event);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as the singleton instance is constructed in a
    thread-safe manner. The AuctionEventBus singleton should be accessed through this
    method rather than creating new instances directly. The implementation typically
    uses static local variables or similar thread-safe initialization techniques to
    ensure proper singleton behavior.
  warnings: Do not delete or manually manage the returned pointer, as it points to
    a singleton instance managed by the system. Avoid calling this method during static
    initialization phases where the singleton might not be fully initialized yet.
