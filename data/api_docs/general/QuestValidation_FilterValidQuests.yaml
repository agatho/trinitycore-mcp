  class: QuestValidation
  method: FilterValidQuests
  signature: int QuestValidation::FilterValidQuests(const int & questIds, Player *
    bot)
documentation:
  brief: Filters and validates a list of quest IDs for a given player, returning the
    count of valid quests.
  description: The FilterValidQuests method evaluates a collection of quest identifiers
    against the specified player's current quest state, including completion status,
    prerequisites, level requirements, and other game logic constraints. It ensures
    that only quests which are currently available and eligible for the player to
    accept or continue are considered valid. This method is typically used in AI systems
    or quest management modules to determine which quests should be presented to a
    player or pursued by a bot. The function performs checks such as minimum required
    level, previous quest completion, faction requirements, and item possession. It
    returns an integer representing the number of valid quests found in the input
    list.
  parameters:
  - name: questIds
    description: A reference to an array or list of quest identifiers (integers) that
      need to be validated against the player's state.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character for whom
      the quest validation is performed. This determines eligibility based on player's
      level, faction, quest log, and other attributes.
  returns: An integer indicating the number of valid quests from the provided questIds
    list that can be accepted or continued by the specified player. Returns zero if
    no quests are valid or if the input is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to filter valid quests for a bot
    code: int validQuestCount = QuestValidation::FilterValidQuests({12345, 12346,
      12347}, botPlayer);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using filtered quests to assign objectives
    code: "std::vector<int> questList = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nint validCount = QuestValidation::FilterValidQuests(questList,\
      \ playerBot);\nif (validCount > 0) {\n    // Proceed with assigning quests to\
      \ the bot\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that questIds are passed as a reference to a container
    of integers. The underlying implementation likely uses internal caching or database
    lookups for performance. It may not handle dynamic quest states in real-time without
    explicit refreshes.
  warnings: Ensure that the player object is valid and not null before calling this
    function, as passing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Also,
    note that filtering does not modify the original quest list; it only evaluates
    eligibility.
