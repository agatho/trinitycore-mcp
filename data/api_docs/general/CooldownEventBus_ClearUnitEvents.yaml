  class: CooldownEventBus
  method: ClearUnitEvents
  signature: void CooldownEventBus::ClearUnitEvents(int unitGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Clears all cooldown events associated with a specified unit GUID from the
    cooldown event bus.
  description: The ClearUnitEvents method removes all pending or active cooldown events
    that are registered for a specific unit identified by its GUID. This function
    is typically used during unit destruction, logout, or when resetting cooldown
    states to ensure no stale events remain in the system. It helps maintain clean
    state management and prevents potential memory leaks or incorrect behavior due
    to outdated cooldown data. The method operates on the internal event bus structure
    and does not directly interact with the game world objects themselves.
  parameters:
  - name: unitGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the unit whose cooldown events should
      be cleared. This value must correspond to a valid unit in the game world, otherwise
      the operation will have no effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing cooldown events for a player
    code: "void RemovePlayerCooldowns(Player* player)\n{\n    CooldownEventBus::ClearUnitEvents(player->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in unit cleanup routine
    code: "void OnUnitDestroy(Unit* unit)\n{\n    // Clear any pending cooldown events\
      \ before destruction\n    CooldownEventBus::ClearUnitEvents(unit->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      \    // Proceed with normal destruction logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. It
    assumes that the provided unitGuid is valid and corresponds to an existing unit
    in the game world. The internal implementation likely uses a hash map or similar
    data structure for efficient lookup and removal of events.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent unit GUID will result
    in no operation being performed, but it may also indicate a logic error in calling
    code if such GUIDs are expected to exist. Ensure that the GUID is valid before
    invoking this method.
