  class: Object
  method: HasDynamicFlag
  signature: bool Object::HasDynamicFlag(uint32 flag) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the object has a specific dynamic flag set.
  description: This method determines whether a given dynamic flag is currently active
    on the object. Dynamic flags are used in World of Warcraft to represent various
    state changes that affect gameplay mechanics, such as unit states, movement flags,
    or other conditional attributes. The method returns true if the specified flag
    is present in the object's dynamic flag set, false otherwise. This functionality
    is essential for determining object behavior and state within the game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified dynamic flag is set on the object, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (obj->HasDynamicFlag(UNIT_FLAG_OAF))\n{\n    // Do something when the\
      \ object has the flag\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other flag-related methods
    to determine object state. Performance considerations are minimal as it simply
    checks a bitfield, but care should be taken when checking multiple flags in sequence.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with different flag values, as incorrect
    flag values can lead to unexpected behavior or game state issues.
