  class: Battleground
  method: SetWeakPtr
  signature: void Battleground::SetWeakPtr(int weakRef)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a weak reference pointer for the battleground instance.
  description: The SetWeakPtr method assigns a weak reference identifier to the battleground
    object, typically used for internal tracking and memory management within the
    TrinityCore framework. This method is part of the battleground's lifecycle management
    and ensures proper cleanup when the battleground is destroyed or removed from
    active gameplay. The weak reference helps prevent dangling pointers in scenarios
    where the battleground might be referenced by other systems but not actively used.
  parameters: []
  returns: None
  examples:
  - title: Setting Weak Pointer During Battleground Initialization
    code: 'Battleground* bg = new Battleground();

      bg->SetWeakPtr(12345);

      // The battleground now has a weak reference ID of 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    battleground creation or initialization. Developers should not need to call this
    method directly unless implementing custom battleground logic or extending the
    core battleground system.
  warnings: Calling SetWeakPtr with an invalid weak reference ID may lead to memory
    management issues or undefined behavior. Ensure that weak reference IDs are unique
    and properly managed within the context of the battleground lifecycle.
