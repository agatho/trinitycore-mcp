  method: _GetRankBankTabSlotsPerDay
  signature: int32 Guild::_GetRankBankTabSlotsPerDay(GuildRankId rankId, uint8 tabId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of slots per day that a guild rank can access for a
    specific bank tab.
  description: This method returns the daily slot limit for a specified guild rank
    to access a particular bank tab. It is used internally by the game engine to enforce
    guild bank tab access permissions based on rank level. The returned value indicates
    how many times per day a guild member with the given rank can interact with the
    specified bank tab, such as depositing or withdrawing items. This mechanism helps
    balance guild resource management and restrict higher-value tabs to senior members.
  parameters:
  - name: rankId
    description: The guild rank identifier (GuildRankId) for which to retrieve the
      slot limit.
  - name: tabId
    description: The bank tab identifier (uint8) for which to retrieve the slot limit.
  returns: Returns an int32 representing the number of slots per day that the specified
    rank can access the given bank tab. A value of -1 typically indicates no limit
    or an invalid configuration, while zero means the rank has no access.
  examples:
  - title: Get daily slot limit for a rank and tab
    code: "int32 slots = guild->_GetRankBankTabSlotsPerDay(GUILD_RANK_OFFICER, 0);\n\
      if (slots >= 0)\n{\n    // Use the slot count\n    printf(\"Officer can access\
      \ tab 0 %d times per day\\n\", slots);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system that manages guild bank permissions.
    It may be called frequently during player interactions with guild banks, so performance
    should be considered in high-traffic scenarios. The method assumes valid inputs
    for rankId and tabId; invalid values might lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    results.
  warnings: Do not assume that all ranks will have a defined slot limit. Some configurations
    may return -1 or 0, indicating either no access or an error state. Always validate
    the returned value before using it in game logic.
