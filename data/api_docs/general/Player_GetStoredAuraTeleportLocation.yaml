documentation:
  brief: Returns the stored teleport location for a player's aura.
  description: This method retrieves the teleport location associated with a specific
    spell aura stored on the player. It is used to determine where a player will be
    teleported when the corresponding spell effect triggers, typically in cases involving
    teleportation spells or similar mechanics. The method returns a pointer to an
    integer value representing the teleport coordinates, which may be null if no valid
    teleport location exists for the specified spell.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to an integer representing the stored teleport location
    coordinates. This value can be NULL if no valid teleport location is found for
    the spell, indicating that the player's aura does not contain a teleportation
    effect or that the spell does not have a stored teleport location.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int* teleportLocation = player->GetStoredAuraTeleportLocation(12345);\n\
      if (teleportLocation != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the teleport location\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the player's aura system and should be used carefully
    when dealing with spell effects that involve teleportation. It may return NULL
    if the spell does not have a stored teleport location or if the player's aura
    has not been properly initialized.
  warnings: This method should only be called in contexts where the player's aura
    is known to contain a valid teleportation effect. Using it without proper validation
    can lead to undefined behavior or memory access violations.
