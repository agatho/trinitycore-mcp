  signature: void GossipMenu::AddMenuItem(const GossipMenuItems & menuItem, uint32
    sender, uint32 action)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a new menu item to the gossip menu with specified sender and action
    identifiers.
  description: The AddMenuItem method is used to add a new entry to a gossip menu
    in TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server implementation. This method allows developers
    to programmatically construct interactive dialogue options that appear when players
    interact with NPCs. The GossipMenuItems parameter defines the properties of the
    menu item such as text, icon, and other display attributes. The sender and action
    parameters are used to identify the source of the gossip interaction and the intended
    action to be performed when the player selects this menu item. This method is
    typically called during NPC gossip initialization or response handling to dynamically
    build the available options presented to players.
  parameters:
  - name: menuItem
    description: A GossipMenuItems object containing the properties and display information
      for the new menu item, including text, icon, and other visual attributes.
  - name: sender
    description: An identifier used to track the source of the gossip interaction.
      This value is passed back to the gossip handlers when a player selects this
      menu item.
  - name: action
    description: An identifier that specifies the action to be performed when the
      player selects this menu item. This value is typically used in conjunction with
      the sender to determine the appropriate response handling logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Gossip Menu Item Addition
    code: 'GossipMenuItems menuItem;

      menuItem.Text = "I want to buy something";

      menuItem.Icon = GOSSIP_ICON_VENDOR;

      AddMenuItem(menuItem, 1, 1001);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Menu Items with Different Actions
    code: 'GossipMenuItems menuItem1;

      menuItem1.Text = "Learn Herbalism";

      menuItem1.Icon = GOSSIP_ICON_TRAINER;

      AddMenuItem(menuItem1, 2, 2001);


      GossipMenuItems menuItem2;

      menuItem2.Text = "Trade Skills";

      menuItem2.Icon = GOSSIP_ICON_INTERACT_1;

      AddMenuItem(menuItem2, 2, 2002);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during the gossip menu construction phase before
    the menu is displayed to players. The sender and action parameters are crucial
    for proper event handling and must be unique enough to distinguish between different
    menu items in the same gossip context. Menu items are typically added in the order
    they are called, which affects their display sequence.
  warnings: Ensure that the GossipMenuItems object passed is properly initialized
    before calling this method. Using invalid sender or action values may result in
    incorrect behavior during gossip handling. Avoid calling this method after the
    gossip menu has already been sent to a player as it will not affect the currently
    displayed menu.
