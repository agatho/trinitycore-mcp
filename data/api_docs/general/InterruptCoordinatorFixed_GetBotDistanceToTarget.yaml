  class: InterruptCoordinatorFixed
  method: GetBotDistanceToTarget
  signature: float InterruptCoordinatorFixed::GetBotDistanceToTarget(int botGuid,
    int targetGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between a bot and its target
    in world coordinates.
  description: The GetBotDistanceToTarget method computes the straight-line distance
    between a specified bot character and its current target within the game world.
    This function is typically used by AI systems to determine proximity for decision-making
    processes such as spell casting, movement behavior, or combat strategy. The method
    requires valid GUIDs for both the bot and its target, and will return a float
    value representing the distance in yards. If either GUID is invalid or the entities
    are not found in the world, the behavior may be undefined or return an incorrect
    value.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character for which to calculate
      the distance.
  - name: targetGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target entity to which the distance
      is calculated.
  returns: A float value representing the Euclidean distance in yards between the
    bot and its target. Returns 0.0f if either GUID is invalid or entities are not
    found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float distance = interruptCoordinator.GetBotDistanceToTarget(botGuid, targetGuid);\n\
      if (distance < 10.0f) {\n    // Bot is close to target\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Distance for AI Decision Making
    code: "float distance = interruptCoordinator.GetBotDistanceToTarget(botGuid, targetGuid);\n\
      if (distance > 25.0f) {\n    // Move closer to target\n    bot->MoveTowards(targetGuid);\n\
      } else if (distance < 5.0f) {\n    // Cast spell if close enough\n    bot->CastSpell(SPELL_SHOOT);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate entity positioning in the game world and assumes
    both entities are active and within the same map. Performance may be impacted
    when called frequently in tight loops or during high-frequency AI updates.
  warnings: Ensure that both botGuid and targetGuid correspond to valid, existing
    entities before calling this method. Invalid GUIDs can lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect distance calculations.
