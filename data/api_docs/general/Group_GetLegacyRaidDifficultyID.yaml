  signature: int Group::GetLegacyRaidDifficultyID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the legacy raid difficulty ID for the group.
  description: This method retrieves the legacy raid difficulty identifier associated
    with the group. In World of Warcraft, raid difficulties are represented by specific
    numeric IDs that correspond to different difficulty levels such as Normal, Heroic,
    and Mythic. This function is typically used in the context of raid management
    and loot distribution systems where the difficulty level affects rewards and encounter
    mechanics. The returned value represents a standardized identifier used internally
    by TrinityCore to distinguish between various raid difficulty settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the legacy raid difficulty ID. Common values include
    0 for Normal, 1 for Heroic, and 2 for Raid Finder (or similar identifiers depending
    on the expansion). A value of -1 may indicate an invalid or unset difficulty setting.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    int difficultyId\
      \ = group->GetLegacyRaidDifficultyID();\n    // Use difficultyId for logic decisions\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in legacy raid systems and may not be relevant
    for newer content. The exact mapping of IDs to difficulty levels can vary between
    different expansions and patches. This function should only be called on groups
    that are valid raid instances.
