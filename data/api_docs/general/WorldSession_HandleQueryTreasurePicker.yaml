documentation:
  brief: Handles client requests for treasure picker data in World of Warcraft.
  description: The HandleQueryTreasurePicker method processes incoming queries from
    the client related to treasure picker information. This functionality is typically
    used when players interact with treasure chests or loot containers that require
    a specific picker mechanism to determine item distribution. The method likely
    retrieves and sends relevant treasure picker data back to the requesting client,
    ensuring proper loot mechanics are maintained within the game world. It operates
    as part of the WorldSession's packet handling system and may involve database
    lookups or cached data retrieval for accurate treasure picker information.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic treasure picker query handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleQueryTreasurePicker(const WorldPackets::Query::QueryTreasurePicker&\
      \ queryTreasurePicker)\n{\n    // Process the treasure picker query\n    //\
      \ Retrieve relevant data from database or cache\n    // Send response packet\
      \ back to client\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's network packet handling system and should
    be called only within the context of a valid WorldSession. The implementation
    likely involves interaction with the database to fetch treasure picker configurations
    or loot templates. Ensure proper error handling for cases where treasure picker
    data might not exist.
  warnings: Improper handling of treasure picker queries could lead to incorrect loot
    distribution or client-side errors. This method should validate input parameters
    and handle missing data gracefully to prevent crashes or unexpected behavior in
    the game world.
