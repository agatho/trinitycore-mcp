  brief: Updates the frenzy state and effects of the beast mastery pet.
  description: The UpdatePetFrenzy method manages the frenzy buff state for a beast
    mastery pet, recalculating and applying any relevant modifiers or visual effects.
    This method is typically invoked when the pet's frenzy status changes, such as
    when entering or exiting a frenzy state due to damage dealt or specific ability
    usage. It ensures that the pet's stats, abilities, and visual representation are
    correctly updated to reflect the current frenzy condition.

  notes: This method should only be called when there is an actual change in the frenzy
    state of the pet. Frequent calls without changes may cause unnecessary performance
    overhead.
