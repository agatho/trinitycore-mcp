documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the Azerite item milestone powers data from the DB2 files.
  description: The GetAzeriteItemMilestonePowers method retrieves a reference to an
    array of integers representing the Azerite item milestone powers. These powers
    define which abilities are unlocked at specific milestone levels for Azerite items
    in World of Warcraft. The returned reference points to internal data that is loaded
    and managed by the DB2Manager class, typically populated during server startup
    or database loading phases. This method allows access to the static game data
    that governs how Azerite traits scale with item level milestones.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const reference to an array of integers (int) representing the Azerite
    item milestone powers. The actual values correspond to internal identifiers or
    indices used by the game's Azerite system to determine which powers are granted
    at each milestone level.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Azerite Milestone Powers
    code: "const int& milestonePowers = sDB2Manager->GetAzeriteItemMilestonePowers();\n\
      for (size_t i = 0; i < /* expected size */; ++i)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Milestone\
      \ Power ID: \" << milestonePowers[i] << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a reference to internal data that should not be modified.
    The data is typically loaded once at startup and remains constant during runtime.
    It's important to ensure that the DB2Manager has been initialized before calling
    this method, otherwise it may return invalid or uninitialized data.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned array directly as it points to internal read-only
    data. Accessing this data after the DB2Manager has been destroyed or not yet initialized
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
