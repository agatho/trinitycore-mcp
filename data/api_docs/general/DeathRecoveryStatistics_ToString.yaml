documentation:
  brief: Converts death recovery statistics data into a formatted string representation
  description: The ToString method serializes the internal death recovery statistics
    data into a human-readable string format. This method is typically used for debugging,
    logging, or displaying player death-related statistics in a readable format. The
    implementation likely aggregates various death-related metrics such as death counts,
    resurrection times, and recovery attempts into a single formatted output string.
    This method does not modify any internal state and is safe to call multiple times.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the formatted death recovery statistics information,
    typically including numerical counts and timing data related to player deaths
    and recoveries
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Logging
    code: 'DeathRecoveryStatistics stats;

      // ... populate stats with data ...

      std::string logMessage = stats.ToString();

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Player death statistics: %s", logMessage.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using standard C++ string formatting techniques
    and may utilize std::ostringstream for building the final string. The exact format
    of the returned string depends on the internal structure of DeathRecoveryStatistics
    and how it chooses to serialize its data members.
