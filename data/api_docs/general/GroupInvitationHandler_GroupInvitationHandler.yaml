  class: GroupInvitationHandler
  method: GroupInvitationHandler
  signature: void GroupInvitationHandler::GroupInvitationHandler(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a group invitation handler for the specified bot player.
  description: The GroupInvitationHandler constructor initializes a group invitation
    handler instance for a given bot player. This method sets up internal state and
    configurations required to manage group invitations within the TrinityCore framework.
    The handler is typically used in AI or automation systems where bots need to accept
    or decline group invitations from other players. It establishes the necessary
    context for processing group-related communication and ensures proper integration
    with the game's group management system.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will be handling
      group invitations. This parameter must not be null and should reference a valid
      player instance within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Invitation Handler Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get or create bot player

      GroupInvitationHandler handler(myBot);

      // Handler is now ready to process group invitations'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Group Invitation Handler in AI System
    code: "class BotAI {\npublic:\n    void InitializeGroupHandling(Player* bot) {\n\
      \        groupHandler = new GroupInvitationHandler(bot);\n    }\nprivate:\n\
      \    GroupInvitationHandler* groupHandler;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any network communication or external API
    calls. It only initializes internal data structures and references. The actual
    invitation processing occurs through separate methods that are called when invitations
    arrive. Ensure the Player object passed is valid and has been properly initialized
    in the game world before calling this constructor.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the bot parameter will likely cause undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always verify that the Player object exists and is in a valid
    state before creating a GroupInvitationHandler instance. This handler should not
    be used with players who are not currently in the game world or have been deleted.
