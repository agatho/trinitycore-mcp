  class: GuardianThrashTracker
  method: ApplyThrash
  signature: void GuardianThrashTracker::ApplyThrash(int guid, uint32 duration, uint32
    stacks)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a thrash effect to a guardian with specified duration and stack count.
  description: The ApplyThrash method is used to apply a thrash effect to a guardian
    unit within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically manages the application
    of debuffs or effects that stack over time, such as those found in various boss
    encounters or player abilities. It takes a unique identifier for the target, the
    duration of the effect in milliseconds, and the number of stacks to apply. The
    method likely interacts with the guardian's aura system to properly register and
    manage the thrash effect.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the guardian unit that will receive
      the thrash effect. This is typically a 32-bit integer representing the object's
      identifier within the game world.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the thrash effect will remain
      active on the target. This determines how long the effect will persist before
      expiring.
  - name: stacks
    description: The number of stacks to apply to the thrash effect. Higher stack
      counts typically increase the potency or duration of the effect, depending on
      game mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GuardianThrashTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyThrash(12345, 6000, 3);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Values
    code: 'uint32 targetGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      uint32 duration = 5000 + (player->GetLevel() * 100);

      uint32 stacks = player->HasAura(12345) ? 2 : 1;

      tracker.ApplyThrash(targetGuid, duration, stacks);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the TrinityCore's aura system and may be
    called during combat events or ability activations. The implementation should
    ensure that multiple applications of the same effect do not cause unexpected behavior,
    and that stack limits are properly enforced.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID corresponds to a valid guardian unit before calling
    this method to prevent undefined behavior. Be cautious when applying high stack
    counts as they may lead to performance issues or game balance concerns.
