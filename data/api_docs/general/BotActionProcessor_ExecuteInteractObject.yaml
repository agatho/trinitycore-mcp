  class: BotActionProcessor
  method: ExecuteInteractObject
  signature: BotActionResult BotActionProcessor::ExecuteInteractObject(Player * bot,
    const BotAction & action)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and executes an interaction with a game object for a bot player.
  description: The ExecuteInteractObject method handles the logic for a bot player
    to interact with a specified game object within the World of Warcraft environment.
    It processes the action request, validates the interaction conditions, and performs
    the appropriate in-game interaction such as opening containers, using quest objects,
    or triggering NPC dialogues. The method ensures that the bot's interaction aligns
    with game mechanics and player state constraints. This function is part of the
    broader BotActionProcessor system which manages all automated actions performed
    by AI-controlled players.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will perform
      the interaction.
  - name: action
    description: Reference to a BotAction object containing details about the interaction,
      including target object GUID and action type.
  returns: Returns a BotActionResult enum indicating success or failure of the interaction.
    Possible values include SUCCESS, FAILED, INVALID_TARGET, or INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES
    depending on execution outcome.
  examples:
  - title: Basic bot object interaction
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Bot player instance\nBotAction action;\naction.type\
      \ = BOT_ACTION_INTERACT_OBJECT;\naction.targetGuid = 123456;\nBotActionResult\
      \ result = processor.ExecuteInteractObject(myBot, action);\nif (result == BOT_RESULT_SUCCESS)\
      \ {\n    // Interaction completed successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling interaction result
    code: "Player* bot = GetBot();\nBotAction action;\naction.type = BOT_ACTION_INTERACT_OBJECT;\n\
      action.targetGuid = GetGameObjectGUID();\nBotActionResult result = processor.ExecuteInteractObject(bot,\
      \ action);\nswitch (result) {\n    case BOT_RESULT_SUCCESS:\n        // Object\
      \ interaction succeeded\n        break;\n    case BOT_RESULT_FAILED:\n     \
      \   // Interaction failed for unknown reason\n        break;\n    case BOT_RESULT_INVALID_TARGET:\n\
      \        // Target object not found or invalid\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the bot's current position and orientation to determine
    if interaction is possible. It may perform checks for line-of-sight, distance
    limits, and object usability before attempting the interaction. The function assumes
    that the target game object exists in the world and is accessible to the bot player.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the target object or
    bot state may result in undefined behavior or client-side errors. Ensure that
    the bot has sufficient resources (mana, health) and that the interaction type
    is supported for the given object before calling.
