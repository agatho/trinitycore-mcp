  class: KitingManager
  method: ExecuteFigureEight
  signature: KitingResult KitingManager::ExecuteFigureEight(const KitingContext &
    context)
documentation:
  brief: Performs a figure-eight kiting pattern using the provided kiting context.
  description: The ExecuteFigureEight method implements a specific kiting maneuver
    where the player moves in a figure-eight (infinity symbol) pattern to maintain
    optimal distance from an enemy while dealing damage. This technique is commonly
    used in combat scenarios to avoid melee attacks while keeping the target within
    ranged attack range. The method utilizes the provided KitingContext to determine
    movement parameters, target position, and other relevant combat data. It returns
    a KitingResult indicating success or failure of the kiting maneuver.
  parameters: []
  returns: KitingResult representing the outcome of the figure-eight kiting execution.
    Possible values include SUCCESS, FAILURE, or IN_PROGRESS depending on whether
    the maneuver completed successfully, failed due to invalid conditions, or is still
    in progress.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecuteFigureEight
    code: "KitingContext context;\n// Set up context with target and movement data\n\
      context.targetPosition = GetTarget()->GetPosition();\ncontext.playerPosition\
      \ = GetPlayer()->GetPosition();\ncontext.maxDistance = 30.0f;\ncontext.minDistance\
      \ = 5.0f;\n\nKitingResult result = kitingManager.ExecuteFigureEight(context);\n\
      if (result == KitingResult::SUCCESS)\n{\n    // Handle successful kiting maneuver\n\
      \    SendChatMessage(\"Figure-eight kiting completed!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player and target positions are valid and that
    the necessary combat state is active. The kiting pattern may be interrupted if
    the target moves outside of acceptable distance thresholds or if the player's
    movement is blocked by terrain or obstacles.
  warnings: The method does not validate whether the player has sufficient mana or
    stamina to perform the kiting maneuver. It also assumes that the KitingContext
    contains valid data; invalid or uninitialized context values may lead to undefined
    behavior.
