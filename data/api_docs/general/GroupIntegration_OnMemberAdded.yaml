  class: GroupIntegration
  method: OnMemberAdded
  signature: void GroupIntegration::OnMemberAdded(Group * group, Player * member)
documentation:
  brief: Invoked when a new member is added to a group, allowing integration logic
    to execute.
  description: The OnMemberAdded method is a callback function that gets triggered
    whenever a player is successfully added to a group within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method serves as an integration point for custom group management logic,
    such as updating player statistics, broadcasting messages, or synchronizing group
    data across systems. It is typically used by addons or custom modules that need
    to react to group membership changes. The method receives a pointer to the Group
    object and the Player object of the newly added member, enabling developers to
    access both group context and member-specific information. This callback ensures
    that all relevant systems are notified when group composition changes, maintaining
    consistency in game state.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object to which the member was added. This represents
      the group context for the operation.
  - name: member
    description: Pointer to the Player object that was added to the group. This provides
      access to the player's data and state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a custom group handler
    code: "void MyGroupIntegration::OnMemberAdded(Group* group, Player* member)\n\
      {\n    // Log the addition of a new member\n    sLog->outString(\"Player %s\
      \ joined group %u\", member->GetName().c_str(), group->GetId());\n    \n   \
      \ // Update player's group-related statistics\n    member->UpdateGroupStats();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with event broadcasting
    code: "void MyGroupIntegration::OnMemberAdded(Group* group, Player* member)\n\
      {\n    // Broadcast a message to all group members\n    ChatHandler handler(member->GetSession());\n\
      \    handler.PSendSysMessage(\"Welcome %s to the group!\", member->GetName().c_str());\n\
      \    \n    // Trigger additional logic for group synchronization\n    if (group->IsRaidGroup())\n\
      \    {\n        member->SetGroupRole(GROUP_ROLE_TANK);\n        sWorld->SendGlobalGMSysMessage(\"\
      New raid member added: \" + member->GetName());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called after the member has been successfully added to the
    group, so it's safe to assume that both the group and player objects are valid.
    The method should be implemented with performance in mind since it may be invoked
    frequently during group operations.
  warnings: Ensure that any logic within this method does not block or delay execution,
    as it is called synchronously during group management operations. Avoid performing
    heavy computations or database queries directly inside this callback to prevent
    potential lag or deadlocks.
