  signature: MovementResult PositionManager::HandleEmergencyMovement(const MovementContext
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Handles emergency movement logic for a player or creature in response to
    critical game events.
  description: The HandleEmergencyMovement method processes and executes immediate
    movement actions for units when emergency conditions are triggered, such as fleeing
    from danger or being pulled into combat. It evaluates the current context of the
    unit's state and applies appropriate movement behavior to ensure survival or tactical
    positioning. This method typically interrupts existing movement sequences and
    prioritizes urgent pathfinding over normal movement routines. The method is designed
    to be invoked during critical game states where standard movement logic may not
    suffice.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a MovementResult enum indicating the success or failure of the
    emergency movement operation, including details about whether the movement was
    completed, interrupted, or failed due to environmental constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "void EmergencyAI::Update()\n{\n    if (HasCriticalHealth())\n    {\n  \
      \      MovementResult result = positionManager->HandleEmergencyMovement(context);\n\
      \        if (result == MOVEMENT_SUCCESS)\n        {\n            // Movement\
      \ completed successfully\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a unit is in immediate danger or under
    critical game conditions. It may override existing movement states and should
    not be used in regular movement logic to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context validation can lead to unintended
    movement patterns or unit locking. Ensure that emergency conditions are properly
    evaluated before invocation.
