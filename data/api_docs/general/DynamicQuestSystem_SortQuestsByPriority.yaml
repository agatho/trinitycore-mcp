  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: SortQuestsByPriority
  signature: int DynamicQuestSystem::SortQuestsByPriority(const int & questIds, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Sorts a list of quest IDs by their priority for dynamic quest handling in
    the bot system.
  description: The SortQuestsByPriority method organizes a collection of quest identifiers
    based on their assigned priority levels within the dynamic quest system. This
    sorting is essential for determining which quests should be prioritized when a
    bot player is processing multiple available quests. The method takes into account
    various factors such as quest level requirements, quest rewards, and player progress
    to establish an optimal order. It ensures that higher-priority quests are handled
    first, improving the efficiency of quest completion for automated players. This
    functionality is particularly important in TrinityCore's bot system where quest
    prioritization directly affects gameplay progression.
  parameters:
  - name: questIds
    description: A reference to an integer representing a list or collection of quest
      identifiers that need to be sorted by priority. The value should correspond
      to valid quest IDs within the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the bot player for whom
      the quests are being prioritized. This parameter is used to determine the bot's
      current level, progress, and other relevant attributes that affect quest priority
      calculation.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the sorting
    operation. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful completion of the
    sorting process, while non-zero values may indicate errors such as invalid quest
    IDs or missing player data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Sorting
    code: "int result = dynamicQuestSystem.SortQuestsByPriority(questIds, botPlayer);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // Quests have been successfully sorted by priority\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Quests sorted successfully\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n \
      \   // Handle error case\n    std::cout << \"Failed to sort quests\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Sorting with Error Handling
    code: "std::vector<int> questList = {12345, 12346, 12347};\nint result = dynamicQuestSystem.SortQuestsByPriority(questList,\
      \ botPlayer);\nswitch (result) {\n    case 0:\n        std::cout << \"Sorting\
      \ completed successfully\" << std::endl;\n        break;\n    case -1:\n   \
      \     std::cout << \"Invalid quest IDs provided\" << std::endl;\n        break;\n\
      \    default:\n        std::cout << \"Unknown error occurred during sorting\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on internal quest priority rules defined within the DynamicQuestSystem
    class. These rules may be configurable through configuration files or database
    entries. The sorting algorithm used internally is likely optimized for performance
    given that bots may process many quests simultaneously. It's important to note
    that this method modifies the order of quest IDs in place, so any references to
    the original list should be updated accordingly.
  warnings: Ensure that all quest IDs passed to this method are valid and exist within
    the game database; otherwise, the method may return an error code or produce undefined
    behavior. The bot player object must be properly initialized before calling this
    method, as it uses the bot's current state to determine priority calculations.
