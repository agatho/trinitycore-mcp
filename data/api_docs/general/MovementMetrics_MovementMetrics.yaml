  class: MovementMetrics
  method: MovementMetrics
  signature: void MovementMetrics::MovementMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the MovementMetrics class with default values.
  description: The MovementMetrics constructor initializes a new instance of the MovementMetrics
    class, setting up internal data structures and default values for movement-related
    metrics. This method is typically called when creating a new MovementMetrics object
    to track player or unit movement statistics within the TrinityCore framework.
    The constructor ensures that all member variables are properly initialized to
    their default states, allowing subsequent operations to function correctly without
    undefined behavior. This initialization is crucial for maintaining accurate movement
    tracking and performance monitoring in World of Warcraft server environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic MovementMetrics Initialization
    code: 'MovementMetrics metrics;

      // Constructor automatically initializes all internal metrics to default values'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating MovementMetrics Instance for Player Tracking
    code: "class PlayerMovementTracker\n{\npublic:\n    MovementMetrics playerMetrics;\n\
      \    \n    PlayerMovementTracker() : playerMetrics() // Default constructor\
      \ call\n    {\n        // Metrics are now ready for tracking\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The constructor performs minimal initialization work and should not be called
    frequently in performance-critical sections. It's recommended to reuse MovementMetrics
    instances when possible rather than creating new ones repeatedly.
  warnings: This is a constructor method, so it should not be called directly on existing
    objects. Calling it on already-initialized objects may lead to undefined behavior
    or data corruption.
