documentation:
  brief: Destroys the QuestHubDatabase instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the QuestHubDatabase class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory, closing database connections, and ensuring
    that all internal resources are properly released when an instance of the class
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper resource
    management and prevents memory leaks within the TrinityCore framework's quest
    system infrastructure.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of QuestHubDatabase instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    QuestHubDatabase db;\n    // Use db for database\
      \ operations\n    // When function ends, db destructor is automatically called\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing
    object lifetime. It's typically invoked automatically by the C++ runtime when
    objects go out of scope or are deleted. The implementation likely handles cleanup
    of database connections and internal data structures used for quest-related queries.
