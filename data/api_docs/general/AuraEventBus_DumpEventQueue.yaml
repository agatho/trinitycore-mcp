  brief: Dumps the contents of the aura event queue to the console for debugging purposes.
  description: The DumpEventQueue method outputs all pending aura events currently
    stored in the AuraEventBus queue to the system console or log. This utility function
    is primarily used during development and debugging to inspect the state of active
    aura events, helping developers understand event flow and timing. The method does
    not modify any internal state and is safe to call at any time. It typically outputs
    information such as event types, associated spell IDs, target GUIDs, and timestamps
    for each queued event.

    on the number of queued events.
