  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: AssignPrimaryTank
  signature: bool ThreatCoordinator::AssignPrimaryTank(int botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns a primary tank to the threat coordinator for managing group combat
    threats.
  description: The AssignPrimaryTank method is responsible for designating a specific
    bot as the primary tank within the ThreatCoordinator's management system. This
    method ensures that the designated bot will be prioritized in threat generation
    and management during group encounters, particularly in scenarios where multiple
    bots are involved in combat. The method evaluates whether the specified bot GUID
    corresponds to a valid and eligible tanking unit within the current group context.
    It returns true if the assignment was successful and false if the operation failed
    due to invalid parameters or system constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that should be assigned as
      the primary tank. This value must correspond to a valid bot entity within the
      current group or encounter context.
  returns: Returns true if the specified bot was successfully assigned as the primary
    tank, false otherwise. The method may return false if the provided GUID does not
    correspond to an active bot, if the bot is already designated as a primary tank,
    or if system constraints prevent assignment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Primary Tank Assignment
    code: "if (threatCoordinator.AssignPrimaryTank(12345)) {\n    // Successfully\
      \ assigned bot with GUID 12345 as primary tank\n    LOG_INFO(\"ai\", \"Primary\
      \ tank assigned successfully.\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to assign primary\
      \ tank\n    LOG_ERROR(\"ai\", \"Failed to assign primary tank.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Assignment Before Operation
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = GetBotGUID();\nif (botGuid != 0 && threatCoordinator.AssignPrimaryTank(botGuid))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with combat operations assuming primary tank is set\n  \
      \  StartCombatRoutine();\n} else {\n    // Handle case where assignment failed\n\
      \    LOG_WARN(\"ai\", \"Could not assign bot {} as primary tank.\", botGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ThreatCoordinator has access to a valid group
    context and that the specified bot GUID refers to an active member of the current
    encounter. The implementation likely involves internal state tracking of assigned
    tanks and may perform validation checks against existing assignments.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid parameter corresponds to a valid, active bot within
    the current group context; otherwise, the method will fail silently or return
    false. Avoid calling this method repeatedly without checking previous assignments
    to prevent unnecessary overhead.
