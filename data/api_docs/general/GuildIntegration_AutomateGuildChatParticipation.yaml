  class: GuildIntegration
  method: AutomateGuildChatParticipation
  signature: void GuildIntegration::AutomateGuildChatParticipation(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Enables automated participation in guild chat for a specified player.
  description: The AutomateGuildChatParticipation method configures a player to automatically
    engage in guild chat activities, such as sending predefined messages or responding
    to guild events. This functionality is typically used in automation scripts or
    botting systems to maintain guild presence without manual input. The method modifies
    internal player state flags and may interact with guild event handlers to ensure
    consistent participation. It requires a valid player reference and operates on
    the assumption that the player is already a member of a guild.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). Must point to a valid player object within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.AutomateGuildChatParticipation(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal player state and should only be called when
    the player is confirmed to be in a guild. The automation behavior may vary depending
    on server configuration and guild settings.
  warnings: Improper use of this method in official servers may violate terms of service
    or result in account penalties. Ensure proper authorization before implementing
    automated chat participation.
