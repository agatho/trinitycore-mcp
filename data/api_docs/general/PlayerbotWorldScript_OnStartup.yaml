documentation:
  brief: Initializes player bot subsystem during world server startup
  description: The OnStartup method is called when the world server begins initialization,
    allowing the PlayerbotWorldScript to perform necessary setup operations for player
    bot functionality. This method typically initializes internal data structures,
    loads configuration settings, and prepares the system for handling player bot
    requests. It serves as the primary entry point for initializing player bot behavior
    before any players connect to the server.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic implementation example
    code: "void PlayerbotWorldScript::OnStartup()\n{\n    // Initialize player bot\
      \ configuration\n    playerbotConfig.Load();\n    \n    // Setup bot AI managers\n\
      \    botAIManager = new BotAIManager();\n    \n    // Register event handlers\n\
      \    sWorld->SetPlayerBotEnabled(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is invoked only once during server startup and should not be
    called manually. It runs in the main thread context and may block server initialization
    until completion. Developers should avoid heavy operations or blocking calls within
    this method to prevent startup delays.
  warnings: Do not perform database operations or access player data structures in
    this method, as the world server may not be fully initialized. Avoid throwing
    exceptions that could prevent server startup.
