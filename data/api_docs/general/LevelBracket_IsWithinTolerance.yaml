  class: LevelBracket
  method: IsWithinTolerance
  signature: bool LevelBracket::IsWithinTolerance(uint32 totalBots) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified total bot count falls within the defined
    tolerance range of the level bracket.
  description: The IsWithinTolerance method evaluates if a given total number of bots
    is within an acceptable variance from the expected bot count for this level bracket.
    This functionality is commonly used in World of Warcraft's battleground and arena
    systems to ensure balanced matchmaking and team composition. The method compares
    the provided totalBots value against internal tolerance thresholds defined for
    the specific level bracket, returning true if the value lies within acceptable
    bounds, or false otherwise. This check helps maintain game balance by ensuring
    that bot populations do not deviate too far from expected values for a given player
    level range.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the total bot count is within the defined tolerance range
    of the level bracket; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Matchmaking
    code: "LevelBracket bracket;\nuint32 currentBots = 15;\nbool isValid = bracket.IsWithinTolerance(currentBots);\n\
      if (isValid)\n{\n    // Proceed with matchmaking\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot\
      \ count is within acceptable tolerance.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in Arena Team Composition
    code: "void ValidateArenaTeam(uint32 botCount)\n{\n    LevelBracket* bracket =\
      \ sWorld->GetLevelBracketForPlayer(playerLevel);\n    if (!bracket->IsWithinTolerance(botCount))\n\
      \    {\n        // Adjust team composition or reject match\n        sLog->outError(\"\
      Invalid bot count for level bracket %u\", playerLevel);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tolerance values that are typically defined
    based on game balance requirements and player level ranges. The tolerance mechanism
    helps prevent situations where bot populations become unbalanced relative to expected
    values for a given bracket.
  warnings: Ensure that the LevelBracket instance is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as uninitialized tolerance values may lead to incorrect results.
    This method does not perform any validation on the input parameter since it's
    not present in the signature.
