    stopAtFirstHit) const
documentation:
  brief: Tests if a ray intersects with the group model and returns the distance to
    the first hit point.
  description: The IntersectRay method performs a ray intersection test against the
    GroupModel, determining whether a given ray intersects with any of the model's
    geometry. It calculates the closest intersection point along the ray and stores
    the distance from the ray origin to that point. The method supports optional early
    termination when the first hit is found, which can improve performance for applications
    that only need to know if an intersection occurred without needing all intersection
    points. This functionality is commonly used in collision detection, line-of-sight
    checks, and object picking within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: ray
    description: Reference to an integer identifier representing the ray to test against
      the group model. The ray is typically defined by a starting point and direction
      vector, though the exact format depends on how rays are managed in the calling
      code.
  - name: distance
    description: Reference to a float value that will be updated with the distance
      from the ray origin to the first intersection point. If no intersection occurs,
      this value remains unchanged or is set to a default invalid value.
  - name: stopAtFirstHit
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to stop testing after finding the
      first intersection. When true, the method returns immediately upon the first
      hit; when false, it continues to test all possible intersections and may return
      multiple results (though typically only the closest is stored).
  returns: Returns true if the ray intersects with any part of the group model, false
    otherwise. If an intersection occurs, the 'distance' parameter is updated with
    the distance from the ray origin to the first hit point.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Ray Intersection Test
    code: "GroupModel* model = ...;\nint rayId = 12345;\nfloat hitDistance;\nif (model->IntersectRay(rayId,\
      \ hitDistance, true)) {\n    std::cout << \"Hit at distance: \" << hitDistance\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"No intersection\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Continuous Ray Testing for Line-of-Sight
    code: "GroupModel* model = ...;\nfloat distance;\nbool hit = model->IntersectRay(rayId,\
      \ distance, false);\nif (hit) {\n    // Process all intersections if needed\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Ray intersected at distance: \" << distance << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    // No intersection found\n    std::cout << \"No obstacles in path\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with ray management systems
    that define rays by their origin and direction. The 'ray' parameter should be
    a valid identifier managed by the application or engine's ray system. Performance
    can be improved by setting 'stopAtFirstHit' to true when only a simple yes/no
    intersection result is required.
  warnings: Ensure that the ray identifier passed in is valid and corresponds to an
    active ray definition; otherwise, behavior is undefined. The method does not validate
    ray parameters beyond ensuring they are properly referenced, so invalid rays may
    cause unexpected results or crashes.
