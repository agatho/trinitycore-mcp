  class: AreaTriggerBox
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void AreaTriggerBox::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const AreaTrigger
    * owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes area trigger box creation data to a ByteBuffer for transmission to
    a specific player.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the state and properties of an AreaTriggerBox
    object into a ByteBuffer, preparing it for network transmission to a designated
    player. This method is typically invoked during the initial synchronization of
    area triggers when a player enters their associated trigger zone. It ensures that
    the client receives all necessary information about the area trigger's dimensions,
    position, orientation, and other relevant attributes to properly render and handle
    the trigger in the game world. The method respects the owner-player relationship,
    ensuring only relevant data is sent based on the trigger's context and the receiver's
    permissions.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized area trigger box creation
      data will be written. This buffer is typically used for constructing network
      packets.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the AreaTrigger object that owns this box. Used to determine
      the trigger's properties and context during serialization.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive the created area trigger
      data. Controls visibility and access permissions for the transmitted information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Area Trigger Initialization
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      AreaTriggerBox box;

      Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      AreaTrigger* trigger = ...; // Get area trigger reference

      box.WriteCreate(data, trigger, player);

      // Send ''data'' to player via network handler'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's packet serialization system for
    area triggers. It assumes that the provided parameters are valid and properly
    initialized. The method does not perform any validation on input parameters beyond
    basic pointer checks.
  warnings: Ensure that the ByteBuffer 'data' is properly cleared or reset before
    calling this method to avoid data corruption. Also, be cautious when using this
    method with triggers that have complex ownership structures as it may lead to
    unexpected behavior if not handled correctly.
