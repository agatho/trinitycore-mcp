  class: PathfindingManager
  method: AssessPathQuality
  signature: PathQuality PathfindingManager::AssessPathQuality(const int & waypoints,
    const PathRequest & request)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the quality of a path based on waypoints and request
    parameters.
  description: The AssessPathQuality method analyzes the provided path data, including
    the number of waypoints and the associated path request, to determine the overall
    quality of the calculated route. This function is typically used within the TrinityCore
    AI system to assess whether a generated path meets certain criteria for usability
    or performance. The method considers factors such as path length, smoothness,
    and adherence to navigation constraints. It is commonly invoked during pathfinding
    operations to filter out suboptimal paths before they are returned to the requesting
    entity.
  parameters:
  - name: waypoints
    description: An integer reference representing the number of waypoints in the
      path. This value determines how many segments the path consists of and influences
      quality calculations.
  - name: request
    description: A constant reference to a PathRequest object that contains details
      about the path request, including start/end positions, movement flags, and other
      constraints used during path generation.
  returns: Returns a PathQuality enum value indicating the quality level of the path.
    Possible values may include PATH_QUALITY_LOW, PATH_QUALITY_MEDIUM, or PATH_QUALITY_HIGH
    depending on how well the path meets defined criteria such as distance, smoothness,
    and validity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of AssessPathQuality
    code: "int waypointCount = 5;\nPathRequest req;\nreq.start = {0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f};\n\
      req.end = {100.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f};\nPathQuality quality = pathfindingManager.AssessPathQuality(waypointCount,\
      \ req);\nif (quality == PATH_QUALITY_HIGH) {\n    // Proceed with using the\
      \ path\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal pathfinding infrastructure and should
    not be called directly by external modules unless necessary. The quality assessment
    may vary depending on server configuration settings related to pathfinding behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the PathRequest object passed contains valid data; otherwise,
    the result may be unpredictable or invalid. Avoid calling this method with zero
    waypoints as it could lead to undefined behavior.
