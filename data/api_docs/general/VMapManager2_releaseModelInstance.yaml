  signature: void VMapManager2::releaseModelInstance(const std::string & filename)
documentation:
  brief: Releases a previously loaded VMAP model instance by filename.
  description: The releaseModelInstance method is responsible for freeing memory and
    resources associated with a specific VMAP (Virtual Map) model that was previously
    loaded into the game world. This method ensures proper cleanup of model data when
    it's no longer needed, preventing memory leaks in the virtual map system. The
    operation typically occurs when a map tile or area is unloaded from memory, or
    when the server needs to free up resources for other operations. It is part of
    the VMapManager2 class which manages all virtual map data and their lifecycle
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: filename
    description: The name of the model file to be released from memory. This should
      match the filename used when originally loading the model, including any path
      information if applicable.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Model Release
    code: 'VMapManager2* vmapManager = VMapFactory::createOrGetVMapManager();

      vmapManager->releaseModelInstance("world\maps\elwynnforest\elwynnforest.obj");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Model Release
    code: "VMapManager2* vmapManager = VMapFactory::createOrGetVMapManager();\nif\
      \ (someCondition)\n{\n    vmapManager->releaseModelInstance(\"world\\maps\\\
      azeroth\\dunmorogh\\dunmorogh.obj\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the VMapManager2 system when
    managing model lifecycle. Developers should not normally need to call this directly
    unless implementing custom map loading/unloading logic. The method assumes that
    the specified filename exists in the loaded models cache and may silently fail
    if the model isn't currently loaded.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent filename may result
    in undefined behavior or silent failures. Ensure that you only call releaseModelInstance
    for models that have been previously loaded successfully. This method should not
    be called concurrently with other VMapManager2 operations without proper synchronization.
