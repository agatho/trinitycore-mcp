  method: Interpolate
  signature: float DifficultyCurve::Interpolate(float skill) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a interpolated difficulty value based on the provided
    skill level.
  description: The DifficultyCurve::Interpolate method performs a mathematical interpolation
    to determine a difficulty factor or value corresponding to a given skill level.
    This is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to adjust game mechanics
    such as quest rewards, mob difficulty scaling, or experience point calculations
    based on player skill or level. The method uses internal curve data that defines
    how difficulty should change with respect to skill input. It expects a valid float
    value representing the skill level and returns a corresponding interpolated difficulty
    factor. The implementation likely utilizes pre-defined control points or a lookup
    table for smooth interpolation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the interpolated difficulty factor corresponding
    to the provided skill level. This value typically ranges between 0.0 and 1.0,
    though exact bounds depend on the internal curve definition. Returns 0.0 if the
    skill is below the minimum defined range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Skill Interpolation
    code: 'DifficultyCurve curve;

      float difficulty = curve.Interpolate(50.0f);

      // Returns interpolated difficulty factor for skill level 50'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Interpolated Value in Quest Scaling
    code: 'DifficultyCurve questScalingCurve;

      float playerSkill = player->GetSkillValue(SKILL_MINING);

      float rewardMultiplier = questScalingCurve.Interpolate(playerSkill);

      // Adjusts quest rewards based on player''s mining skill level'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with predefined difficulty curves
    stored within the game's data files. The interpolation algorithm may use linear,
    cubic, or other curve types depending on how the DifficultyCurve was initialized.
    Performance is generally optimal as it's a simple mathematical operation, but
    repeated calls should be considered for optimization in performance-critical code
    paths.
  warnings: Ensure that the skill parameter passed to this method is within expected
    ranges; passing extremely high or low values may result in unexpected interpolation
    behavior or out-of-bounds access if not properly validated. The method assumes
    valid internal curve data has been loaded and initialized.
