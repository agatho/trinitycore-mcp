documentation:
  brief: Checks if a target has the Vampiric Touch debuff applied.
  description: The HasVampiricTouch method determines whether a specific target, identified
    by their GUID, currently has the Vampiric Touch spell effect active on them. This
    method is typically used in shadow priest AI logic to track the status of debuffs
    and make decisions about spell casting. The method performs a lookup in an internal
    tracking structure that maintains information about active Shadow DoT effects
    on targets.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target with the specified GUID has the Vampiric Touch
    debuff applied, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a target has Vampiric Touch
    code: "if (shadowDotTracker.HasVampiricTouch(targetGuid)) {\n    // Target already\
      \ has Vampiric Touch\n    // Do not apply it again\n    return;\n}\n// Apply\
      \ Vampiric Touch to the target"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on an internal data structure that tracks active
    debuffs. The implementation may involve checking a map or set of GUIDs associated
    with active Vampiric Touch effects. Performance is expected to be O(1) for the
    lookup operation.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method corresponds to a valid target
    in the current combat context, as invalid GUIDs might lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect results.
