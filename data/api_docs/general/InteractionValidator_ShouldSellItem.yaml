  signature: bool InteractionValidator::ShouldSellItem(::Player * bot, ::Item * item)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot player should sell a given item based on inventory
    management rules.
  description: The ShouldSellItem method evaluates if a specified item held by a bot
    player should be sold. This decision is typically made based on factors such as
    item value, inventory space constraints, and the bot's current needs. The method
    is part of the InteractionValidator class which handles various validation checks
    for bot interactions within the TrinityCore framework. It is commonly used in
    automated trading or inventory management systems where bots need to make decisions
    about selling items to optimize their load or generate gold.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that owns the item.
      Must not be null.
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to the Item object that is being evaluated for potential
      sale. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the item should be sold according to bot logic and inventory
    rules; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot AI
    code: "if (validator.ShouldSellItem(bot, item)) {\n    bot->GetSession()->SendSellItem(item);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with inventory management loop
    code: "for (uint8 i = INVENTORY_SLOT_ITEM_START; i < INVENTORY_SLOT_ITEM_END;\
      \ ++i) {\n    Item* item = bot->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0, i);\n   \
      \ if (item && validator.ShouldSellItem(bot, item)) {\n        bot->DestroyItem(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0,\
      \ i, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely considers factors such as item quality, vendor sell price,
    and current inventory capacity. It may also integrate with the bot's configured
    selling strategy or market analysis logic. The implementation assumes that both
    the bot and item pointers are valid before calling.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot and item parameters are not null before invoking this
    method to prevent undefined behavior. Be cautious when using this in high-frequency
    loops as it may involve multiple checks and could impact performance if not optimized.
