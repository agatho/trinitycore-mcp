  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: ArchiveOldData
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::ArchiveOldData(uint64_t olderThanMicroseconds)
documentation:
  brief: Archives performance data older than the specified age threshold.
  description: The ArchiveOldData method is responsible for moving performance analytics
    data that is older than a given time threshold into an archive storage. This method
    helps manage database size and performance by removing outdated records while
    preserving historical data for analysis. The method operates on a time-based cutoff,
    using microseconds as the unit of measurement to determine which records are considered
    'old'. It is typically invoked periodically to maintain optimal database health
    and ensure that only relevant recent data is actively queried.
  parameters:
  - name: olderThanMicroseconds
    description: The age threshold in microseconds. Records older than this value
      will be archived. A value of 0 indicates all records should be archived.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Archive data older than 30 days
    code: 'uint64_t thirtyDaysInMicroseconds = 30ULL * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000000;

      botAnalytics->ArchiveOldData(thirtyDaysInMicroseconds);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Archive all data immediately
    code: botAnalytics->ArchiveOldData(0);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database operations and may have performance
    implications if called frequently or with large datasets. It is recommended to
    call this method during low-traffic periods or as part of a scheduled maintenance
    task.
  warnings: Calling this method with a very small value for olderThanMicroseconds
    could result in archiving too much data at once, potentially causing performance
    degradation. Ensure that the threshold is set appropriately based on your retention
    policy and system capacity.
