  class: GroupMgr
  method: RegisterGroupDbStoreId
  signature: void GroupMgr::RegisterGroupDbStoreId(int storageId, Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a group with a specific database storage ID in the group manager's
    internal storage.
  description: The RegisterGroupDbStoreId method associates a Group object with a
    given storage ID within the GroupMgr's internal database store. This allows the
    system to efficiently retrieve and manage groups based on their unique database
    identifiers. The method is typically used during group creation or loading from
    the database to ensure proper indexing and lookup capabilities. It maintains an
    internal mapping between storage IDs and Group pointers, which is essential for
    group persistence and synchronization across the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: storageId
    description: An integer identifier representing the database storage location
      for the group. This ID should correspond to a valid entry in the group database
      table.
  - name: group
    description: A pointer to the Group object that needs to be registered with the
      specified storage ID. The group must be a valid, initialized Group instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Registration Example
    code: 'Group* myGroup = new Group();

      int dbId = 12345;

      GroupMgr::instance()->RegisterGroupDbStoreId(dbId, myGroup);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Registration During Group Creation
    code: "void CreateAndRegisterGroup()\n{\n    Group* newGroup = new Group();\n\
      \    // ... initialize group members ...\n    int storageId = sObjectMgr->GetNextGroupId();\n\
      \    GroupMgr::instance()->RegisterGroupDbStoreId(storageId, newGroup);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided group pointer is valid and properly
    initialized. The storage ID should be unique within the context of the database
    to prevent conflicts. Internally, this method likely uses a map or similar data
    structure for fast lookup by storage ID.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the storageId is valid and not already registered to avoid
    potential data corruption or memory leaks.
