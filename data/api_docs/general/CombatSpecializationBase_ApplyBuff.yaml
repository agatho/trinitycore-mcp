  method: ApplyBuff
  signature: void CombatSpecializationBase::ApplyBuff(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a specified buff spell to the combat specialization.
  description: The ApplyBuff method is used to apply a buff spell identified by its
    spell ID to the current combat specialization. This method typically handles the
    logic for activating a buff effect, which could include increasing damage output,
    enhancing defensive capabilities, or providing other beneficial effects. The implementation
    likely involves checking if the spell can be applied, validating prerequisites
    such as cooldowns or resource requirements, and then applying the spell's effects
    through the TrinityCore spell system. This method is commonly used in combat specialization
    systems where specific buffs are activated based on player actions or conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to be applied as a buff. This
      must correspond to a valid spell entry in the TrinityCore database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Buff Application
    code: 'CombatSpecializationBase* spec = player->GetCombatSpecialization();

      spec->ApplyBuff(12345); // Applies the buff with spell ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Buff Application
    code: "if (player->HasAura(67890)) {\n    CombatSpecializationBase* spec = player->GetCombatSpecialization();\n\
      \    spec->ApplyBuff(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the spell system's aura application logic.
    It may perform checks for existing auras, validate spell casting requirements,
    and handle the visual effects associated with buff application. The method should
    be called from within a valid combat context to ensure proper behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the spell ID is valid or that
    prerequisites are met may result in undefined behavior or client-side issues.
    Ensure that the spell being applied is appropriate for the current specialization
    and combat state.
