  class: PathGenerator
  method: SetActualEndPosition
  signature: void PathGenerator::SetActualEndPosition(const int & point)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the actual end position for a path generator using the specified point
    index.
  description: The SetActualEndPosition method configures the final destination point
    for a pathfinding operation within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically
    used during navigation calculations to define where an AI-controlled unit or object
    should ultimately move. The method accepts an integer parameter representing the
    index of the point in the path array that should be treated as the actual end
    position. It's important to note that this method modifies internal state and
    may affect subsequent pathfinding behavior. The point index should correspond
    to a valid location within the current path structure, otherwise undefined behavior
    may occur.
  parameters:
  - name: point
    description: An integer reference representing the index of the point in the path
      array that will be set as the actual end position. This index must be valid
      and correspond to an existing point within the current path structure.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting End Position for AI Navigation
    code: 'PathGenerator* pathGen = new PathGenerator();

      // Assume path has been generated with multiple waypoints

      int targetPointIndex = 5;

      pathGen->SetActualEndPosition(targetPointIndex);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the PathGenerator object
    and should be called after a path has been successfully generated. The point index
    parameter must reference an existing point in the current path; otherwise, accessing
    invalid memory may occur.
  warnings: Passing an invalid point index (e.g., one that exceeds the number of points
    in the path) can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always ensure the point
    index is within valid bounds before calling this method.
