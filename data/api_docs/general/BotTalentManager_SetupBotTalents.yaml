    level)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and applies talent specifications to a bot player character.
  description: The SetupBotTalents method configures the talent tree for a specified
    bot player by assigning talents based on the provided specialization ID and level.
    This method ensures that the bot's talent distribution matches the intended playstyle
    and class capabilities. It handles the internal setup of talent points, resets
    existing talents if necessary, and applies the new talent configuration according
    to the game's talent system mechanics. The method requires a valid player object
    representing the bot, a valid specialization ID, and a level that determines the
    maximum talent points available for allocation.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character whose
      talents are being configured. Must be a valid non-null pointer to an existing
      bot player.
  - name: specId
    description: The specialization ID that determines which talent tree and talents
      should be applied to the bot. Valid values typically correspond to class-specific
      specialization identifiers (e.g., 0 for first spec, 1 for second spec).
  - name: level
    description: The level of the bot character, which influences how many talent
      points are available for allocation and determines the maximum talent tree depth
      that can be accessed.
  returns: Returns true if the talent setup was successfully applied to the bot; returns
    false if the operation failed due to invalid parameters, unsupported class/spec
    combination, or internal errors during the talent application process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Talent Setup
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume valid bot player\nbool success = BotTalentManager::SetupBotTalents(myBot,\
      \ 0, 60);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Talent setup completed successfully\n   \
      \ sLog->outString(\"Bot talents configured for level 60.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Up a Specific Spec for a Bot
    code: "Player* warlockBot = ...; // Assume valid warlock bot player\nuint8 specId\
      \ = 2; // Assuming 2 is the destruction specialization\nuint32 botLevel = 70;\n\
      bool result = BotTalentManager::SetupBotTalents(warlockBot, specId, botLevel);\n\
      if (!result)\n{\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to setup talents for warlock bot\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally manages the talent point allocation and reset logic.
    It assumes that the provided player object is already initialized and valid. The
    method may perform database operations or internal state updates, so it should
    be called during appropriate game states where such modifications are allowed.
    Performance impact is minimal for single bot setups but could accumulate with
    many bots.
  warnings: Ensure the specId corresponds to a valid specialization for the bot's
    class; invalid spec IDs may cause undefined behavior or failed setup. Calling
    this method on non-bot players or players not yet initialized can lead to crashes
    or corrupted talent data. Avoid calling this method during active combat or critical
    gameplay events.
