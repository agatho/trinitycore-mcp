  class: ProfessionManager
  method: GetProfessionTypeFromSkillId
  signature: ProfessionType ProfessionManager::GetProfessionTypeFromSkillId(uint16
    skillId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the profession type associated with a given skill ID.
  description: The GetProfessionTypeFromSkillId method maps a skill identifier to
    its corresponding profession type within the TrinityCore framework. This is commonly
    used when processing player actions related to crafting, gathering, or other skill-based
    activities. The method performs a lookup in an internal mapping structure that
    associates skill IDs with their respective profession types. It's essential for
    determining what kind of profession (e.g., Mining, Herbalism, Blacksmithing) a
    particular skill represents, enabling proper game logic handling for skill-based
    interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a ProfessionType enum value representing the type of profession
    associated with the provided skill ID. If no mapping exists for the given skill
    ID, the method may return an invalid or default profession type, depending on
    implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint16 miningSkillId = 171;\nProfessionType type = sProfessionManager->GetProfessionTypeFromSkillId(miningSkillId);\n\
      if (type == PROFESSION_MINING)\n{\n    // Handle mining profession logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal data structures that are populated
    during server initialization or when loading skill/profession definitions from
    database files. It's recommended to ensure the skill ID passed is valid before
    calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or unregistered skill ID may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect profession type being returned. Always validate input parameters
    if possible, especially when dealing with dynamic skill IDs from external sources.
