  class: Creature
  method: SetSessile
  signature: void Creature::SetSessile(bool sessile)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the creature's sessile state to control its movement behavior.
  description: The SetSessile method controls whether a creature is allowed to move
    or not. When set to true, the creature enters a sessile state where it cannot
    move, typically used for stationary creatures like guards or NPCs that should
    remain in place. When set to false, the creature can move normally. This method
    is commonly used during creature AI scripting and event handling to manage creature
    behavior during specific game events.
  parameters:
  - name: sessile
    description: A boolean value indicating whether the creature should be in sessile
      state (true) or not (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Creature* creature = GetCreature();

      creature->SetSessile(true); // Makes the creature stationary

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Creature* creature = GetCreature();\nif (creature->GetEntry() == 12345)\n\
      {\n    creature->SetSessile(true);\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the creature's movement state and should be used carefully
    during AI events. It typically impacts the creature's pathfinding behavior and
    can influence how the creature interacts with players or other NPCs.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may cause creatures to become stuck or unable
    to move, potentially leading to game-breaking issues if not handled correctly.
    Always ensure that sessile states are properly reset after events.
