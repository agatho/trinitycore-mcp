  method: JustAppeared
  signature: void CreatureAI::JustAppeared()
documentation:
  brief: Called when a creature first appears in the world, after it has been spawned
    and initialized.
  description: The JustAppeared method is invoked by the TrinityCore AI system when
    a CreatureAI object is initialized and the associated creature has just become
    visible in the game world. This method serves as an entry point for custom AI
    logic that should execute immediately upon the creature's appearance, such as
    setting initial states, registering events, or performing one-time setup operations.
    It is called once per creature instance during its lifetime, typically after the
    creature has been added to the world and all necessary initialization has completed.
    The method does not accept any parameters and does not return a value, making
    it suitable for executing side-effect operations without complex interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Override Example
    code: "class MyCustomCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    explicit\
      \ MyCustomCreatureAI(Creature* creature) : CreatureAI(creature) {}\n\n    void\
      \ JustAppeared() override\n    {\n        // Initialize creature behavior upon\
      \ appearance\n        me->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n        me->SetFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS,\
      \ UNIT_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Event Registration
    code: "class BossAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    explicit BossAI(Creature*\
      \ creature) : CreatureAI(creature) {}\n\n    void JustAppeared() override\n\
      \    {\n        // Start combat timer and register for events\n        me->SetReactState(REACT_DEFENSIVE);\n\
      \        me->SetFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS, UNIT_FLAG_NON_ATTACKABLE);\n        me->CastSpell(me,\
      \ SPELL_SUMMON_MINIONS, true);\n        events.ScheduleEvent(EVENT_CHECK_HEALTH,\
      \ 1000);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during the creature's initialization phase, after it
    has been added to the world but before any AI tick processing begins. It is important
    to note that this method may be called multiple times if a creature is despawned
    and respawned, though typically only once per creature instance. The method should
    not be used for heavy computations or long-running operations as it's part of
    the initialization sequence.
  warnings: Avoid performing operations that might cause the creature to become invalid
    or trigger other AI events within JustAppeared, as this can lead to undefined
    behavior. Do not attempt to modify creature state in a way that conflicts with
    the game's internal systems during this brief initialization window.
