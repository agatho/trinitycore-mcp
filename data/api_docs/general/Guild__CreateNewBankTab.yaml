  class: Guild
  method: _CreateNewBankTab
  signature: void Guild::_CreateNewBankTab(int trans)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new bank tab for the guild with the specified transaction.
  description: The _CreateNewBankTab method is an internal utility function within
    the Guild class responsible for initializing and setting up a new bank tab for
    the guild. This method likely handles database operations and in-memory state
    updates to ensure the new tab is properly registered within the guild's banking
    system. It accepts a transaction parameter which may be used to manage database
    consistency or rollback behavior during the creation process. The method is typically
    invoked when a guild leader or officer adds a new bank tab through in-game interface
    or administrative commands.
  parameters:
  - name: trans
    description: Transaction identifier used for database operations. This parameter
      likely controls how the database changes are committed, potentially supporting
      rollback mechanisms or batch processing of related updates.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new bank tab with transaction
    code: "Guild* guild = sObjectAccessor->GetGuildById(guildId);\nif (guild)\n{\n\
      \    guild->_CreateNewBankTab(1); // Create new bank tab using transaction ID\
      \ 1\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is an internal method and should not be called directly from external
    code. The transaction parameter suggests this method may be part of a larger transactional
    system for guild management operations. Implementation likely involves database
    writes to store the new tab configuration and updates to in-memory guild data
    structures.
  warnings: Direct invocation of this internal method can lead to inconsistent guild
    state if not properly coordinated with other guild management functions. The transaction
    parameter must be handled carefully to avoid database locking or consistency issues.
