  class: FormationManager
  method: EnableAdaptiveFormations
  signature: void FormationManager::EnableAdaptiveFormations(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables adaptive formations for units in the FormationManager.
  description: The EnableAdaptiveFormations method controls whether units managed
    by the FormationManager will dynamically adjust their positioning based on combat
    conditions and AI behavior. When enabled, formations can adapt to changing battlefield
    dynamics such as enemy movement, terrain, or threat levels. This feature allows
    for more realistic and responsive unit behavior during group combat scenarios.
    The method does not require any specific preconditions but may affect existing
    formation states immediately upon activation.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean flag that determines whether adaptive formations should be
      enabled (true) or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Adaptive Formations
    code: 'FormationManager* fm = ...;

      fm->EnableAdaptiveFormations(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Adaptive Formations
    code: 'FormationManager* fm = ...;

      fm->EnableAdaptiveFormations(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the FormationManager and affects
    how units within it respond to AI-driven positioning updates. It is recommended
    to call this during initialization or when transitioning between different combat
    strategies.
