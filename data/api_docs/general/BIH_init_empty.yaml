  brief: Initializes a BIH (Bounding Interval Hierarchy) structure with empty state
  description: The init_empty method initializes a BIH (Bounding Interval Hierarchy)
    structure, setting it up for use with empty data. This method prepares the internal
    state of the BIH object to accept new bounding volumes and perform spatial queries.
    It typically resets all internal counters, clears any existing hierarchy data,
    and ensures that the structure is in a valid state for subsequent operations.
    The BIH is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore for efficient spatial
    partitioning and collision detection in game world objects.

  - title: Basic BIH initialization
    code: 'BIH bih;

      bih.init_empty();

      // BIH is now ready for use with empty data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any other BIH operations to ensure proper
    initialization. The BIH structure will be in a valid but empty state after calling
    this method, and subsequent calls to add bounding volumes or perform queries will
    work correctly.
