documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the creature GUID associated with a specific actor in the conversation.
  description: The GetActorCreature method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID)
    of the creature that is assigned to a particular actor within a conversation.
    This method is typically used when working with scripted conversations where actors
    are represented by game entities such as NPCs. The returned value represents the
    creature's GUID, which can be used to interact with or reference the specific
    NPC in the game world. The method takes an index parameter that specifies which
    actor's creature GUID should be retrieved from the conversation's internal actor
    list.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the creature associated
    with the specified actor, or nullptr if the actor index is invalid or no creature
    is assigned.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Creature GUID for First Actor
    code: "Conversation* conv = sObjectAccessor->GetConversation(12345);\nif (conv)\n\
      {\n    int* creatureGuid = conv->GetActorCreature(0);\n    if (creatureGuid)\n\
      \    {\n        // Use the creature GUID to get the actual creature object\n\
      \        Creature* creature = sObjectAccessor->GetCreature(*creatureGuid);\n\
      \        if (creature)\n        {\n            // Perform actions with the creature\n\
      \            creature->Say(\"Hello, player!\", LANG_UNIVERSAL, 0);\n       \
      \ }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that actors in a conversation are associated with creatures.
    The actor index should be validated before calling this method to avoid accessing
    invalid memory. The returned pointer points to an internal data member, so it
    should not be modified directly.
  warnings: Do not dereference the returned pointer without checking for null values.
    Accessing invalid actor indices may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure
    that the conversation object is valid and properly initialized before calling
    this method.
