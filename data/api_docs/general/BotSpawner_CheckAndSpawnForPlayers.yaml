  class: BotSpawner
  method: CheckAndSpawnForPlayers
  signature: void BotSpawner::CheckAndSpawnForPlayers()
documentation:
  brief: Checks player conditions and spawns bot characters for active players in
    the game world.
  description: The CheckAndSpawnForPlayers method evaluates the current state of players
    within the game world to determine whether bot characters should be spawned. It
    typically checks if a player is eligible for bot assistance, such as being in
    a specific zone or meeting certain criteria like level requirements or quest progress.
    This method is part of the BotSpawner class and is responsible for managing the
    automated creation of bot companions based on predefined rules and conditions
    set by the server configuration. The spawning process may involve checking existing
    bot limits, player permissions, and game state to ensure that bots are introduced
    appropriately without disrupting gameplay balance.

    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    botSpawner.CheckAndSpawnForPlayers();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called periodically during the game loop or triggered
    by specific events such as player login or zone entry. It's important to note
    that bot spawning behavior can be configured via server settings, and this method
    respects those configurations to avoid over-spawning bots.
  warnings: Improper use of this method or incorrect configuration of bot limits may
    lead to performance degradation or unintended gameplay effects. Ensure that the
    conditions under which bots are spawned align with your server's intended mechanics.
