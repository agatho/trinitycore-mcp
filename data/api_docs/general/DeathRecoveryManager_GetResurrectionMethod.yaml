documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current resurrection method configured for the death recovery
    system.
  description: The GetResurrectionMethod function returns the ResurrectionMethod enum
    value that defines how a player will be resurrected upon death. This method is
    part of the DeathRecoveryManager class which handles various aspects of character
    resurrection and death-related mechanics in TrinityCore. The returned value indicates
    whether the player will be resurrected at the graveyard, by a spirit healer, or
    through other available methods based on server configuration and player state.
    This function does not modify any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ResurrectionMethod enum value indicating the current resurrection method.
    Possible values include methods such as RESURRECTION_METHOD_GRAVEYARD, RESURRECTION_METHOD_SPIRIT_HEALER,
    or RESURRECTION_METHOD_NONE depending on server settings and player conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "DeathRecoveryManager* deathRecovery = player->GetDeathRecoveryManager();\n\
      ResurrectionMethod method = deathRecovery->GetResurrectionMethod();\nif (method\
      \ == RESURRECTION_METHOD_GRAVEYARD)\n{\n    // Handle graveyard resurrection\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other death recovery functions
    to determine the appropriate resurrection behavior. The actual resurrection process
    may be influenced by additional factors such as player level, zone restrictions,
    and server rules.
