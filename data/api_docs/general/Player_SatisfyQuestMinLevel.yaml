  signature: bool Player::SatisfyQuestMinLevel(const Quest * qInfo, bool msg) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player meets the minimum level requirements for a quest.
  description: This method checks if the player's current level satisfies the minimum
    level requirement specified in the quest data. It is used internally by the game
    system to validate whether a player can accept or complete a quest based on their
    level. The method returns true if the player meets the required level, false otherwise.
    This functionality is crucial for quest system validation and helps ensure proper
    quest progression within the game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: qInfo
    description: Pointer to the Quest object containing the minimum level requirement
      that needs to be checked against the player's current level.
  - name: msg
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to display messages to the player
      when the level requirements are not met. If true, appropriate messages will
      be shown; if false, no messages will be displayed.
  returns: Returns true if the player's level meets or exceeds the minimum level requirement
    specified in the quest, false otherwise. This indicates whether the player can
    proceed with the quest based on their current level.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->SatisfyQuestMinLevel(quest, true)) {\n    // Player meets minimum\
      \ level requirement\n    // Proceed with quest acceptance or completion\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "bool result = player->SatisfyQuestMinLevel(quest, false);\nif (result)\
      \ {\n    // Player meets minimum level requirement\n    // No message displayed\n\
      } else {\n    // Player does not meet minimum level requirement\n    // Message\
      \ would have been displayed if msg was true\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during quest acceptance and completion processes.
    It's important to note that this method only checks the minimum level requirement,
    not maximum level or other quest requirements. The method may be called multiple
    times during quest processing depending on the game mechanics.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a standalone check for quest validity;
    it is primarily intended for internal use within the quest system. Using this
    method without proper context may lead to incorrect quest progression or player
    experience issues.
