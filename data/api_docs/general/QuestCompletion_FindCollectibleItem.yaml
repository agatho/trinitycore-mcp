  signature: bool QuestCompletion::FindCollectibleItem(Player * bot, QuestObjectiveData
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has collected all required items for a quest objective.
  description: The FindCollectibleItem method determines whether a player has gathered
    all necessary collectible items required to complete a specific quest objective.
    This method is typically used within the quest completion logic to validate that
    all item collection requirements have been met. It evaluates the player's inventory
    and quest progress data to verify if the specified objective criteria are satisfied.
    The method operates on a provided QuestObjectiveData structure which contains
    information about the required items, quantities, and other relevant parameters
    for the objective.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player character performing
      the quest completion check
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing the details
      of the quest objective being validated, including required items and quantities
  returns: Returns true if all collectible items required for the quest objective
    have been collected by the player, false otherwise. The method returns false when
    any item requirement is not met or when the objective data is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Objective Validation
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nQuestObjectiveData objective = ...;\nbool isValid\
      \ = QuestCompletion::FindCollectibleItem(player, objective);\nif (isValid) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with quest completion\n    player->CompleteQuest(...);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Completion Logic
    code: "void HandleQuestCompletion(Player* player, uint32 questId) {\n    Quest\
      \ const* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(questId);\n    if (!quest) return;\n\
      \    \n    for (uint8 i = 0; i < QUEST_OBJECTIVES_COUNT; ++i) {\n        QuestObjectiveData&\
      \ objective = player->GetQuestObjective(i);\n        if (objective.type == QUEST_OBJECTIVE_ITEM_COLLECTION)\
      \ {\n            if (!QuestCompletion::FindCollectibleItem(player, objective))\
      \ {\n                // Quest cannot be completed yet\n                return;\n\
      \            }\n        }\n    }\n    // All objectives met - complete quest\n\
      \    player->CompleteQuest(questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's current inventory state and quest tracking
    data. It assumes that the QuestObjectiveData structure has been properly initialized
    with valid item requirements before calling. The method may perform database queries
    to verify item ownership, so performance should be considered in high-frequency
    scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the objective parameter contains valid data before calling
    this method, as invalid or uninitialized data could lead to unexpected behavior.
    This method does not modify player state directly; it only performs validation
    checks.
