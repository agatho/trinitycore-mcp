  class: DynamicObject
  method: SetDuration
  signature: void DynamicObject::SetDuration(int newDuration)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the duration of the dynamic object, determining how long it will remain
    active in the game world.
  description: The SetDuration method configures the lifetime of a DynamicObject instance,
    specifying the number of milliseconds the object should persist before being automatically
    removed from the game world. This is commonly used for spell effects that have
    a time-based duration, such as area-of-effect spells or summoned objects. The
    duration value directly affects when the object's destructor will be called and
    its associated resources freed. Setting a duration of zero or negative values
    typically results in immediate removal of the object.
  parameters:
  - name: newDuration
    description: The new duration in milliseconds for which the dynamic object should
      remain active. A value of zero or less will cause the object to be removed immediately.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a 5-second duration for a spell effect
    code: 'DynamicObject* dynObj = ...;

      dynObj->SetDuration(5000); // Set to 5 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Immediately removing a dynamic object
    code: 'DynamicObject* dynObj = ...;

      dynObj->SetDuration(0); // Remove immediately'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal duration timer of the DynamicObject.
    It should be called before the object is added to the world or after any existing
    duration has been properly handled to avoid unexpected behavior. The actual removal
    occurs during the next update cycle.
  warnings: Calling SetDuration with a very large value may cause performance issues
    or memory leaks if not properly managed. Avoid setting negative values unless
    explicitly required by specific game mechanics, as this could lead to undefined
    behavior.
