  method: SetSpawnedByDefault
  signature: void GameObject::SetSpawnedByDefault(bool b)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the game object should spawn by default.
  description: The SetSpawnedByDefault method configures the default spawning behavior
    of a GameObject instance. When set to true, the game object will be included in
    the default spawn list for its map and phase, making it appear when the world
    loads or when players enter the relevant area. When set to false, the object will
    not spawn automatically unless explicitly summoned through other means. This method
    is typically used during object initialization or configuration to define how
    the object should behave in the world's spawning system.
  parameters:
  - name: b
    description: Boolean value indicating whether the game object should spawn by
      default. True enables default spawning, false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Default Spawning
    code: 'GameObject* go = player->SummonGameObject(12345, position, orientation,
      0);

      go->SetSpawnedByDefault(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Default Spawning
    code: "GameObject* go = ObjectAccessor::GetGameObject(*player, guid);\nif (go)\n\
      {\n    go->SetSpawnedByDefault(false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies an internal flag that affects the GameObject's presence
    in the world's spawn manager. The change takes effect immediately for objects
    already in the world, but may not be persistent across server restarts unless
    saved to the database. This is a core gameplay mechanic that controls object visibility
    and availability.
  warnings: Modifying this flag on objects that are already spawned in the world may
    cause unexpected behavior if not handled carefully. Ensure that any changes to
    spawning behavior are consistent with the intended game design and do not conflict
    with existing spawn groups or phases.
