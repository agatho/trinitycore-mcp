  signature: PerformanceMetrics PlayerbotConfig::GetPerformanceMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current performance metrics configuration for player bots
  description: This method returns a PerformanceMetrics structure containing configuration
    values that control how player bot performance is measured and reported. The returned
    metrics typically include settings related to update frequency, logging intervals,
    and resource usage thresholds. This configuration is used by the playerbot system
    to monitor and optimize bot behavior without impacting server performance. The
    method does not modify any internal state and is safe to call from any thread
    context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A PerformanceMetrics object containing current configuration values for
    player bot performance monitoring, including update intervals, logging thresholds,
    and resource constraints
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and display performance metrics
    code: 'PlayerbotConfig& config = sPlayerbotAIConfig;

      PerformanceMetrics metrics = config.GetPerformanceMetrics();

      LOG_INFO("playerbots", "Bot performance update interval: {} seconds", metrics.updateIntervalSeconds);

      LOG_INFO("playerbots", "Logging threshold: {}", metrics.logThreshold);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned PerformanceMetrics object is a copy of the internal configuration
    and modifications to it will not affect the actual playerbot settings. This method
    performs no I/O operations and has minimal performance impact.
