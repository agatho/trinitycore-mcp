documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has a specific currency item in their inventory
  description: The HasCurrency method determines whether a player possesses a particular
    currency type with a specified amount. This method is commonly used in game mechanics
    to verify currency availability for quests, purchases, or other gameplay interactions.
    It checks both the existence of the currency and the quantity required. The method
    returns true if the currency exists in sufficient quantities, false otherwise.
    This functionality is essential for implementing currency-based systems such as
    vendor transactions, quest rewards, or achievement requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The currency ID to check for. This typically corresponds to a specific
      currency type defined in the game database.
  - name: amount
    description: The minimum amount of currency required to consider it as having.
      This represents the quantity needed to be considered present.
  returns: Returns true if the player has the specified currency with at least the
    given amount, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->HasCurrency(2973, 100)) {\n    // Player has at least 100 of\
      \ currency ID 2973\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "if (player->HasCurrency(394, 1000)) {\n    // Player has at least 1000\
      \ of currency ID 394\n    // This is used for checking achievement requirements\
      \ or vendor purchases\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally uses the player's inventory and currency system to
    check if a currency exists. It does not modify any data but simply checks existing
    values. Performance considerations are minimal as it only performs a simple lookup.
  warnings: Be aware that this method may return false even when the player has the
    currency but not in sufficient quantities. Always double-check the amount parameter
    for accuracy.
