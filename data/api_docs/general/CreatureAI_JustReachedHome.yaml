  method: JustReachedHome
  signature: void CreatureAI::JustReachedHome()
documentation:
  brief: Called when a creature successfully returns to its home position after being
    forced to move away.
  description: The JustReachedHome method is invoked in the CreatureAI class when
    a creature has completed its return journey to its original spawn location. This
    typically occurs after the creature has been aggroed, moved from its spawn point,
    and then successfully returned to that location. The method serves as a callback
    for AI logic that needs to execute upon the creature's return to its home position.
    It is commonly used in scenarios where creatures are programmed to return to their
    spawn point after chasing targets or engaging in combat, ensuring proper behavior
    and state management. This method does not take any parameters and does not return
    any value.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void JustReachedHome()\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Reset creature state when returning home\n   \
      \     me->SetReactState(REACT_IDLE);\n        me->RemoveAllAuras();\n      \
      \  // Additional logic here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Combat State Reset
    code: "class AdvancedCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void JustReachedHome()\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Ensure creature is idle and reset combat state\n\
      \        if (me->IsInCombat())\n            me->CombatStop(true);\n        \n\
      \        // Reset any movement or AI flags\n        me->SetFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS,\
      \ UNIT_FLAG_IMMUNE_TO_PC);\n        \n        // Log event for debugging\n \
      \       sLog->outString(\"Creature %u has returned home.\", me->GetEntry());\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the standard CreatureAI callback system and is automatically
    invoked by the core when a creature's movement path completes successfully. It
    should be overridden in custom AI implementations to provide specific behavior
    upon returning home. The method is called after all movement logic has completed,
    so any state changes or actions taken here will occur after the creature has physically
    reached its home position.
  warnings: Ensure that any logic implemented in this method does not cause infinite
    loops or unintended side effects. For example, if the AI logic causes the creature
    to immediately start moving again after reaching home, it could lead to continuous
    movement cycles. Also, be aware that this method may be called multiple times
    during a creature's lifetime, so avoid using it for one-time initialization tasks.
