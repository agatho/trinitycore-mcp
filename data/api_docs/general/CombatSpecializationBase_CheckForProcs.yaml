documentation:
  brief: Checks for and processes combat specializations procs.
  description: The CheckForProcs method evaluates whether any active combat specializations
    or abilities should trigger their associated proc effects. This typically occurs
    during combat events such as attacks, spells, or damage application. The method
    iterates through relevant specialization effects and determines if conditions
    are met for triggering procs based on chance, cooldowns, or other game mechanics.
    It is generally called internally by the combat system when appropriate events
    occur.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Event
    code: "void Player::HandleMeleeAttack(Unit* victim)\n{\n    // ... combat logic\
      \ ...\n    m_combatSpecialization->CheckForProcs();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal combat specialization system and should
    not be called directly from outside combat handlers unless specifically required
    by custom modules. It may perform multiple internal checks including cooldown
    validation, chance calculations, and effect application.
  warnings: Calling this method manually without proper context can lead to unintended
    proc behavior or game balance issues. Ensure that all relevant combat events have
    been properly processed before invoking this function.
