  class: GroupHooks
  method: Hook_OnRemoveMember
  signature: void GroupHooks::Hook_OnRemoveMember(Group * group, int playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Invoked when a player is removed from a group, allowing custom logic to be
    executed.
  description: The Hook_OnRemoveMember method is a callback function that gets triggered
    whenever a player is removed from a group in the TrinityCore framework. This hook
    allows developers to implement custom behavior or logging when group membership
    changes occur. The method receives a pointer to the Group object and the GUID
    of the player being removed. It's typically used for cleanup operations, synchronization
    with external systems, or enforcing game rules related to group dynamics. This
    method is part of the GroupHooks system which provides extension points for modifying
    standard group behavior without directly patching core code.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object from which the player is being removed.
      Must not be null.
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player being removed from the
      group. Should represent a valid player GUID.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Implementation Example
    code: "void MyGroupHooks::Hook_OnRemoveMember(Group* group, int playerGuid)\n\
      {\n    // Log the removal event\n    sLog->outString(\"Player with GUID %u was\
      \ removed from group %u\", playerGuid, group->GetId());\n    \n    // Perform\
      \ any custom cleanup logic here\n    // For example: remove player from custom\
      \ tracking systems\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Group Data Access
    code: "void MyGroupHooks::Hook_OnRemoveMember(Group* group, int playerGuid)\n\
      {\n    // Check if this is the last member being removed\n    if (group->GetMembersCount()\
      \ == 1)\n    {\n        sLog->outString(\"Last member removed from group %u,\
      \ cleaning up\", group->GetId());\n        // Trigger cleanup or notify other\
      \ systems about group dissolution\n    }\n    \n    // Update any custom tracking\
      \ data structures\n    RemovePlayerFromTrackingSystem(playerGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This hook is called after the player has been removed from the group but
    before the group structure is updated. Developers should be aware that the group
    may already be in a transitional state when this hook executes. The method is
    executed synchronously and blocking, so performance-critical operations should
    be minimized to avoid impacting gameplay.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the group structure or call methods that might
    cause recursive calls from within this hook. Be cautious about modifying player
    data or other systems that may depend on the group state being consistent. Avoid
    performing heavy I/O operations in this hook as it can affect server performance.
