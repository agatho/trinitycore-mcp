documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant pointer to the map of game object quest items in the ObjectMgr.
  description: The GetGameObjectQuestItemMap method retrieves a constant reference
    to the internal map that stores mappings between game object entries and their
    associated quest items. This map is used by the TrinityCore server to determine
    which quest items are linked to specific game objects, such as quest givers or
    interactive objects. The returned pointer provides read-only access to this mapping
    structure, allowing other systems to query which items are required or rewarded
    by quest-related game objects without modifying the underlying data. This method
    is typically used during quest handling and item interaction logic within the
    core server mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to a GameObjectQuestItemMap object, which contains mappings
    of game object entries to their associated quest item information. Returns nullptr
    if no such mapping exists or if the map has not been initialized yet.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Quest Item Mappings for a Game Object
    code: "const GameObjectQuestItemMap* questItemMap = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectQuestItemMap();\n\
      if (questItemMap)\n{\n    // Iterate through the map to find quest items associated\
      \ with a specific game object\n    for (auto& pair : *questItemMap)\n    {\n\
      \        uint32 goEntry = pair.first;\n        const std::vector<uint32>& questItems\
      \ = pair.second;\n        // Process quest items for this game object entry\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a constant pointer, meaning the returned map should not
    be modified. The GameObjectQuestItemMap is populated during server startup from
    database entries and remains static during runtime. Accessing this map is thread-safe
    as it's read-only.
