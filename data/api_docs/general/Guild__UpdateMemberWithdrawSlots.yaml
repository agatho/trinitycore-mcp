  class: Guild
  method: _UpdateMemberWithdrawSlots
  signature: void Guild::_UpdateMemberWithdrawSlots(int trans, int guid, uint8 tabId)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the withdrawal slot counts for a guild member's bank tab.
  description: The _UpdateMemberWithdrawSlots method is responsible for synchronizing
    the number of available withdrawal slots for a specific guild member associated
    with a given bank tab. This internal method ensures that the player's allowed
    withdrawal limits are properly maintained within the guild's banking system, particularly
    when items are deposited or withdrawn from guild bank tabs. It operates at the
    database level using transaction handling to maintain data consistency. The method
    is typically invoked internally by other guild operations such as item deposits
    or withdrawals.
  parameters:
  - name: trans
    description: Database transaction identifier used for ensuring atomicity of the
      update operation in the database.
  - name: guid
    description: Global Unique Identifier of the guild member whose withdrawal slots
      are being updated.
  - name: tabId
    description: Identifier of the specific guild bank tab for which the withdrawal
      slot count is modified.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Withdraw Slots for a Guild Member
    code: "void UpdatePlayerWithdrawSlots(uint32 playerGuid, uint8 bankTabId) {\n\
      \    // Assuming we have an active database transaction\n    Transaction* trans\
      \ = new Transaction();\n    guild->_UpdateMemberWithdrawSlots(trans, playerGuid,\
      \ bankTabId);\n    // Commit the transaction to persist changes\n    sDatabase->ExecuteTransaction(trans);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is an internal helper function and should not be called directly
    from external code. It assumes that proper database transactions are in place
    before execution. The method likely interacts with the guild bank tab configuration
    and player-specific withdrawal limits stored in the database.
  warnings: Direct invocation of this method without proper transaction management
    may lead to data inconsistency or corruption. This is an internal API and changes
    to its behavior could affect core guild banking functionality.
