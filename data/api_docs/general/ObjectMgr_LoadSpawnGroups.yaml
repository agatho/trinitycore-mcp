documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes all spawn groups from the database into memory for
    creature and game object spawning logic.
  description: The LoadSpawnGroups method is responsible for loading spawn group definitions
    from the database tables into internal memory structures within the ObjectMgr
    class. This method ensures that all defined spawn groups, which control how creatures
    and game objects are spawned in specific zones or conditions, are properly initialized
    and available for use during world initialization. It typically runs during server
    startup or reload operations to make sure all spawn group data is accessible for
    dynamic spawning systems. The method processes database entries related to spawn
    groups and builds internal lookup structures that allow the core to determine
    which creatures or game objects should spawn together in specific scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadDatabase()\n{\n    // ... other initialization code ...\n\
      \    sObjectMgr->LoadSpawnGroups();\n    // ... continue with other loading\
      \ operations ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or reload operations
    and should not be invoked during normal gameplay. The loaded spawn groups are
    used by the spawning system to determine which entities should appear together
    in specific zones or under certain conditions. It's important that this method
    completes successfully before allowing players to enter the world, as missing
    spawn group data could result in incorrect spawning behavior.
  warnings: Do not call this method during active gameplay as it may cause race conditions
    or inconsistent spawning behavior. The method assumes all required database tables
    are properly populated with valid spawn group definitions. Improperly configured
    spawn groups in the database can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
