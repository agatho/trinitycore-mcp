  signature: int32 Map::GetWorldStateValue(int32 worldStateId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current value of a world state identifier.
  description: This method returns the active value of a specified world state ID
    within the map context. World states in TrinityCore represent dynamic game variables
    that can change during gameplay, such as faction standings, quest progress, or
    seasonal events. The method is commonly used to check the current status of world
    state variables for various game mechanics and scripting purposes. It provides
    a way to query the current state of these variables without requiring direct access
    to internal data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the current value of the specified world state ID. If the world
    state ID is not found or has no active value, it returns 0. The return value represents
    the current state of the world state variable within the map context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic World State Query
    code: int32 factionValue = map->GetWorldStateValue(1234);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. Performance
    considerations are minimal as it simply retrieves a value from internal storage
    without complex operations.
  warnings: The method may return 0 for non-existent world state IDs, so developers
    should verify the existence of world state IDs before using this method to avoid
    incorrect assumptions about game state.
