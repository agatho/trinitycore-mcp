  class: InstanceScript
  method: GetBossBoundary
  signature: const CreatureBoundary * InstanceScript::GetBossBoundary(uint32 id) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the boundary definition for a specified boss within the instance.
  description: The GetBossBoundary method returns a pointer to the CreatureBoundary
    structure that defines the movement or engagement limits for a specific boss in
    the instance. This boundary is typically used by the AI system to constrain boss
    movement and determine when the boss should engage or disengage from players.
    The method takes a boss identifier (id) as input and returns a const pointer to
    the corresponding boundary definition. If no boundary is defined for the given
    boss ID, the method may return nullptr. This functionality is crucial for maintaining
    proper encounter mechanics and preventing bosses from leaving designated areas
    during combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to a CreatureBoundary structure that defines the boss's
    movement or engagement boundaries. Returns nullptr if no boundary is defined for
    the specified boss ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const CreatureBoundary* boundary = instanceScript->GetBossBoundary(12345);\n\
      if (boundary)\n{\n    // Use boundary data to manage boss behavior\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      sql.sql\", \"Boss boundary found for ID: %u\", 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Boundary Validation
    code: "uint32 bossId = 54321;\nconst CreatureBoundary* boundary = instanceScript->GetBossBoundary(bossId);\n\
      if (boundary && boundary->GetMinX() != 0)\n{\n    // Boss has a defined boundary,\
      \ use it for AI logic\n    float minX = boundary->GetMinX();\n    float maxX\
      \ = boundary->GetMaxX();\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"scripts\", \"Boss %u boundary:\
      \ X range [%f, %f]\", bossId, minX, maxX);\n}\nelse\n{\n    TC_LOG_WARNING(\"\
      scripts\", \"No valid boundary found for boss ID: %u\", bossId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned CreatureBoundary pointer is read-only and should not be modified.
    The method assumes that the instance script has already initialized all boss boundaries
    during the instance setup phase. This method is typically called from AI scripts
    or encounter management code during boss combat events.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid boss ID may return nullptr, which
    should always be checked before dereferencing. The returned pointer is only valid
    for the lifetime of the instance script and should not be stored for later use
    without proper validation.
