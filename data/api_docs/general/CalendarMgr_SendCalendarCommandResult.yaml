  class: CalendarMgr
  method: SendCalendarCommandResult
  signature: void CalendarMgr::SendCalendarCommandResult(int guid, CalendarError err,
    const char * param) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a calendar command result message to the specified player with an error
    code and optional parameter.
  description: The SendCalendarCommandResult method is used by the CalendarMgr class
    to communicate calendar-related command outcomes back to players in the game.
    It sends a structured message containing an error code and an optional parameter
    string to a specific player identified by their GUID. This method is typically
    invoked when a calendar operation fails or completes, allowing the client to display
    appropriate user-facing messages. The method does not return any value but directly
    handles network communication with the player's client.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who will receive the calendar
      command result message. This is typically a player's account or character GUID
      used to identify the recipient in the game world.
  - name: err
    description: The CalendarError enum value representing the specific error or outcome
      of the calendar command that was executed. This determines how the client interprets
      and displays the result to the user.
  - name: param
    description: An optional character string parameter that provides additional context
      or data related to the calendar command result. May be NULL if no extra information
      is needed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending a successful calendar invite response
    code: CalendarMgr::SendCalendarCommandResult(playerGuid, CALENDAR_ERROR_NONE,
      "Invite sent");
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending an error message for insufficient permissions
    code: CalendarMgr::SendCalendarCommandResult(playerGuid, CALENDAR_ERROR_PERMISSIONS,
      NULL);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's calendar system implementation and
    relies on proper network communication to deliver messages to players. It should
    only be called from within a valid game context where player sessions are active.
    The method is marked as const, indicating it does not modify internal state but
    performs read-only operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID provided corresponds to an actual logged-in player
    session; otherwise, the message will not be delivered. Incorrect CalendarError
    values may cause client-side display issues or unexpected behavior in the calendar
    UI.
