documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum range of a spell based on caster and spell properties
  description: The GetMaxRange method retrieves the maximum range of a spell, considering
    both positive and negative spell effects. It evaluates the range based on the
    caster's object type and the specific spell being cast, taking into account whether
    the spell is considered positive or negative for range calculations. This method
    is essential for determining spell targeting and validation in World of Warcraft
    mechanics, particularly when checking if targets are within the spell's reach.
    The method considers various factors including caster's position, spell properties,
    and target type to determine valid range.
  parameters:
  - name: positive
    description: Boolean value indicating whether the spell is considered positive
      (true) or negative (false). This affects how range is calculated for different
      spell types.
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that is casting the spell. This determines
      the caster's position and type when calculating range.
  - name: spell
    description: Pointer to the Spell object being evaluated. This contains the specific
      spell properties and effects used in range calculation.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the maximum range of the spell in yards.
    The value can be zero or negative depending on the spell's properties and whether
    it's considered positive or negative.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "float range = spellInfo->GetMaxRange(true, caster, spell);\nif (range >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Process valid range\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "float range = spellInfo->GetMaxRange(false, caster, spell);\nif (range\
      \ < 0)\n{\n    // Handle negative range for negative spells\n}\n// Use range\
      \ in distance calculations"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used during spell validation and targeting. Implementation
    considers the caster's type and position, and may involve complex calculations
    based on spell properties. Performance impact is minimal as it only calculates
    range without affecting other spell mechanics.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method with negative spells as range
    values can be negative, potentially causing confusion in distance calculations.
    Ensure proper handling of positive/negative spell flags to avoid incorrect targeting.
