documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature is prevented from swimming.
  description: This method checks if a creature's swimming movement is currently prevented
    or disabled. It returns true when the creature cannot swim, typically due to being
    in a state where swimming is not allowed (such as during combat or when specific
    conditions are met). The method is commonly used in game mechanics to control
    creature behavior and movement patterns during various states like combat, flight,
    or other environmental restrictions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature's swimming movement is prevented, false otherwise.
    This indicates that the creature cannot swim due to current conditions or state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->IsSwimPrevented()) {\n    // Do something\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details are not available in the source code, but this method
    likely checks internal state flags or conditions related to creature movement.
    Performance considerations may arise from frequent calls during movement updates.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it may affect creature behavior
    during combat or other dynamic states where swimming is restricted.
