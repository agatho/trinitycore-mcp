documentation:
  brief: Destroys a PlayerbotWorldScript instance and performs necessary cleanup operations.
  description: The destructor for the PlayerbotWorldScript class is responsible for
    cleaning up any resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This includes
    releasing memory, unregistering event handlers, and ensuring proper shutdown of
    bot-related systems within the WorldScript context. In TrinityCore's playerbot
    framework, this method ensures that when a PlayerbotWorldScript instance is destroyed,
    all associated bot behaviors and world interaction hooks are properly terminated
    without leaving dangling references or causing memory leaks.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of PlayerbotWorldScript
    code: 'PlayerbotWorldScript* script = new PlayerbotWorldScript();

      // ... use the script ...

      delete script; // Triggers ~PlayerbotWorldScript()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically invoked when a PlayerbotWorldScript object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to ensure that all
    bot-related systems are properly shut down before this destructor runs to prevent
    any potential crashes or undefined behavior.
