    float o, float rotation0, float rotation1, float rotation2, float rotation3, int
    goState) const
documentation:
  brief: Creates a game object with specified parameters and returns a pointer to
    its unique identifier.
  description: The CreateObject method instantiates a game object within the TrinityCore
    world system using provided positional and rotational data. It allows for precise
    placement of objects in the game world, including orientation through quaternion
    rotation. The method is typically used in arena scripts or custom game mechanics
    where dynamic object creation is required. The returned integer pointer represents
    the unique identifier (GUID) of the created object, which can be used to reference
    or manipulate the object later. This function operates within the context of arena
    scripting and requires proper initialization of the script environment before
    use.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The entry ID of the game object template to create. This corresponds
      to the 'entry' field in the gameobject_template table.
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate for the object's position in the world.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate for the object's position in the world.
  - name: z
    description: The Z coordinate for the object's position in the world.
  - name: o
    description: The orientation angle (in radians) of the object around the Z-axis.
  - name: rotation0
    description: The first component of the quaternion rotation (typically w component).
  - name: rotation1
    description: The second component of the quaternion rotation (typically x component).
  - name: rotation2
    description: The third component of the quaternion rotation (typically y component).
  - name: rotation3
    description: The fourth component of the quaternion rotation (typically z component).
  - name: goState
    description: The initial state of the game object, typically representing its
      visual or interactive state.
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the
    created game object. Returns nullptr if creation fails.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Object Creation
    code: int* guid = arenaScript->CreateObject(176582, 100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f, 0.0f,
      1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating an Arena Door with Rotation
    code: 'float rotation[4] = {0.707f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.707f}; // 90 degree rotation
      around Z-axis

      int* doorGuid = arenaScript->CreateObject(176582, 50.0f, 50.0f, 0.0f, 1.57f,
      rotation[0], rotation[1], rotation[2], rotation[3], 1);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within an arena script context where
    the world environment is properly initialized. The returned GUID pointer must
    be managed carefully to avoid memory leaks or dangling references. Object creation
    may fail if the entry ID does not exist in the gameobject_template table or if
    coordinates are invalid.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a valid arena script context will likely
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all parameters, especially
    rotation components, form a valid quaternion to prevent incorrect object orientation.
    The returned pointer should be checked for null before use to avoid dereferencing
    errors.
