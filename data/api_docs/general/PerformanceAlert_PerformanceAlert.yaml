  class: PerformanceAlert
  method: PerformanceAlert
  signature: void PerformanceAlert::PerformanceAlert(AlertLevel lvl, MetricType type,
    uint32_t guid, uint64_t val, uint64_t thresh, std::string msg)
documentation:
  brief: Logs a performance alert with specified level, metric type, GUID, value,
    threshold, and message.
  description: The PerformanceAlert method is used to record performance-related alerts
    within the TrinityCore framework. It takes multiple parameters including the alert
    level, metric type, object GUID, current value, threshold value, and an associated
    message. This method is typically invoked when a performance metric exceeds a
    defined threshold, helping developers and administrators monitor server performance
    and identify potential bottlenecks or issues in real-time. The method does not
    return any value and is designed to be called from various subsystems that track
    performance metrics such as memory usage, CPU load, or database query times.
  parameters:
  - name: lvl
    description: The alert level indicating severity of the performance issue. Valid
      values are typically defined by an enum such as INFO, WARNING, ERROR, or CRITICAL.
  - name: type
    description: The type of metric being monitored. This indicates what kind of performance
      data is being reported, such as memory usage, CPU time, or database query duration.
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the object or subsystem that triggered
      the alert. This could be a player GUID, GameObject GUID, or other entity identifier.
  - name: val
    description: The current measured value of the metric that triggered the alert.
      This is compared against the threshold to determine if an alert should be raised.
  - name: thresh
    description: The threshold value that was exceeded, triggering this performance
      alert. When val exceeds thresh, the alert is logged.
  - name: msg
    description: A descriptive message providing additional context about the alert.
      This may include details about what metric triggered the alert and why it's
      significant.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Performance Alert Usage
    code: PerformanceAlert::PerformanceAlert(AlertLevel::WARNING, MetricType::MEMORY_USAGE,
      playerGuid, currentMemory, thresholdMemory, "Player memory usage exceeded threshold");
    language: cpp
  - title: Database Query Time Alert
    code: PerformanceAlert::PerformanceAlert(AlertLevel::ERROR, MetricType::DB_QUERY_TIME,
      0, queryTime, maxQueryTime, "Database query took longer than allowed threshold");
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using TrinityCore's logging system and
    may be integrated with performance monitoring tools or dashboards. It's important
    to note that alerts are typically asynchronous and may not block execution flow.
    The method assumes all parameters are valid and properly initialized before calling.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the PerformanceAlert
    subsystem might result in silent failures or incorrect logging behavior. Ensure
    that alert thresholds are appropriately set to avoid excessive noise from minor
    performance variations.
