api:
  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: CalculateGearScoreImprovement
  signature: float DynamicQuestSystem::CalculateGearScoreImprovement(Player * bot,
    const int & items)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the gear score improvement for a bot player based on item statistics.
  description: The CalculateGearScoreImprovement method computes a normalized gear
    score improvement value for a given bot player. This value represents how much
    the player's effective gear score would increase if they were to equip the specified
    items. The calculation takes into account various item properties such as stats,
    quality, and level to determine a meaningful improvement factor that can be used
    in dynamic quest systems for decision making or reward distribution.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose gear score
      improvement is being calculated. Must not be null.
  - name: items
    description: Integer value representing the total number of items considered for
      the gear score calculation. This typically corresponds to item count or item
      level sum.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated gear score improvement. Values
    are typically between 0.0 and 1.0, where higher values indicate greater potential
    improvement in gear score.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume valid bot pointer

      int itemCount = 5;

      float improvement = dynamicQuestSystem.CalculateGearScoreImprovement(myBot,
      itemCount);

      // improvement now contains the calculated gear score boost factor'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Improvement in Quest Logic
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nint itemsEquipped = 10;\nfloat improvement = dynamicQuestSystem.CalculateGearScoreImprovement(bot,\
      \ itemsEquipped);\nif (improvement > 0.75f) {\n    // Trigger high-value quest\
      \ reward\n    bot->AddItem(...);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal TrinityCore item evaluation logic to determine
    stat weights and gear score calculations. It may be called frequently during quest
    progression or bot decision-making processes, so performance should be considered
    in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Passing invalid item counts may lead to unexpected results or division
    by zero errors if internal calculations depend on item count normalization.
