  signature: void VendorItemData::Clear()
documentation:
  brief: Clears all vendor items from the VendorItemData container.
  description: The Clear method removes all entries from a VendorItemData object,
    effectively resetting it to an empty state. This method is typically used when
    updating or rebuilding a vendor's inventory, ensuring that previous item entries
    are completely removed before new ones are added. The operation is performed in
    O(n) time where n is the number of items currently stored in the container. No
    parameters are required as the method operates on the instance it is called upon.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing a vendor's item list
    code: 'VendorItemData* vendorItems = new VendorItemData();

      // Add some items to vendorItems...

      vendorItems->Clear(); // Removes all items from the vendor'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method invalidates any references or pointers to previously stored items.
    If other parts of the code hold references to items within the VendorItemData,
    those references become stale after calling Clear(). It is recommended to reinitialize
    or re-populate the vendor data structure after clearing.
