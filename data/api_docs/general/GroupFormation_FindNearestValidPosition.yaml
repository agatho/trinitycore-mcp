  signature: int GroupFormation::FindNearestValidPosition(const int & desired) const
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the nearest valid position within group formation logic
    based on a desired position index.
  description: The FindNearestValidPosition method is used in the context of group
    formations, likely for positioning players or NPCs within a group during certain
    game events or mechanics. It takes a desired position index and searches through
    available positions to find the closest valid one that meets formation requirements.
    This method ensures that group members are placed optimally according to predefined
    formation rules, which may include distance constraints, orientation, or other
    spatial considerations. The method is typically called when repositioning group
    members dynamically during combat or movement scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the index of the nearest valid position
    in the group formation. If no valid position can be found, it may return -1 or
    another sentinel value indicating failure. The returned index corresponds to a
    position within the internal formation data structure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find valid position
    code: "int validPosition = groupFormation.FindNearestValidPosition(5);\nif (validPosition\
      \ >= 0)\n{\n    // Use the valid position index for group positioning\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Found valid position: \" << validPosition << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n\
      \    // Handle case where no valid position exists\n    std::cout << \"No valid\
      \ position found.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on internal data structures representing group
    member positions and formation constraints. It may involve spatial calculations
    or lookups against predefined formation templates. Performance is important in
    group-based scenarios where this method might be called frequently during dynamic
    positioning.
  warnings: The method assumes that the desired position index passed to it is within
    a valid range for the current formation. If an invalid index is passed, behavior
    is undefined and may lead to incorrect positioning or errors. Always validate
    inputs before calling this method in production code.
