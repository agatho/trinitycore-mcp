  method: ResetTimes
  signature: void GuildMgr::ResetTimes(bool week)
documentation:
  brief: Resets guild-related time-based tracking values, either weekly or daily.
  description: The ResetTimes method in the GuildMgr class is responsible for resetting
    various time-based tracking values associated with guilds. When called with week=true,
    it performs a weekly reset of guild data such as weekly reputation gains, weekly
    quest completions, and other time-sensitive guild activities. When called with
    week=false, it typically resets daily tracking values like daily quest limits
    or daily guild bank transactions. This method ensures that guild members' progress
    is properly reset according to the game's time-based mechanics, maintaining balance
    in guild progression systems.
  parameters:
  - name: week
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to perform a weekly reset (true)
      or daily reset (false). When true, resets all weekly tracking values. When false,
      resets daily tracking values.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Perform Weekly Guild Reset
    code: GuildMgr::instance()->ResetTimes(true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Perform Daily Guild Reset
    code: GuildMgr::instance()->ResetTimes(false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the game's internal time management system
    during scheduled reset intervals. It may trigger database updates for guild data
    and could potentially affect guild member experience points or reputation gains
    if not handled properly.
  warnings: Calling this method directly should be done with caution as it can immediately
    reset progress for all guild members. Ensure proper timing and synchronization
    with the game's time system to avoid unintended resets during active gameplay.
