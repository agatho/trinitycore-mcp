documentation:
  brief: Executes a hybrid role assignment strategy for group members in a World of
    Warcraft instance.
  description: The ExecuteHybridStrategy method implements a role assignment algorithm
    that dynamically assigns roles (such as tank, healer, or damage dealer) to group
    members based on a combination of player class, specialization, and instance requirements.
    This method is typically invoked during group creation or when a new member joins
    an existing group to ensure optimal team composition for dungeon or raid encounters.
    The strategy considers various factors including player level, gear, and current
    role distribution within the group to maintain balanced team dynamics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Group Management
    code: "void AssignRoles(Group* group)\n{\n    RoleAssignment roleAssigner;\n \
      \   roleAssigner.ExecuteHybridStrategy(group);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided Group object contains valid members
    with appropriate class and specialization data. The implementation may vary depending
    on the specific TrinityCore version and patch level.
  warnings: Calling this method on a null group pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the group is properly initialized before invoking this strategy.
