  signature: CreateResult BotCharacterCreator::ValidateCreationRequest(uint32 accountId,
    uint8 race, uint8 classId, uint8 gender, const std::string & name, std::string
    & outErrorMsg)
documentation:
  brief: Validates a character creation request for a bot character, ensuring all
    provided parameters meet game requirements and constraints.
  description: The ValidateCreationRequest method checks whether the given character
    creation parameters (account ID, race, class, gender, name) are valid for creating
    a new bot character in the TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft server. It performs
    various validations including checking if the account exists, verifying that the
    selected race and class combination is allowed, ensuring the character name adheres
    to naming rules, and confirming that the player does not already have a character
    with the same name on the account. The method returns a CreateResult enum indicating
    success or failure along with an error message if validation fails. This function
    is typically called before attempting to create a new bot character to prevent
    invalid creations.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: The unique identifier of the account for which the character is being
      created. Must be a valid, existing account ID in the database.
  - name: race
    description: The race of the character being created. Valid values correspond
      to the race IDs defined in the game (e.g., 1 for Human, 2 for Orc).
  - name: classId
    description: The class of the character being created. Valid values correspond
      to the class IDs defined in the game (e.g., 1 for Warrior, 2 for Paladin).
  - name: gender
    description: The gender of the character being created. Valid values are 0 for
      male and 1 for female.
  - name: name
    description: The desired name for the new character. Must be between 2 and 12
      characters long, contain only allowed characters (letters, spaces), and not
      be a reserved name.
  - name: outErrorMsg
    description: A reference to a string where an error message will be written if
      validation fails. This parameter is updated with details about why the creation
      request was rejected.
  returns: Returns a CreateResult enum value indicating whether the character creation
    request passed validation or failed. Possible values include CREATE_SUCCESS, CREATE_ERROR,
    CREATE_DISABLED, CREATE_ACCOUNT_LOCKED, CREATE_SERVER_LIMIT, CREATE_NAME_IN_USE,
    CREATE_NAME_INVALID, and others depending on the specific validation failure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Character Creation Validation
    code: "uint32 accountId = 12345;\nuint8 race = 1; // Human\nuint8 classId = 1;\
      \ // Warrior\nuint8 gender = 0; // Male\nstd::string name = \"BotWarrior\";\n\
      std::string errorMsg;\nCreateResult result = creator.ValidateCreationRequest(accountId,\
      \ race, classId, gender, name, errorMsg);\nif (result == CREATE_SUCCESS) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with character creation\n} else {\n    // Handle error using\
      \ errorMsg\n    std::cout << \"Character creation failed: \" << errorMsg <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database queries to check account existence and existing
    character names, so it may have performance implications if called frequently.
    It is recommended to cache or pre-validate inputs where possible. The validation
    logic might be extended in the future to include additional checks such as server
    population limits or custom rules.
  warnings: Ensure that the input parameters are sanitized before calling this method
    to avoid potential issues with invalid data. Also, note that this method does
    not actually create a character; it only validates whether one could be created
    based on the given inputs.
