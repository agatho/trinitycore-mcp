  class: SocialManager
  method: AcceptGuildInvite
  signature: void SocialManager::AcceptGuildInvite(Player * inviter)
documentation:
  brief: Accepts an invitation to join a guild from another player.
  description: The AcceptGuildInvite method processes a guild invitation received
    from another player. It handles the logic required to add the calling player to
    the inviting player's guild, including updating guild membership data, sending
    notifications, and removing the invitation from the system. This method is typically
    invoked when a player clicks 'Accept' on a guild invite received through the social
    interface. The method assumes that the player has been properly invited and that
    the guild exists.
  parameters:
  - name: inviter
    description: Pointer to the Player object who sent the guild invitation. This
      parameter must be a valid player instance, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Accepting a Guild Invitation
    code: "void HandleGuildInviteAccept(Player* player, Player* inviter)\n{\n    if\
      \ (player && inviter)\n    {\n        player->GetSocial()->AcceptGuildInvite(inviter);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player has received a valid guild
    invitation. It internally manages the removal of the invite from the system and
    updates the player's guild membership status. The method does not validate whether
    the inviter is actually in a guild or if the player is already in a guild.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that an invitation exists for the
    player can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Additionally, calling it on
    a player who is already in a guild may cause undefined behavior or client-side
    issues.
