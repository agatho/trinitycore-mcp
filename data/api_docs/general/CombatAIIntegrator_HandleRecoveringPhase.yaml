  brief: Handles the recovering phase logic for combat AI integration
  description: The HandleRecoveringPhase method manages the state and behavior of
    an AI-controlled unit during its recovery phase after engaging in combat. This
    typically involves resetting cooldowns, restoring health or mana, and preparing
    for subsequent combat actions. The method ensures that the AI adheres to proper
    timing and resource management during transitions from active combat to recovery
    states. It is part of the broader CombatAIIntegrator system which coordinates
    AI behavior in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.

    code: "void MyCombatAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_isInCombat)\n    \
      \    HandleCombatPhase();\n    else\n        HandleRecoveringPhase();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during AI update cycles to maintain
    proper recovery state management. It may interact with internal cooldown tracking
    and resource restoration systems.
