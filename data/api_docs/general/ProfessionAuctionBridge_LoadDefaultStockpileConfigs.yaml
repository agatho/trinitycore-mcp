  class: ProfessionAuctionBridge
  method: LoadDefaultStockpileConfigs
  signature: void ProfessionAuctionBridge::LoadDefaultStockpileConfigs()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes default stockpile configurations for profession auctions within
    the auction house system.
  description: The LoadDefaultStockpileConfigs method sets up predefined stockpile
    settings that determine how many items of each profession-related item type should
    be automatically stocked in the auction house. This method is typically invoked
    during server startup or initialization to ensure that auction houses have baseline
    inventory levels for common crafting materials and components. It configures default
    quantities, price ranges, and item categories that are used by the profession
    auction bridge to manage automated stock replenishment. The configurations loaded
    here serve as fallback values when specific user-defined settings are not present
    or when resetting to default behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeAuctionSystem()\n{\n    ProfessionAuctionBridge bridge;\n\
      \    bridge.LoadDefaultStockpileConfigs();\n    // Stockpile configurations\
      \ are now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during system initialization to avoid
    overwriting existing configurations. It is designed to be non-destructive, meaning
    it will not overwrite already configured stockpile settings if they exist. The
    method likely interacts with internal configuration tables and may depend on specific
    database entries or config files to determine default values.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times during runtime may lead to unexpected
    behavior or duplicate configurations. Ensure that this method is only invoked
    during initialization phases, not during active operation when stockpile settings
    might be in use.
