documentation:
  brief: Deletes all bot accounts from the database asynchronously.
  description: The DeleteAllBotAccounts method removes all bot accounts stored in
    the TrinityCore database. This operation is performed asynchronously and accepts
    a callback function that will be invoked once the deletion process is complete.
    The method is typically used during server maintenance or when resetting bot-related
    configurations. It ensures that all associated data for bot accounts is properly
    cleaned up from the database, including any character data, account settings,
    and related entries. This method does not return any value directly but relies
    on the provided callback to signal completion.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage with Lambda Callback
    code: "BotAccountMgr::DeleteAllBotAccounts([](uint32 accountId) {\n    printf(\"\
      Deleted bot account with ID: %u\\n\", accountId);\n});"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database operations asynchronously, so the actual deletion
    may not complete immediately. The callback function is executed on the same thread
    that initiated the operation. Ensure proper error handling in the callback to
    manage potential database failures or other issues during deletion.
  warnings: Using this method will permanently remove all bot accounts and their associated
    data from the database. This action cannot be undone without a backup, so ensure
    you have taken appropriate precautions before calling this function.
