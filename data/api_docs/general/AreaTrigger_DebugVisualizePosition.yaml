  signature: void AreaTrigger::DebugVisualizePosition()
documentation:
  brief: Visualizes the position of an area trigger for debugging purposes.
  description: The DebugVisualizePosition method is used to display a visual representation
    of an area trigger's location and boundaries within the game world. This method
    is typically invoked during development or debugging sessions to help developers
    understand the spatial properties and positioning of area triggers. It may render
    temporary visual markers, such as particles or debug geometry, at the trigger's
    location to aid in verifying correct placement and dimensions. The functionality
    is usually disabled in production builds but enabled in debug configurations for
    development purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Visualization
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...; // Get reference to area trigger

      trigger->DebugVisualizePosition(); // Visualize the position in game world'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for developers and debugging purposes.
    It may have performance implications if called frequently or on many triggers
    simultaneously. The actual visualization mechanism depends on the TrinityCore
    debug system and may vary based on client-side configuration.
  warnings: Do not call this method in production code as it's meant for debugging
    only. The visualizations are temporary and will not persist across server restarts
    or client sessions.
