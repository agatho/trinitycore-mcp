  signature: void BotProfiler::IntegrateDatabaseOptimizer()
documentation:
  brief: Integrates the database optimizer into the bot profiler system to enhance
    performance monitoring and optimization capabilities.
  description: The IntegrateDatabaseOptimizer method initializes and connects the
    database optimization module within the BotProfiler class. This integration allows
    the profiler to monitor database query performance, identify bottlenecks, and
    apply optimizations automatically. The method sets up necessary hooks and callbacks
    to track database operations performed by bot systems, ensuring that profiling
    data accurately reflects real-world usage patterns. It also configures internal
    data structures required for analyzing query execution times and resource consumption.

  - title: Basic Integration Usage
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      profiler.IntegrateDatabaseOptimizer();

      // Database optimizer is now active and monitoring bot queries'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during system initialization or when enabling
    profiling features. The integration process may introduce minimal overhead during
    startup but provides significant benefits for long-term performance monitoring.
