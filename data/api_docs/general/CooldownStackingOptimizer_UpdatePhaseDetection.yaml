  class: CooldownStackingOptimizer
  method: UpdatePhaseDetection
  signature: void CooldownStackingOptimizer::UpdatePhaseDetection()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the phase detection state for cooldown stacking optimization.
  description: The UpdatePhaseDetection method is responsible for recalculating and
    updating the current phase state used by the CooldownStackingOptimizer class.
    This method determines whether the player is in a specific game phase that affects
    how cooldowns are managed and stacked. It typically checks conditions such as
    combat status, area restrictions, or player state to adjust internal phase tracking.
    The updated phase information influences subsequent cooldown calculations and
    stacking decisions made by the optimizer.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CooldownStackingOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.UpdatePhaseDetection();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during gameplay to ensure accurate
    phase detection. It may trigger internal state changes that affect cooldown behavior,
    so frequent calls could impact performance if not optimized.
