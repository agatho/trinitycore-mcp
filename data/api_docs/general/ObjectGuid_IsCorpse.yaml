documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the ObjectGuid represents a corpse entity.
  description: The IsCorpse method checks if the current ObjectGuid instance refers
    to a corpse object within the World of Warcraft game world. This method examines
    the type portion of the GUID to determine if it matches the corpse type identifier.
    In TrinityCore, GUIDs are used extensively to uniquely identify game objects,
    players, creatures, and other entities. Corpse GUIDs have a specific type value
    that distinguishes them from other object types. The method returns true if the
    GUID represents a corpse, and false otherwise. This functionality is commonly
    used in combat-related systems, loot distribution, and corpse management logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ObjectGuid represents a corpse entity; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic corpse GUID check
    code: "ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Corpse>(12345);\nif (guid.IsCorpse())\n\
      {\n    // Handle corpse-specific logic\n    printf(\"This GUID represents a\
      \ corpse\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking GUID type in combat system
    code: "void HandleLootDistribution(ObjectGuid looterGuid, ObjectGuid targetGuid)\n\
      {\n    if (targetGuid.IsCorpse())\n    {\n        // Only allow loot distribution\
      \ to corpses\n        DistributeLoot(looterGuid, targetGuid);\n    }\n    else\n\
      \    {\n        // Handle other object types\n        SendErrorMessage(\"Target\
      \ is not a corpse\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on the internal type field of the ObjectGuid structure.
    In TrinityCore, corpse GUIDs use a specific high GUID type value (HighGuid::Corpse)
    that is distinct from other object types like players, creatures, or game objects.
    This check is efficient as it only examines the type bits without requiring database
    lookups or network calls.
  warnings: This method should not be used to validate if an object exists in the
    world - it only checks the GUID's type. A valid corpse GUID may still point to
    a non-existent corpse if the corpse has been despawned or cleaned up by the server.
