  brief: Sends a respec wipe confirmation message to the player
  description: This method sends a confirmation message to the player indicating that
    their character's talent specializations have been reset, typically as part of
    a respec process. The method handles the communication of the reset type and associated
    cost to the player's client. It is used in conjunction with the player's spec
    reset functionality to ensure proper game mechanics handling during talent reconfiguration.

  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose talents are being
      reset
  - name: cost
    description: The cost in gold or points required for the respec operation, typically

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 cost = 1000;

      SpecResetType respecType = SPEC_RESET_NORMAL;

      player->SendRespecWipeConfirm(player->GetGUID(), cost, respecType);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the process of resetting a player's
    talents. The method ensures that the client receives proper information about
    the reset operation and associated costs. It should be used in conjunction with
    other methods that handle spec reset operations.
  warnings: The method requires that the player object be valid and that the GUID
    be properly initialized before calling. Improper use could result in incorrect
    or missing messages to the player.
