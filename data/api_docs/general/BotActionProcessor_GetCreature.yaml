  signature: Creature * BotActionProcessor::GetCreature(Player * bot, int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a Creature object from the world based on a bot player and creature
    GUID
  description: The GetCreature method is used to fetch a Creature instance from the
    game world using a bot player's context and a specified creature GUID. This method
    serves as a utility for bot AI logic to access and interact with specific creatures
    in the game environment. It typically involves looking up the creature within
    the player's current map and visibility range, ensuring that the creature is valid
    and accessible before returning it. The method may perform checks to ensure the
    creature exists and is within the bot's operational scope, which is crucial for
    proper bot behavior in World of Warcraft environments.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is requesting
      access to the creature. This parameter defines the context and visibility range
      for the lookup.
  - name: guid
    description: Integer value representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the creature
      to be retrieved. This GUID must correspond to an existing creature in the game
      world.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Creature object if found and accessible within
    the bot's context. Returns nullptr if no valid creature exists with the given
    GUID or if the creature is not accessible to the specified bot player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GetCreature
    code: "Creature* target = botActionProcessor->GetCreature(bot, 12345);\nif (target)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with interaction logic\n    bot->Attack(target, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe usage with null check
    code: "Creature* creature = botActionProcessor->GetCreature(bot, creatureGuid);\n\
      if (creature && creature->IsAlive())\n{\n    // Perform actions only if creature\
      \ exists and is alive\n    bot->CastSpell(creature, SPELL_ATTACK, true);\n}\n\
      else\n{\n    // Handle case where creature is not found or dead\n    bot->Say(\"\
      Target not available.\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the TrinityCore's object management system to locate
    creatures. It may involve map and visibility checks, so performance can be impacted
    if called frequently in tight loops. The returned Creature pointer should not
    be stored for long periods without re-validation, as creatures can be despawned
    or removed from the world.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-null return value guarantees the creature is
    alive or in combat. Always validate the creature's state before performing actions.
    Calling this method with an invalid GUID may result in undefined behavior or crashes
    if not properly handled.
