  signature: int Unit::GetUpdateFieldFlagsFor(const int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the update field flags for a specific target
  description: This method retrieves the update field flags associated with a given
    target, which are used to determine what data should be sent to clients for updates.
    The flags indicate which fields of the unit's update data are relevant for a particular
    target, such as whether the unit is visible or hidden to that target. This method
    is crucial for determining proper client-side update behavior in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the update field flags for the specified
    target, where each bit corresponds to a specific update field type and indicates
    whether that field should be included in the update data for the target.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* unit = new Unit;\nint flags = unit->GetUpdateFieldFlagsFor(&target);\n\
      if (flags & UPDATE_FLAG_VISIBLE)\n{\n    // This unit is visible to the target\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with update managers and client-side
    update logic. The flags returned are usually bitwise OR'd with other flag values
    to determine complete update behavior. Performance considerations include avoiding
    frequent calls to this method during update cycles.
  warnings: Care must be taken when interpreting the returned flags, as incorrect
    bit manipulation can lead to incorrect visibility or update behavior for clients.
    This method should not be called directly in update loops without proper optimization.
