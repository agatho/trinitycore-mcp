  class: EnhancedBotAI
  method: ProcessGroupEvents
  signature: void EnhancedBotAI::ProcessGroupEvents(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Processes group-related events for enhanced bot AI behavior.
  description: The ProcessGroupEvents method handles and updates the state of group-related
    activities within the EnhancedBotAI system. It processes events such as player
    joining or leaving groups, changes in group roles, and other group dynamics that
    affect bot behavior. This method is typically called during the AI update cycle
    to ensure bots respond appropriately to group changes in real-time. The method
    operates on a time-based diff parameter to manage event processing frequency and
    avoid excessive CPU usage.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: Time delta in milliseconds since last execution, used to determine
      when to process group events and manage timing of AI actions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void EnhancedBotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    ProcessGroupEvents(diff);\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with group management system
    code: "void EnhancedBotAI::OnGroupChange()\n{\n    // Trigger immediate processing\
      \ of group events\n    ProcessGroupEvents(0);\n}\n\nvoid EnhancedBotAI::UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff)\n{\n    if (diff >= m_groupEventTimer)\n    {\n        ProcessGroupEvents(diff);\n\
      \        m_groupEventTimer = 1000; // Reset timer\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called regularly from the AI update loop. It's
    important that the diff parameter accurately reflects time elapsed since last
    call to ensure proper timing of group event processing. The implementation likely
    includes internal state tracking for group members and their roles.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the AI update context without understanding
    its internal dependencies. Improper use may lead to inconsistent bot behavior
    or group state corruption.
