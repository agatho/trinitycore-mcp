api:
  class: GuildIntegration
  method: InitiateGuildConversation
  signature: void GuildIntegration::InitiateGuildConversation(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a guild conversation for the specified player, allowing communication
    with guild members.
  description: The InitiateGuildConversation method starts a guild-specific chat session
    for a given player. This function typically sets up the necessary data structures
    and UI elements to enable real-time text messaging between guild members. It may
    also handle authentication checks to ensure the player has proper guild membership
    status before allowing conversation initiation. The method is commonly used when
    a player selects to open their guild chat interface or when automatic guild notifications
    trigger a conversation window.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter specifies which player's guild conversation session should
      be initiated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Conversation Initiation
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.InitiateGuildConversation(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the TrinityCore's chat system and guild
    management modules. It may require the player to be currently logged in and part
    of a guild. The implementation might involve creating temporary chat channels
    or updating UI state.
  warnings: Ensure that the player ID passed is valid and corresponds to an active
    player session, otherwise the method may fail silently or cause undefined behavior.
    This function should not be called for players who are not in a guild.
