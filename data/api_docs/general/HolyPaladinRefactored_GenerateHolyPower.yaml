documentation:
  brief: Generates holy power for the paladin based on the specified amount.
  description: The GenerateHolyPower method is responsible for increasing the holy
    power resource of a Holy Paladin character. This method typically corresponds
    to abilities or effects that grant holy power, such as judgements, flash of light,
    or other holy-based spells and talents. The amount parameter specifies how much
    holy power should be added to the paladin's current resource pool. This method
    is part of the core gameplay mechanics for Holy Paladins in World of Warcraft,
    allowing them to accumulate holy power for use with various abilities like Holy
    Shock or Lay on Hands.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of holy power to generate. Must be a non-negative integer
      representing the amount of resource to add to the paladin's holy power pool.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: paladin->GenerateHolyPower(10);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Ability Effect
    code: "if (spellId == SPELL_FLASH_OF_LIGHT)\n{\n    uint32 holyPowerGain = 5;\n\
      \    paladin->GenerateHolyPower(holyPowerGain);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal resource tracking and may trigger visual
    effects or UI updates to reflect the change in holy power. It should be called
    only on valid Holy Paladin instances.
  warnings: Calling this method with a negative value for amount could lead to unexpected
    behavior or resource depletion. Ensure that the paladin instance is valid before
    calling this method.
