documentation:
  brief: Registers all default bot chat commands with the command system
  description: The RegisterDefaultCommands method initializes and registers all predefined
    bot-related chat commands with the TrinityCore command handler system. This method
    is typically called during server startup or bot initialization to make available
    all standard bot management commands such as summoning, dismissing, setting behavior,
    and configuring bot parameters. The registered commands allow game masters and
    players to control bot behavior through in-game chat commands. This method does
    not accept any parameters and performs no direct return operations, instead relying
    on the command system's internal registration mechanisms.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeBotSystem()\n{\n    BotChatCommandHandler commandHandler;\n\
      \    commandHandler.RegisterDefaultCommands();\n    // Bot commands are now\
      \ available for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called once during server initialization
    or when a new bot system instance is created. The actual command registration
    process occurs internally within the TrinityCore framework and may involve multiple
    internal calls to register different categories of bot commands.
