  class: HavocDemonHunterRefactored
  method: CountEnemiesInCone
  signature: uint32 HavocDemonHunterRefactored::CountEnemiesInCone(float angle, float
    range, float arc) const
documentation:
  brief: Counts the number of enemy units within a specified cone-shaped area in front
    of the Havoc Demon Hunter.
  description: The CountEnemiesInCone method determines how many hostile targets are
    positioned within a cone-shaped region extending from the Havoc Demon Hunter's
    current location. This utility is commonly used for abilities that affect multiple
    enemies in a forward-facing arc, such as melee attacks or area-of-effect spells.
    The method evaluates the positioning of all nearby enemies relative to the caster's
    facing direction and the specified angular range. It returns a count of valid
    targets that fall within both the defined angle and distance constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: angle
    description: The central angle (in degrees) of the cone, measured from the forward
      direction of the Havoc Demon Hunter. A value of 0 means the cone points directly
      ahead.
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance (in yards) from the caster's position to consider
      for enemy detection within the cone.
  - name: arc
    description: The total angular width of the cone (in degrees), centered around
      the specified angle. For example, an arc of 90 degrees with an angle of 0 creates
      a cone that extends 45 degrees to the left and right of forward.
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the number of enemy units found within the
    specified cone-shaped area. If no enemies are detected, it returns zero.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for counting enemies in front of the Demon Hunter
    code: uint32 count = demonHunter->CountEnemiesInCone(0.0f, 8.0f, 60.0f); // Count
      enemies within a 60-degree cone up to 8 yards ahead
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the method with custom cone parameters for a wider area
    code: uint32 count = demonHunter->CountEnemiesInCone(45.0f, 10.0f, 120.0f); //
      Count enemies within a 120-degree cone starting at 45 degrees from forward,
      up to 10 yards
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a spatial query against the current map's collision
    system and enemy units. It is optimized for performance but may be impacted by
    high-density combat environments or large numbers of nearby enemies. The cone
    definition assumes a standard World of Warcraft coordinate system where positive
    Y-axis points forward.
  warnings: Ensure that the parameters passed to this method are within reasonable
    bounds; extremely large ranges or wide arcs can lead to performance degradation
    or unexpected behavior in densely populated areas. Avoid calling this method during
    high-frequency updates without caching results.
