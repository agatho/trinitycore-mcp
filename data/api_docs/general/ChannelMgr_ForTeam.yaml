  class: ChannelMgr
  method: ForTeam
  signature: ChannelMgr * ChannelMgr::ForTeam(int team)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the ChannelMgr instance for the specified team
  description: The ForTeam method retrieves or creates a ChannelMgr instance associated
    with a specific team in the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically used
    to manage channel access and communication for players based on their faction
    or team affiliation. The returned ChannelMgr instance handles all channel-related
    operations for that particular team, including creating, destroying, and managing
    channels specific to that team's context. This is essential for maintaining proper
    game mechanics related to team-based communication in World of Warcraft environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the ChannelMgr instance for the specified team. Returns nullptr
    if the team is invalid or if no ChannelMgr could be retrieved/created for that
    team.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve ChannelMgr for Alliance Team
    code: "ChannelMgr* allianceChannels = ChannelMgr::ForTeam(TEAM_ALLIANCE);\nif\
      \ (allianceChannels)\n{\n    // Use allianceChannels to manage alliance-specific\
      \ channels\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Usage with Null Check
    code: "ChannelMgr* teamMgr = ChannelMgr::ForTeam(player->GetTeam());\nif (teamMgr\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Proceed with channel operations for the player's team\n\
      \    Channel* channel = teamMgr->GetChannel(\"General\", player);\n    if (channel)\n\
      \    {\n        channel->SendToPlayer(\"Hello, team!\", player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses a static map or registry to store and retrieve ChannelMgr
    instances per team. The implementation may involve thread synchronization if multiple
    threads access channel management simultaneously. It's important to note that
    team IDs should be valid faction identifiers (e.g., TEAM_ALLIANCE, TEAM_HORDE)
    for proper functionality.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid team ID might return nullptr or cause
    undefined behavior. Ensure proper validation of team parameters before use. This
    method may not be thread-safe if the underlying registry isn't protected by mutexes.
