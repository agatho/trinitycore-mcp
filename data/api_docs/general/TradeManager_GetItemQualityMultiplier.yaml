documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the quality multiplier for an item based on its quality
    level.
  description: The GetItemQualityMultiplier method retrieves a floating-point multiplier
    value that corresponds to the quality level of an item. This multiplier is typically
    used in game mechanics such as calculating item values, pricing, or stat modifiers.
    The method accepts an integer representing the item's quality and returns a float
    that represents how much the quality affects certain calculations. In World of
    Warcraft's context, item qualities range from poor (0) to artifact (7), with each
    quality level having a predefined multiplier that influences gameplay elements
    like vendor prices, enchantment effectiveness, or loot value.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the quality multiplier for the given item quality.
    The exact values depend on internal game definitions but generally increase with
    higher quality levels (e.g., Poor = 0.5f, Common = 1.0f, Rare = 1.5f, etc.). Returns
    0.0f if an invalid quality level is provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float multiplier = tradeManager.GetItemQualityMultiplier(4); // For Epic
      quality items

      std::cout << "Epic item multiplier: " << multiplier << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Item Value Calculation
    code: 'int baseValue = 100;

      int quality = 3; // Rare

      float multiplier = tradeManager.GetItemQualityMultiplier(quality);

      int finalValue = static_cast<int>(baseValue * multiplier);

      std::cout << "Final item value: " << finalValue << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the TradeManager to adjust item
    values during trades, auctions, or loot distribution. The quality levels and their
    corresponding multipliers are defined within the TrinityCore codebase and may
    vary depending on the specific expansion or game version.
  warnings: Ensure that the quality parameter passed to this method is within valid
    range (typically 0-7) to avoid unexpected behavior or incorrect calculations.
    Invalid quality values might result in a return value of 0.0f, which could lead
    to division by zero or other mathematical errors if not handled properly.
