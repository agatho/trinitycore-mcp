documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's terrain status based on liquid data changes
  description: The ProcessTerrainStatusUpdate method handles updates to a player's
    terrain status when their position relative to liquid surfaces (such as water
    or lava) changes. This method is typically invoked internally by the game engine
    when a player moves into or out of liquid zones, or when liquid levels change
    in the environment. It processes the old and new liquid status data to determine
    appropriate actions such as updating visual effects, playing sound effects, or
    triggering environmental interactions. The method ensures that the player's state
    remains consistent with their physical surroundings in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: oldLiquidStatus
    description: The previous liquid status of the player's position, indicating what
      type of liquid (if any) was previously present at the player's location
  - name: newLiquidData
    description: Reference to the new liquid data structure containing updated information
      about the current liquid status at the player's position
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic terrain status update handling
    code: "void HandlePlayerLiquidChange(Player* player, int oldStatus, const int&\
      \ newStatus)\n{\n    player->ProcessTerrainStatusUpdate(oldStatus, newStatus);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    movement updates and should not normally be invoked directly by external code.
    The liquid status values are usually defined by the game's terrain system and
    may include flags for different types of liquids such as water, lava, or other
    environmental elements.
