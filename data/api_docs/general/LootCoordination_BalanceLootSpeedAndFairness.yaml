    sessionId)
documentation:
  brief: Balances loot distribution speed and fairness within a group during coordination.
  description: The BalanceLootSpeedAndFairness method in the LootCoordination class
    is responsible for managing the trade-off between distributing loot quickly and
    ensuring fair allocation among group members. This method likely adjusts the loot
    distribution mechanism based on group size, player participation, and other contextual
    factors to optimize both efficiency and equity. It may modify internal timers,
    priority systems, or distribution algorithms to maintain an optimal balance. The
    method operates on a provided group object and session identifier to determine
    appropriate balancing strategies.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group of players participating
      in loot coordination. Must be a valid group with at least one member.
  - name: sessionId
    description: Unique identifier for the current loot session. Used to track and
      manage specific loot distribution events within the group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Loot Coordination
    code: "void HandleLootDistribution(Group* group, uint32 sessionId)\n{\n    LootCoordination\
      \ coordination;\n    coordination.BalanceLootSpeedAndFairness(group, sessionId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal loot timers and priority queues.
    It may be called periodically during active loot sessions to dynamically adjust
    distribution strategies based on group dynamics.
