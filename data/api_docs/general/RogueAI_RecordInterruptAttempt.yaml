  class: RogueAI
  method: RecordInterruptAttempt
  signature: void RogueAI::RecordInterruptAttempt(int * target, uint32 spellId, bool
    success)
documentation:
  brief: Records an interrupt attempt made by a rogue AI against a target.
  description: The RecordInterruptAttempt method logs information about an attempted
    spell interruption performed by a RogueAI instance. This method tracks whether
    the interrupt was successful or not, and stores relevant data such as the target
    and spell ID for potential future analysis or behavior modification. It is typically
    invoked during combat when the rogue attempts to interrupt an enemy's casting.
    The method does not return any value but updates internal AI state related to
    interrupt tracking.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target unit that was interrupted. Must be a valid
      pointer to a Unit object, or nullptr if no valid target exists.
  - name: spellId
    description: The ID of the spell being interrupted. Should correspond to a valid
      spell in the game's database.
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the interrupt attempt was successful
      (true) or failed (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupt Recording
    code: 'Unit* target = ai->GetTarget();

      uint32 spellId = 12345;

      bool success = true;

      ai->RecordInterruptAttempt(&target, spellId, success);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Failed Interrupt Attempt
    code: 'Unit* target = ai->GetTarget();

      uint32 spellId = 67890;

      bool success = false;

      ai->RecordInterruptAttempt(&target, spellId, success);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the RogueAI class to maintain statistics
    or adjust behavior based on interrupt success rates. It may be called from various
    combat-related functions within the AI logic.
