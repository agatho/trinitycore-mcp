  description: This method checks if the player's equipment is set to use PvP item
    levels rather than normal item levels. It returns true when the player is actively
    using PvP gear, and false otherwise. The method is commonly used in PvP-related
    gameplay mechanics to determine if a player's items are configured for PvP combat
    or if they're using regular PvE gear. This functionality is important for players
    who want to ensure their equipment is properly configured for PvP activities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is using PvP item levels, false otherwise. The
    return value indicates whether the player's equipment is configured for PvP combat
    rather than regular PvE gameplay.

    code: "if (player->IsUsingPvpItemLevels()) {\n    // Player is using PvP gear\n\
      \    // Perform PvP-related actions\n}\nelse {\n    // Player is using PvE gear\n\
      \    // Perform PvE-related actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks the player's equipment configuration and may be
    related to item level settings or gear type. It should be used in conjunction
    with other PvP-related methods for comprehensive PvP gameplay analysis.
  warnings: Be aware that this method might not reflect actual PvP gear usage if the
    player has switched between different gear configurations. Ensure proper testing
    when using this method in PvP scenarios.
