documentation:
  brief: Updates auction price data for a specific item in the auction house.
  description: The UpdatePriceData method is responsible for maintaining and updating
    the price statistics associated with a particular item in the auction house system.
    This method ensures that the auction house reflects current market conditions
    by tracking price trends, average prices, and other relevant economic data for
    items being auctioned. It typically gets invoked when new auctions are created,
    existing auctions are updated, or when periodic price recalculations occur. The
    method operates on a specific item ID and an auction house object reference to
    update the corresponding price information within the auction house's internal
    data structures.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item for which price data needs to be
      updated. This corresponds to the ItemTemplate entry in the database.
  - name: ah
    description: Pointer to the AuctionHouseObject representing the auction house
      instance where the item's price data should be updated. This object contains
      the auction house's configuration and current state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Price Data for a Specific Item
    code: 'AuctionHouseObject* auctionHouse = sAuctionMgr->GetAuctionHouse(12345);

      uint32 itemId = 1234;

      sAuctionMgr->UpdatePriceData(itemId, auctionHouse);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Price Data After Auction Creation
    code: "void OnAuctionCreated(uint32 itemId, AuctionHouseObject* ah)\n{\n    //\
      \ Update price data after new auction is created\n    sAuctionMgr->UpdatePriceData(itemId,\
      \ ah);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the auction house's internal database or
    cache to store updated price information. It may also trigger additional operations
    such as updating item statistics, notifying other systems of price changes, or
    recalculating market trends. The implementation might be optimized for performance
    since it could be called frequently during active auction house operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the AuctionHouseObject pointer is valid and not null before
    calling this method, as passing an invalid pointer may lead to undefined behavior.
    Also, make sure that the itemId corresponds to a valid item in the game's database
    to avoid incorrect price data updates.
