  signature: bool PositionStrategyBase::CheckCollisionWithObjects(const int & pos,
    float radius) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a position with given radius collides with any objects in the environment.
  description: The CheckCollisionWithObjects method determines whether a specified
    position, represented by an integer identifier, intersects or collides with existing
    game objects within a defined radius. This method is typically used during pathfinding
    or positioning logic to ensure that units or entities do not spawn or move into
    blocked areas. It evaluates the spatial relationship between the given position
    and surrounding obstacles, such as terrain features, buildings, or other interactive
    objects. The method returns true if a collision is detected, indicating that the
    area is obstructed; otherwise, it returns false, signifying that the space is
    clear for use.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer identifier representing a position in the game world.
      This value usually corresponds to a specific coordinate or node within the navigation
      system.
  - name: radius
    description: A floating-point value defining the radius around the specified position
      to check for collisions. Larger radii will encompass more area and may detect
      more potential obstructions.
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether a collision was detected. True
    means that at least one object within the specified radius obstructs the position,
    while false indicates that no such obstruction exists.

    code: "if (strategy->CheckCollisionWithObjects(12345, 2.0f)) {\n    // Handle\
      \ collision case\n    std::cout << \"Position is blocked!\" << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    // Proceed with movement or placement\n    std::cout << \"Position\
      \ is clear.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Collision Detection in Pathfinding
    code: "bool isValidPath = true;\nfor (int i = 0; i < path.size(); ++i) {\n   \
      \ if (strategy->CheckCollisionWithObjects(path[i], unit->GetCombatReach()))\
      \ {\n        isValidPath = false;\n        break;\n    }\n}\nif (!isValidPath)\
      \ {\n    // Find alternative route\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying navigation mesh and object placement
    data from the game world. Performance can be affected by the number of objects
    in the vicinity, especially in densely populated areas. The 'pos' parameter must
    correspond to a valid position within the system's coordinate space; otherwise,
    behavior is undefined.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of the 'pos' identifier or invalid radius values may lead
    to unexpected results or crashes. Always validate inputs before calling this method,
    particularly when dealing with dynamic positions that change frequently.
