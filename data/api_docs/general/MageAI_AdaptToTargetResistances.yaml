  class: MageAI
  method: AdaptToTargetResistances
  signature: void MageAI::AdaptToTargetResistances(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the mage's spell selection based on the target's resistance attributes.
  description: The AdaptToTargetResistances method modifies a MageAI instance's behavior
    to select spells that are most effective against a specific target's magical resistances.
    This method evaluates the target's resistance values for different magic schools
    and adjusts the AI's spell casting priorities accordingly. It is typically invoked
    when the mage AI needs to optimize its spell selection strategy in response to
    changing combat conditions or target attributes. The method directly influences
    which spells are considered for casting during the AI's decision-making process.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Unit object representing the target against which
      the mage's spell selection should be adapted. This parameter must not be null
      and should represent a valid combatant with resistance attributes.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void MageAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->GetVictim())\n\
      \    {\n        AdaptToTargetResistances(me->GetVictim());\n        // Proceed\
      \ with normal AI logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with custom target selection
    code: "void MageAI::OnCombatStart(Unit* who)\n{\n    if (who)\n    {\n       \
      \ AdaptToTargetResistances(who);\n        // AI now prioritizes spells based\
      \ on who's resistances\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the MageAI's adaptive combat behavior system. It should
    be called whenever the target's resistance profile changes or when a new target
    is selected to ensure optimal spell selection. The implementation likely involves
    checking resistance values and adjusting spell priorities internally without modifying
    the target object directly.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as passing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior. This
    method modifies internal AI state and should only be called during appropriate
    combat situations.
