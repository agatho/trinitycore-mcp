  method: Regenerate
  signature: void EnergyChiResource::Regenerate(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the energy or chi resource based on elapsed time.
  description: The Regenerate method is responsible for incrementally restoring a
    player's energy or chi resource over time. This method is typically called by
    the game loop at regular intervals to simulate the natural regeneration of these
    resources. It calculates how much resource should be regenerated based on the
    time difference (diff) and applies that increase to the current resource value,
    ensuring it does not exceed the maximum allowed amount. The behavior may vary
    depending on the player's class and active abilities that affect resource regeneration.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Regeneration Call
    code: 'uint32 diff = 1000; // 1 second elapsed

      energyChiResource->Regenerate(diff);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void Update(uint32 diff) {\n    // Other update logic...\n    energyChiResource->Regenerate(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked from within the main game loop or update system.
    It's important to ensure that the 'diff' parameter accurately reflects the time
    elapsed since the last call, as incorrect timing can lead to unrealistic resource
    regeneration rates.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly with arbitrary values for 'diff', as
    it may cause inconsistent behavior or resource overflow. The method assumes that
    the internal state of the resource is valid and properly initialized.
