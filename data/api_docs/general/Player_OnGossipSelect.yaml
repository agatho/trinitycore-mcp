documentation:
  brief: Handles the selection of gossip options in the player's interaction with
    NPCs.
  description: The OnGossipSelect method is invoked when a player selects a gossip
    option from an NPC menu, allowing developers to customize the behavior and response
    of the player's interaction. This method typically triggers after a player clicks
    on a specific gossip option, enabling custom actions such as teleporting, quest
    acceptance, or dialogue advancement. It serves as a core component in implementing
    custom gossip interactions within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters:
  - name: source
    description: Pointer to the NPC object that initiated the gossip menu, used to
      identify which NPC the player interacted with.
  - name: gossipOptionId
    description: The ID of the selected gossip option, used to determine which specific
      action was chosen by the player.
  - name: menuId
    description: The unique identifier of the gossip menu being selected, used to
      track and differentiate between various menus.
  returns: null

    code: "void Player::OnGossipSelect(int* source, int32 gossipOptionId, uint32 menuId)\n\
      {\n    if (gossipOptionId == 1)\n    {\n        // Handle quest acceptance\n\
      \        SendQuestDialog(questId);\n    }\n    else if (gossipOptionId == 2)\n\
      \    {\n        // Handle teleportation\n        TeleportTo(0, 0, 0);\n    }\n\
      }\n"

  notes: This method is part of the player's gossip handling system and should be
    implemented carefully to ensure proper interaction with NPCs. It requires accurate
    identification of the source NPC and correct handling of menu IDs to avoid conflicts
    or incorrect behavior.
  warnings: Improper handling of gossipOptionId or menuId can lead to incorrect interactions,
    such as triggering wrong actions or failing to advance dialogue properly. Be cautious
    when implementing custom logic for different options.
