  signature: void MonkAI::OptimizeAbilityPriorities()
documentation:
  brief: Updates and optimizes the priority order of abilities for a Monk AI character
    based on current combat state and resource levels.
  description: The OptimizeAbilityPriorities method dynamically adjusts the sequence
    in which a Monk AI character will use its available abilities during combat. This
    optimization takes into account factors such as player health, mana levels, active
    buffs/debuffs, and the current target's status to determine the most effective
    ability usage order. The method is typically called during AI decision-making
    cycles to ensure that the monk prioritizes abilities in a way that maximizes damage
    output or survivability depending on the situation. It does not directly execute
    abilities but rather updates internal priority lists used by the AI engine.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n    OptimizeAbilityPriorities();\n\
      \    // ... execute highest priority ability ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently during combat, ideally every few
    seconds or after significant changes in player state. The optimization algorithm
    considers various game mechanics including cooldowns, resource costs, and ability
    effectiveness modifiers.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat context unless the AI is designed
    to handle non-combat states properly. Improper usage may lead to incorrect ability
    prioritization during critical moments.
