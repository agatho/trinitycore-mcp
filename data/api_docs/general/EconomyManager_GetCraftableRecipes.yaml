documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of craftable recipes available to the player
  description: The GetCraftableRecipes method returns an integer representing the
    total number of recipes that the player can currently craft. This includes all
    recipes that meet the player's skill level requirements, have sufficient materials
    in their inventory, and are not on cooldown or otherwise restricted. The method
    is typically used to determine how many crafting options are available to a player
    at any given time, which may be useful for UI display, quest progression checks,
    or inventory management systems. This count dynamically updates as the player's
    skills improve, items are consumed, or new recipes are learned.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the number of craftable recipes available
    to the player. Returns zero if no recipes are currently craftable or if the player
    has no crafting skills.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int craftableCount = economyMgr.GetCraftableRecipes();\nif (craftableCount\
      \ > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Player can craft \" << craftableCount << \" recipes.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"No craftable recipes available.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve database queries or cached data lookups depending
    on the implementation. It is recommended to cache this value if it's accessed
    frequently during gameplay to avoid performance degradation. The returned count
    does not include recipes that are locked due to quest requirements or faction
    restrictions.
  warnings: The return value may change between calls if the player's crafting skills,
    inventory, or available recipes are modified during gameplay. Avoid relying on
    cached values without checking for updates in dynamic environments.
