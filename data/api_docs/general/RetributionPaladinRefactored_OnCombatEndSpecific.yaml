documentation:
  brief: Performs cleanup and finalization tasks when a retribution paladin's combat
    session ends
  description: The OnCombatEndSpecific method is invoked when a retribution paladin
    exits combat mode, allowing the AI to execute specific post-combat logic. This
    includes resetting combat-related flags, clearing temporary buffs or debuffs,
    and potentially triggering cooldown resets or resource management adjustments.
    The method ensures that the paladin's state is properly synchronized with the
    game environment after combat concludes, maintaining proper behavior for subsequent
    actions. It typically runs as part of the AI's combat lifecycle management and
    may be called automatically by the TrinityCore framework upon combat termination.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat End Handler
    code: "void MyRetributionPaladinAI::OnCombatEnd()\n{\n    // Call base class implementation\
      \ if needed\n    RetributionPaladinRefactored::OnCombatEndSpecific();\n    //\
      \ Additional custom logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called only during combat termination events.
    It should not be invoked manually unless implementing a custom combat lifecycle
    handler. The method may interact with internal AI state tracking and should be
    implemented carefully to avoid race conditions or inconsistent states.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat end scenarios as it may leave
    the AI in an invalid state. Ensure all combat-related resources are properly released
    before calling this method to prevent memory leaks or undefined behavior.
