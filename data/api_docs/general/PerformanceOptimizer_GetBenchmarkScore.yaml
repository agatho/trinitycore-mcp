  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: GetBenchmarkScore
  signature: float PerformanceOptimizer::GetBenchmarkScore(uint32_t botGuid, const
    std::string & benchmarkName) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the benchmark score for a specific bot and benchmark name.
  description: The GetBenchmarkScore method retrieves a floating-point performance
    score associated with a specific bot GUID and benchmark name. This method is typically
    used in performance optimization and profiling within the TrinityCore framework
    to evaluate how well a particular bot performs under certain benchmark conditions.
    The method likely accesses internal data structures that store benchmark results,
    possibly indexed by bot GUID and benchmark identifier. It's designed to provide
    consistent, reproducible performance metrics for analysis and optimization purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose benchmark score is
      being retrieved. This value should correspond to a valid bot entity within the
      game world.
  - name: benchmarkName
    description: A string identifier for the specific benchmark being queried. This
      name should match a previously registered benchmark within the performance optimization
      system.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the benchmark score for the specified
    bot and benchmark combination. A return value of 0.0 may indicate that no benchmark
    data exists for the given parameters, or that the benchmark has not yet been executed.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve a bot's performance score
    code: "float score = optimizer.GetBenchmarkScore(12345, \"MovementSpeedTest\"\
      );\nif (score > 0.0f) {\n    std::cout << \"Bot performance score: \" << score\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"No benchmark data found.\" <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in performance analysis
    code: 'uint32_t botId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      float aiPerformance = optimizer.GetBenchmarkScore(botId, "AIReactionTime");

      float movementPerformance = optimizer.GetBenchmarkScore(botId, "MovementAccuracy");

      std::cout << "AI Score: " << aiPerformance << ", Movement Score: " << movementPerformance
      << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely thread-safe if used with appropriate locking mechanisms
    in the underlying data structures. The performance score may be cached or computed
    on-demand depending on implementation details. Ensure that both botGuid and benchmarkName
    are valid before calling to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid bot GUID or non-existent benchmark
    name may result in unexpected behavior or return values. Always validate input
    parameters before invoking the method, especially in high-frequency performance-critical
    code paths.
