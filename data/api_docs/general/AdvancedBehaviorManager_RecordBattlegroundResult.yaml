  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::RecordBattlegroundResult(bool victory)
documentation:
  brief: Records the result of a battleground match for the player.
  description: The RecordBattlegroundResult method logs whether the player achieved
    victory or defeat in a battleground instance. This method is typically invoked
    at the conclusion of a battleground match to update player statistics and achievements
    related to competitive play. It may also trigger internal state changes within
    the AdvancedBehaviorManager to track player performance over time. The method
    does not require any parameters as it uses the current player's context to determine
    the outcome.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Battleground End Handler
    code: "void OnBattlegroundEnd(Player* player, bool victory)\n{\n    sAdvancedBehaviorManager->RecordBattlegroundResult(victory);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended to be called only after a battleground has concluded.
    It assumes that the current player context is valid and that the battleground
    result is already determined. The method may interact with internal databases
    or achievement systems, so performance should be considered in high-frequency
    scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a battleground context may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect data recording. Ensure that the player's battleground state
    is properly managed before invoking this function.
