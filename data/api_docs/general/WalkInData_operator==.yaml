  method: operator==
  signature: bool WalkInData::operator==(const WalkInData & right) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two WalkInData objects for equality based on their internal data
    members.
  description: The operator== method performs a member-wise comparison between this
    WalkInData object and another WalkInData object passed as a parameter. It returns
    true if all corresponding data members of both objects are equal, and false otherwise.
    This comparison is typically used to determine whether two walk-in data structures
    contain identical information, which may be relevant in scenarios such as validating
    player movement data or checking for duplicate walk-in events within the game
    world. The method is const, meaning it does not modify either object during the
    comparison operation.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: A constant reference to another WalkInData object that this instance
      will be compared against for equality.
  returns: Returns true if all data members of both WalkInData objects are equal;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Equality Check
    code: 'WalkInData data1;

      WalkInData data2;

      bool isEqual = (data1 == data2); // Returns true if data1 and data2 have identical
      contents'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Conditional Logic
    code: "if (playerWalkData == eventWalkData) {\n    // Handle case where player's\
      \ walk-in data matches expected event data\n    SendNotification(\"Walk-in data\
      \ matches expected pattern\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that all member variables of WalkInData support the ==
    operator for comparison. If any member variable is a complex object, its own equality
    operator must be properly implemented to ensure accurate results.
