  signature: AnimTier Unit::GetAnimTier() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the animation tier of the unit, determining its visual animation
    style.
  description: The GetAnimTier method retrieves the animation tier associated with
    a Unit object, which defines how the unit's animations are handled in terms of
    visual style and behavior. This value influences the appearance and movement patterns
    of creatures or players within World of Warcraft. The method is commonly used
    to determine the appropriate animation set for different types of units, such
    as those with specific combat or movement behaviors. It typically returns one
    of several predefined animation tiers that correspond to different visual styles
    and gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an AnimTier value representing the animation tier of the unit.
    This value determines how animations are applied to the unit, including movement,
    combat, and other visual behaviors. Possible values include various tier types
    such as Tier0, Tier1, etc., which affect the visual appearance and behavior of
    the unit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* target = GetUnit();\nAnimTier tier = target->GetAnimTier();\n\nif\
      \ (tier == ANIM_TIER_0)\n{\n    // Handle animation tier 0\n}\nelse if (tier\
      \ == ANIM_TIER_1)\n{\n    // Handle animation tier 1\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Unit class and is used primarily for determining
    animation behavior in World of Warcraft. It should be used carefully as it affects
    visual representation and gameplay mechanics. Performance considerations include
    avoiding unnecessary calls to this method during combat or movement.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in performance-critical code sections,
    as it may impact frame rate if called excessively during movement or animation
    updates. Also, ensure that the returned AnimTier value is properly handled to
    avoid undefined behavior.
