  brief: Handles game event start and stop notifications for SmartAI
  description: 'The OnGameEvent method is a callback function in the SmartAI class
    that is invoked when a game event begins or ends. This method allows AI-controlled
    creatures to respond dynamically to game events, such as holiday celebrations,
    seasonal changes, or custom server-defined events. The method takes two parameters:
    a boolean flag indicating whether the event is starting or stopping, and a 16-bit
    event ID that uniquely identifies the specific game event. When called, this method
    typically triggers associated smart scripts or actions defined in the creature''s
    AI behavior configuration.'
  parameters:
  - name: start
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the game event is starting (true)
      or stopping (false)
  - name: eventId
    description: 16-bit unsigned integer representing the unique identifier of the
      game event being triggered
  returns: void

    code: "void SmartAI::OnGameEvent(bool start, uint16 eventId)\n{\n    if (start)\n\
      \    {\n        // Handle event start\n        if (eventId == 1234)\n      \
      \  {\n            // Activate holiday decorations or special behavior\n    \
      \        me->SetFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS, UNIT_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE);\n        }\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Handle event end\n        if (eventId ==\
      \ 1234)\n        {\n            // Remove holiday decorations or restore normal\
      \ behavior\n            me->RemoveFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS, UNIT_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the game server's event system when a
    game event state changes. The SmartAI implementation should be prepared to handle
    both start and stop events for any registered event ID. Developers should ensure
    that all event-related actions are properly synchronized with the game world state.
  warnings: Improper handling of event states may cause inconsistent AI behavior or
    visual glitches. Always validate the eventId before performing operations, as
    invalid IDs could lead to undefined behavior. Avoid performing heavy computations
    within this method as it's called frequently during event transitions.
