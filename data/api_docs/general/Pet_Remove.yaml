  class: Pet
  method: Remove
  signature: void Pet::Remove(PetSaveMode mode, bool returnreagent)
documentation:
  brief: Removes the pet from the world and updates its saved state according to the
    specified mode.
  description: The Remove method is used to eliminate a pet from the game world, typically
    when the pet is dismissed, released, or destroyed. It handles the cleanup of the
    pet's presence in the world and ensures that its state is properly persisted or
    discarded based on the provided PetSaveMode. The method also optionally returns
    reagents if the pet was summoned using soulshards or similar resources. This function
    is integral to pet management within TrinityCore's creature and player systems,
    ensuring proper resource handling and database synchronization.
  parameters:
  - name: mode
    description: Specifies how the pet should be saved or removed. Valid values include
      PetSaveMode::Saved, PetSaveMode::NotSaved, PetSaveMode::Dismissed, etc., depending
      on the intended outcome of the removal.
  - name: returnreagent
    description: Determines whether reagents (such as soulshards) used to summon the
      pet should be returned to the owner. If true, reagents are refunded; if false,
      they are not.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pet Removal
    code: "Pet* myPet = player->GetPet();\nif (myPet)\n{\n    myPet->Remove(PetSaveMode::Dismissed,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove Pet Without Returning Reagents
    code: "if (player->GetPet())\n{\n    player->GetPet()->Remove(PetSaveMode::NotSaved,\
      \ false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally calls database operations to update the pet's saved
    state and may trigger additional events such as pet dismissal notifications. It
    should only be called when the pet is no longer needed in the world.
  warnings: Calling Remove on a null pet pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the pet exists before calling this method.
