api:
  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: RegisterBot
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::RegisterBot(Player * bot, BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a bot player and its associated AI with the threat coordination
    system.
  description: The RegisterBot method integrates a bot player into the ThreatCoordinator's
    management system, linking the Player object with its corresponding BotAI instance.
    This allows the threat coordinator to track and manage the bot's threat state,
    including threat generation, target selection, and threat distribution among group
    members. The method is typically called during bot initialization or when a bot
    is added to a group. It ensures that the bot's AI behavior is properly synchronized
    with the overall threat management system for coordinated group combat.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character to be
      registered. Must be a valid player instance and should already be initialized
      in the game world.
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI object associated with the bot player. This
      AI instance controls the bot's behavior and must be properly initialized before
      registration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Registration
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Bot player instance

      BotAI* myBotAI = ...; // Bot AI instance

      ThreatCoordinator::instance()->RegisterBot(myBot, myBotAI);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Registration with Error Checking
    code: "if (myBot && myBotAI)\n{\n    ThreatCoordinator::instance()->RegisterBot(myBot,\
      \ myBotAI);\n    // Bot is now managed by threat coordinator\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot player and AI are already properly initialized.
    The ThreatCoordinator maintains internal tracking of registered bots, so calling
    this method multiple times for the same bot may result in unexpected behavior
    or duplicate entries. It is recommended to check if a bot is already registered
    before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling RegisterBot with null pointers will likely cause crashes or undefined
    behavior. Ensure that both parameters are valid before invoking this method. Additionally,
    bots should not be registered while they are in combat or actively engaged in
    threat-generating activities, as this may interfere with the threat management
    system.
