  class: LootCoordination
  method: RequestGroupInput
  signature: void LootCoordination::RequestGroupInput(Group * group, const std::string
    & question, uint32 timeoutMs)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a group input request with a question and timeout for loot coordination.
  description: The RequestGroupInput method sends a prompt to all members of a specified
    group, requesting their input for loot coordination decisions. This functionality
    is typically used during group loot events where players must vote or make choices
    regarding item distribution. The method sets up a timed interaction window during
    which group members can respond. The timeout parameter controls how long the group
    has to provide input before the system moves forward with default behavior. This
    method is integral to TrinityCore's loot system, particularly for group loot scenarios
    such as dungeon or raid loot rolls.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group that will receive
      the input request. Must be a valid group instance; null pointers will cause
      undefined behavior.
  - name: question
    description: String containing the question or prompt to display to group members.
      This text is shown in the loot coordination UI and should clearly communicate
      what input is required from players.
  - name: timeoutMs
    description: Timeout value in milliseconds that determines how long the group
      has to respond to the input request. Must be a positive integer; values of zero
      or negative will result in immediate timeout behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Input Request
    code: 'Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();

      LootCoordination::RequestGroupInput(myGroup, "Should we roll for this item?",
      30000);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Group Input with Dynamic Question
    code: 'Group* raidGroup = player->GetGroup();

      std::string question = "Vote on loot distribution for: " + item->GetTemplate()->Name;

      LootCoordination::RequestGroupInput(raidGroup, question, 60000);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to work within the context of TrinityCore's loot
    coordination system. It relies on proper group membership validation and assumes
    that the Group object passed in is active and valid. The timeout mechanism uses
    a standard timer implementation, so performance considerations include ensuring
    that the timeout value is reasonable for player interaction. This method does
    not directly handle input responses; it only initiates the request process.
  warnings: Passing null pointers for the group parameter will result in crashes or
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the group is valid and active before calling this
    method. The question string should be properly formatted and localized to avoid
    UI display issues. Be cautious with very short timeout values as they may not
    allow sufficient time for players to respond, especially during high-latency network
    conditions.
