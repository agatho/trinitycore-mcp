  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: CreateDatabaseTimer
  signature: ScopedTimer BotPerformanceMonitor::CreateDatabaseTimer()
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a scoped timer for monitoring database operation performance.
  description: The CreateDatabaseTimer method initializes and returns a ScopedTimer
    object specifically designed for measuring the execution time of database operations
    within the BotPerformanceMonitor class. This timer is used to track how long various
    database queries and transactions take, which helps in identifying performance
    bottlenecks in bot behavior and AI decision-making processes. The returned timer
    automatically records the start time when created and will log the elapsed time
    upon destruction, making it ideal for profiling database interactions without
    manual timing management.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ScopedTimer object that begins measuring time immediately upon creation.
    The timer will automatically record and report the duration of the database operation
    when it goes out of scope, allowing for precise performance monitoring of database
    calls within the bot system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Database Timer Usage
    code: "void SomeBotFunction() {\n    BotPerformanceMonitor& monitor = BotPerformanceMonitor::Instance();\n\
      \    auto dbTimer = monitor.CreateDatabaseTimer();\n    // Perform database\
      \ operations here\n    // Timer automatically logs duration when dbTimer goes\
      \ out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The ScopedTimer returned by this method leverages RAII (Resource Acquisition
    Is Initialization) principles, ensuring automatic timing measurement without requiring
    explicit start/stop calls. The timer's measurements are typically logged to performance
    monitoring systems or debug output depending on the configuration settings of
    the BotPerformanceMonitor instance.
