  class: Creature
  method: GetLastDamagedTime
  signature: time_t Creature::GetLastDamagedTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the timestamp of the last damage dealt to this creature.
  description: This method retrieves the time_t value representing the last time this
    creature received damage from any source. It is commonly used in game mechanics
    to determine when a creature was last attacked or took damage, which can be useful
    for tracking cooldowns, determining if a creature has been recently damaged, or
    managing AI behavior. The returned timestamp is typically compared against current
    time to determine elapsed time since the last damage event.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a time_t value representing the Unix timestamp of when the creature
    last took damage. If no damage has been dealt yet, it returns 0 or a default value
    indicating no recent damage.
  examples:
  - title: Check if creature was damaged within last 5 seconds
    code: "if (creature->GetLastDamagedTime() + 5 > time(nullptr)) {\n    // Creature\
      \ was damaged within last 5 seconds\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other creature damage-related
    methods to track creature state. It may be affected by various game mechanics
    such as damage reduction, critical hits, and other combat systems. Performance-wise,
    it's a lightweight call that does not involve any complex operations.
  warnings: Be aware that this value might be reset or modified during certain events
    like creature respawn or AI resets. Also, if the creature has never taken damage,
    this method may return 0 or an invalid timestamp depending on implementation.
