  class: BotSpawner
  method: CreateBotCharacter
  signature: int BotSpawner::CreateBotCharacter(uint32 accountId)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new bot character for the specified account ID and returns its
    unique identifier.
  description: The CreateBotCharacter method is responsible for generating a new bot
    character within the TrinityCore framework. It takes an account ID as input, validates
    it, and proceeds to create a new character associated with that account. The method
    handles all necessary database operations and game state updates required to properly
    initialize the bot character. This function is typically used in automated bot
    systems or testing environments where multiple AI-controlled characters need to
    be generated programmatically. The method ensures that the created character adheres
    to game rules and constraints, such as character limits per account and valid
    race/class combinations.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: The unique identifier of the account for which the bot character
      will be created. Must be a valid, existing account ID in the database.
  returns: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the newly created bot character
    if successful, or -1 if the operation fails due to invalid input, account constraints,
    or database errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Character Creation
    code: "uint32 accountId = 12345;\nint botGuid = botSpawner->CreateBotCharacter(accountId);\n\
      if (botGuid != -1) {\n    printf(\"Successfully created bot character with GUID:\
      \ %d\\n\", botGuid);\n} else {\n    printf(\"Failed to create bot character\
      \ for account %d\\n\", accountId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Bot Character Creation with Error Handling
    code: "uint32 accountId = 54321;\nint result = botSpawner->CreateBotCharacter(accountId);\n\
      switch (result) {\n    case -1:\n        printf(\"Error: Failed to create bot\
      \ character for account %d\\n\", accountId);\n        break;\n    case 0:\n\
      \        printf(\"Warning: Account %d has reached maximum bot character limit\\\
      n\", accountId);\n        break;\n    default:\n        printf(\"Successfully\
      \ created bot character with GUID %d for account %d\\n\", result, accountId);\n\
      \        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database operations and should be used carefully in
    performance-critical sections of code. The method may block during database transactions.
    Ensure that the provided accountId is valid and corresponds to an existing account
    before calling this function.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent account ID will likely
    result in undefined behavior or database errors. This method should not be called
    concurrently for the same account without proper locking mechanisms to prevent
    race conditions.
