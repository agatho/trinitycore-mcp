documentation:
  brief: Sends aura information for a target player to the client.
  description: This method sends aura data for a specified target player to the client,
    allowing the player to view the target's active auras. It is typically used in
    conjunction with other player-related methods to display status effects or buffs/Debuffs
    on targets. The method operates within the context of World of Warcraft's packet
    system and may be called during player updates or when a player enters the world.
    This method does not require any parameters beyond the target reference, as it
    implicitly uses the player's own data.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* target = new Player();


      // Assuming target is properly initialized

      player->SendAurasForTarget(target);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves sending packet data to the client and may have
    performance implications if called frequently. The method should be used carefully
    in scenarios where multiple players are being updated simultaneously.
  warnings: This method might not be safe for use in multithreaded environments without
    proper synchronization, as it could cause race conditions or data corruption if
    multiple threads attempt to send aura data simultaneously.
