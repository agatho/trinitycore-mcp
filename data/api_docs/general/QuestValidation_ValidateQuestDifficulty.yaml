  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateQuestDifficulty
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateQuestDifficulty(uint32 questId, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player can accept a quest based on their current difficulty
    settings and quest requirements.
  description: The ValidateQuestDifficulty method checks if a given quest is appropriate
    for the specified player, considering the player's current difficulty settings
    and the quest's difficulty requirements. This validation ensures that players
    are not presented with quests that are too difficult or too easy for their current
    level and preferences. The method typically integrates with the game's quest system
    to filter out quests that do not meet the player's criteria, such as minimum level
    requirements, faction restrictions, or difficulty settings. It is commonly used
    in automated questing systems or botting logic to determine valid quest targets.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to validate. Must be a positive
      integer corresponding to a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player for whom the
      quest validation is performed. This parameter determines the player's current
      settings, level, and restrictions that affect quest eligibility.
  returns: Returns true if the quest can be accepted by the player based on difficulty
    requirements; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Validation
    code: "uint32 questId = 12345;\nPlayer* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized\n\
      if (QuestValidation::ValidateQuestDifficulty(questId, player)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with quest acceptance logic\n    printf(\"Quest %u is valid for the player\\\
      n\", questId);\n} else {\n    printf(\"Quest %u is not valid for the player\\\
      n\", questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Accept Logic
    code: "void HandleQuestAccept(Player* player, uint32 questId) {\n    if (QuestValidation::ValidateQuestDifficulty(questId,\
      \ player)) {\n        // Proceed with normal quest acceptance\n        player->AddQuest(questId);\n\
      \        player->SendQuestGiverQuestDetails(questId);\n    } else {\n      \
      \  // Handle invalid quest case\n        player->SendNotification(\"This quest\
      \ is not available for your current settings.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely checks against the player's selected difficulty mode, their
    level range, faction requirements, and any custom restrictions defined in the
    game's configuration. It may also consider whether the quest has been previously
    completed or if it conflicts with other active quests.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior. Also, be aware that this validation might
    not account for all possible quest restrictions, such as reputation requirements
    or specific item possession checks.
