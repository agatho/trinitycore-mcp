documentation:
  brief: Restores the playerbot database from a specified backup file path
  description: The RestoreDatabase method attempts to restore the playerbot database
    state using a backup file located at the provided path. This functionality is
    typically used during migration processes or when reverting changes made to the
    playerbot system. The method validates the existence and integrity of the backup
    file before proceeding with the restoration process. It may involve stopping active
    bot operations, replacing current database contents with backup data, and restarting
    the bot management system. The operation is designed to be atomic, ensuring that
    either the full restoration succeeds or fails without leaving the database in
    a corrupted state.
  parameters:
  - name: backupPath
    description: Absolute or relative path to the backup file containing playerbot
      database state. Must point to a valid file with appropriate read permissions.
      The file should be in a format compatible with the current TrinityCore playerbot
      system version.
  returns: Returns true if the database restoration was successful and complete, false
    otherwise. A return value of false may indicate issues such as invalid file path,
    insufficient permissions, corrupted backup data, or failure during the restore
    process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Database Restoration
    code: "PlayerbotMigrationMgr* migrationMgr = PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance();\n\
      bool success = migrationMgr->RestoreDatabase(\"/path/to/playerbots_backup.sql\"\
      );\nif (success) {\n    sLog->outString(\"Playerbot database restored successfully.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to restore playerbot database from\
      \ backup.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during maintenance windows or when the
    playerbot system is not actively processing commands. The backup file must match
    the expected schema version of the current TrinityCore installation to prevent
    compatibility issues. Consider backing up the current database before attempting
    restoration.
  warnings: Attempting to restore a corrupted or incompatible backup file may result
    in data loss or system instability. Ensure that the backup path is accessible
    and contains valid, unmodified database backup files. Never execute this method
    while bots are actively running without proper shutdown procedures.
