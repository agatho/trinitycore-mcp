  class: Battlefield
  method: InitStalker
  signature: void Battlefield::InitStalker(int entry, const Position & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a battlefield stalker creature with the specified entry and position.
  description: The InitStalker method is responsible for creating and initializing
    a stalker creature within the Battlefield framework. This method sets up the stalker
    with the provided creature entry ID and positions it at the specified location.
    The stalker typically serves as an AI-controlled entity that monitors or interacts
    with battlefield events, such as tracking player movements or triggering objectives.
    It's commonly used during battlefield initialization to place essential game entities
    that are required for the battlefield's functionality. The method does not return
    any value but modifies the internal state of the Battlefield object by adding
    the stalker to its managed creatures list.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The creature entry ID that defines which type of stalker creature
      to create. This corresponds to the entry field in the creature_template table
      in the database.
  - name: pos
    description: The Position structure specifying the x, y, z coordinates and orientation
      where the stalker should be spawned. The position must be valid within the battlefield's
      boundaries.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic stalker initialization
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(1234);\n\
      if (bf)\n{\n    Position stalkerPos = { 100.0f, 200.0f, 50.0f, 0.0f };\n   \
      \ bf->InitStalker(12345, stalkerPos);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing multiple stalkers in a battlefield
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(5678);\n\
      if (bf)\n{\n    Position positions[] = {\n        { 100.0f, 200.0f, 50.0f, 0.0f\
      \ },\n        { 150.0f, 250.0f, 55.0f, 1.57f },\n        { 200.0f, 300.0f, 60.0f,\
      \ 3.14f }\n    };\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i)\n    {\n        bf->InitStalker(12345\
      \ + i, positions[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during the battlefield initialization
    phase. The stalker creature will be automatically managed by the battlefield system
    and cleaned up when the battlefield ends. Ensure that the provided entry ID corresponds
    to a valid creature template in the database, otherwise the stalker may not spawn
    correctly.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid entry ID or position can result in
    undefined behavior or failed spawns. The method does not validate whether the
    specified position is within the battlefield's active area, so it's important
    to ensure proper positioning before calling this function.
