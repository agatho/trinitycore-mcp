documentation:
  brief: Updates the state of a door object within the instance script.
  description: The UpdateDoorState method is responsible for updating the interactive
    state of a GameObject representing a door within an instance. This typically involves
    setting the door's open/closed status, handling any associated triggers or events,
    and ensuring that the door's visual and functional properties are synchronized
    with the game world. The method is commonly called when door states need to be
    modified based on quest progress, boss encounters, or other scripted events in
    a dungeon or raid instance.
  parameters:
  - name: door
    description: A pointer to the GameObject representing the door whose state needs
      to be updated. This object must be a valid door-type game object within the
      instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Door State After Boss Kill
    code: "void BossDeathHandler()\n{\n    GameObject* door = instance->GetGameObject(BOSS_DOOR_GUID);\n\
      \    if (door)\n    {\n        instance->UpdateDoorState(door);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Multiple Doors in Sequence
    code: "void OpenAllDoors()\n{\n    for (uint32 i = 0; i < DOOR_COUNT; ++i)\n \
      \   {\n        GameObject* door = instance->GetGameObject(doorGuids[i]);\n \
      \       if (door)\n        {\n            instance->UpdateDoorState(door);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during instance scripting events such as
    boss encounters, quest completion, or when door states need to be synchronized
    with the overall instance state. It's important to ensure that the GameObject
    pointer passed is valid and represents a door type object to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null GameObject pointer to this method can lead
    to crashes or undefined behavior. Always verify that the GameObject exists and
    is of the correct type before calling UpdateDoorState.
