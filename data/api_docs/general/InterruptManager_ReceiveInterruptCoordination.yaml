  class: InterruptManager
  method: ReceiveInterruptCoordination
  signature: void InterruptManager::ReceiveInterruptCoordination(Player * sender,
    const InterruptTarget & target)
documentation:
  brief: Processes an interrupt coordination message received from another player
    in the game.
  description: The ReceiveInterruptCoordination method handles incoming interrupt
    coordination requests from other players within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method is typically invoked when a player attempts to interrupt another player's
    spell casting or ability execution, and it coordinates the interrupt action across
    the game world. The method processes the target information provided by the sending
    player and applies appropriate interrupt logic based on game rules and player
    states. It ensures that interrupt actions are properly synchronized between players
    and maintains consistency in combat mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: sender
    description: Pointer to the Player object who initiated the interrupt coordination
      request. This represents the player attempting to interrupt another's action.
  - name: target
    description: Reference to an InterruptTarget structure containing information
      about the target of the interrupt, including the target player and relevant
      combat state data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic interrupt coordination handling
    code: "void HandleInterruptCoordination(Player* sender, const InterruptTarget&\
      \ target)\n{\n    interruptManager->ReceiveInterruptCoordination(sender, target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing interrupt with validation
    code: "void ProcessIncomingInterrupt(Player* sender, const InterruptTarget& target)\n\
      {\n    if (!sender || !target.IsValid())\n        return;\n    \n    interruptManager->ReceiveInterruptCoordination(sender,\
      \ target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core interrupt system and should only be called
    when a valid interrupt coordination message is received. The InterruptTarget structure
    must contain valid data to prevent undefined behavior. The method does not perform
    any validation on its inputs, so callers should ensure data integrity before invoking
    this function.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or null parameters can lead to crashes
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that both sender and target parameters are properly
    initialized before invocation. This method is typically used internally by the
    core game loop and should not be called directly from external systems without
    proper context.
