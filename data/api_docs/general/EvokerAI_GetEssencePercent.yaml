api:
  class: EvokerAI
  method: GetEssencePercent
  signature: float EvokerAI::GetEssencePercent()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current essence percentage of the evoker.
  description: The GetEssencePercent method retrieves the percentage value representing
    how much essence the evoker currently has available. This value is typically used
    for determining spell casting eligibility, resource management, or UI display
    purposes within the EvokerAI system. The returned float value ranges from 0.0
    to 100.0, where 0.0 indicates no essence and 100.0 indicates full essence capacity.
    This method does not modify any internal state and is safe for repeated calls
    during AI decision-making processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 100.0 representing the current essence percentage
    of the evoker. Returns 0.0 if the evoker has no essence or if the essence tracking
    system is not initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (evokerAI->GetEssencePercent() >= 50.0f)\n{\n    // Cast a high-cost\
      \ spell\n    evokerAI->CastSpell(SPELL_HIGH_COST_SPELL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Essence Percent for Resource Management
    code: "float essence = evokerAI->GetEssencePercent();\nif (essence < 20.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Switch to low-cost spells or passive abilities\n    evokerAI->SetCurrentSpell(SPELL_LOW_COST_SPELL);\n\
      }\nelse if (essence >= 80.0f)\n{\n    // Activate burst mode or powerful abilities\n\
      \    evokerAI->ActivateBurstMode();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal essence tracking mechanism of the EvokerAI
    class. It is recommended to call this method only when necessary as it may involve
    calculations or access to game state variables. The value returned should be treated
    as a snapshot at the time of invocation and may change immediately after.
  warnings: Ensure that the evoker object is properly initialized before calling this
    method, as accessing uninitialized essence data could lead to undefined behavior.
    This method does not perform any validation on the internal essence state, so
    unexpected values may be returned if the AI system is in an inconsistent state.
