documentation:
  brief: Checks whether emotes are enabled for the social manager instance.
  description: The AreEmotesEnabled method determines if emote functionality is currently
    active within the SocialManager. This flag typically controls whether players
    can perform or receive emote actions such as waving, laughing, or other non-verbal
    communication gestures in the game world. The method returns a boolean value indicating
    the current state of the emote system. This check is often used before allowing
    emote-related operations to ensure proper game behavior and player experience.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if emotes are enabled, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (socialManager.AreEmotesEnabled()) {\n    // Allow emote actions\n \
      \   player.SendEmote(EMOTE_STATE_WAVE);\n} else {\n    // Emotes disabled, handle\
      \ accordingly\n    player.SendSystemMessage(\"Emotes are currently disabled.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely reads from an internal configuration flag or state variable
    that may be set during server initialization or modified via game commands. It's
    important to note that emote functionality might also depend on other factors
    such as player permissions, account status, or specific game modes.
