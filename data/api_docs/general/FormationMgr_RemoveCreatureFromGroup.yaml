  class: FormationMgr
  method: RemoveCreatureFromGroup
  signature: void FormationMgr::RemoveCreatureFromGroup(CreatureGroup * group, Creature
    * member)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a creature from its assigned formation group.
  description: The RemoveCreatureFromGroup method removes a specified creature from
    its current formation group. This operation updates internal group data structures
    to ensure the creature is no longer considered part of the group's formation.
    The method is typically invoked when a creature needs to be separated from its
    group, such as during combat, movement changes, or when the group is disbanded.
    It ensures that the creature's formation-related state is properly cleaned up
    and that the group's member count is adjusted accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the CreatureGroup from which the creature will be removed.
      Must be a valid pointer to an existing group.
  - name: member
    description: Pointer to the Creature that will be removed from the group. Must
      be a valid pointer to an existing creature that belongs to the specified group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CreatureGroup* group = ...; // Assume valid group

      Creature* creature = ...; // Assume valid creature in the group

      FormationMgr::RemoveCreatureFromGroup(group, creature);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Safety Check
    code: "if (group && member)\n{\n    FormationMgr::RemoveCreatureFromGroup(group,\
      \ member);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid pointers\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided group and creature pointers are valid
    and that the creature is actually a member of the specified group. It does not
    perform any validation to confirm membership, so calling this method with an incorrect
    combination may lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or null pointers can result in crashes
    or memory corruption. Always ensure that both the group and member parameters
    are valid before invoking this function. Additionally, removing a creature from
    a group without proper handling of its AI state may cause unexpected behavior
    during combat or movement.
