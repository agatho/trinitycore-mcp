  signature: void TradeSystem::UpdateVendorAvailability()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the availability status of vendors in the trading system based on
    current game conditions and player interactions.
  description: The UpdateVendorAvailability method is responsible for managing and
    synchronizing the active state of vendors within the TrinityCore trade system.
    This function ensures that vendor inventory, stock levels, and availability are
    accurately reflected based on in-game events such as time-based resets, player
    purchases, or server-side modifications. It typically iterates through all registered
    vendors, evaluates their current status against predefined conditions, and updates
    their availability flags or inventory states accordingly. The method may also
    trigger related callbacks or notifications to maintain consistency across the
    trading subsystem.

  - title: Basic Usage in Trade System Update Loop
    code: "void WorldSession::UpdateTradeSystem()\n{\n    TradeSystem::UpdateVendorAvailability();\n\
      \    // Additional trade system logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called during periodic updates or in response to specific
    game events. It may involve database synchronization and should be considered
    when implementing performance-critical trading features. The implementation details
    could include locking mechanisms for thread safety if the trade system supports
    concurrent access.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of appropriate contexts (e.g., during critical
    sections) might lead to inconsistent vendor states or race conditions. Ensure
    that any modifications to vendor availability are properly synchronized with the
    game's transactional model.
