  class: ResourceManager
  method: ConsumeResource
  signature: void ResourceManager::ConsumeResource(ResourceType type, uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified amount of a resource of the given type.
  description: 'The ConsumeResource method reduces the available quantity of a specific
    resource type by the provided amount. This method is typically used in game mechanics
    where players or NPCs spend resources such as mana, rage, energy, or health points.
    It ensures that resource consumption is properly tracked and validated, preventing
    negative resource values. The method does not return any value but modifies internal
    resource state. Precondition: The resource type must be valid and the amount must
    be non-negative. Postcondition: The internal resource count for the specified
    type is decreased by the given amount, or remains unchanged if insufficient resources
    exist.'
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The ResourceType enum value indicating which type of resource to
      consume. Valid values include mana, health, rage, energy, and other game-specific
      resource types.
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of the specified resource to consume. Must be a non-negative
      integer. If zero, no action is taken.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Consume Mana Resource
    code: resourceManager.ConsumeResource(ResourceType::MANA, 50);
    language: cpp
  - title: Consume Health Resource with Conditional Check
    code: "if (player->HasResource(ResourceType::HEALTH, 100)) {\n    resourceManager.ConsumeResource(ResourceType::HEALTH,\
      \ 100);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger resource management system and may
    interact with other methods like GetResource() or HasResource(). It's important
    to ensure that resource types are properly defined in the ResourceType enum. The
    implementation should handle edge cases such as insufficient resources gracefully,
    possibly by not consuming anything or throwing an exception.
  warnings: Ensure that the amount parameter is always non-negative to avoid unexpected
    behavior. Be cautious when calling this method on resources that might be shared
    among multiple entities, as it could lead to unintended side effects if not properly
    synchronized.
