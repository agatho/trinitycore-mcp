api:
  class: AuctionManager
  method: RecordAuctionSold
  signature: void AuctionManager::RecordAuctionSold(int botGuid, uint64 salePrice,
    uint64 costBasis)
documentation:
  brief: Records the sale of an auction item and updates the bot's financial records
    with the sale price and cost basis.
  description: The RecordAuctionSold method is used to log the successful completion
    of an auction sale within the TrinityCore auction system. It takes the GUID of
    the bot that sold the item, the final sale price received, and the original cost
    basis of the item. This method likely updates internal accounting records or statistics
    for the bot's auction activity. The method does not return any value but performs
    necessary bookkeeping operations to track profits, losses, and transaction history
    for the auction house system.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the game object or player representing
      the bot that sold the auction item. This typically corresponds to a character
      or NPC in the World of Warcraft environment.
  - name: salePrice
    description: The amount of gold received from the successful sale of the auctioned
      item, represented as a 64-bit unsigned integer value.
  - name: costBasis
    description: The original cost or value of the item being sold, also represented
      as a 64-bit unsigned integer. This may be used to calculate profit margins or
      track inventory costs.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Auction Sale Recording
    code: AuctionManager::RecordAuctionSold(12345, 1000000, 500000);
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording a Bot's Auction Profit
    code: 'uint64 botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      uint64 salePrice = 2500000;

      uint64 costBasis = 1200000;

      AuctionManager::RecordAuctionSold(botGuid, salePrice, costBasis);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger auction management system that tracks
    bot behavior and financial outcomes. It may interact with database storage to
    persist transaction data or update in-memory structures for performance metrics.
