  method: GetTotalAuraModValue
  signature: float Unit::GetTotalAuraModValue(UnitMods unitMod) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total modifier value for a specified unit mod.
  description: This method computes the sum of all aura modifiers applied to a specific
    unit mod, such as attack power, spell power, or defense. It aggregates effects
    from various sources including buffs, debuffs, and temporary modifiers. The result
    represents the cumulative impact of these modifiers on the unit's performance.
    This function is essential for determining character stats and combat effectiveness
    in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the total modifier applied to the specified
    unit mod. Negative values indicate reduction, while positive values indicate enhancement.
    The returned value may be zero if no modifiers are active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float attackPower = unit->GetTotalAuraModValue(UnitMods::UNIT_MOD_ATTACK_POWER);

      float spellPower = unit->GetTotalAuraModValue(UnitMods::UNIT_MOD_SPELL_POWER);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other unit-related functions
    to determine overall character stats. Performance considerations include checking
    for active effects before calculating modifiers, as this can impact computational
    overhead during combat situations.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in combat situations, as it
    may involve multiple calculations and could affect performance if not properly
    optimized. Also note that the method will return zero if no aura modifiers are
    applied to the specified unit mod.
