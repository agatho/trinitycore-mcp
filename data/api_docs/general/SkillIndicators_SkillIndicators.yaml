documentation:
  brief: Initializes the SkillIndicators class with default values and prepares internal
    state for skill-related data handling.
  description: The SkillIndicators constructor initializes the class instance, setting
    up any necessary internal data structures or default configurations required for
    managing skill indicators within the TrinityCore framework. This method ensures
    that all member variables are properly initialized before the object is used in
    gameplay mechanics such as skill tracking, display updates, or interaction with
    player abilities. It typically performs setup operations like initializing counters,
    clearing indicator states, and preparing buffers for storing skill-related information.
    The constructor does not take any parameters and should be called automatically
    when creating a new instance of the SkillIndicators class.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new SkillIndicators instance
    code: 'SkillIndicators* indicators = new SkillIndicators();

      // The constructor is automatically called here

      // and initializes the internal state of the object'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked implicitly during object construction. Developers
    should ensure that any derived classes properly call the base class constructor
    if overridden. The initialization performed by this constructor may involve memory
    allocation for internal data structures, so performance considerations are minimal
    but worth noting in high-frequency usage scenarios.
