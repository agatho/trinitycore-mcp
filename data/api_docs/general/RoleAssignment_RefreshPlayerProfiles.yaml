  brief: Refreshes all player profiles within the role assignment system to ensure
    current data consistency.
  description: The RefreshPlayerProfiles method updates and synchronizes player profile
    information across the role assignment system. This function ensures that all
    cached or previously loaded player data is refreshed with the latest values from
    the database or active state. It typically triggers internal updates to maintain
    accurate role assignments, permissions, and character states. The method does
    not require any input parameters and performs its operations in-memory, updating
    the system's internal representation of player roles without external dependencies.
