documentation:
  brief: Checks if combo points are available for the player to use
  description: The ComboPointSystem::available() method determines whether the player
    currently has any combo points that can be spent on abilities. This is typically
    used in conjunction with combo point-based abilities like Sinister Strike, Eviscerate,
    or other finishers that require combo points to function. The method returns true
    if the player has at least one combo point available, and false otherwise. This
    check is essential for preventing invalid ability usage when a player attempts
    to use combo point-consuming abilities without having sufficient points.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has at least one combo point available for use,
    false if no combo points are currently available
  examples:
  - title: Basic combo point availability check
    code: "if (player->GetComboPointSystem()->available()) {\n    // Player can spend\
      \ combo points\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_EVISERATE, true);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // No combo points available\n    player->SendSpellFailed(0, SPELL_EVISERATE,\
      \ SPELL_FAILED_NO_COMBO_POINTS);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before attempting to consume combo points
    for abilities. It's important to note that combo points are automatically consumed
    when using abilities like Eviscerate or Sinister Strike, so this check should
    be performed before the ability execution to prevent invalid actions.
  warnings: This method does not account for temporary loss of combo points due to
    certain effects (like being stunned). Always validate combo point availability
    before executing combo point-consuming spells to avoid unexpected behavior or
    client-side errors.
