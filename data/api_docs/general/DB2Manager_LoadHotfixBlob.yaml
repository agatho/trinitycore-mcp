  class: DB2Manager
  method: LoadHotfixBlob
  signature: void DB2Manager::LoadHotfixBlob(uint32 localeMask)
documentation:
  brief: Loads and processes hotfix data blobs for the specified locale mask.
  description: 'The LoadHotfixBlob method initializes and loads hotfix data from database
    files, applying localization-specific modifications based on the provided locale
    mask. This method is typically invoked during server startup or when locale changes
    occur to ensure that all game data reflects the correct localized versions. It
    handles parsing of DB2 hotfix records and updates internal caches accordingly.
    The method does not return any value but modifies the internal state of the DB2Manager
    instance. Precondition: The database connection must be established and valid
    before calling this method. Postcondition: All hotfix data for the specified locale
    is loaded and ready for use by other subsystems.'
  parameters:
  - name: localeMask
    description: A bitmask representing the locales to load hotfix data for. Each
      bit corresponds to a specific locale ID (e.g., 0x1 for enUS, 0x2 for koKR).
      Multiple locales can be combined using bitwise OR operations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Load hotfix data for English and Korean locales
    code: 'DB2Manager db2Manager;

      uint32 localeMask = LOCALE_enUS | LOCALE_koKR;

      db2Manager.LoadHotfixBlob(localeMask);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Load all available hotfix data
    code: 'DB2Manager db2Manager;

      uint32 localeMask = 0xFFFFFFFF; // All locales

      // Assuming LOCALE_enUS, LOCALE_koKR, etc. are defined

      // This would load hotfixes for all supported languages

      db2Manager.LoadHotfixBlob(localeMask);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization and should not
    be invoked repeatedly during runtime unless locale changes occur. The hotfix data
    loaded may override default DB2 records, allowing for dynamic content updates
    without requiring full database rebuilds.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid locale mask may result in incomplete
    or corrupted data loading. Ensure that the locale mask values are valid and correspond
    to supported locales in the TrinityCore build.
