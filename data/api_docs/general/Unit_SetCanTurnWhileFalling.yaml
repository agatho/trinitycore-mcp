  class: Unit
  method: SetCanTurnWhileFalling
  signature: bool Unit::SetCanTurnWhileFalling(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the unit can turn while falling.
  description: This method controls whether a unit can change direction while in mid-fall,
    which is particularly relevant for units with flight movement capabilities. It
    affects the unit's ability to perform movement updates during falling state, potentially
    allowing for more dynamic movement behavior during aerial maneuvers. The method
    returns true if the setting was successfully applied, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the setting was successfully applied, false otherwise.
    A return value of false typically indicates that the operation failed or the unit
    does not support this type of movement.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* unit = player->GetUnit();\nbool result = unit->SetCanTurnWhileFalling(true);\n\
      if (result)\n{\n    // Unit can now turn while falling\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely interacts with the unit''s movement
    handler and may affect how movement updates are processed during flight. Performance
    considerations include potential impact on movement calculations during fall,
    especially for units with complex movement patterns.'
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it can affect movement behavior
    during falls, particularly in scenarios involving high-speed movement or complex
    pathfinding. Incorrect usage could lead to unexpected movement results or even
    movement glitches.
