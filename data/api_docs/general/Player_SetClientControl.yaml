  class: Player
  method: SetClientControl
  signature: void Player::SetClientControl(int * target, bool allowMove)
documentation:
  brief: Sets client control state for a player to allow or disallow movement.
  description: The SetClientControl method is used to control whether a player can
    move or not in the game world. It takes a pointer to a target object and a boolean
    flag that determines if movement should be allowed. This method is typically used
    during player controlled events like quests, combat, or other gameplay scenarios
    where player movement needs to be restricted. The method affects the client-side
    movement control of the player, ensuring that the player cannot move when movement
    is disabled.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target object that will be controlled by this method.
      This could be a GameObject or Unit depending on context.
  - name: allowMove
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether movement should be allowed (true)
      or disallowed (false). When false, player movement is disabled.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetClientControl(&target, false);

      // Player movement is now disabled'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetClientControl(&target, true);

      // Player movement is enabled again

      // Used in scenarios like quest completion or combat

      // where player needs to be controlled by game mechanics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other player control methods
    and should be called carefully during gameplay events. It affects client-side
    movement control and may not be effective in all scenarios depending on how the
    game world handles player movement.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to players being unable to move or
    control their character properly. Care should be taken when using this method
    during combat or quest events, as it may affect game mechanics.
