  class: KitingUtils
  method: IsPositionGoodForKiting
  signature: bool KitingUtils::IsPositionGoodForKiting(const int & pos, Player * bot,
    const int & threats)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether a given position is suitable for kiting mechanics based
    on threat and bot state.
  description: The IsPositionGoodForKiting method determines if a specified position
    is appropriate for performing kiting behavior in World of Warcraft. Kiting involves
    maintaining distance from enemies while dealing damage, typically used by classes
    like hunters or mages. This method considers the current threat level and the
    bot's state to decide if moving to the given position would be beneficial for
    kiting. It evaluates factors such as proximity to threats, available space, and
    whether the bot can maintain optimal positioning for sustained combat.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position identifier or index to evaluate for kiting suitability.
      Represents a specific location in the game world that may be used for movement.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose positioning
      is being evaluated. This player's current state, abilities, and position affect
      the kiting decision.
  - name: threats
    description: The number or severity level of threats present at the evaluation
      point. Used to determine if the position is safe enough for kiting behavior.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is suitable for kiting, false otherwise.
    A return value of true indicates that moving to this position would allow the
    bot to maintain effective distance from threats while continuing combat.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a kiting decision
    code: "if (KitingUtils::IsPositionGoodForKiting(5, playerBot, 3)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with movement to position 5\n    playerBot->MoveToPosition(5);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using kiting evaluation in a combat AI loop
    code: "void CombatAI::Update() {\n    if (IsInCombat()) {\n        int bestPosition\
      \ = FindBestKitingPosition();\n        if (KitingUtils::IsPositionGoodForKiting(bestPosition,\
      \ _bot, GetThreatLevel())) {\n            MoveToPosition(bestPosition);\n  \
      \      }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in AI decision-making systems for bots that
    engage in kiting behavior. It assumes the bot has sufficient movement capabilities
    and that threat levels are accurately calculated. The method may be called frequently
    during combat, so performance is important for smooth gameplay.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'pos' parameter corresponds to a valid position in the
    game world; invalid positions may lead to unexpected behavior. Also, the 'threats'
    parameter should reflect current conditions, as outdated threat data can cause
    poor kiting decisions.
