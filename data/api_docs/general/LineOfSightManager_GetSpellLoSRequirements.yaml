  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: GetSpellLoSRequirements
  signature: LoSValidation LineOfSightManager::GetSpellLoSRequirements(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the line-of-sight validation requirements for a specified spell.
  description: The GetSpellLoSRequirements method retrieves the line-of-sight validation
    settings associated with a given spell ID. This information determines whether
    a spell requires line of sight to be cast successfully, and if so, what specific
    validation rules apply. The returned LoSValidation structure typically contains
    flags or enums indicating the type of line-of-sight check required, such as whether
    the target must be visible, whether the caster's line of sight is blocked by objects,
    or if certain environmental conditions affect the spell's ability to execute.
    This method is crucial for implementing proper spell casting mechanics in World
    of Warcraft-style games where spells may fail due to obstructed vision or other
    environmental factors.
  parameters: []
  returns: A LoSValidation object that defines the line-of-sight requirements for
    the specified spell. The structure typically includes flags indicating whether
    line-of-sight is required, what type of validation should be performed (e.g.,
    target visibility, caster visibility, or both), and potentially additional parameters
    such as minimum distance thresholds or special conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 spellId = 12345;\nLoSValidation validation = lineOfSightManager.GetSpellLoSRequirements(spellId);\n\
      if (validation.requiresLineOfSight)\n{\n    // Perform line-of-sight check before\
      \ casting\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during spell validation in the game's core
    logic to ensure that spells are only cast when appropriate conditions are met.
    The LoSValidation structure may contain flags or enums that are specific to TrinityCore's
    implementation and should be interpreted according to the internal spell system
    documentation.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell ID passed to this method is valid, as invalid IDs
    may result in undefined behavior or incorrect validation results. This method
    does not perform any automatic line-of-sight checks itself; it only returns the
    requirements for how such checks should be performed.
