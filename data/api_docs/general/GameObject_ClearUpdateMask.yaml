  brief: Clears the update mask for a game object, removing it from the update system.
  description: This method clears the update mask of a GameObject, effectively removing
    it from the update system and preventing further updates to client. The method
    is typically used during object removal or when the object needs to be temporarily
    hidden from players. It ensures that no further updates are sent to clients for
    this object, which is essential for proper game mechanics handling.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by TrinityCore during object destruction
    or removal. It's important to note that clearing the update mask does not immediately
    remove the object from memory; it only prevents updates from being sent to clients.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to objects remaining in update lists
    even after they've been removed, causing potential client-side issues or memory
    leaks.
