documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the movement override value for a creature specified by its spawn
    ID
  description: The GetCreatureMovementOverride method fetches a movement override
    configuration for a specific creature identified by its spawn ID. This override
    can modify how the creature moves within the game world, such as altering its
    pathfinding behavior or movement speed. The method returns a pointer to an integer
    value that represents the override setting, which may be null if no override is
    defined for the given spawn ID. This functionality is commonly used in custom
    scripts or database configurations to fine-tune NPC behavior without modifying
    core game logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an integer representing the movement override value
    for the specified creature spawn ID, or nullptr if no override is configured.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Check Movement Override
    code: "const int* override = sObjectMgr->GetCreatureMovementOverride(12345);\n\
      if (override != nullptr) {\n    printf(\"Movement override for spawn ID 12345\
      \ is: %d\\n\", *override);\n} else {\n    printf(\"No movement override found\
      \ for spawn ID 12345\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal data structures that may be cached or loaded
    from database entries. The returned pointer is valid only as long as the ObjectMgr
    instance remains active and the underlying data has not been modified. Consider
    thread safety implications if this method is called from multiple threads concurrently.
  warnings: The returned integer pointer should never be modified directly, as it
    points to internal configuration data. Dereferencing a null return value will
    cause undefined behavior. Ensure that the spawn ID provided corresponds to an
    existing creature in the world to avoid incorrect lookups.
