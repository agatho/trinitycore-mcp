  class: PlayerPersonalPhasesTracker
  method: DespawnPhase
  signature: void PlayerPersonalPhasesTracker::DespawnPhase(Map * map, PersonalPhaseSpawns
    & spawns)
documentation:
  brief: Removes all spawned objects associated with a personal phase from the specified
    map.
  description: The DespawnPhase method is responsible for cleaning up and removing
    all game objects, creatures, or other entities that were spawned as part of a
    specific personal phase on a given map. This method ensures that when a player's
    personal phase ends or needs to be reset, all related spawned content is properly
    removed from the game world to prevent lingering entities. It operates on a provided
    PersonalPhaseSpawns structure which contains references to the spawned objects
    and their associated map context. The method does not return any value but modifies
    the state of the map by removing the specified phase's spawns.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object where the phase spawns need to be removed.
      This represents the game world instance where the spawned objects currently
      exist.
  - name: spawns
    description: Reference to a PersonalPhaseSpawns object containing the list of
      spawned entities that should be removed from the map. This structure typically
      holds identifiers or pointers to the actual spawned objects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of DespawnPhase
    code: 'PlayerPersonalPhasesTracker* tracker = player->GetPersonalPhasesTracker();

      Map* map = player->GetMap();

      PersonalPhaseSpawns spawns;

      // Assume spawns is populated with relevant data

      tracker->DespawnPhase(map, spawns);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the phase is no longer active or needs
    to be explicitly removed. It is typically invoked during phase transitions, player
    logout, or when a phase is manually reset. The method assumes that the provided
    map and spawns data are valid and not null.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or null map pointer may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the spawns structure contains valid references
    to objects that were actually spawned on the given map.
