documentation:
  brief: Validates and checks the memory usage of the CombatAIIntegrator instance
    for potential leaks or excessive allocation.
  description: The ValidateMemoryUsage method performs a diagnostic check on the internal
    memory structures managed by the CombatAIIntegrator class. This function is typically
    invoked during debugging or performance monitoring to ensure that AI-related data
    structures are not consuming more memory than expected, which could lead to performance
    degradation or memory leaks in the game server. It may inspect allocated buffers,
    active AI state objects, and other runtime memory pools associated with combat
    behavior logic. The method does not modify any state but rather reports on current
    usage patterns to aid in optimization and debugging efforts.

    code: 'CombatAIIntegrator aiIntegrator;

      aiIntegrator.ValidateMemoryUsage(); // Checks memory usage for potential issues'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for use in debug builds or during performance
    profiling sessions. In release builds, it might be a no-op or disabled to avoid
    performance overhead.
