  class: ObstacleUtils
  method: AdjustForFormationConstraints
  signature: int ObstacleUtils::AdjustForFormationConstraints(const int & intended,
    const int & group, float minDistance)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts an intended value based on formation constraints and minimum distance
    requirements.
  description: The AdjustForFormationConstraints method modifies a given intended
    value to ensure it adheres to specified formation rules and maintains a minimum
    required distance from other group members. This utility is commonly used in AI
    pathfinding and positioning logic within TrinityCore's creature and player movement
    systems. The method evaluates the current group configuration and adjusts the
    intended position or direction to prevent collisions or violations of formation
    spacing. It returns an adjusted value that respects both the original intent and
    the imposed constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: intended
    description: The intended value to be adjusted, typically representing a desired
      position coordinate or direction component.
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier or reference used to determine formation constraints
      and neighboring member positions.
  - name: minDistance
    description: The minimum distance that must be maintained between the current
      entity and other group members.
  returns: An integer representing the adjusted value that satisfies formation constraints
    while maintaining the specified minimum distance. Returns 0 if no adjustment was
    needed, or a modified value if adjustments were applied.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Movement
    code: int adjustedPosition = ObstacleUtils::AdjustForFormationConstraints(100,
      5, 2.5f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Group Positioning Logic
    code: 'float desiredX = 150.0f;

      int adjustedX = ObstacleUtils::AdjustForFormationConstraints(static_cast<int>(desiredX),
      playerGroup, 3.0f);

      player->SetPosition(adjustedX, player->GetPositionY(), player->GetPositionZ());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in AI pathfinding and formation management
    systems where maintaining proper spacing between group members is crucial for
    gameplay mechanics. The implementation likely involves checking nearby group members'
    positions and calculating necessary adjustments to avoid overlap or violate minimum
    distance requirements.
  warnings: Ensure that the intended value represents a valid coordinate or direction
    component before calling this method, as invalid inputs may lead to unexpected
    behavior. The method assumes that the group parameter correctly identifies the
    relevant group context for constraint evaluation.
