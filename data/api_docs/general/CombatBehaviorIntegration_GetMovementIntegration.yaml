  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: GetMovementIntegration
  signature: MovementIntegration * CombatBehaviorIntegration::GetMovementIntegration()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the movement integration component associated with the combat behavior.
  description: The GetMovementIntegration method returns a pointer to the MovementIntegration
    object that is linked to this CombatBehaviorIntegration instance. This integration
    handles all movement-related behaviors and logic during combat scenarios, such
    as pathfinding, positioning, and mobility actions. The returned pointer is typically
    used by AI systems to query or modify movement parameters during active combat
    states. The method does not perform any initialization or creation of the MovementIntegration
    object; it simply provides access to an already existing instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the MovementIntegration object associated with this combat
    behavior. Returns nullptr if no movement integration has been initialized or assigned.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "CombatBehaviorIntegration* combatBehavior = unit->GetCombatBehavior();\n\
      MovementIntegration* movement = combatBehavior->GetMovementIntegration();\n\
      if (movement != nullptr)\n{\n    movement->SetTargetPosition(Position(100.0f,\
      \ 200.0f, 300.0f));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in AI decision-making loops where movement adjustments
    need to be made dynamically during combat. The returned MovementIntegration object
    should not be deleted or modified directly by external code unless explicitly
    designed for such usage. Ensure that the CombatBehaviorIntegration instance has
    been properly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or improperly constructed CombatBehaviorIntegration
    instance may return a null pointer, leading to potential crashes if not checked.
    Always validate the returned pointer before using it in critical code paths.
