  method: ResetTransport
  signature: void MovementInfo::ResetTransport()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the transport-related movement data in the MovementInfo structure.
  description: The ResetTransport method clears or resets all transport-specific movement
    information stored within a MovementInfo object. This includes clearing any cached
    transport positions, offsets, and related data that may have been set during player
    or creature movement on transports such as boats, zeppelins, or other moving platforms
    within World of Warcraft. The method ensures that subsequent movement calculations
    do not use stale or incorrect transport data, which is crucial for maintaining
    accurate positioning when a unit disembarks from a transport or when transport
    state changes. This operation typically occurs during movement updates, transport
    transitions, or when resetting a unit's movement state.

  examples:
  - title: Resetting Transport Data After Disembarking
    code: "void Player::HandleTransportExit()\n{\n    m_movementInfo.ResetTransport();\n\
      \    // Continue with normal movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using ResetTransport in Movement Update Loop
    code: "void Unit::UpdateMovementInfo()\n{\n    if (HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_ON_TRANSPORT))\n\
      \    {\n        // Update transport data\n        m_movementInfo.UpdateTransportData();\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Reset transport data when no longer on transport\n\
      \        m_movementInfo.ResetTransport();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core movement system when
    a unit's transport state changes. It's important to note that this reset operation
    does not affect general movement flags or position data, only transport-specific
    fields. The method should be invoked before setting new transport data to ensure
    clean state.
  warnings: Calling ResetTransport while a unit is actively moving on a transport
    may cause temporary positioning glitches if not properly synchronized with the
    movement update cycle. Ensure this method is called during appropriate state transitions
    rather than mid-movement updates.
