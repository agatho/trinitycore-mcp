  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the MechanicDatabase class
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the MechanicDatabase
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the database manager exists throughout
    the application lifecycle. This method provides global access to the mechanic-related
    database functionality, which is essential for managing game mechanics such as
    spell effects, aura states, and combat behaviors. The returned reference allows
    direct interaction with the database without requiring explicit instantiation.
    This pattern is commonly used in TrinityCore for resource-intensive systems that
    need centralized management and efficient access across multiple subsystems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the single instance of MechanicDatabase. The reference is
    guaranteed to be valid and initialized when accessed, as the singleton ensures
    proper construction on first use.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the MechanicDatabase singleton
    code: 'MechanicDatabase& db = MechanicDatabase::Instance();

      // Use db to access mechanic-related database operations

      uint32 mechanicId = db.GetMechanicIdByName("Stun");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the singleton in a game mechanic handler
    code: "class CombatHandler {\npublic:\n    void ApplyMechanicEffect(Unit* target,\
      \ uint32 mechanicType) {\n        MechanicDatabase& db = MechanicDatabase::Instance();\n\
      \        if (db.IsMechanicImmune(target, mechanicType)) {\n            // Skip\
      \ effect application\n            return;\n        }\n        // Proceed with\
      \ mechanic application\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the Meyers singleton pattern, which is thread-safe in
    C++11 and later. The instance is created on first access and destroyed at program
    termination. Developers should be aware that accessing this singleton from multiple
    threads simultaneously may require additional synchronization if the database
    operations themselves are not thread-safe.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, excessive reliance on global state can make
    code harder to test and maintain. Avoid creating tight coupling between components
    and the singleton instance. Also, ensure that any modifications to the database
    content are properly synchronized if accessed from multiple threads.
