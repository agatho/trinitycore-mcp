  method: GetDispeller
  signature: int * DispelInfo::GetDispeller() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the dispeller's unique identifier (GUID) stored within
    the DispelInfo object.
  description: The GetDispeller method retrieves a pointer to an integer value representing
    the unique identifier (GUID) of the entity that applied or is responsible for
    the dispel effect. This method is typically used in the context of spell dispel
    mechanics within TrinityCore's game engine, where information about which player,
    creature, or object caused a dispel is needed. The returned pointer may be null
    if no dispeller has been set or if the dispel information is invalid. It is important
    to note that this method returns a raw pointer and not a copy of the GUID, so
    direct access should be handled carefully to avoid dangling references or memory
    corruption.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer (int*) representing the GUID of the dispeller.
    Returns nullptr if no dispeller is set or if the DispelInfo object is in an invalid
    state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve dispeller GUID
    code: "DispelInfo dispelInfo;\n// ... populate dispelInfo with data ...\nint*\
      \ dispellerGuid = dispelInfo.GetDispeller();\nif (dispellerGuid != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    std::cout << \"Dispeller GUID: \" << *dispellerGuid << std::endl;\n}\n\
      else\n{\n    std::cout << \"No dispeller found.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a raw pointer, which means the caller must ensure that
    the DispelInfo object remains valid for as long as the returned pointer is being
    used. The GUID returned by this method corresponds to the entity that initiated
    or caused the dispel effect in the game world.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned pointer directly without checking
    for null values. Dereferencing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior
    and likely crash the application. Also, since this is a const method, it should
    not be used to modify the internal state of the DispelInfo object.
