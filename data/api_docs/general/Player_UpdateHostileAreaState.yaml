  method: UpdateHostileAreaState
  signature: void Player::UpdateHostileAreaState(const AreaTableEntry * area)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's hostile area state based on the provided area table
    entry.
  description: The UpdateHostileAreaState method is responsible for managing a player's
    hostility status within a specific area. It evaluates the player's current faction,
    PvP status, and area-specific rules to determine whether the player should be
    marked as hostile or non-hostile in that area. This method is typically invoked
    when a player enters or leaves an area, or when their factional status changes.
    The function updates internal player state flags and may trigger visual or gameplay
    effects related to hostile status, such as changing the player's name color or
    enabling PvP combat mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: area
    description: Pointer to the AreaTableEntry structure representing the area for
      which the hostile state should be updated. This parameter must not be null and
      should point to a valid area entry from the game's area database.
  returns: This method does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Updating Hostile State When Entering Area
    code: "AreaTableEntry const* area = sAreaStore.LookupEntry(1234);\nif (area)\n\
      {\n    UpdateHostileAreaState(area);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Hostile State Based on Player Movement
    code: "void Player::OnAreaChange()\n{\n    AreaTableEntry const* newArea = sAreaStore.LookupEntry(GetMap()->GetAreaId());\n\
      \    if (newArea)\n    {\n        UpdateHostileAreaState(newArea);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core engine when player
    movement or faction changes occur. Developers should not call this method directly
    unless implementing custom area-based hostility logic. The method may interact
    with other systems such as faction handling, PvP state management, and area trigger
    systems.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null area pointer will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the area parameter points to a valid entry from
    the AreaTableStore before calling this function.
