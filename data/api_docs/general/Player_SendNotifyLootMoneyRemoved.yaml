  description: This method sends a notification message to the player's client indicating
    that loot money has been removed from their loot window. It is typically used
    during loot processing when a player's loot is updated or cleared, such as when
    a player loots money from a container or when loot is removed from their loot
    window after a successful loot roll. The method ensures that the player receives
    proper visual feedback about changes in their loot state.

  notes: This method is typically called during loot processing and requires the player
    to be in a valid state for the notification to be sent. It may be used in conjunction
    with other loot-related methods such as SendNotifyLootRoll or SendNotifyLootItemRemoved.
  warnings: Care should be taken when calling this method, as improper use can lead
    to client-side confusion or incorrect display of loot information. Ensure that
    the lootObj parameter corresponds to a valid loot object before calling this method.
