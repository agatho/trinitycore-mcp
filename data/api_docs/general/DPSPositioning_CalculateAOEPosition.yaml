  method: CalculateAOEPosition
  signature: int DPSPositioning::CalculateAOEPosition(Player * dps, const int & targets)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates optimal area-of-effect positioning for a player based on target
    count
  description: The CalculateAOEPosition method determines the best positioning strategy
    for a player to maximize damage output when casting area-of-effect spells. It
    evaluates the number of targets within range and computes an appropriate positioning
    value that considers factors such as spell radius, target distribution, and player
    movement constraints. This method is typically used by AI systems or advanced
    DPS calculation modules to optimize combat performance in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore environment.
  parameters:
  - name: dps
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the damage dealer for whom
      positioning is being calculated
  - name: targets
    description: Reference to an integer indicating the number of targets within the
      spell's area of effect range
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated optimal positioning
    strategy. Values typically indicate different positioning modes such as center,
    edge, or spread positioning depending on target count and spell mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for single target AOE
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      int targetCount = 1;

      int position = dpsPositioning.CalculateAOEPosition(player, targetCount);

      // Returns positioning value for single target AOE'
    language: cpp
  - title: Optimizing multi-target AOE positioning
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nint targetCount = 5;\nint position = dpsPositioning.CalculateAOEPosition(player,\
      \ targetCount);\nif (position == 1) {\n    // Center positioning for optimal\
      \ AoE damage\n} else if (position == 2) {\n    // Spread positioning to cover\
      \ more targets\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the player has sufficient mana and that spell requirements
    are met. The positioning calculation may vary based on specific class abilities,
    gear, and spell specialization. Performance is optimized for frequent calls during
    combat simulations.
  warnings: Ensure the Player pointer is valid and not null before calling this method.
    Incorrect target count values may lead to suboptimal positioning decisions. This
    method should only be called during active combat scenarios where positioning
    matters.
