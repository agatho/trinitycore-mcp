  class: AIDecisionProfiler
  method: GenerateDecisionReport
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::GenerateDecisionReport(std::string & report,
    uint32_t botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Generates a detailed decision-making report for a specified bot GUID, populating
    the provided string reference with the report data.
  description: The GenerateDecisionReport method is used to produce a comprehensive
    analysis of AI decisions made by a specific bot within the TrinityCore framework.
    It takes a bot's unique identifier (GUID) and constructs a detailed report about
    its decision-making process, which may include action selection, evaluation criteria,
    and other internal AI state information. This functionality is typically used
    for debugging, performance analysis, or understanding how AI bots behave in various
    game scenarios. The method populates the provided string reference with the generated
    report content, allowing developers to inspect or log the AI behavior without
    direct access to internal data structures.
  parameters:
  - name: report
    description: A reference to a std::string that will be populated with the generated
      decision report. The string is cleared and overwritten with new content during
      execution.
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which the decision report
      is being generated. This value must correspond to a valid active bot within
      the system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'std::string report;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      profiler.GenerateDecisionReport(report, botGuid);

      // The ''report'' string now contains the decision log for bot with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Decision Report to Console
    code: 'std::string report;

      uint32_t botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      profiler.GenerateDecisionReport(report, botGuid);

      TC_LOG_INFO("ai", "Decision Report for Bot %u:\n%s", botGuid, report.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely intended for debugging and development purposes. It
    may have performance implications if called frequently or on bots with extensive
    decision histories. The report format and content are implementation-specific
    and may vary between different versions of TrinityCore.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid parameter corresponds to an active bot, otherwise
    the behavior is undefined. The method modifies the provided string reference directly,
    so ensure it's not being used elsewhere during execution.
