  class: Map
  method: AddCreatureToMoveList
  signature: void Map::AddCreatureToMoveList(Creature * c, float x, float y, float
    z, float ang)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a creature to the map's movement list for processing.
  description: The AddCreatureToMoveList method registers a creature with the map's
    movement system, allowing it to be processed during the next update cycle. This
    is typically used internally by the game engine when a creature's position or
    orientation changes and needs to be synchronized with the server's world state.
    The method takes the creature pointer along with its new coordinates and angle
    to update its position in the movement list.
  parameters:
  - name: c
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that should be added to the movement
      list. Must not be null.
  - name: x
    description: The new X coordinate of the creature's position in world space.
  - name: y
    description: The new Y coordinate of the creature's position in world space.
  - name: z
    description: The new Z coordinate of the creature's position in world space.
  - name: ang
    description: The new orientation angle (in radians) of the creature.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for moving a creature
    code: 'Creature* myCreature = ...;

      float newX = 100.0f, newY = 200.0f, newZ = 50.0f, newAngle = 1.57f;

      map->AddCreatureToMoveList(myCreature, newX, newY, newZ, newAngle);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is generally called internally by the game engine when a creature's
    movement needs to be updated. It does not immediately move the creature but schedules
    it for processing in the next update cycle. The method assumes that the provided
    coordinates and angle are valid and within the bounds of the map.
