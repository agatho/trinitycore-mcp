  class: LazyManagerFactory
  method: RecordInitTime
  signature: void LazyManagerFactory::RecordInitTime(const std::string & managerName,
    std::chrono::milliseconds duration)
documentation:
  brief: Records the initialization time for a lazy manager instance.
  description: The RecordInitTime method logs the duration it took to initialize a
    specific lazy manager identified by its name. This functionality is typically
    used for performance monitoring and debugging purposes within the TrinityCore
    framework. The method stores this timing data for later analysis or reporting,
    helping developers understand how long various subsystems take to initialize at
    runtime. It does not affect the actual initialization process but merely tracks
    and records the elapsed time.
  parameters:
  - name: managerName
    description: A string identifier representing the name of the lazy manager being
      initialized. This should be a unique, descriptive name that identifies the specific
      manager instance.
  - name: duration
    description: The time duration in milliseconds that was required to complete the
      initialization of the specified manager. This value is typically obtained using
      std::chrono::high_resolution_clock or similar timing mechanisms.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: LazyManagerFactory::Instance()->RecordInitTime("PlayerManager", std::chrono::milliseconds(150));
    language: cpp
  - title: Timing with High Resolution Clock
    code: 'auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      // ... initialization code ...

      auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      std::chrono::milliseconds duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(end
      - start);

      LazyManagerFactory::Instance()->RecordInitTime("WorldObjectManager", duration);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a performance profiling or logging system.
    It's important to ensure that manager names are consistent and unique across the
    application to avoid data corruption or misreporting. The recorded times may be
    used for generating reports, detecting slow initialization paths, or triggering
    alerts if certain thresholds are exceeded.
  warnings: Ensure that managerName strings are properly validated before calling
    this method to prevent potential issues with malformed identifiers. Also, be aware
    that recording too many timing entries could impact performance if not managed
    carefully in high-frequency scenarios.
