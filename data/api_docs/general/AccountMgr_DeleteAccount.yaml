  signature: AccountOpResult AccountMgr::DeleteAccount(uint32 accountId)
documentation:
  brief: Deletes an account from the database by its unique identifier.
  description: The DeleteAccount method removes a specified account from the TrinityCore
    database system. This operation is irreversible and affects all associated data
    including characters, guilds, and other account-specific information. The method
    performs validation to ensure the account exists before attempting deletion and
    returns an AccountOpResult indicating success or failure of the operation. In
    World of Warcraft context, this function is typically used by administrative tools
    or in response to user requests for account termination.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: The unique identifier of the account to be deleted. Must be a valid,
      existing account ID in the database.
  returns: Returns an AccountOpResult enum value indicating the outcome of the deletion
    operation. Possible values include SUCCESS, FAILED_NOT_FOUND, FAILED_ADMINISTRATOR_ACCOUNT,
    and other error conditions depending on validation checks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic account deletion
    code: "AccountOpResult result = AccountMgr::DeleteAccount(12345);\nif (result\
      \ == ACCOUNT_SUCCESS)\n{\n    printf(\"Account deleted successfully\\n\");\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"Failed to delete account: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe account deletion with error handling
    code: "uint32 accountId = 98765;\nAccountOpResult result = AccountMgr::DeleteAccount(accountId);\n\
      switch (result)\n{\n    case ACCOUNT_SUCCESS:\n        printf(\"Account %u deleted\
      \ successfully\\n\", accountId);\n        break;\n    case ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND:\n\
      \        printf(\"Account %u does not exist\\n\", accountId);\n        break;\n\
      \    case ACCOUNT_ADMINISTRATOR_ACCOUNT:\n        printf(\"Cannot delete administrator\
      \ account %u\\n\", accountId);\n        break;\n    default:\n        printf(\"\
      Unknown error deleting account %u\\n\", accountId);\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database operations and may have performance implications
    when executed frequently. It's recommended to use this function with proper authorization
    checks and transaction handling in multi-threaded environments. The deletion process
    typically cascades to remove all related character data, mail, auction house entries,
    and other account-specific records.
  warnings: This is a destructive operation that cannot be undone. Always verify the
    accountId exists and that the requesting user has appropriate administrative privileges
    before calling this method. Attempting to delete an administrator account will
    result in failure and may log security events.
