  class: CombatStateAnalyzer
  method: CalculateGroupSpread
  signature: float CombatStateAnalyzer::CalculateGroupSpread() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the average distance spread of group members within
    the current combat state.
  description: The CalculateGroupSpread method determines the average spatial distribution
    of players or units within a group during combat. It evaluates the distances between
    each member of the group and computes a normalized spread value that represents
    how dispersed the group members are relative to one another. This metric is commonly
    used in AI behavior decision-making, such as determining whether to maintain formation
    or reposition for optimal engagement. The method assumes that the CombatStateAnalyzer
    has access to valid group data and combat context information. It does not modify
    any internal state but relies on existing group member positions and combat state
    data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the average distance spread of group members,
    where 0.0 indicates all members are at the same location and higher values indicate
    greater dispersion. Typical values range from 0.0 to several hundred depending
    on group size and positioning.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float spread = analyzer.CalculateGroupSpread();\nif (spread > 50.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Group is too spread out, consider repositioning\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Strategy Decision
    code: "float spread = combatAnalyzer.CalculateGroupSpread();\nif (spread < 20.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Group is compact, suitable for close-range tactics\n    player->SetCombatStrategy(CombatStrategy::CloseRange);\n\
      }\nelse if (spread > 100.0f)\n{\n    // Group is widely spread, consider formation\
      \ adjustment\n    player->SetCombatStrategy(CombatStrategy::FormationAdjustment);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs calculations based on the current positions of group
    members and assumes that the CombatStateAnalyzer has been properly initialized
    with valid combat data. The calculation may involve Euclidean distances or other
    spatial metrics depending on implementation details. For performance-critical
    applications, caching results when group composition hasn't changed is recommended.
  warnings: The method may return unexpected values if group member positions are
    not properly synchronized or if the combat state is invalid. Always validate that
    the CombatStateAnalyzer has valid data before calling this method to avoid undefined
    behavior.
