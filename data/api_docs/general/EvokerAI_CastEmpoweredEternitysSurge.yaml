  class: EvokerAI
  method: CastEmpoweredEternitysSurge
  signature: void EvokerAI::CastEmpoweredEternitysSurge(int * target, EmpowermentLevel
    level)
documentation:
  brief: Casts the Empowered Eternity's Surge spell with the specified empowerment
    level on the target.
  description: The CastEmpoweredEternitysSurge method is used by EvokerAI to cast
    the Empowered Eternity's Surge ability, which is a key spell in the evoker's gameplay.
    This method takes a target and an empowerment level as parameters, determining
    both the target of the spell and how powerful the surge will be. The empowerment
    level affects the damage or effects of the spell, with higher levels typically
    resulting in more potent outcomes. This method is part of the evoker's core combat
    AI logic and is invoked during strategic moments in battle to maximize damage
    output or utility.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit for the spell.
      The value should correspond to a valid GameObject, Creature, or Player GUID.
  - name: level
    description: EmpowermentLevel enum value indicating the strength of the surge
      effect. Valid values are typically ETERNALITY_SURGE_LEVEL_1, ETERNALITY_SURGE_LEVEL_2,
      or ETERNALITY_SURGE_LEVEL_3, representing increasing power.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CastEmpoweredEternitysSurge
    code: 'int targetGuid = 12345;

      EvokerAI* evoker = ...;

      evoker->CastEmpoweredEternitysSurge(&targetGuid, ETERNALITY_SURGE_LEVEL_2);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with dynamic target selection
    code: 'Unit* target = SelectBestTarget();

      int* targetPtr = reinterpret_cast<int*>(&target->GetGUID());

      EvokerAI* evoker = ...;

      evoker->CastEmpoweredEternitysSurge(targetPtr, ETERNALITY_SURGE_LEVEL_3);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the AI's update loop or during
    specific combat conditions. It assumes that the evoker has sufficient mana and
    meets other prerequisites for casting the spell. The target must be within range
    and visible to the evoker.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid and points to a live unit, otherwise
    calling this method may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Avoid calling
    this method outside of combat or when the evoker is not in a state where casting
    spells is allowed.
