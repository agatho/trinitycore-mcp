  signature: int32 ReputationMgr::GetRenownLevelThreshold(const FactionEntry * renownFactionEntry)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the renown level threshold for a specified faction entry.
  description: The GetRenownLevelThreshold method calculates and returns the renown
    level threshold required for a specific faction. This value represents the amount
    of renown points needed to reach the next renown level for the given faction.
    The method takes a FactionEntry pointer as input, which defines the faction for
    which the threshold is being calculated. It is typically used in conjunction with
    reputation and renown systems to determine progression requirements within the
    game's faction structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int32 value representing the renown level threshold for the
    specified faction. This value indicates how many renown points are required to
    advance to the next level for that faction.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Renown Threshold for a Faction
    code: "const FactionEntry* faction = sFactionStore.LookupEntry(1234);\nint32 threshold\
      \ = reputationMgr->GetRenownLevelThreshold(faction);\nif (threshold > 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Use the threshold value to determine next renown level\n    printf(\"\
      Next renown level requires %d points\\n\", threshold);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves calculations based on faction-specific configurations
    and player reputation data. It may cache results or perform lookups in internal
    faction tables to determine the correct threshold value.
