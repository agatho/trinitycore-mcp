  brief: Uses defensive cooldowns for the Monk AI during combat.
  description: The UseDefensiveCooldowns method evaluates and applies appropriate
    defensive abilities for a Monk AI character in combat. This method typically checks
    the current health state, threat level, and available cooldowns to determine which
    defensive abilities should be used. It is part of the general AI behavior system
    for Monk classes within TrinityCore's framework, ensuring that the AI makes intelligent
    use of its defensive cooldowns based on situational awareness.

      \    }\n}"

  notes: This method is typically called within the Monk AI's update loop or combat
    behavior logic. It assumes that the AI has access to its own health status and
    cooldown information, which are managed by the core TrinityCore AI system.
