  class: ReadyCheckHandler
  method: HandleEvent
  signature: bool ReadyCheckHandler::HandleEvent(const GroupEvent & event)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a group ready check event and returns whether the event was handled
    successfully.
  description: The HandleEvent method in the ReadyCheckHandler class is responsible
    for processing group ready check events, typically triggered when a player initiates
    a ready check within a group. This method evaluates the incoming GroupEvent to
    determine if it corresponds to a valid ready check action and performs necessary
    actions such as broadcasting the ready check status to group members or updating
    internal state. The method ensures that only appropriate events are processed
    and returns true upon successful handling, otherwise false. It plays a crucial
    role in maintaining synchronization and communication within player groups during
    instance encounters or other group-based activities.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: A constant reference to a GroupEvent object containing the details
      of the group event being processed. This includes information about the event
      type, source player, and any associated data required for handling the ready
      check.
  returns: Returns true if the event was successfully handled as a ready check event;
    otherwise returns false. A return value of false may indicate that the event was
    not a ready check or that processing failed due to invalid parameters or state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "ReadyCheckHandler handler;\nGroupEvent event;\n// Assume event is properly\
      \ initialized with ready check data\nbool result = handler.HandleEvent(event);\n\
      if (result)\n{\n    // Ready check processed successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Ready check handled successfully.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Failed to handle ready\
      \ check\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to process ready check event.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within the group management system
    when a player sends a ready check request. It's important to ensure that the GroupEvent
    passed to this method contains valid data, as malformed events may cause unexpected
    behavior or failure in processing.
  warnings: Do not call this method with uninitialized or invalid GroupEvent objects,
    as it may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure proper synchronization when handling
    events from multiple threads to prevent race conditions.
