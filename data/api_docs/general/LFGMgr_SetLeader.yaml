  class: LFGMgr
  method: SetLeader
  signature: void LFGMgr::SetLeader(int gguid, int leader)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the leader of a specific LFG group identified by its GUID.
  description: The SetLeader method assigns a new leader to an existing Looking For
    Group (LFG) party. This function updates the internal data structure that tracks
    group leadership, ensuring that the designated player becomes the new leader of
    the specified group. The method is typically invoked when a group needs reorganization
    or when a player voluntarily or involuntarily transfers leadership. It's important
    to note that this operation affects only the in-memory representation of the LFG
    group and does not directly communicate with the client or database unless other
    systems are triggered by this change.
  parameters:
  - name: gguid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the LFG group for which the
      leader is being set. This value uniquely identifies the specific group within
      the game world.
  - name: leader
    description: The GUID of the player who will become the new leader of the LFG
      group. This must be a valid player GUID that exists in the current session or
      world state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: LFGMgr::instance()->SetLeader(12345, 67890);
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Leader Based on Player GUID
    code: 'uint32 groupGuid = player->GetGroup()->GetGUID();

      uint32 newLeaderGuid = targetPlayer->GetGUID();

      LFGMgr::instance()->SetLeader(groupGuid, newLeaderGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal LFG system and should be used carefully.
    It assumes that both group and player GUIDs are valid and exist in the current
    session context. Changes made using this function may not immediately reflect
    on clients unless accompanied by appropriate network messages or updates.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to inconsistent state within the
    LFG system, potentially causing issues with group operations such as queue management,
    loot distribution, or raid assignments. Ensure that the new leader is a valid
    member of the group before calling this function.
