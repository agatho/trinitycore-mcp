  brief: Processes the group queue for player bots in the TrinityCore instance
  description: The ProcessGroupQueue method handles the logic for managing and updating
    the group queue state for player bot groups within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method is responsible for checking the current status of queued player bots,
    determining their eligibility for group formation, and coordinating with the group
    management system to either create new groups or add players to existing ones.
    It ensures that player bots are efficiently organized into appropriate group configurations
    based on game mechanics such as instance difficulty, player levels, and quest
    requirements. The method typically runs during regular update cycles to maintain
    up-to-date group structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) override\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    playerbotGroupManager->ProcessGroupQueue();\n    // ... rest of update\
      \ logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the main AI update loop and should
    not be invoked directly outside of normal execution flow. The implementation may
    involve locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety when accessing shared group
    data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of its intended update context may lead to
    inconsistent group states or race conditions in multi-threaded environments. Ensure
    that all player bot operations are properly synchronized.
