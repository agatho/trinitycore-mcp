documentation:
  brief: Loads all page texts from the database into memory for use in game content.
  description: The LoadPageTexts method initializes and populates the internal cache
    of page text entries required for displaying quest items, books, and other textual
    content in World of Warcraft. This method is typically invoked during server startup
    or database reload operations to ensure that all page text data is available for
    retrieval when players interact with objects such as books, scrolls, or quest
    items. The method iterates through the database table containing page text records
    and stores them in an efficient lookup structure for fast access during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeWorld()\n{\n    ObjectMgr::instance()->LoadPageTexts();\n\
      \    // Page texts are now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    reloading database content. It is not thread-safe and must be executed in a single-threaded
    context. The method assumes that the database connection is already established
    and valid.
