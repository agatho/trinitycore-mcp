  class: ManaSoulShardResourceDestro
  method: GetMax
  signature: uint32 ManaSoulShardResourceDestro::GetMax() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the maximum value of mana soul shards that can be stored in the
    resource destructor.
  description: The GetMax method returns the upper limit of mana soul shards that
    the ManaSoulShardResourceDestro object can hold. This value defines the capacity
    boundary for the resource management system and is typically used to determine
    how many shards can be accumulated before reaching the maximum storage capacity.
    The returned value is constant and represents a fixed limit based on the implementation
    of the resource destructor class.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of mana soul shards that
    can be stored in this resource destructor instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ManaSoulShardResourceDestro resource;

      uint32 maxShards = resource.GetMax();

      printf("Maximum mana soul shards: %u\n", maxShards);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other resource management
    functions to track current shard count against maximum capacity. The value returned
    by GetMax should remain constant throughout the lifetime of the object unless
    explicitly modified through a setter or constructor.
