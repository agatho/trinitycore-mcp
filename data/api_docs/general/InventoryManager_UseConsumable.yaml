  signature: bool InventoryManager::UseConsumable(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to use a consumable item from the player's inventory, returning
    true if successful.
  description: The UseConsumable method in the InventoryManager class attempts to
    consume a specified item from the player's inventory. It checks whether the item
    exists in the inventory and is of a consumable type (such as potions, food, or
    scrolls). If valid, it processes the consumption effect, which may include applying
    buffs, healing, mana restoration, or other game effects. The method returns true
    if the consumable was successfully used, and false if the item does not exist,
    is not consumable, or cannot be used due to game restrictions such as cooldowns
    or player state (e.g., being in combat). This method is typically invoked when
    a player right-clicks on a consumable item or uses it through a spell or command.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the consumable item was successfully used, false otherwise.
    A return of false may indicate that the item does not exist in the inventory,
    is not a consumable type, or is currently unusable due to game rules or player
    state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (player->GetInventory()->UseConsumable(34567)) {\n    // Item was successfully\
      \ consumed\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(L\"Consumable used successfully.\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Failed to consume item\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(L\"Failed\
      \ to use consumable.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying item database and player state checks.
    It does not directly modify the item count in inventory; instead, it triggers
    a consumption process that may remove the item from the inventory upon successful
    use. The method should be called only when appropriate game context is present
    (e.g., player is not in combat or item is not on cooldown).
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid item IDs as it may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the item ID corresponds to a valid consumable
    type in the database before invoking this method.
