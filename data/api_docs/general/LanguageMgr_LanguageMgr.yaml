documentation:
  brief: Moves resources from a source LanguageMgr instance to this instance.
  description: The LanguageMgr move constructor transfers all resources from another
    LanguageMgr object to this one, leaving the source object in a valid but unspecified
    state. This is a standard C++ move semantics implementation used for efficient
    resource management. The method is typically invoked during object initialization
    or assignment operations where an rvalue LanguageMgr is being moved into a new
    LanguageMgr instance. It's important to note that after the move operation, the
    source LanguageMgr should not be used in any way that would access its former
    resources.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move constructor usage
    code: 'LanguageMgr mgr1;

      // ... initialize mgr1 ...

      LanguageMgr mgr2 = std::move(mgr1); // Move resources from mgr1 to mgr2'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, which follows standard C++ move semantics. After
    the move, the source object's state should be considered invalid for further use.
    This implementation likely handles internal data structures like string collections
    or lookup tables that are expensive to copy.
  warnings: Do not attempt to use the source LanguageMgr object after moving its resources.
    Using it afterward may result in undefined behavior or access violations. The
    move constructor is typically called implicitly during certain assignment operations,
    so be aware of when this happens in your code.
