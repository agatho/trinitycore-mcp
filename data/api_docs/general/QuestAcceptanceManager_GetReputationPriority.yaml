  class: QuestAcceptanceManager
  method: GetReputationPriority
  signature: float QuestAcceptanceManager::GetReputationPriority(const int * quest)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the reputation priority value for a given quest based
    on player's current reputation status.
  description: The GetReputationPriority method determines how much reputation gain
    is prioritized for a specific quest by evaluating the player's current standing
    with various factions. This value influences quest acceptance logic and can affect
    which quests are presented to players based on their faction relationships. The
    method takes into account the quest's associated reputation rewards and the player's
    existing reputation levels with relevant factions. It returns a float value that
    represents the relative importance or priority of gaining reputation through this
    particular quest.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the quest ID. The value should
      correspond to a valid quest entry in the database.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated reputation priority for the specified
    quest. Higher values indicate higher priority for reputation gain from this quest.
    Returns 0.0 if the quest has no associated reputation rewards or if the player's
    reputation status cannot be evaluated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float priority = questAcceptanceManager->GetReputationPriority(&questId);\n\
      if (priority > 0.0f) {\n    // Quest has reputation priority\n    printf(\"\
      Reputation priority: %.2f\\n\", priority);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Acceptance Logic
    code: "void CheckQuestAcceptability(QuestAcceptanceManager* manager, int questId)\
      \ {\n    float reputationPriority = manager->GetReputationPriority(&questId);\n\
      \    if (reputationPriority >= 1.0f) {\n        // High reputation priority\
      \ - consider accepting this quest\n        printf(\"High reputation priority\
      \ quest accepted\\n\");\n    } else if (reputationPriority > 0.0f) {\n     \
      \   // Medium priority - may accept under certain conditions\n        printf(\"\
      Medium reputation priority quest considered\\n\");\n    } else {\n        //\
      \ Low or no priority - likely not worth accepting\n        printf(\"Low reputation\
      \ priority quest skipped\\n\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the quest acceptance system to
    determine which quests should be prioritized for a player based on their faction
    relationships. The calculation may involve multiple factors including current
    reputation levels, faction thresholds, and quest-specific reputation rewards.
    Performance-wise, this method should be called sparingly as it may involve database
    lookups or complex calculations involving faction data.
  warnings: The method expects a valid quest ID pointer; passing NULL or an invalid
    quest ID may lead to undefined behavior. The returned float value is not guaranteed
    to be within any specific range and should be interpreted relative to other values
    from the same system rather than as an absolute measure.
