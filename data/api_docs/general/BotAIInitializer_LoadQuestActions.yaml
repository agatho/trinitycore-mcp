documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads quest-related AI actions for bot characters in the
    TrinityCore framework.
  description: The LoadQuestActions method is responsible for setting up and configuring
    all quest-related artificial intelligence behaviors for bot characters within
    the TrinityCore server environment. This method typically initializes the quest
    action handlers, registers available quest-specific AI commands, and prepares
    the bot's decision-making system to handle quest-related activities such as quest
    acceptance, objective completion, and quest progression. The method is usually
    invoked during the initialization phase of a bot's AI system, ensuring that bots
    can properly interact with the game's quest system. It may also load configuration
    data or cached quest information required for proper quest handling.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'BotAIInitializer initializer;

      initializer.LoadQuestActions();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the bot AI initialization process
    and should not be invoked manually unless specifically required for custom bot
    behavior modifications. The method may perform operations that involve database
    queries or configuration file reads, so it could have performance implications
    during server startup.
