  signature: void ArmsWarriorRefactored::InitializeDebuffTracking()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes debuff tracking for the Arms Warrior class, setting up internal
    state for managing enemy debuffs.
  description: The InitializeDebuffTracking method prepares the ArmsWarriorRefactored
    class to monitor and manage debuffs applied to enemies during combat. This method
    typically sets up internal data structures, registers necessary callbacks, or
    initializes tracking variables required for debuff-based gameplay mechanics such
    as tracking duration, application status, or stacking counts of specific debuffs.
    It is generally called during the initialization phase of a warrior's AI behavior
    or when entering combat. The method does not take any parameters and performs
    no direct return operations, focusing solely on preparing the class for debuff-related
    functionality.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'ArmsWarriorRefactored warrior;

      warrior.InitializeDebuffTracking();

      // Debuff tracking is now initialized for the warrior instance.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called once during the setup of an Arms Warrior AI
    instance to ensure proper debuff tracking functionality. It may internally initialize
    maps or lists used to store debuff information, and it's expected that this method
    is invoked before any combat-related debuff checks occur.
