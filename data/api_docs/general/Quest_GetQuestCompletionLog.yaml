documentation:
  brief: Returns the quest completion log string for the current quest
  description: The GetQuestCompletionLog method retrieves the completion log text
    associated with a specific quest. This string typically contains information about
    the quest's objectives, rewards, and completion status. It is used by the game
    engine to display quest-related information to players in various contexts such
    as quest log entries, quest dialogues, or when completing quests. The method returns
    a constant string that represents the quest's completion log, which may vary based
    on quest state and player progress.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a constant string representing the quest completion log text. This
    string contains the formatted quest information including objectives, rewards,
    and completion status. The return value is typically null or empty if the quest
    has no completion log or if the quest is not properly initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Completion Log Retrieval
    code: "Quest* quest = player->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\nif (quest)\n{\n    std::string\
      \ completionLog = quest->GetQuestCompletionLog();\n    // Use completionLog\
      \ for display or processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method is typically used internally by the
    TrinityCore framework to retrieve quest-related information. The returned string
    may be formatted based on quest state and player progress. Performance considerations:
    The method itself is lightweight but may involve string operations depending on
    how it''s used in conjunction with other quest methods.'
  warnings: 'Common mistakes: Using this method without checking if the quest exists
    or is valid can lead to undefined behavior. Dangerous edge cases: If the quest
    has not been properly initialized or loaded, this method may return empty or invalid
    strings which could cause issues in display logic.'
