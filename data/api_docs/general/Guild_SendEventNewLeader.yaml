  class: Guild

  signature: void Guild::SendEventNewLeader(Member * newLeader, Member * oldLeader,
    bool isSelfPromoted) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a guild event notification when a new leader is promoted, including
    details about the old and new leaders.
  description: The SendEventNewLeader method is responsible for broadcasting a guild
    event message to all guild members when a new leader is promoted. This method
    handles the communication of leadership changes within the guild context, ensuring
    that all players are notified of the transition. It takes into account whether
    the promotion was self-initiated and provides information about both the former
    and newly appointed leaders. The method is typically invoked during guild leadership
    transitions such as when a guild master resigns or is demoted, and a new leader
    is selected or promoted.
  parameters:
  - name: newLeader
    description: Pointer to the Member object representing the newly promoted guild
      leader. This parameter must not be null and should reference a valid guild member.
  - name: oldLeader
    description: Pointer to the Member object representing the former guild leader
      who is being replaced. This parameter must not be null and should reference
      a valid guild member.
  - name: isSelfPromoted
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the promotion was self-initiated
      by the new leader. True if the player promoted themselves, false otherwise.
  returns: This method does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SendEventNewLeader
    code: 'Guild* guild = ...;

      Member* newLeader = guild->GetMember("NewLeaderPlayer");

      Member* oldLeader = guild->GetMember("OldLeaderPlayer");

      guild->SendEventNewLeader(newLeader, oldLeader, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Self-promotion scenario
    code: 'Guild* guild = ...;

      Member* newLeader = guild->GetMember("SelfPromotingPlayer");

      Member* oldLeader = guild->GetMember("PreviousLeader");

      guild->SendEventNewLeader(newLeader, oldLeader, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely sends a packet to all guild members to update their UI
    with the new leader information. It may also trigger internal state updates within
    the Guild class to reflect the leadership change. The method assumes that both
    Member objects are valid and belong to the same guild.
  warnings: Ensure that both newLeader and oldLeader parameters are valid pointers
    to members of the same guild, otherwise behavior is undefined. This method should
    only be called during legitimate guild leadership transitions to maintain data
    integrity.
