api:
  class: GroupEvent
  method: ReadyCheckStarted
  signature: GroupEvent GroupEvent::ReadyCheckStarted(int groupGuid, int initiatorGuid,
    uint32 durationMs)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a GroupEvent object indicating that a ready check has
    started for a specific group.
  description: The ReadyCheckStarted method constructs and returns a GroupEvent instance
    that represents the initiation of a ready check within a World of Warcraft group.
    This event is typically triggered when a player initiates a ready check, which
    is used to determine if all group members are prepared to proceed with an action
    such as entering a dungeon or starting a quest. The returned GroupEvent contains
    information about the group GUID, the initiator's GUID, and the duration for which
    the ready check will remain active. This method is part of TrinityCore's group
    management system and is essential for coordinating group activities in the game
    environment.
  parameters:
  - name: groupGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group for which the ready check
      is initiated. This value identifies the specific group within the game world.
  - name: initiatorGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who initiated the ready
      check. This represents the player who triggered the event.
  - name: durationMs
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the ready check remains active.
      This determines how long group members have to respond to the ready check.
  returns: A GroupEvent object representing the ready check initiation event, containing
    all relevant information about the group, initiator, and duration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of ReadyCheckStarted
    code: 'GroupEvent event = GroupEvent::ReadyCheckStarted(12345, 67890, 30000);

      // Creates a ready check event for group 12345, initiated by player 67890, lasting
      30 seconds.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using ReadyCheckStarted in Group Management
    code: "#include \"GroupEvent.h\"\n\nvoid StartGroupReadyCheck(uint32 groupId,\
      \ uint32 initiatorId) {\n    GroupEvent event = GroupEvent::ReadyCheckStarted(groupId,\
      \ initiatorId, 15000);\n    // Process the event or broadcast it to group members\n\
      \    SendGroupEvent(event);\n}\n// Example usage: StartGroupReadyCheck(54321,\
      \ 98765);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other group management
    functions to coordinate player actions. The duration parameter affects how long
    players have to respond to the ready check. Implementation details may vary based
    on TrinityCore version and server configuration.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUIDs are valid and correspond to existing groups
    and players, otherwise the event may not be properly processed. Incorrect duration
    values could lead to unexpected behavior in group coordination.
