  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: GetCachedNPC
  signature: NPCInfo * NPCInteractionManager::GetCachedNPC(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves cached NPC information by its unique identifier.
  description: The GetCachedNPC method fetches a previously stored NPCInfo object
    from an internal cache using the provided GUID. This method is typically used
    during NPC interaction events to quickly access pre-loaded or recently accessed
    NPC data without requiring expensive database lookups. The returned pointer may
    be null if no cached entry exists for the specified GUID, indicating that the
    NPC data has not yet been loaded or cached. This caching mechanism improves performance
    in scenarios involving frequent NPC interactions or quest-related dialogue.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the NPC to retrieve from cache. Must
      be a valid, non-zero GUID corresponding to an existing NPC in the game world.
  returns: A pointer to the cached NPCInfo object if found; otherwise, returns nullptr
    if no cached data exists for the given GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "NPCInfo* npc = interactionManager->GetCachedNPC(12345);\nif (npc != nullptr)\
      \ {\n    // Use cached NPC data\n    std::cout << \"Found NPC: \" << npc->name\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle missing cache entry\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"NPC not in cache\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Interaction Context
    code: "void OnGossipHello(Player* player, Creature* creature) {\n    NPCInfo*\
      \ cachedNpc = interactionManager->GetCachedNPC(creature->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      \    if (cachedNpc != nullptr) {\n        // Process cached NPC data for gossip\
      \ options\n        AddGossipItemFor(player, GOSSIP_ICON_CHAT, \"Talk to me\"\
      , GOSSIP_SENDER_MAIN, 1);\n    } else {\n        // Fallback logic when cache\
      \ miss occurs\n        creature->Whisper(\"I'm not ready yet.\", LANG_UNIVERSAL,\
      \ player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that NPC data has already been loaded into the cache
    via other mechanisms such as AddCachedNPC or similar. The cache is typically managed
    by the NPCInteractionManager and may be automatically invalidated based on game
    events or time-based expiration policies.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-null return value guarantees valid NPC state;
    always validate the returned NPCInfo object before using it. Also, be aware that
    cached entries might become stale if the underlying NPC is modified or destroyed
    in the world.
