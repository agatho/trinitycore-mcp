documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the area trigger teleport associated with the specified map for
    go-back functionality.
  description: The GetGoBackTrigger method retrieves a const pointer to an AreaTriggerTeleport
    object that corresponds to the given map identifier. This is typically used in
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation to determine the teleportation
    trigger that allows players to return to a previous location, such as when leaving
    an instance or using a go-back mechanism. The method accesses internal data structures
    maintained by ObjectMgr to associate maps with their respective area trigger teleports.
    It is commonly called during player movement and instance management operations
    where teleportation back to previous locations is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an AreaTriggerTeleport object if a valid go-back trigger
    exists for the specified map, or nullptr if no such trigger is found. The returned
    object represents the area trigger that defines the teleportation behavior for
    returning to a prior location on the given map.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve go-back trigger for a specific map
    code: "const AreaTriggerTeleport* trigger = sObjectMgr->GetGoBackTrigger(1234);\n\
      if (trigger)\n{\n    // Use the trigger to determine teleportation behavior\n\
      \    printf(\"Found go-back trigger for map %u\\n\", trigger->MapID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal ObjectMgr data structures and should only be
    called from within the core game logic. The returned pointer is valid only as
    long as the AreaTriggerTeleport object remains in memory, which is managed by
    the server's data loading system.
  warnings: The method returns nullptr if no go-back trigger exists for the specified
    map, so callers must always check for null before dereferencing the returned pointer
    to avoid crashes. Additionally, this method may not be thread-safe if called from
    outside the main game thread.
