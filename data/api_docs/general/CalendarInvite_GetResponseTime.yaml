  class: CalendarInvite
  method: GetResponseTime
  signature: time_t CalendarInvite::GetResponseTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the timestamp when a calendar invite response was received.
  description: The GetResponseTime method retrieves the time_t value representing
    when a player responded to a calendar event invitation. This timestamp is typically
    set when the player accepts, declines, or ignores the invitation. The returned
    value represents the number of seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970,
    00:00:00 UTC). In the context of TrinityCore's calendar system, this method allows
    the server to track response timing for event coordination and player engagement
    metrics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A time_t value representing the Unix timestamp when the calendar invite
    was responded to. Returns 0 if no response has been received yet.
  examples:
  - title: Check Response Time of Calendar Invite
    code: "CalendarInvite* invite = player->GetCalendarInvite(inviteId);\nif (invite)\n\
      {\n    time_t responseTime = invite->GetResponseTime();\n    if (responseTime\
      \ > 0)\n    {\n        std::cout << \"Invite responded at: \" << responseTime\
      \ << std::endl;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        std::cout << \"No response\
      \ received yet.\" << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other calendar invite methods
    to track player participation. The returned timestamp can be converted to a human-readable
    format using standard C++ time functions like localtime or gmtime.
