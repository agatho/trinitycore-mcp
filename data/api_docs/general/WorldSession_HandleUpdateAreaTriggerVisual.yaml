  signature: void WorldSession::HandleUpdateAreaTriggerVisual(const WorldPackets::AreaTrigger::UpdateAreaTriggerVisual
    & updateAreaTriggerVisual)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the visual state of an area trigger for the player's session.
  description: The HandleUpdateAreaTriggerVisual method processes incoming client
    packets related to area trigger visuals, allowing the server to synchronize and
    update the visual representation of area triggers in the player's world. This
    method is part of the WorldSession's packet handling system and typically responds
    to client-side changes or events that affect how area triggers are displayed to
    the player. It ensures that the visual state of area triggers remains consistent
    between the client and server, which is important for gameplay mechanics such
    as quest objectives, combat zones, or environmental effects.
  parameters:
  - name: updateAreaTriggerVisual
    description: A packet containing data about the area trigger visual update, including
      trigger ID, visual state, and associated flags. This parameter represents the
      client's request to modify how an area trigger appears to the player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleUpdateAreaTriggerVisual(const WorldPackets::AreaTrigger::UpdateAreaTriggerVisual\
      \ & updateAreaTriggerVisual)\n{\n    // Process the visual update for the specified\
      \ area trigger\n    if (Player* player = GetPlayer())\n    {\n        // Apply\
      \ visual changes to the area trigger\n        player->UpdateAreaTriggerVisual(updateAreaTriggerVisual);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within the WorldSession's packet processing
    loop. The actual implementation may involve updating internal state, sending updates
    to other players in the area, or triggering related game events depending on the
    type of area trigger and its visual properties.
