  class: EvolutionaryOptimizer
  method: InitializePopulation
  signature: void EvolutionaryOptimizer::InitializePopulation(size_t chromosomeSize)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the population for the evolutionary optimization algorithm with
    a specified chromosome size.
  description: The InitializePopulation method sets up the initial population of chromosomes
    for an evolutionary optimization process. It allocates memory for the population
    and initializes each chromosome with random or default values based on the provided
    chromosome size. This method is typically called before starting an evolutionary
    algorithm to establish the starting genetic pool. The population size is determined
    internally, and each chromosome represents a potential solution to the optimization
    problem being solved. This initialization step is crucial for the evolutionary
    process to begin effectively.
  parameters:
  - name: chromosomeSize
    description: The length of each chromosome in the population. This determines
      how many genes or parameters each individual in the population will contain.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Population Initialization
    code: 'EvolutionaryOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.InitializePopulation(10); // Initialize population with chromosomes
      of size 10'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Population for Genetic Algorithm
    code: 'EvolutionaryOptimizer ga;

      ga.InitializePopulation(50); // Set up genetic algorithm with 50-gene chromosomes

      // Population is now ready for evolutionary operations like selection, crossover,
      and mutation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any evolutionary operations such as selection,
    crossover, or mutation. The population size is determined internally based on
    the algorithm's requirements. Each chromosome is initialized with random values
    to ensure diversity in the initial population.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the EvolutionaryOptimizer
    object may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the chromosomeSize parameter
    is appropriate for your specific optimization problem; too small values may limit
    solution space, while too large values may increase computational overhead.
