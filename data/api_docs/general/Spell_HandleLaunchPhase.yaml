  method: HandleLaunchPhase
  signature: void Spell::HandleLaunchPhase()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the launch phase for a spell, preparing it for execution and handling
    associated phase transitions.
  description: The HandleLaunchPhase method is responsible for initiating the launch
    sequence of a spell within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically prepares
    the spell's target, validates prerequisites, and sets up the necessary state changes
    required before the spell can be executed. It plays a crucial role in the spell
    lifecycle by ensuring that all pre-execution conditions are met and that the spell
    transitions properly from its preparation phase to its active execution phase.
    The method may also handle phase-specific logic such as updating player states,
    triggering visual effects, or managing cooldowns.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Launch
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(caster, spellInfo, TRIGGERED_NONE);

      spell->HandleLaunchPhase();

      // Spell is now prepared for execution'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the spell system during spell
    processing. Developers should not directly invoke this method unless implementing
    custom spell behavior. The method may perform phase transitions that affect player
    state and should be called in the appropriate context to avoid inconsistent game
    states.
  warnings: Calling HandleLaunchPhase directly without proper spell initialization
    or context may result in undefined behavior or client-server desynchronization.
    This method is part of the internal spell execution pipeline and should not be
    used for custom spell triggers outside of core spell handling logic.
