  class: RangedPositionStrategy
  method: GetKitingPosition
  signature: int RangedPositionStrategy::GetKitingPosition(Player * bot, Unit * target)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal kiting position for a ranged bot relative
    to its target.
  description: The GetKitingPosition method determines the best positional strategy
    for a ranged player bot to maintain distance from an enemy while maximizing damage
    output. This method evaluates factors such as attack range, movement speed, and
    target positioning to compute an ideal retreat path that allows the bot to stay
    within effective combat range without closing too closely. It is primarily used
    in AI decision-making processes for ranged combat scenarios where maintaining
    optimal distance is crucial for survival and damage efficiency.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the ranged bot that needs
      positioning calculations. Must not be null.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the enemy target. Must not
      be null and should be within combat range.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated kiting position index
    or strategy code. Positive values typically indicate specific positioning strategies,
    while negative values may denote error conditions or inability to determine optimal
    position.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI combat logic
    code: "int kitingPosition = bot->GetKitingPosition(target);\nif (kitingPosition\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Execute movement toward calculated kiting position\n    bot->MoveToKitingPosition(kitingPosition);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle error or fallback behavior\n    bot->Attack(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat state machine
    code: "class CombatStrategy {\npublic:\n    void UpdateCombat(Player* bot, Unit*\
      \ target) {\n        int position = bot->GetKitingPosition(target);\n      \
      \  if (position >= 0) {\n            // Apply kiting behavior\n            ExecuteKitingMovement(bot,\
      \ target, position);\n        } else {\n            // Fallback to standard\
      \ attack\n            bot->Attack(target);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal AI state and positioning calculations that
    may vary based on the bot's class, equipment, and current combat situation. The
    returned position index should be interpreted within the context of the specific
    kiting strategy implementation used by the RangedPositionStrategy class.
  warnings: Ensure both 'bot' and 'target' parameters are valid pointers before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior. The method assumes that the bot has sufficient
    movement capabilities and that the target is within a reasonable combat range
    for kiting calculations.
