documentation:
  brief: Increments the global script count managed by the ScriptMgr instance
  description: The IncreaseScriptCount method is used to increment an internal counter
    within the ScriptMgr class that tracks the total number of loaded or registered
    scripts in the TrinityCore server. This method is typically called during script
    initialization or registration processes to maintain an accurate count of active
    scripts. The script count may be used for debugging, performance monitoring, or
    ensuring proper cleanup of script resources when the server shuts down. This method
    does not take any parameters and performs no validation on the current script
    count value.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Script Registration
    code: "void RegisterCustomScripts()\n{\n    // Register a custom AI script\n \
      \   sScriptMgr->IncreaseScriptCount();\n    // Additional registration logic\
      \ here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of TrinityCore's internal script management system
    and may be called automatically during server startup when scripts are loaded.
    It's important to note that this method should only be called after the ScriptMgr
    instance has been properly initialized.
