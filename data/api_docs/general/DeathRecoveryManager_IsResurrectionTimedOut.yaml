  signature: bool DeathRecoveryManager::IsResurrectionTimedOut() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a resurrection timeout has occurred for the player.
  description: The IsResurrectionTimedOut method determines if the time limit for
    resurrection recovery has been exceeded. This functionality is typically used
    in conjunction with death recovery mechanics within the TrinityCore framework,
    where players may have a limited window of time to be resurrected after dying.
    The method evaluates internal state variables related to the player's death and
    resurrection timer to make this determination. It returns true if the timeout
    period has elapsed, indicating that the player can no longer be resurrected through
    standard means within the configured time frame.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the resurrection timeout has occurred, false otherwise.
    A return value of true indicates that the player's resurrection window has expired
    and they may no longer be revived via normal death recovery mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check resurrection timeout
    code: "if (player->GetDeathRecoveryManager()->IsResurrectionTimedOut()) {\n  \
      \  // Handle the case where resurrection is no longer possible\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Your resurrection window has expired.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal timer tracking and should only be called when
    the player's death state is active. The timeout duration is configurable within
    the TrinityCore server settings and typically relates to the 'death recovery'
    system parameters.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called outside of appropriate death-related
    contexts, as it may return incorrect results if the player is not in a valid death
    state. Also note that this check does not account for resurrection mechanics that
    might be triggered by other players or game events.
