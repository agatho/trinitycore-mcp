  class: DetectedSpellCast
  method: GetRemainingTime
  signature: uint32 DetectedSpellCast::GetRemainingTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the remaining time in milliseconds for a detected spell cast.
  description: The GetRemainingTime method retrieves the amount of time remaining
    until a detected spell cast completes. This value represents the duration left
    before the spell finishes its casting process, typically used for tracking spell
    progress or determining when a spell will become available again. The returned
    value is expressed in milliseconds and can be used to implement visual indicators,
    cooldown timers, or game logic that depends on spell timing. This method is commonly
    used within AI systems or event handlers that monitor ongoing spell casts.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the remaining time in milliseconds for the
    detected spell cast to complete. Returns 0 if the spell has already finished casting
    or if no spell is currently being detected.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Spell Cooldown
    code: "if (DetectedSpellCast* spellCast = player->GetDetectedSpellCast()) {\n\
      \    uint32 remainingTime = spellCast->GetRemainingTime();\n    if (remainingTime\
      \ > 0) {\n        // Spell is still casting, show cooldown timer\n        SendSpellCooldownUpdate(remainingTime);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Spell has finished casting\n        HandleSpellFinished();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on a valid DetectedSpellCast object. The
    returned value may be zero if the spell cast is complete or invalid. This function
    does not perform any thread synchronization, so it's recommended to use it in
    contexts where the object is guaranteed to be safe from concurrent modification.
  warnings: Calling this method on a null or invalid DetectedSpellCast pointer will
    result in undefined behavior. Always verify that the spell cast object exists
    and is valid before calling GetRemainingTime().
