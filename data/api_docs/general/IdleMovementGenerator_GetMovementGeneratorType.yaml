documentation:
  brief: Returns the movement generator type identifier for idle movement.
  description: The GetMovementGeneratorType method retrieves the unique type identifier
    associated with the IdleMovementGenerator. This identifier is used by the game's
    AI system to distinguish between different types of movement generators and ensure
    proper behavior during creature movement operations. The returned value typically
    corresponds to a predefined enumeration or constant that represents the idle movement
    state within the TrinityCore movement framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the movement generator type identifier for idle
    movement. This value is typically a constant defined in the movement generator
    enumeration, such as MOVEMENTGEN_IDLING (commonly 1), which uniquely identifies
    this specific movement generator type within the game's AI system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "IdleMovementGenerator* idleGen = new IdleMovementGenerator();\nint type\
      \ = idleGen->GetMovementGeneratorType();\n// type will be equal to MOVEMENTGEN_IDLING\
      \ (typically 1)\nif (type == MOVEMENTGEN_IDLING) {\n    // Handle idle movement\
      \ state\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the AI system or movement manager to identify
    which type of movement generator is currently active. The return value should
    be consistent across all instances of IdleMovementGenerator and is used for internal
    bookkeeping and state management within the TrinityCore framework.
