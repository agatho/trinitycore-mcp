  class: RoleDefinitions
  method: IsPureClass
  signature: bool RoleDefinitions::IsPureClass(uint8 classId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified class is a pure class, meaning it has no
    hybrid abilities or restrictions.
  description: The IsPureClass method checks if a given class ID corresponds to a
    pure class in the World of Warcraft game system. In TrinityCore, pure classes
    are those that follow a single, defined role without any hybrid mechanics or special
    restrictions. This method is typically used during character creation, class validation,
    or when determining class-specific abilities and restrictions. The method evaluates
    the internal class definitions stored within the RoleDefinitions system to return
    a boolean value indicating whether the class is considered pure.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified class ID represents a pure class; otherwise
    returns false. A pure class typically means it has no hybrid mechanics or restrictions
    that would prevent it from being used in certain contexts.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Warrior Class is Pure
    code: "uint8 warriorClassId = CLASS_WARRIOR;\nbool isPure = RoleDefinitions::IsPureClass(warriorClassId);\n\
      if (isPure)\n{\n    // Handle pure warrior logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal class definitions and may be affected by custom
    modifications or expansions to the game's class system. The implementation likely
    uses a lookup table or bitmask approach for performance optimization.
  warnings: Ensure that the classId parameter is valid before calling this method,
    as invalid IDs might lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results in the evaluation.
