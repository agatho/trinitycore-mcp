  class: AuraEffect
  method: Update
  signature: void AuraEffect::Update(uint32 diff, Unit * caster)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the aura effect based on time passed and caster information
  description: The Update method in AuraEffect class handles the periodic updates
    of aura effects, typically used for managing active buffs or debuffs that have
    a duration. It processes the passage of time and applies necessary changes to
    the affected unit based on the caster's influence. This method is crucial for
    maintaining game balance and ensuring proper application of mechanics such as
    damage over time, healing over time, or stat modifications.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed in milliseconds since last update call. This parameter
      determines how much time has passed between updates.
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the unit that initiated or is maintaining the aura effect.
      This can be a player, NPC, or other game object that provides context for the
      aura's behavior and effects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void AuraEffect::Update(uint32 diff, Unit * caster)\n{\n    // Implementation\
      \ details\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example with time-based effects
    code: "void AuraEffect::Update(uint32 diff, Unit * caster)\n{\n    if (diff >\
      \ 0)\n    {\n        // Apply periodic damage\n        // Update aura duration\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main update loop of the game world.
    It should be implemented carefully to avoid performance issues, especially when
    handling multiple effects simultaneously. The method may be invoked in different
    contexts depending on whether it's a periodic effect or a single application.
  warnings: Improper implementation can lead to incorrect aura behavior, such as applying
    damage when not intended or failing to update the aura properly. Care should be
    taken to ensure that all relevant conditions are checked before updating.
