  signature: void HunterAI::RecordTrapPlacement(int trapSpell)
documentation:
  brief: Records the placement of a trap spell for the hunter's AI behavior.
  description: The RecordTrapPlacement method is used by the HunterAI class to track
    when a trap spell has been placed by the hunter. This functionality is essential
    for managing trap-related AI logic, such as determining optimal trap placement
    timing, avoiding overlapping traps, and coordinating with other hunter abilities.
    The method likely updates internal state variables or flags within the AI system
    to reflect that a trap has been deployed, which may influence future decision-making
    processes for the hunter character. This tracking mechanism helps ensure proper
    gameplay mechanics and prevents issues like duplicate trap placement or incorrect
    AI behavior when multiple traps are involved.
  parameters:
  - name: trapSpell
    description: The spell ID of the trap being placed. This parameter identifies
      which specific trap spell was deployed, allowing the AI to distinguish between
      different types of traps (e.g., Immolation Trap, Frost Trap, Explosive Trap)
      and apply appropriate logic for each.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Recording a trap placement
    code: "void MyHunterAI::OnTrapPlaced(uint32 spellId)\n{\n    RecordTrapPlacement(spellId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using trap placement tracking in AI decision making
    code: "void HunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_trapPlaced && m_trapSpellId\
      \ == SPELL_IMMOLATION_TRAP)\n    {\n        // Do not place another immolation\
      \ trap\n        return;\n    }\n    RecordTrapPlacement(SPELL_IMMOLATION_TRAP);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system that tracks hunter trap usage
    and cooldowns. The implementation may involve internal data structures to store
    the last placed trap type, time of placement, or position information for strategic
    AI decisions.
  warnings: Ensure that the trapSpell parameter represents a valid trap spell ID to
    prevent undefined behavior in the AI logic. Improper handling of trap placement
    tracking could lead to AI behaviors such as placing traps in invalid locations
    or ignoring cooldowns.
