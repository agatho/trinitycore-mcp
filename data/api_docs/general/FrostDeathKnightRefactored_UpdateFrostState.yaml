documentation:
  brief: Updates the frost death knight's state including abilities, cooldowns, and
    combat behavior.
  description: The UpdateFrostState method is responsible for managing the internal
    state of a frost death knight class instance within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method typically handles updating various aspects such as ability readiness,
    cooldown timers, resource management (like Runic Power), and combat-related flags.
    It ensures that the AI or game logic correctly reflects the current condition
    of the frost death knight, including any changes in their active abilities or
    status effects. The method is generally called during each update cycle or when
    specific events occur that affect the death knight's state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void FrostDeathKnightAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic\
      \ ...\n    m_frostDK->UpdateFrostState();\n    // ... other logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Conditional State Updates
    code: "void FrostDeathKnightRefactored::HandleCombatEvent(CombatEventType event)\n\
      {\n    switch (event)\n    {\n        case DAMAGE_TAKEN:\n            UpdateFrostState();\n\
      \            break;\n        case ABILITY_USED:\n            UpdateFrostState();\n\
      \            break;\n        default:\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the AI update cycle to ensure
    proper state synchronization. It may internally trigger other state-related updates
    or callbacks that affect the death knight's behavior in combat.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the intended update context as it may
    cause inconsistent state management or unexpected behavior in the death knight's
    AI logic.
