documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the hunter has an active pet in the game world
  description: The HasActivePet method determines if the MarksmanshipHunterRefactored
    instance currently controls a valid, active pet. This check is essential for hunter
    AI behavior, particularly when deciding whether to issue commands or perform actions
    that require a pet presence. The method evaluates the hunter's pet state and returns
    true if a pet exists and is considered active within the game context, false otherwise.
    In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, this typically involves verifying
    that the pet is not dead, despawned, or otherwise inactive.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the hunter has an active pet in the game world; returns
    false if no pet exists or if the pet is inactive/dead
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine pet status
    code: "if (hunter.HasActivePet()) {\n    // Perform actions that require an active\
      \ pet\n    hunter.AttackTarget();\n} else {\n    // Handle case where no pet\
      \ is present\n    hunter.CallPet();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using HasActivePet in conditional logic for AI decision making
    code: "void MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::UpdateAI() {\n    if (HasActivePet())\
      \ {\n        // Pet is active, use pet abilities or commands\n        if (pet->GetHealthPct()\
      \ < 30) {\n            // Pet needs healing\n            CastSpellOnPet(SPELL_HEALING_TOUCH);\n\
      \        }\n    } else {\n        // No pet, possibly summon one\n        SummonPet();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in AI decision trees for hunters to determine
    appropriate combat behavior. It's important to note that the method checks for
    an active pet state rather than just existence, meaning a pet that has been dismissed
    or is dead would return false.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in combination with other pet-related
    functions as it may not account for temporary states like pet being in combat
    or under certain spell effects. Always validate the pet's actual state before
    performing actions that depend on its presence.
