documentation:
  brief: Sets the pet slot for a player's summoned pet.
  description: The SetPetSlot method configures the slot position where a player's
    summoned pet will be placed in their pet bar. This method is used to manage the
    positioning of summoned pets within the game's pet management system, allowing
    players to control which slot their pet occupies in their pet bar. The method
    operates on the player's pet number and destination slot parameters, enabling
    precise control over pet placement.
  parameters:
  - name: petNumber
    description: The unique identifier for the pet being set, typically representing
      the pet's index or number within the player's pet system.
  - name: dstPetSlot
    description: The destination slot where the pet should be placed. A value of -1
      indicates removal of the pet from the pet bar, while positive values indicate
      specific slot positions for placement.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pet Slot Setting Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetPetSlot(0, 1); // Set pet number 0 to slot 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove Pet from Pet Bar Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetPetSlot(2, -1); // Remove pet number 2 from pet bar'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other pet management functions
    and may require synchronization with the game's pet bar system. It should be called
    carefully to avoid conflicts with existing pet slot configurations.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can result in pets being placed incorrectly
    or removed from the pet bar entirely, potentially causing loss of pet functionality.
    Care should be taken when setting slots to ensure proper pet management.
