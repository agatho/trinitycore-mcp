documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the pool template data associated with a given pool identifier.
  description: The GetPoolTemplate method fetches the PoolTemplateData structure that
    corresponds to the specified pool ID. This method is used internally by the TrinityCore
    server to manage and retrieve configuration data for object pools, which are collections
    of game objects or creatures that are spawned according to defined rules and probabilities.
    The returned pointer provides access to pool-specific settings such as spawn chances,
    maximum limits, and other pool-related parameters. This function is typically
    called during world initialization or when processing pool-based spawning logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to a PoolTemplateData structure if the pool ID exists;
    otherwise, returns nullptr. The returned data contains configuration information
    for the specified pool including spawn rules and limits.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const PoolTemplateData* poolData = sPoolMgr->GetPoolTemplate(1234);\nif\
      \ (poolData != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use poolData to access pool configuration\n\
      \    printf(\"Pool %u has max spawns: %u\\n\", poolData->Id, poolData->MaxLimit);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup in an internal map structure that stores all
    known pool templates. It's designed to be fast and thread-safe for concurrent
    access during world updates. The returned pointer is valid only as long as the
    PoolMgr instance exists and the pool template hasn't been removed.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned PoolTemplateData structure directly, as it
    may cause inconsistencies in the pool management system. Always treat the returned
    data as read-only. Also, ensure that the pool_id parameter is validated before
    calling this method to avoid potential lookup failures.
