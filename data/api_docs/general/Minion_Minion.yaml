  method: Minion
  signature: void Minion::Minion(const SummonPropertiesEntry * properties, int * owner,
    bool isWorldObject)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a minion with specified summon properties, owner reference, and
    world object flag.
  description: The Minion constructor method initializes a minion entity within the
    TrinityCore framework. It takes summon properties that define how the minion behaves,
    a pointer to the owner's identifier (which may be null), and a boolean indicating
    whether the minion is a world object. This method sets up internal state for the
    minion including its summoning properties, ownership relationship, and object
    type classification. The initialization process ensures proper integration of
    the minion into the game world's object hierarchy and AI systems.
  parameters:
  - name: properties
    description: Pointer to SummonPropertiesEntry that defines the minion's summoning
      behavior, duration, and other summon-related properties. Must not be null for
      valid initialization.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the owner's identifier (GUID).
      Can be null if the minion has no owner or is a world object.
  - name: isWorldObject
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether this minion should be treated as
      a world object. If true, the minion will not be managed by standard object systems
      and may have different update behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Minion Initialization
    code: 'const SummonPropertiesEntry* props = sSummonPropertiesStore.LookupEntry(12345);

      int ownerGuid = 56789;

      Minion* minion = new Minion(props, &ownerGuid, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: World Object Minion Initialization
    code: 'const SummonPropertiesEntry* props = sSummonPropertiesStore.LookupEntry(12345);

      Minion* minion = new Minion(props, nullptr, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally during summon creation. The properties
    parameter must point to a valid SummonPropertiesEntry from the game's data store.
    If owner is null, the minion will not be associated with any specific unit. World
    object minions are not added to standard object managers and may require special
    handling for updates.
  warnings: Passing a null properties pointer will likely cause undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the owner GUID points to an existing unit in the world
    before calling this method. Incorrect use of isWorldObject flag can lead to unexpected
    behavior in AI updates or object management.
