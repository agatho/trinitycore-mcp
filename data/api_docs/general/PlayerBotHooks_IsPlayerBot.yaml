  signature: bool PlayerBotHooks::IsPlayerBot(const Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given player is a player bot.
  description: The IsPlayerBot method checks if the specified Player object represents
    a player bot rather than a real player. This utility function is commonly used
    in TrinityCore's AI and bot management systems to differentiate between human-controlled
    players and scripted bots. The method performs a check against internal bot flags
    or identifiers that are set when a player is created as a bot. It returns true
    if the player is confirmed to be a bot, and false otherwise. This functionality
    is essential for implementing bot-specific behaviors, preventing certain actions
    for bots, or filtering bot-related data in various game systems.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object to check. Must not be null, as passing
      a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior or a crash.
  returns: Returns true if the player is identified as a player bot; otherwise returns
    false if it's a real player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a player is a bot
    code: "if (PlayerBotHooks::IsPlayerBot(player)) {\n    // Handle bot-specific\
      \ logic\n    sLog->outString(\"This is a player bot.\");\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ real player logic\n    sLog->outString(\"This is a real player.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a command handler to filter bot players
    code: "void HandleBotCommand(ChatHandler* handler, const char* args) {\n    Player*\
      \ target = handler->getSelectedPlayer();\n    if (!target) {\n        handler->PSendSysMessage(\"\
      No player selected.\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    if (PlayerBotHooks::IsPlayerBot(target))\
      \ {\n        handler->PSendSysMessage(\"Selected player is a bot.\");\n    }\
      \ else {\n        handler->PSendSysMessage(\"Selected player is a real player.\"\
      );\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal flags or metadata set during the creation
    of player bots. It's important to note that this check should be performed only
    on valid Player pointers, as dereferencing a null pointer will cause a crash.
    The implementation may vary depending on how bots are registered in the specific
    TrinityCore build being used.
  warnings: Never pass a null pointer to this method; doing so can lead to segmentation
    faults or undefined behavior. Additionally, ensure that the Player object passed
    is valid and has been properly initialized before calling this function.
