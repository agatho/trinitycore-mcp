  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: GetActiveEvents
  signature: int AdvancedBehaviorManager::GetActiveEvents() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of currently active events managed by the AdvancedBehaviorManager
    instance.
  description: The GetActiveEvents method returns an integer representing the number
    of events currently active within the AdvancedBehaviorManager. This count typically
    reflects events that are in progress, scheduled, or otherwise managed by the behavior
    system. The method is read-only and does not modify any internal state. It is
    commonly used for monitoring event activity, debugging, or determining the current
    workload of the behavior manager. The return value can be zero if no events are
    active, or a positive integer indicating how many events are currently being tracked.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of active events managed by this AdvancedBehaviorManager
    instance. A return value of zero indicates no active events, while any positive
    integer indicates the count of active events.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Active Events
    code: "int activeEvents = behaviorManager.GetActiveEvents();\nif (activeEvents\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"There are \" << activeEvents << \" active events.\\\
      n\";\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Active Event Count for Debugging
    code: "void DebugBehaviorManager(AdvancedBehaviorManager& manager)\n{\n    int\
      \ count = manager.GetActiveEvents();\n    sLog->outString(\"Active Events: %d\"\
      , count);\n    // Additional logic based on event count\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented as a constant-time operation, making
    it efficient for frequent calls. It's important to note that the returned value
    may change between calls if events are added or removed from the manager's internal
    tracking system.
