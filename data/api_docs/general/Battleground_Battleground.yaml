documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new battleground instance by copying data from an existing
    battleground object.
  description: The Battleground constructor is responsible for initializing a new
    battleground instance by copying all relevant data members from another battleground
    object. This method ensures that the newly created battleground maintains the
    same state and configuration as the source battleground, which is essential for
    proper battleground management within the TrinityCore framework. The constructor
    handles deep copying of battleground-specific attributes such as player counts,
    team assignments, and game state variables. It plays a crucial role in battleground
    replication during matchmaking, replay scenarios, or when creating duplicate battleground
    instances for testing purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new battleground from an existing one
    code: 'Battleground existingBG(12345);

      Battleground newBG(existingBG);

      // newBG now contains a copy of all data from existingBG'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by the TrinityCore system when
    creating battleground instances. Developers should be aware that this is a copy
    constructor and will create a deep copy of all relevant battleground data members.
    The implementation may involve copying complex data structures including player
    lists, team information, and game state variables.
  warnings: When using this constructor, ensure that the source battleground object
    is in a valid state before copying. If the source object is in an inconsistent
    state or has been destroyed, the copy operation may lead to undefined behavior
    or corrupted data. This constructor should not be used directly by most developers
    unless implementing custom battleground logic.
