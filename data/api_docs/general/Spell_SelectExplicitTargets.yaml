  brief: Selects explicit target for spell effects
  description: The SelectExplicitTargets method determines and sets the explicit target
    for spell effects based on the spell's target requirements. This method is crucial
    for handling spell targeting logic in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework,
    ensuring proper targeting of spell effects during execution. It typically involves
    checking various conditions such as target type, range, and validity before setting
    the target. The method is part of the spell's core execution process and directly
    affects how spell effects are applied to targets.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Target Selection
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(player, spellInfo);

      spell->SelectExplicitTargets();

      // This sets the target for the spell based on its requirements'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell initialization and execution.
    It may involve checking target validity, range, and other conditions before setting
    targets. Performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary checks when targets
    are already set.
  warnings: Improper handling of target selection can lead to incorrect spell targeting,
    resulting in failed spell effects or unexpected behavior. This method should not
    be called without proper initialization of spell objects.
