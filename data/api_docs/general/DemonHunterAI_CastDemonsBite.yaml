  signature: void DemonHunterAI::CastDemonsBite(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Casts the Demon's Bite ability on the specified target.
  description: The CastDemonsBite method executes the Demon Hunter's signature ability,
    Demon's Bite, which deals damage to a targeted enemy. This method is typically
    invoked within the AI logic of a Demon Hunter creature or player character to
    perform this specific attack. The method requires a valid target reference and
    handles the execution of the spell mechanics including damage calculation, cooldown
    management, and potential effects such as stacking debuffs or energy generation.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or index
      within the game world. This parameter must point to a valid target entity that
      is within casting range and not immune to the spell.
  returns: null

    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        CastDemonsBite(&target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Demon Hunter has sufficient resources (such
    as Fury or Energy) to cast the spell. It is recommended to check for valid target
    and resource conditions before calling this method to prevent errors during execution.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer passed to this method points to a valid
    Unit object; otherwise, the spell may fail or cause undefined behavior. Avoid
    calling this method outside of combat or when the Demon Hunter is in an invalid
    state (e.g., stunned or silenced).
