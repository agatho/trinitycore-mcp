  signature: void ArenaAI::~ArenaAI()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an ArenaAI instance and performs cleanup operations for arena-related
    AI behavior.
  description: The ArenaAI destructor is called when an ArenaAI object is being destroyed,
    typically during the cleanup of a creature or unit that was using arena-specific
    AI logic. This method ensures proper deallocation of resources and cleanup of
    any internal state related to arena combat behaviors. It may handle releasing
    references to associated objects, resetting AI flags, or cleaning up temporary
    data structures used during arena matches. The destructor is automatically invoked
    by the C++ runtime when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of ArenaAI instance
    code: "void CleanupArenaUnit(Unit* unit)\n{\n    if (unit->GetAI() && unit->GetAI()->IsArenaAI())\n\
      \    {\n        delete unit->GetAI(); // Triggers ArenaAI destructor\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The ArenaAI destructor is part of the TrinityCore's AI system and should
    not be called directly unless implementing custom AI behavior. It is automatically
    invoked during object destruction, ensuring proper cleanup of arena-specific resources.
