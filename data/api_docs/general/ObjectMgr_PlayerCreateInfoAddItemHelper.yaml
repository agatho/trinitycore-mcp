documentation:
  brief: Adds an item to the player creation info for a specific race and class.
  description: The PlayerCreateInfoAddItemHelper method is used to associate a specific
    item with a given race and class during player creation. This function likely
    populates internal data structures that determine which items are available to
    players when they first create a character of a particular race and class combination.
    The method takes the race ID, class ID, item ID, and quantity as parameters to
    configure this initial equipment. It is typically called during server startup
    or configuration loading to set up default player starting items.
  parameters:
  - name: race_
    description: The race ID for which the item should be added to the player creation
      info
  - name: class_
    description: The class ID for which the item should be added to the player creation
      info
  - name: itemId
    description: The item template ID that will be given to players during character
      creation
  - name: count
    description: The quantity of the item to add (can be negative to remove items,
      or zero for no change)
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Add a starter weapon for Human Warriors
    code: ObjectMgr::Instance()->PlayerCreateInfoAddItemHelper(RACE_HUMAN, CLASS_WARRIOR,
      12345, 1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove an item from all character creation defaults
    code: ObjectMgr::Instance()->PlayerCreateInfoAddItemHelper(RACE_ORC, CLASS_MAGE,
      98765, -1);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization when loading
    player creation data. It modifies internal structures that are used to determine
    starting inventory for new players. The implementation likely involves updating
    maps or lists of items associated with race/class combinations.
  warnings: Be cautious when modifying item assignments, as incorrect configurations
    may lead to missing or duplicate starting items. This method should not be called
    during active gameplay as it may affect existing player data structures.
