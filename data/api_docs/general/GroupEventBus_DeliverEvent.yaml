  class: GroupEventBus
  method: DeliverEvent
  signature: bool GroupEventBus::DeliverEvent(BotAI * subscriber, const GroupEvent
    & event)
documentation:
  brief: Delivers a group event to a specified bot AI subscriber.
  description: The GroupEventBus::DeliverEvent method is responsible for routing and
    dispatching group-related events to subscribed bot AIs. It ensures that the specified
    subscriber receives notifications about group activities, such as member changes,
    loot distribution, or tactical decisions. This method plays a crucial role in
    maintaining synchronization between the game's group mechanics and AI behavior.
    The method returns true if the event was successfully delivered to the subscriber,
    or false if delivery failed for any reason, including invalid subscriber or event
    data.
  parameters:
  - name: subscriber
    description: A pointer to the BotAI object that will receive the group event.
      This parameter must be a valid, initialized BotAI instance; otherwise, the method
      may fail or cause undefined behavior.
  - name: event
    description: The GroupEvent object containing the event data to be delivered.
      This represents a specific group-related occurrence that the subscriber needs
      to process and respond to accordingly.
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the event was successfully delivered
    to the subscriber. Returns true if delivery succeeded, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Delivery
    code: "BotAI* bot = ...;\nGroupEvent event;\nevent.type = GroupEventType::LOOT_ADDED;\n\
      event.data = \"Gold\";\nbool success = groupEventBus.DeliverEvent(bot, event);\n\
      if (!success) {\n    // Handle delivery failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Event Delivery with Error Handling
    code: "BotAI* bot = GetBot();\nif (!bot) return;\nGroupEvent event;\nevent.type\
      \ = GroupEventType::MEMBER_JOINED;\nevent.data = \"NewPlayer\";\nbool delivered\
      \ = groupEventBus.DeliverEvent(bot, event);\nif (delivered) {\n    // Event\
      \ processed successfully\n} else {\n    // Log error or retry logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore AI system to
    propagate group events. It assumes that the subscriber has been properly registered
    with the GroupEventBus before attempting delivery. The method does not perform
    any validation on the event data itself, so it's the caller's responsibility to
    ensure valid event contents.
  warnings: Do not pass null pointers for either 'subscriber' or 'event'. Passing
    invalid parameters may lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Ensure that the
    BotAI instance is still valid and active before calling this method.
