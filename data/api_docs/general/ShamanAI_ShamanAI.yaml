  class: ShamanAI
  method: ShamanAI
  signature: void ShamanAI::ShamanAI(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the ShamanAI class with a bot reference for handling shaman-specific
    AI behaviors.
  description: The ShamanAI constructor initializes the AI system for a shaman class
    bot, setting up internal state and references needed to manage shaman-specific
    abilities and behaviors. This method prepares the AI to handle spell casting,
    aura management, and combat decisions unique to shamans within the TrinityCore
    framework. The initialization process includes configuring ability priorities,
    setting up target selection logic, and preparing for mana and cooldown management
    specific to shaman class mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot object that this AI will control. Must be a valid
      shaman class bot instance with proper initialization of base player attributes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic ShamanAI Initialization
    code: ShamanAI* shaman_ai = new ShamanAI(&bot);
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing with Null Check
    code: "if (bot != nullptr) {\n    ShamanAI* shaman_ai = new ShamanAI(&bot);\n\
      \    // Use the AI for bot control\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid bot reference\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The constructor assumes that the provided bot object has already been initialized
    with valid shaman class data. The AI system will not function properly if the
    bot is not correctly configured as a shaman before this initialization. Memory
    management should be handled carefully, as this constructor creates an AI instance
    that must be properly destroyed to prevent memory leaks.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer or an invalid bot reference to this constructor
    will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure the bot parameter
    points to a fully initialized shaman class object before calling this constructor.
