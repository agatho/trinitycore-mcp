  method: ApplyCooldownMultiplier
  signature: uint32 CooldownManager::ApplyCooldownMultiplier(uint32 cooldownMs) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies a cooldown multiplier to the specified cooldown duration in milliseconds.
  description: The ApplyCooldownMultiplier method adjusts a given cooldown duration
    by applying a multiplier factor, typically used in World of Warcraft mechanics
    to modify spell or ability cooldowns based on player attributes, buffs, or game
    rules. This method is commonly invoked when calculating final cooldown times after
    applying various modifiers such as haste effects, talent bonuses, or item enchantments.
    The result represents the adjusted cooldown time that should be used for gameplay
    logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the adjusted cooldown duration in milliseconds after applying the
    internal cooldown multiplier. The value is always a non-negative integer representing
    the effective cooldown time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 originalCooldown = 5000; // 5 seconds

      uint32 adjustedCooldown = cooldownManager.ApplyCooldownMultiplier(originalCooldown);

      // adjustedCooldown will be 5000 * multiplier (e.g., 4000 if 0.8 multiplier
      applied)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal state or configuration data from the
    CooldownManager instance to determine the appropriate multiplier value. It is
    assumed that the multiplier is stored as a member variable and may vary per player,
    class, or game context.
