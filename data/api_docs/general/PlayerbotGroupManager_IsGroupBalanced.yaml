  signature: bool PlayerbotGroupManager::IsGroupBalanced(const PlayerbotGroup & group)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether a player bot group is balanced in terms of class distribution
    and level ranges.
  description: The IsGroupBalanced method determines if a given player bot group meets
    predefined criteria for balance, typically based on the distribution of player
    classes and their levels. This ensures that groups are well-rounded and suitable
    for various game activities such as dungeons or raids. The method considers factors
    like class diversity and level variance to assess whether the group is appropriately
    balanced. It does not modify the group state but returns a boolean value indicating
    the balance status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player bot group is considered balanced according to
    internal criteria; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a group is balanced
    code: "PlayerbotGroupManager groupManager;\nPlayerbotGroup group = groupManager.GetGroupByLeader(playerGuid);\n\
      bool isBalanced = groupManager.IsGroupBalanced(group);\nif (isBalanced) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with group-based activities\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal logic to evaluate class distribution and
    level spread within the group. It may be used in conjunction with other balancing
    mechanisms in player bot AI systems.
