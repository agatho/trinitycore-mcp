  brief: Returns the arena points reward for the quest
  description: This method retrieves the arena points awarded to players upon completing
    the specified quest. The returned value represents the number of arena points
    that will be granted to the player's character upon quest completion. This is
    typically used in conjunction with other quest reward methods to determine the
    total rewards a player will receive. The method is part of the Quest class and
    operates on the quest object's data, returning a fixed integer value based on
    the quest's configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the arena points reward for the quest.
    This value is typically positive and represents the number of arena points that
    will be awarded to the player upon completing the quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int32 arenaPoints = quest->GetRewArenaPoints();\n// Use arenaPoints in\
      \ reward calculations\nif (arenaPoints > 0)\n{\n    // Apply arena points to\
      \ player's arena team\n    player->AddArenaPoints(arenaPoints);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in quest reward calculations and should be
    called after verifying that the quest has been completed. The value returned by
    this method is usually constant for a given quest and does not change based on
    player level or other factors. Performance considerations are minimal as this
    method simply retrieves stored data.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with other
    reward methods, as it may conflict with other reward types if the quest rewards
    are configured incorrectly. This method should only be used when the quest is
    actually completed and not during quest progression.
