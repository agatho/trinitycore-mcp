  method: UpdateCharacterGuildId
  signature: void CharacterCache::UpdateCharacterGuildId(const int & guid, int guildId)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the guild ID associated with a character in the cache.
  description: The UpdateCharacterGuildId method modifies the cached guild identifier
    for a specific character identified by their GUID. This function is typically
    used to synchronize in-memory character data with database changes when a player
    joins or leaves a guild. The method directly updates an internal cache structure
    without persisting changes to the database, making it suitable for temporary or
    session-based updates. It assumes that the provided GUID and guild ID are valid
    and exist within the game's data structures.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the character whose guild ID needs
      to be updated. This value should correspond to an existing player in the game
      world.
  - name: guildId
    description: The new guild identifier that will be associated with the specified
      character. A value of 0 indicates the character is not part of any guild.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update a Character's Guild ID
    code: 'CharacterCache::Instance()->UpdateCharacterGuildId(12345, 6789);

      // Updates character with GUID 12345 to be part of guild with ID 6789'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove Character from Guild
    code: 'CharacterCache::Instance()->UpdateCharacterGuildId(12345, 0);

      // Removes character with GUID 12345 from any guild'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on an in-memory cache and does not interact directly
    with the database. Changes made using this function are not persistent across
    server restarts unless explicitly saved to the database elsewhere. The implementation
    likely uses thread-safe mechanisms for concurrent access, but developers should
    verify that no race conditions occur during high-concurrency scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID and guild ID values are valid before calling
    this method to avoid corrupting cache data or causing undefined behavior. Passing
    invalid or non-existent IDs may lead to inconsistent state in the character cache.
