  signature: bool Item::IsBattlenetAccountBound() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the item is bound to a Battle.net account.
  description: This method checks if an item is bound to a Battle.net account, which
    means it cannot be transferred between characters or accounts. Items bound to
    Battle.net accounts are typically obtained through Battle.net services and are
    restricted to the specific account that purchased them. This method is commonly
    used in game mechanics to determine item ownership restrictions and prevent unauthorized
    transfers between players.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item is bound to a Battle.net account, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the item can be transferred between characters or accounts.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Battle.net Account Bound status
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByGUID(123456);\nif (item->IsBattlenetAccountBound())\
      \ {\n    // Item is bound to Battle.net account\n    // Cannot be transferred\
      \ between characters\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other item binding checks.
    Implementation relies on the item's binding type and may involve checking specific
    flags or properties. Performance considerations are minimal as this is a simple
    boolean check.
  warnings: Be aware that items bound to Battle.net accounts cannot be traded between
    players, which may affect gameplay mechanics in certain scenarios. This method
    should not be used for determining item transferability in all cases, as other
    binding types may exist.
