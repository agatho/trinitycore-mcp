  class: BotActionManager
  method: QueueAction
  signature: void BotActionManager::QueueAction(BotAction && action)
documentation:
  brief: Queues a bot action for execution by the bot action manager.
  description: The QueueAction method adds a BotAction object to the internal queue
    of actions that will be processed by the bot action manager. This method is typically
    used to schedule bot behaviors such as movement, casting spells, or interacting
    with objects. The queued actions are executed in the order they were added, subject
    to any priority or timing constraints imposed by the bot's AI system. The method
    accepts an rvalue reference to a BotAction, allowing for efficient move semantics
    and avoiding unnecessary copies of the action object.
  parameters:
  - name: action
    description: An rvalue reference to a BotAction object that represents the action
      to be queued for execution by the bot. This parameter is moved into the internal
      queue, so the original object should not be used after calling this method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Queuing a simple movement action
    code: 'BotAction moveAction;

      moveAction.SetType(BotActionType::MOVE_TO_POSITION);

      moveAction.SetTargetPosition({100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f});

      botActionManager.QueueAction(std::move(moveAction));'
    language: cpp
  - title: Queuing a spell casting action
    code: 'BotAction castAction;

      castAction.SetType(BotActionType::CAST_SPELL);

      castAction.SetSpellId(12345);

      castAction.SetTargetGuid(PlayerGuid);

      botActionManager.QueueAction(std::move(castAction));'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. The actual
    execution of queued actions occurs on the main game thread during the next update
    cycle. The BotAction object passed to this method should not be modified after
    being queued, as it may lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or uninitialized BotAction object to this method can
    result in undefined behavior. Ensure that the BotAction has been properly initialized
    before queuing it. Also, note that this method does not validate whether the action
    is valid for the current bot state; validation occurs during execution.
