  brief: Moves a World object to another World object, transferring all resources
    and leaving the source in a valid but unspecified state.
  description: The move assignment operator for the World class transfers ownership
    of all resources from the source World object to the target World object. This
    operation is typically used when moving temporary or rvalue World objects into
    existing World instances. The method performs efficient resource transfer without
    deep copying, making it a fast alternative to copy assignment. After the operation,
    the source object's state is left in a valid but unspecified condition, suitable
    for immediate destruction or reassignment. In the context of TrinityCore, this
    operator is essential for managing server state objects efficiently during initialization,
    configuration changes, and resource cleanup operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the target World object, allowing for chaining of move assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'World world1;

      World world2 = std::move(world1); // Move world1''s resources to world2

      // world1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Move Assignment
    code: 'World world1, world2, world3;

      world1 = std::move(world2) = std::move(world3); // Chained move operations

      // world2 and world3 are left in valid but unspecified states'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented using std::move semantics. It's important
    to note that after a move operation, the source object should not be used for
    any operations except destruction or assignment. The World class likely manages
    significant resources such as configuration data structures, server state, and
    internal game systems, making efficient move semantics crucial for performance.
  warnings: Never use the source object after a move operation unless it's immediately
    destroyed or reassigned. The moved-from object is left in a valid but unspecified
    state, which may cause undefined behavior if accessed directly. Also be aware
    that this operator is typically only available when the class supports move semantics
    (C++11 and later).
