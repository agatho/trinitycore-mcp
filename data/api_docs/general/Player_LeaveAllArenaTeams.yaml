  brief: Removes a player from all arena teams in the realm
  description: This method removes the specified player from all active arena teams
    within the realm. It effectively clears the player's arena team membership, preventing
    them from participating in any competitive arena activities. The method ensures
    that the player's arena team data is properly updated and that their character
    is no longer associated with any arena team roster. This action is typically used
    when a player leaves the game or when they need to be removed from all arena teams
    for administrative purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose arena team membership
      needs to be cleared. This parameter represents the player's character GUID in
      the database.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other arena-related methods
    to ensure proper cleanup of player data. It may be called during character deletion
    or when a player leaves the game. The implementation involves updating database
    records and removing player from all arena team rosters.
  warnings: This method should not be called on players who are still in active arena
    matches, as it could result in invalid arena team data or loss of player's match
    participation. It is recommended to ensure that the player is not currently participating
    in any arena activities before calling this method.
