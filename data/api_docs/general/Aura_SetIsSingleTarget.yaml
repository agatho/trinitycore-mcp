  class: Aura
  method: SetIsSingleTarget
  signature: void Aura::SetIsSingleTarget(bool val)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the aura is applied to a single target.
  description: The SetIsSingleTarget method configures the internal flag of an Aura
    object that determines if the aura is intended for a single target. This flag
    affects how the aura behaves in combat, particularly in relation to stacking,
    proc mechanics, and targeting logic. When set to true, the aura is treated as
    a single-target effect, which may influence its application, duration, and interaction
    with other auras or abilities. This method is typically used during aura creation
    or modification within spell effects or aura handling systems.
  parameters:
  - name: val
    description: Boolean value indicating whether the aura should be treated as a
      single-target effect. True enables single-target behavior, false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting an Aura to Single-Target Mode
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    aura->SetIsSingleTarget(true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Disabling Single-Target Mode for a Debuff
    code: "Aura* debuff = target->GetAura(67890);\nif (debuff)\n{\n    debuff->SetIsSingleTarget(false);\n\
      \    // This may affect how the debuff stacks or interacts with other effects\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies an internal state flag of the Aura object. The change
    takes effect immediately and influences subsequent aura processing logic. It is
    recommended to call this method before the aura is fully initialized or applied
    to ensure consistent behavior.
  warnings: Modifying the single-target flag after an aura has already been applied
    may lead to unexpected behavior in combat mechanics, especially if other systems
    depend on this flag for stacking rules or proc calculations.
