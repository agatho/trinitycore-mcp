  method: BuildQuestChainMapping
  signature: void QuestPickup::BuildQuestChainMapping()
documentation:
  brief: Builds a mapping of quest chains for efficient quest lookup and processing
    within the QuestPickup system.
  description: The BuildQuestChainMapping method constructs an internal data structure
    that maps quest identifiers to their respective chain relationships, enabling
    fast retrieval of related quests such as prerequisites, follow-ups, and quest
    branches. This method is typically invoked during server initialization or when
    quest data is updated to ensure that the quest chain hierarchy is accurately represented
    in memory. It facilitates efficient quest progression handling by allowing quick
    identification of which quests can be started, completed, or are available based
    on player progress. The mapping supports complex quest chains including branching
    paths and conditional dependencies.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'QuestPickup questPickup;

      questPickup.BuildQuestChainMapping();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after all relevant quest data has been
    loaded into the system. It is not thread-safe and should be executed in a single-threaded
    context during server startup or quest data refresh operations.
  warnings: Calling this method while quests are actively being processed by players
    may result in inconsistent quest state behavior. Avoid invoking it during active
    gameplay sessions to prevent potential race conditions or incorrect quest chain
    lookups.
