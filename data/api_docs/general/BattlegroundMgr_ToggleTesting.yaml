  method: ToggleTesting
  signature: void BattlegroundMgr::ToggleTesting()
documentation:
  brief: Toggles the testing mode for battlegrounds, enabling or disabling special
    debugging features.
  description: The ToggleTesting method switches the battleground system's testing
    mode on or off. When enabled, this mode typically allows developers and testers
    to bypass certain gameplay restrictions, enable debug commands, or simulate specific
    battleground conditions for development and quality assurance purposes. This functionality
    is usually restricted to administrative accounts or specific server configurations.
    The method does not take any parameters and has no return value. It modifies internal
    state flags within the BattlegroundMgr class that control how battlegrounds behave
    during testing scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Toggle Testing Mode
    code: BattlegroundMgr::instance()->ToggleTesting();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal flags that affect battleground behavior
    and may only be accessible to GMs or in development environments. The actual testing
    features enabled depend on server configuration and implementation details within
    TrinityCore.
  warnings: Using this method in a production environment without proper authorization
    can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. It should only be
    used during development or by authorized administrators.
