  signature: void ItemData::ClearChangesMask()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the item data, resetting its modified state flags.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with an ItemData object. This operation typically clears any flags that indicate
    which fields of the item have been modified since the last synchronization or
    save operation. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this
    is commonly used when preparing item data for network transmission or database
    persistence, ensuring that only relevant changes are tracked and sent. The method
    does not alter the actual item data itself, but rather resets the tracking mechanism
    that monitors modifications.

  examples:
  - title: Clearing Changes Mask After Item Modification
    code: "ItemData* itemData = player->GetItemByGuid(itemGuid);\nif (itemData)\n\
      {\n    itemData->SetField(ITEM_FIELD_STACK_COUNT, 5);\n    // ... other modifications\n\
      \    itemData->ClearChangesMask(); // Reset the mask after applying changes\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core system when item data
    is about to be sent to clients or written to the database. It's important to understand
    that clearing the mask does not undo modifications made to the item data, but
    only resets the tracking of which fields were changed.
