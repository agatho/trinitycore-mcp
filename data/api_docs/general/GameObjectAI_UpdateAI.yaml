documentation:
  brief: Updates the game object's AI behavior based on elapsed time and current state.
  description: The UpdateAI method is a core component of the GameObjectAI class that
    handles the periodic updating of game object behaviors in the TrinityCore engine.
    This method is called by the game loop at regular intervals to process AI logic,
    handle state transitions, and manage interactions with players or other game entities.
    It typically contains the main logic for how a game object should behave over
    time, such as triggering events, managing timers, or responding to external stimuli.
    The method may be overridden in custom GameObjectAI implementations to provide
    specific behaviors for different types of game objects like doors, chests, or
    interactive environment elements.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Elapsed time in milliseconds since the last update call. This parameter
      is used to calculate time-based behaviors and ensure consistent timing across
      different server performance conditions.
  returns: null

    code: "class MyGameObjectAI : public GameObjectAI\n{\npublic:\n    MyGameObjectAI(GameObject*\
      \ go) : GameObjectAI(go) {}\n    \n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) override\n\
      \    {\n        if (diff >= 1000)\n        {\n            // Perform actions\
      \ every second\n            DoSomething();\n        }\n    }\n};"

    code: "class ChestGameObjectAI : public GameObjectAI\n{\nprivate:\n    uint32\
      \ m_resetTimer;\n    bool m_isOpen;\n    \npublic:\n    ChestGameObjectAI(GameObject*\
      \ go) : GameObjectAI(go), m_resetTimer(0), m_isOpen(false) {}\n    \n    void\

      \ 30 seconds\n            {\n                ResetChest();\n               \
      \ m_resetTimer = 0;\n                m_isOpen = false;\n            }\n    \
      \    }\n    }\n};"

  notes: The UpdateAI method is called from the main game loop and should not block
    or perform heavy computations that could affect server performance. It's recommended
    to use small time intervals for frequent updates and consider using timers or
    event-based systems for complex logic. The parameter 'diff' represents the actual
    elapsed time since last update, which may vary depending on server load.
  warnings: Avoid performing database operations or sending packets directly from
    this method as it can cause performance issues or race conditions. Do not call
    methods that modify the GameObject's state in ways that might conflict with other
    systems. Be careful with long-running operations that could block the game loop.
