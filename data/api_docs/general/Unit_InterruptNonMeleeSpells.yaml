    bool withInstant)
documentation:
  brief: Interrupts non-melee spells on the unit, stopping spell casting and optionally
    delaying or instantiating the interruption.
  description: This method interrupts all non-melee spells currently being cast by
    the Unit, effectively stopping their casting process. It can optionally delay
    the interruption of specific spells or instantly interrupt them based on parameters
    provided. The method is commonly used in game mechanics to control spell casting
    behavior during combat situations or when a unit needs to be interrupted from
    casting spells. The function operates on the principle that non-melee spells are
    those not related to melee attacks, such as cast spells, channeled spells, or
    other spell effects that don't involve direct physical attack.
  parameters:
  - name: withDelayed
    description: If true, delays the interruption of the specified spell; if false,
      interrupts immediately. This parameter controls whether the spell interruption
      is delayed or instant.
  - name: spellid
    description: The specific spell ID to interrupt. If set to 0, all non-melee spells
      are interrupted. If a valid spell ID is provided, only that specific spell is
      interrupted.
  - name: withInstant
    description: If true, interrupts the spell instantly without delay; if false,
      allows for delayed interruption. This parameter controls whether the spell interruption
      is immediate or delayed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* target = new Unit();


      // Interrupt all non-melee spells immediately

      target->InterruptNonMeleeSpells(false, 0, true);


      // Interrupt specific spell with delay

      target->InterruptNonMeleeSpells(true, 12345, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: '// Assuming unit is a player or NPC

      Unit* unit = GetPlayer();


      // Interrupt all non-melee spells with delay

      unit->InterruptNonMeleeSpells(true, 0, false);


      // Interrupt specific spell with instant interruption

      unit->InterruptNonMeleeSpells(false, 12345, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in combat situations where a unit needs to
    be interrupted from casting spells. It may be called during certain events like
    being hit by an attack or during specific game mechanics like spell interruption.
    Performance considerations include potential overhead when interrupting multiple
    spells simultaneously, especially if the spell ID is not specified and all non-melee
    spells are interrupted.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it can cause unexpected behavior
    in spell casting if used incorrectly. The method may interfere with ongoing spell
    effects or channeling spells, potentially causing loss of spell effect or unintended
    consequences. Also, if the spell ID is not properly specified, all non-melee spells
    may be interrupted, which could lead to unintended consequences.
