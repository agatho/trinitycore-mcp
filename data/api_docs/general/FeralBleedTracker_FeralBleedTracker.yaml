documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the FeralBleedTracker class for managing feral
    bleed effects on targets.
  description: The FeralBleedTracker constructor initializes a new instance of the
    FeralBleedTracker class, which is responsible for tracking and managing the application
    and duration of feral bleed effects on targets in World of Warcraft. This class
    likely maintains internal state such as active bleed applications, their durations,
    damage values, and target references. The initialization process sets up necessary
    data structures and prepares the tracker to monitor and update feral bleed effects
    according to game mechanics and combat events. It is typically called when creating
    a new instance of the tracker for use in spell processing or combat simulation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new FeralBleedTracker instance
    code: 'FeralBleedTracker bleedTracker;

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track feral bleeds'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely initializes internal data structures such as maps
    or lists to store active bleed effects. It may also set up default values for
    tracking parameters like damage multipliers, duration modifiers, or target tracking
    mechanisms. The class may be part of a larger combat system and requires proper
    integration with spell casting and effect application systems.
