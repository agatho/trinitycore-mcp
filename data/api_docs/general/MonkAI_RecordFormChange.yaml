  method: RecordFormChange
  signature: void MonkAI::RecordFormChange(MartialForm fromForm, MartialForm toForm)
documentation:
  brief: Records a change in martial form for the Monk AI, updating internal state
    to reflect the transition from one form to another.
  description: The RecordFormChange method is used within the MonkAI class to track
    and log transitions between different martial forms. This method updates the AI's
    internal state to remember the previous and current form, which may be used for
    various game mechanics such as spell cooldowns, ability restrictions, or behavior
    modifications based on the active form. The method does not perform any direct
    gameplay actions but rather maintains an accurate record of form transitions for
    use by other systems within the AI logic. It is typically called when a monk character
    changes forms through abilities like Stance Change or Form Shift.
  parameters:
  - name: fromForm
    description: The martial form that the monk is transitioning from. This parameter
      represents the previous active form before the change occurs.
  - name: toForm
    description: The martial form that the monk is transitioning to. This parameter
      represents the new active form after the change occurs.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Form Transition Recording
    code: 'MonkAI* ai = ...;

      MartialForm oldForm = MARIAN_FORM;

      MartialForm newForm = WIND_FORM;

      ai->RecordFormChange(oldForm, newForm);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Form Change in Combat
    code: "if (player->HasAura(MONK_AURA_STANCE_CHANGE)) {\n    ai->RecordFormChange(player->GetCurrentMartialForm(),\
      \ MARIAN_FORM);\n    // Perform additional logic after form change\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Monk AI's internal state management and should
    be called whenever a martial form transition occurs. It does not directly affect
    gameplay mechanics but serves as a data tracking mechanism for other AI components
    that may depend on knowing the current and previous forms.
  warnings: Ensure that both 'fromForm' and 'toForm' parameters are valid MartialForm
    enum values to prevent undefined behavior or incorrect state tracking. Calling
    this method without proper form validation could lead to inconsistent AI behavior.
