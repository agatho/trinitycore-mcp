    dataElementId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a character data element value as either an integer or floating-point
    number.
  description: The GetDataElementCharacter method retrieves a specific character data
    element identified by its ID and returns the value in a std::variant container
    that can hold either an int64 or float type. This method is typically used to
    access various player statistics, attributes, or game state values that are stored
    in a structured format within the PlayerDataAccessor. The returned variant allows
    for flexible handling of different numeric types without requiring explicit type
    checking in client code. The method does not modify any internal state and is
    safe for repeated calls.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::variant containing either an int64 or float value representing the
    requested character data element. If the data element ID is invalid or not found,
    behavior is undefined but typically results in a default-constructed variant or
    exception depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "PlayerDataAccessor accessor;\nuint32 healthId = 1001;\nstd::variant<int64,\
      \ float> result = accessor.GetDataElementCharacter(healthId);\nif (std::holds_alternative<int64>(result))\
      \ {\n    int64 value = std::get<int64>(result);\n    // Handle integer value\n\
      } else if (std::holds_alternative<float>(result)) {\n    float value = std::get<float>(result);\n\
      \    // Handle floating-point value\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the data element ID corresponds to a valid entry
    in the player's data store. The internal storage mechanism may vary between different
    data types, and the returned variant should be checked before accessing its contents
    to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Using this method without checking the variant type can lead to runtime
    errors. Ensure proper type checking using std::holds_alternative or std::visit
    before extracting values from the returned variant.
