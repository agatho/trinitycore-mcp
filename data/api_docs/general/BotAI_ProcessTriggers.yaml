  signature: void BotAI::ProcessTriggers()
documentation:
  brief: Processes all active triggers for the bot AI, evaluating conditions and executing
    appropriate actions.
  description: The ProcessTriggers method is responsible for evaluating all currently
    active triggers within the BotAI system. It iterates through the trigger list,
    checks each trigger's condition requirements, and executes the associated action
    if the conditions are met. This method forms a core part of the bot's decision-making
    loop, enabling dynamic behavior based on in-game events and states. The method
    typically runs during each AI update cycle and ensures that bots respond appropriately
    to changing circumstances such as combat situations, health levels, or target
    availability.

  examples:
  - title: Basic trigger processing call
    code: "void MyBot::UpdateAI()\n{\n    // Other AI logic...\n    botAI->ProcessTriggers();\n\
      \    // Other AI logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the bot's main AI update loop.
    It's important to note that trigger evaluation order may affect behavior, and
    triggers should be ordered appropriately for desired execution flow. The method
    does not block or delay execution; it processes all triggers synchronously during
    its invocation.
