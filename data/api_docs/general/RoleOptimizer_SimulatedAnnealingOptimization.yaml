    int & players, const GroupComposition & targetComposition, const OptimizationConstraints
    & constraints)
documentation:
  brief: Performs simulated annealing optimization to determine the best group composition
    for a given set of players and constraints.
  description: The SimulatedAnnealingOptimization method implements a simulated annealing
    algorithm to find an optimal group composition that satisfies specified target
    roles and constraints. It evaluates various possible player arrangements, iteratively
    improving the solution by accepting or rejecting new configurations based on a
    probability function that decreases over time (temperature). This approach allows
    for escaping local optima and finding a globally optimal or near-optimal solution.
    The method is commonly used in World of Warcraft group planning systems to optimize
    raid or dungeon teams for specific encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: players
    description: The number of players available for group composition. Must be a
      positive integer representing the total count of players participating in the
      optimization.
  - name: targetComposition
    description: The desired role distribution for the group, specifying how many
      players should fill each role (e.g., tank, healer, damage dealer). This defines
      the objective that the optimization aims to achieve.
  - name: constraints
    description: Additional restrictions or requirements that must be satisfied during
      optimization. These may include player class limitations, gear level requirements,
      or other game-specific constraints that affect valid group compositions.
  returns: An OptimizationResult object containing the best group composition found
    by the simulated annealing algorithm, along with metadata such as the optimization
    score and any relevant statistics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'RoleOptimizer optimizer;

      int playerCount = 25;

      GroupComposition target = {1, 5, 19}; // 1 tank, 5 healers, 19 DPS

      OptimizationConstraints constraints = {"raid", "level_80"};

      OptimizationResult result = optimizer.SimulatedAnnealingOptimization(playerCount,
      target, constraints);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Custom Constraints
    code: "RoleOptimizer optimizer;\nint playerCount = 10;\nGroupComposition target\
      \ = {2, 2, 6}; // 2 tanks, 2 healers, 6 DPS\nOptimizationConstraints constraints\
      \ = {\n    \"dungeon\",\n    \"level_70\",\n    {\"class\", \"warrior\"},\n\
      \    {\"class\", \"paladin\"}\n};\nOptimizationResult result = optimizer.SimulatedAnnealingOptimization(playerCount,\
      \ target, constraints);\n// Process result to build the final group\nif (result.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"Optimal composition found with score: \" << result.GetScore()\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is computationally intensive and may take several milliseconds
    to complete depending on the number of players and complexity of constraints.
    The simulated annealing algorithm uses randomization, so multiple calls with identical
    inputs might produce slightly different results. For performance-critical applications,
    consider caching previous optimization results when input parameters are similar.
  warnings: The method assumes that all input parameters are valid and properly initialized.
    Passing invalid or inconsistent values for players, targetComposition, or constraints
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. Ensure that the targetComposition
    sums up to the number of players specified.
