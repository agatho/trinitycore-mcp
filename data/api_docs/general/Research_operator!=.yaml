documentation:
  brief: Compares two Research objects for inequality and returns true if they are
    not equal.
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this Research object
    and another Research object to determine if they are not equal. This comparison
    is typically based on the internal data members of the Research class, such as
    research ID, status, or associated data. The method is commonly used in conditional
    statements to check whether two research entries differ in their properties. In
    the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this operator would
    be used when managing research projects, quests, or other game mechanics that
    involve comparing research states or identifiers.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current Research object is not equal to the provided
    Research object; otherwise returns false. The comparison is based on all relevant
    data members of the Research class.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Inequality Check
    code: "Research research1;\nResearch research2;\n// Assume research1 and research2\
      \ have been initialized with different values\nif (research1 != research2) {\n\
      \    printf(\"The research objects are not equal\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Conditional Logic
    code: "Research playerResearch;\nResearch baseResearch = GetBaseResearch();\n\
      if (playerResearch != baseResearch) {\n    // Apply custom research logic\n\
      \    UpdatePlayerResearch(playerResearch);\n} else {\n    // Research is unchanged,\
      \ skip processing\n    printf(\"Research data unchanged\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely relies on an underlying equality comparison (operator==)
    to determine inequality. It's important to ensure that all relevant fields in
    the Research class are properly compared for accurate results. The implementation
    may involve comparing unique identifiers, timestamps, or other key properties.
