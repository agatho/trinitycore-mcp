  class: AreaTrigger
  method: Delay
  signature: void AreaTrigger::Delay(int32 delaytime)
documentation:
  brief: Delays the execution of the area trigger by the specified time interval.
  description: The Delay method schedules an area trigger to be executed after a specified
    delay period. This method is typically used in conjunction with area trigger scripts
    to introduce timing delays between trigger activations or to create sequential
    effects. The delay time is specified in milliseconds and affects when the area
    trigger's associated actions will be processed. This functionality is commonly
    utilized for creating timed events, delayed spell effects, or sequential visual/audio
    cues within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: delaytime
    description: The delay time in milliseconds to postpone the execution of the area
      trigger. A positive value delays execution, while a negative value may reset
      or cancel the delay depending on implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Delay Usage
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = player->GetAreaTrigger(12345);\nif (trigger)\n{\n\
      \    trigger->Delay(5000); // Delay execution by 5 seconds\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Delay for Sequential Effects
    code: "void OnAreaTriggerEnter(Player* player, AreaTrigger* trigger)\n{\n    //\
      \ First effect immediately\n    trigger->CastSpell(player, 12345);\n    \n \
      \   // Second effect after 2 seconds\n    trigger->Delay(2000);\n    trigger->CastSpell(player,\
      \ 12346);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The Delay method modifies the internal execution timer of the area trigger.
    It does not block the calling thread or prevent other triggers from executing.
    The delay mechanism relies on the TrinityCore's event system and may be affected
    by server tick rates. This method should only be called when the area trigger
    is in a valid state for modification.
  warnings: Calling Delay on an inactive or destroyed area trigger may result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the area trigger remains valid throughout the delay period.
    Repeated calls to Delay may overwrite previous delay settings without proper synchronization.
