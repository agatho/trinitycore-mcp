  method: HasVisibleMapId
  signature: bool PhaseShift::HasVisibleMapId(uint32 visibleMapId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specified visible map ID is included in the phase shift.
  description: The HasVisibleMapId method determines whether a given map ID is present
    in the current phase shift's visible map list. This functionality is essential
    for determining which maps a player or object should be able to see based on their
    current phase state. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, phases
    control visibility of various game elements including maps, objects, and areas.
    The method performs a lookup within the internal collection of visible map IDs
    associated with this PhaseShift instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified visibleMapId is found in the phase shift's
    visible map list; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Map Visibility
    code: "if (phaseShift.HasVisibleMapId(1234))\n{\n    // The player can see map\
      \ ID 1234 in their current phase\n    // Proceed with map-specific logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Conditional Logic for Object Visibility
    code: "uint32 currentMapId = player->GetMapId();\nif (!phaseShift.HasVisibleMapId(currentMapId))\n\
      {\n    // Object should be hidden or disabled\n    object->SetVisibility(VISIBILITY_OFF);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Object is visible in current phase\n    object->SetVisibility(VISIBILITY_ON);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses an optimized data structure (such as a set or hash
    map) for fast lookup of visible map IDs. The implementation may be thread-safe
    if used in a multi-threaded environment, but this depends on how the underlying
    phase shift data is managed.
  warnings: Ensure that the visibleMapId parameter represents a valid map ID within
    the game's context; invalid IDs might not produce expected results. This method
    should only be called on properly initialized PhaseShift objects to avoid undefined
    behavior.
