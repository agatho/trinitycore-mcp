  signature: int Channel::GetGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the channel
  description: The GetGUID method retrieves the globally unique identifier associated
    with a specific channel instance. In TrinityCore's architecture, each channel
    is assigned a unique integer GUID upon creation, which serves as its identifying
    marker within the game world. This GUID is used internally by the server to reference
    and manage channel-related operations such as member management, message broadcasting,
    and channel permissions. The method is read-only and does not modify any internal
    state of the channel object.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the channel. This
    value is typically a positive integer that uniquely identifies this channel instance
    within the server's memory space.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel("General", player);

      int channelId = channel->GetGUID();

      // channelId now contains the GUID of the ''General'' channel'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GUID for Channel Identification
    code: "void HandleChannelListPacket(Player* player) {\n    Channel* channel =\
      \ sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"Trade\", player);\n    if (channel) {\n        int\
      \ guid = channel->GetGUID();\n        // Use guid to identify or log the channel\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Channel GUID: %d\", guid);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The GUID returned by this method is assigned at channel creation time and
    remains constant throughout the channel's lifetime. It is important to note that
    channel GUIDs are not persistent across server restarts, as they are generated
    dynamically during runtime.
  warnings: Ensure that the Channel object being queried is valid before calling GetGUID(),
    as calling this method on a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Additionally,
    since GUIDs are unique only within a single server instance, comparing GUIDs from
    different servers may lead to incorrect assumptions about channel identity.
