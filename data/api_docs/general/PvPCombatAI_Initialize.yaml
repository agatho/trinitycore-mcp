documentation:
  brief: Initializes the PvP combat AI behavior for a creature or unit
  description: The Initialize method sets up the necessary internal state and configurations
    for a PvPCombatAI instance. This method is typically called during the creation
    or activation of an AI-controlled unit in PvP scenarios, establishing the foundation
    for PvP-specific combat behaviors such as target selection, spell casting, and
    movement patterns. It ensures that all required AI components are properly configured
    before the unit enters active combat. The initialization process may involve setting
    up behavior trees, registering event handlers, and preparing any necessary data
    structures for PvP-specific interactions.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "void SetupPvPCombatAI()\n{\n    PvPCombatAI* ai = new PvPCombatAI();\n\
      \    ai->Initialize();\n    // AI is now ready for PvP combat\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the AI object's lifecycle.
    Calling it multiple times may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks.
    The initialization process is typically handled automatically by the TrinityCore
    framework when a creature with PvP AI is spawned.
  warnings: Do not call Initialize() on an already initialized AI instance, as this
    could lead to memory corruption or unexpected behavior. Ensure that all required
    dependencies are available before calling this method.
