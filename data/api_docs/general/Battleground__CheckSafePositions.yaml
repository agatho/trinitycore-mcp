  class: Battleground
  method: _CheckSafePositions
  signature: void Battleground::_CheckSafePositions(int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Checks and validates safe positions for players within the battleground.
  description: The _CheckSafePositions method verifies that player positions are valid
    and safe within the context of a battleground. It ensures that players are not
    in invalid locations such as inside walls, out of bounds, or in areas where they
    could be stuck or exploited. This method is typically called during battleground
    updates to maintain game integrity and prevent exploits related to player positioning.
    The method takes a difficulty parameter to adjust its behavior based on the specific
    battleground mode.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The difficulty level of the battleground, used to determine validation
      rules and thresholds for safe position checks.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in battleground update loop
    code: "void Battleground::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic\
      \ ...\n    _CheckSafePositions(diff);\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is an internal utility function and should not be called directly
    by external code. It's part of the battleground's regular update cycle and performs
    position validation to maintain game balance and prevent exploits.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method's logic could lead to players being stuck
    or exploited in battlegrounds. The difficulty parameter must be correctly set
    to ensure proper validation rules are applied.
