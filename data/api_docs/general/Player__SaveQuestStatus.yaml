documentation:
  brief: Saves the player's quest status to the database
  description: This method saves the current quest status of the player to the database,
    ensuring that all active quest objectives and progress are properly recorded.
    It is typically called during player logout or when transitioning between zones
    to maintain quest progression data. The method handles the serialization of quest-related
    data including quest log entries, objective progress, and completion status. This
    operation is crucial for maintaining game state consistency across sessions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->_SaveQuestStatus(0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player is about to leave the game
    or when saving quest data. It performs database operations that may impact performance
    if called frequently. The parameter 'trans' is likely related to transaction handling,
    though the exact implementation details are not fully specified.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to loss of quest progress data. This
    method should not be called during active quest progression or when quest objectives
    are being updated, as it may overwrite current progress.
