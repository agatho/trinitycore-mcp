  class: GroupFormation
  method: AdjustForTerrain
  signature: void GroupFormation::AdjustForTerrain(const int & obstacles)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts group formation positioning based on terrain obstacles.
  description: The AdjustForTerrain method modifies the positioning of group members
    to account for environmental obstacles such as walls, cliffs, or other impassable
    terrain features. This ensures that group formations remain practical and functional
    within the game world's physical constraints. The method likely calculates alternative
    positions or adjusts formation patterns to avoid collisions with terrain elements.
    It is typically invoked during group movement or positioning updates when the
    system needs to maintain formation integrity while respecting the game world's
    layout.
  parameters:
  - name: obstacles
    description: Reference to an integer value representing the number or type of
      terrain obstacles detected in the group's path or formation area. This parameter
      likely influences how aggressively the formation adjusts its positioning to
      avoid obstacles.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group movement
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();

      int obstacleCount = GetTerrainObstacleCount(player->GetPosition());

      formation->AdjustForTerrain(obstacleCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with dynamic obstacle detection
    code: "void UpdateGroupFormation(Player* player)\n{\n    Group* group = player->GetGroup();\n\
      \    if (!group) return;\n    \n    GroupFormation* formation = group->GetFormation();\n\
      \    int obstacles = DetectNearbyObstacles(player);\n    \n    if (obstacles\
      \ > 0)\n    {\n        formation->AdjustForTerrain(obstacles);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger group management system that handles
    positioning, movement, and coordination between multiple players. The implementation
    may involve pathfinding algorithms or spatial calculations to determine optimal
    formation adjustments. It's important to note that this method modifies the internal
    state of the GroupFormation object and should be called during appropriate update
    cycles to avoid performance issues.
  warnings: Calling this method with incorrect obstacle values may result in unrealistic
    group positioning or formation corruption. The method assumes that the obstacle
    count parameter accurately reflects the terrain conditions in the group's vicinity.
    Improper usage could lead to players being positioned in invalid locations or
    groups failing to maintain proper formation during combat or movement.
