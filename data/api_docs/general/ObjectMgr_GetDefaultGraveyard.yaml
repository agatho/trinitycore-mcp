documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the default graveyard location for the specified team.
  description: The GetDefaultGraveyard method returns a pointer to the default graveyard
    location entry for the given team. This function is used by the game engine to
    determine where players from a specific faction should be teleported upon death
    if no other graveyard is explicitly set. The returned WorldSafeLocsEntry contains
    information about the safe location, including coordinates and map ID. This method
    is typically invoked during player death processing and character respawn logic
    within TrinityCore's core systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a WorldSafeLocsEntry structure representing the default graveyard
    for the specified team, or nullptr if no valid graveyard is found for that team.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Default Graveyard for Alliance
    code: "const WorldSafeLocsEntry* allianceGraveyard = sObjectMgr->GetDefaultGraveyard(TEAM_ALLIANCE);\n\
      if (allianceGraveyard)\n{\n    printf(\"Alliance graveyard: %s (%u, %u)\\n\"\
      ,\n           allianceGraveyard->AreaName, \n           allianceGraveyard->LocX,\
      \ \n           allianceGraveyard->LocY);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal data structures that are populated during
    server startup from database entries. The method is thread-safe as it only reads
    from immutable data structures after initialization. Performance is generally
    fast since it performs a simple lookup operation.
  warnings: The returned pointer may be null if no default graveyard exists for the
    specified team, so always check for null before using the result. This can happen
    during server initialization or in custom configurations where teams are not properly
    set up.
