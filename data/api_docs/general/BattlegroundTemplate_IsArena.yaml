documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the battleground template represents an arena type.
  description: The IsArena method checks if the current battleground template is configured
    as an arena. This is a fundamental property used to differentiate between various
    battleground types in World of Warcraft, such as arenas (e.g., Eye of the Storm,
    Alterac Valley) and regular battlegrounds. The method returns true if the battleground
    is specifically designed for arena-style combat, which typically involves 2v2,
    3v3, or 5v5 player vs player matches with specific rules and mechanics. It's commonly
    used in game logic to apply different behaviors, scoring systems, or UI elements
    based on whether the battleground is an arena.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the battleground template represents an arena type; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a battleground is an arena
    code: "BattlegroundTemplate* bgTemplate = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattlegroundTemplate(123);\n\
      if (bgTemplate && bgTemplate->IsArena()) {\n    // Handle arena-specific logic\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"This is an arena battleground.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal flags or properties set during the battleground
    template initialization. It's a simple getter that does not perform any heavy
    computations, making it safe for frequent calls in performance-sensitive code
    paths.
