  brief: Updates the buff states and application logic for the Windwalker Monk AI.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and applying buffs
    specific to the Windwalker Monk class within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    evaluates the current state of the monk's buffs, including any active auras or
    effects that influence combat performance, such as damage increases, movement
    speed enhancements, or defensive measures. It ensures that the appropriate buffs
    are applied or removed based on game mechanics and player conditions. The method
    typically runs during each AI update cycle to maintain accurate buff status for
    optimal gameplay behavior.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of an AI update cycle and should
    not be invoked manually unless necessary for specific game state changes. Buff
    management may involve complex interactions with spell systems, aura tracking,
    and combat state transitions.
