  method: GetPlayerCluster
  signature: uint32_t BehaviorCluster::GetPlayerCluster(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the cluster identifier associated with a player given their GUID.
  description: The GetPlayerCluster method retrieves the cluster identifier (uint32_t)
    that is associated with a specific player identified by their global unique identifier
    (int). This method is typically used in AI behavior systems to determine which
    cluster or group a particular player belongs to, enabling clustered behavior logic.
    The method does not perform any validation on the input GUID and assumes it refers
    to a valid player within the system. It is commonly used in conjunction with other
    clustering mechanisms to manage player grouping for AI decision-making.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (int) of the player whose cluster is
      to be retrieved.
  returns: Returns a uint32_t representing the cluster identifier associated with
    the specified player GUID. If no cluster is assigned or the GUID is invalid, the
    method may return zero or an undefined value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve player cluster
    code: uint32_t clusterId = behaviorCluster->GetPlayerCluster(playerGuid);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the retrieved cluster for AI decision making
    code: "uint32_t clusterId = behaviorCluster->GetPlayerCluster(playerGuid);\nif\
      \ (clusterId != 0) {\n    // Perform actions based on player's cluster\n   \
      \ DoBehaviorBasedOnCluster(clusterId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI clustering system and assumes that
    player-to-cluster mappings are already established. The returned cluster ID should
    be used carefully in contexts where cluster validity is important, as invalid
    or unassigned GUIDs may result in undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure the provided GUID corresponds to an existing player; otherwise,
    the method may return an incorrect or zero cluster ID. This method does not validate
    the existence of the player or the integrity of the cluster mapping.
