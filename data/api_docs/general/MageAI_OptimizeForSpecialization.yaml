  class: MageAI
  method: OptimizeForSpecialization
  signature: void MageAI::OptimizeForSpecialization()
documentation:
  brief: Configures the Mage AI behavior based on the current specialization and spell
    availability.
  description: The OptimizeForSpecialization method adjusts the Mage AI's decision-making
    process to align with the player's current specialization (Arcane, Fire, or Frost).
    It evaluates available spells, cooldowns, and mana efficiency to determine optimal
    spell casting priorities. This method is typically invoked when a mage's specialization
    changes or during combat initialization to ensure that the AI selects the most
    effective spells for the current playstyle. The optimization considers factors
    such as damage output, utility spells, and resource management tailored to each
    specialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void OnCombatStart(Unit* target)\n{\n    m_mageAI->OptimizeForSpecialization();\n\
      \    // AI now uses optimized spell selection for current specialization\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Specialization Change Handling
    code: "void OnSpecializationChanged()\n{\n    if (m_mageAI)\n    {\n        m_mageAI->OptimizeForSpecialization();\n\
      \        // Reconfigure AI behavior for new specialization\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after any change in the mage's specialization
    or when entering combat to ensure that the AI adapts its spell selection strategy.
    The optimization process may involve recalculating spell priorities and updating
    internal state variables related to cooldown tracking and mana efficiency.
  warnings: Calling this method during active combat without proper context could
    lead to inconsistent behavior if not properly synchronized with the game's current
    state. Ensure that all relevant spell data is initialized before invoking this
    function.
