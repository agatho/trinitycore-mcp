documentation:
  brief: Returns whether a player has completed a specific quest.
  description: This method checks if a player has completed a particular quest by
    its ID. It returns true if the quest is marked as completed in the player's quest
    log, false otherwise. The method is commonly used in quest-related code to determine
    if a player has already completed a quest or not. This functionality is essential
    for implementing quest completion logic and determining whether a player should
    receive rewards or continue with quest progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest has been completed by the player, false otherwise.
    The return value represents the status of the quest reward, indicating whether
    the player has earned the reward for completing the specified quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Completion Check
    code: "if (player->GetQuestRewardStatus(12345)) {\n    // Player has completed\
      \ quest 12345\n    // Proceed with reward logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to determine quest completion status. It accesses the player's quest log data
    internally and may involve database queries depending on implementation. Performance
    considerations are minimal as this method only checks a single quest ID.
  warnings: Be aware that this method does not validate if the quest ID exists or
    is valid. Using invalid quest IDs may lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Also,
    the method only returns true for completed quests, not necessarily for those that
    have been turned in or are fully rewarded.
