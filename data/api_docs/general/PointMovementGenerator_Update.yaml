  class: PointMovementGenerator
  method: Update
  signature: bool PointMovementGenerator::Update(int * owner, int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the movement generator to progress towards a specified point.
  description: The PointMovementGenerator::Update method is responsible for advancing
    the movement of a creature or unit towards a designated point in the world. It
    handles the logic for moving the entity along a path, checking if the destination
    has been reached, and managing the state transitions during movement. This method
    is typically called every game tick to ensure smooth and continuous movement behavior.
    The method updates internal state variables and returns true when movement is
    still in progress or false when the target point has been successfully reached.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the unit or creature that owns this movement generator.
      Used to access the entity's current position, movement state, and other properties
      during update processing.
  - name: diff
    description: Time delta in milliseconds since last update call. This parameter
      determines how much time has passed and is used to calculate movement speed
      and progress towards the target point.
  returns: Returns true if the movement is still in progress or false when the target
    point has been reached. When returning false, it typically indicates that the
    movement generator should be removed from the unit's movement list.

    code: "void UpdateMovement(Unit* owner, uint32 diff) {\n    PointMovementGenerator*\
      \ movementGen = new PointMovementGenerator(10.0f, 20.0f, 30.0f);\n    bool isMoving\
      \ = movementGen->Update(&owner, diff);\n    if (!isMoving) {\n        // Movement\
      \ completed, handle next action\n        owner->SetFacingTo(45.0f);\n    }\n\
      }"

  - title: Movement Generator Integration in AI
    code: "class CustomAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    bool UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (pointMovementGen) {\n            if (!pointMovementGen->Update(&me,\
      \ diff)) {\n                // Movement complete\n                pointMovementGen\
      \ = nullptr;\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n     \
      \   return false;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's movement system and integrates with
    the unit's movement queue. It assumes that the target point has already been set
    via other methods like SetDestination(). The update process considers factors
    such as unit speed, terrain, and obstacles when calculating movement progress.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly on a PointMovementGenerator without ensuring
    it is properly initialized with a valid destination point. Calling Update() after
    reaching the target point may cause undefined behavior or infinite loops if not
    handled correctly by the calling code.
