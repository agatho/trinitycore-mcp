  class: QuestAcceptanceManager
  method: ShouldAcceptQuest
  signature: bool QuestAcceptanceManager::ShouldAcceptQuest(const int * quest) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player should accept a quest based on current game state
    and quest requirements.
  description: The ShouldAcceptQuest method evaluates if a player is eligible to accept
    a specific quest. It checks various conditions such as quest prerequisites, player
    level requirements, faction restrictions, and previous quest completion status.
    This method is typically called during the quest acceptance process to validate
    that the player meets all necessary criteria before allowing them to take on the
    quest. The method returns true if the quest can be accepted, and false otherwise.
    It's an integral part of the quest system's validation logic within TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the quest ID. This parameter identifies
      which specific quest should be evaluated for acceptance eligibility.
  returns: Returns true if the player meets all requirements and can accept the specified
    quest; returns false if any requirement is not met or if the quest cannot be accepted
    at this time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Acceptance Check
    code: "if (questManager->ShouldAcceptQuest(&questId)) {\n    // Proceed with quest\
      \ acceptance logic\n    player->AddQuest(questId);\n} else {\n    // Inform\
      \ player that quest cannot be accepted\n    player->SendNotification(\"You are\
      \ not eligible to accept this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Accept Event
    code: "void Player::OnQuestAccept(Quest const* quest) {\n    if (!questManager->ShouldAcceptQuest(&quest->GetQuestId()))\
      \ {\n        SendQuestInvalidReason(QUEST_INVALID_REASON_NOT_HAVE_REQ);\n  \
      \      return;\n    }\n    // Continue with normal quest acceptance flow\n \
      \   AcceptQuest(quest);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against the player's current level, faction,
    completed quests, and other game state variables. It may also interact with database
    queries to verify quest prerequisites. The method is expected to be called frequently
    during quest interaction, so performance optimization is important.
  warnings: The method assumes that the quest pointer points to a valid quest ID.
    Passing an invalid or null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Additionally,
    this method should not be used as a replacement for full quest validation in all
    scenarios, as some checks may require additional context from the player's state.
