documentation:
  brief: Completes the simulation of an active mover movement initialization packet
    for bot behavior.
  description: The SimulateMoveInitActiveMoverComplete method finalizes the process
    of simulating a movement initialization packet that is typically sent by the server
    to notify clients about an active mover's movement state. This method is part
    of the BotPacketSimulator class and is used in the context of TrinityCore's bot
    system, where bots simulate player actions including movement. It likely handles
    internal state transitions or cleanup after initiating a movement sequence for
    a simulated bot character. The method does not take any parameters and returns
    no value, indicating it performs an action rather than computing a result.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Initialization
    code: 'BotPacketSimulator simulator;

      simulator.SimulateMoveInitActiveMoverComplete();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally within the bot AI system to maintain
    synchronization between simulated movement states and actual game server behavior.
    It may be called as part of a larger sequence involving movement packet generation,
    sending, and state management.
