  class: PlayerbotPacketSniffer
  method: CategorizePacket
  signature: PacketCategory PlayerbotPacketSniffer::CategorizePacket(int opcode)
documentation:
  brief: Categorizes an incoming packet based on its opcode for player bot processing.
  description: The CategorizePacket method analyzes the provided opcode to determine
    the type and category of an incoming network packet. This categorization is essential
    for player bot logic to properly handle different types of game messages, such
    as chat communications, movement updates, or combat-related data. The method helps
    in routing packets to appropriate handlers within the player bot system, ensuring
    that bots can respond correctly to various game events. It typically operates
    during packet sniffing sessions where the bot monitors and interprets network
    traffic for decision-making purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a PacketCategory enum value indicating the categorized type of
    the packet. Possible values may include categories like Chat, Movement, Combat,
    Inventory, or Unknown depending on how the opcode is classified within the player
    bot system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet handling
    code: "PacketCategory category = sniffer.CategorizePacket(opcode);\nif (category\
      \ == PacketCategory::Chat)\n{\n    // Handle chat message\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal opcode-to-category mappings that are
    defined within the player bot framework. It's important to note that the categorization
    logic may evolve with game updates and should be consistent with the current TrinityCore
    packet handling system.
