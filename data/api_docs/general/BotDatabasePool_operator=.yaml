    param0)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one BotDatabasePool object to another
  description: The assignment operator for BotDatabasePool performs a deep copy of
    all internal database connection pool resources from the source object to the
    target object. This method ensures that both objects maintain independent but
    equivalent database connection configurations, allowing for proper resource management
    and avoiding shared state issues. In the context of TrinityCore's bot system,
    this operation is typically used when reassigning database connections between
    different bot instances or when copying configuration settings for database access.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotDatabasePool object whose contents will be copied to
      this object
  returns: A reference to the current BotDatabasePool object (this) after the assignment
    has been completed, enabling chained assignment operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Example
    code: 'BotDatabasePool pool1;

      BotDatabasePool pool2 = pool1; // Uses copy constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      pool2 = pool1; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'BotDatabasePool pool1, pool2, pool3;

      // ... initialize pools ...

      pool3 = pool2 = pool1; // Chained assignment

      // pool1, pool2, and pool3 all contain identical database pool configurations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely handles reference counting or resource management internally
    to prevent memory leaks. The implementation should ensure thread-safe operation
    when multiple threads access database connections simultaneously.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning large database connection pools as this may
    involve significant resource copying. Avoid frequent assignment operations in
    performance-critical code paths.
