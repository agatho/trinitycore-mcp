  class: PositionStrategyBase
  method: GetMinimumSpacing
  signature: float PositionStrategyBase::GetMinimumSpacing()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the minimum spacing value used by the position strategy for object
    placement.
  description: The GetMinimumSpacing method retrieves the minimum distance threshold
    that governs how closely objects can be positioned relative to each other within
    the context of a positioning strategy. This value is crucial for preventing overlap
    or excessive clustering of game entities such as NPCs, loot, or spawn points.
    The returned float value represents the spacing in world units and is typically
    used during pathfinding, spawn point selection, or positioning calculations to
    maintain appropriate spatial distribution. This method does not require any parameters
    and always returns a positive floating-point number representing the configured
    minimum spacing.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the minimum spacing distance in world units.
    This value defines the closest allowable distance between objects when using this
    position strategy, ensuring proper spatial distribution and avoiding collisions
    or overcrowding.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PositionStrategyBase* strategy = new SomePositionStrategy();

      float spacing = strategy->GetMinimumSpacing();

      printf("Minimum spacing is: %f\n", spacing);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Spawn Logic
    code: "void SpawnCreature(Creature* creature, PositionStrategyBase* strategy)\
      \ {\n    float minSpacing = strategy->GetMinimumSpacing();\n    // Use minSpacing\
      \ to ensure new spawn positions are not too close\n    // to existing creatures\
      \ or objects\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other positioning strategies
    and should be called after the strategy has been initialized with appropriate
    configuration values. The returned value may vary depending on the specific derived
    class implementation of PositionStrategyBase.
