documentation:
  brief: Returns the bitmask representing the character sets that are currently available
    for use in the configuration category.
  description: The GetExistingCharsetMask method retrieves a bitmask value that indicates
    which character set encodings are supported or enabled within the Cfg_CategoriesEntry.
    This bitmask is typically used by the TrinityCore server to determine compatibility
    and validity of string data when processing client requests, localization settings,
    or database entries related to text encoding. The returned integer value can be
    interpreted using bitwise operations to check for specific character set support
    flags. This method does not modify any internal state and is safe to call multiple
    times. It assumes that the configuration entry has been properly initialized with
    valid charset data.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer bitmask where each bit represents a specific character set encoding.
    The bits can be checked using bitwise AND operations against predefined constants
    (e.g., CHARSET_LATIN1, CHARSET_UTF8) to determine which encodings are supported
    in this configuration category.
  examples:
  - title: Check if UTF-8 charset is supported
    code: "Cfg_CategoriesEntry* entry = sConfigMgr->GetCategoryEntry(123);\nif (entry\
      \ && (entry->GetExistingCharsetMask() & CHARSET_UTF8)) {\n    // UTF-8 encoding\
      \ is supported\n    printf(\"UTF-8 is supported\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validate character set compatibility
    code: "int mask = categoryEntry->GetExistingCharsetMask();\nif (mask & CHARSET_LATIN1)\
      \ {\n    // Latin-1 encoding is available\n}\nif (mask & CHARSET_UTF8) {\n \
      \   // UTF-8 encoding is available\n}\n// Combine checks for multiple encodings\n\
      if ((mask & (CHARSET_LATIN1 | CHARSET_UTF8)) == (CHARSET_LATIN1 | CHARSET_UTF8))\
      \ {\n    // Both encodings are supported\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the configuration management system in TrinityCore
    and relies on internal data structures that must be properly initialized before
    calling. The bitmask values are typically defined as constants in the core codebase,
    such as CHARSET_LATIN1, CHARSET_UTF8, etc., which should be referenced for proper
    bit checking.
  warnings: Ensure that the Cfg_CategoriesEntry object is valid and initialized before
    calling this method, otherwise behavior is undefined. Bitwise operations on the
    returned mask should use predefined charset constants to avoid errors due to incorrect
    bit positions.
