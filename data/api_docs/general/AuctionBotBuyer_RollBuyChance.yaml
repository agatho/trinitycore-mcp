api:
  class: AuctionBotBuyer
  method: RollBuyChance
  signature: bool AuctionBotBuyer::RollBuyChance(const BuyerItemInfo * ahInfo, const
    int * auction)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the auction bot should purchase a specific item based
    on configured buying criteria.
  description: The RollBuyChance method evaluates if an auction item meets the conditions
    set by the AuctionBotBuyer configuration to decide whether to place a bid. It
    considers factors such as item quality, price thresholds, and buyer settings.
    This method is typically called during auction house scanning or bidding processes
    to make automated purchasing decisions. The result indicates whether the bot should
    proceed with buying the item.
  parameters:
  - name: ahInfo
    description: Pointer to the BuyerItemInfo structure containing details about the
      auction item being evaluated, including item ID, bid price, buyout price, and
      other relevant auction data.
  - name: auction
    description: Pointer to an integer array representing the auction data, likely
      containing identifiers or metadata related to the specific auction entry in
      the auction house system.
  returns: Returns true if the bot should buy the item based on configured criteria;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in auction scanning loop
    code: "if (botBuyer.RollBuyChance(&itemInfo, &auctionData)) {\n    // Place bid\
      \ on the item\n    botBuyer.BuyItem(itemInfo, auctionData);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with auction house update handler
    code: "void OnAuctionUpdate(AuctionEntry* entry) {\n    BuyerItemInfo itemInfo;\n\
      \    // Populate itemInfo from entry\n    int auctionData[3] = {entry->id, entry->bid,\
      \ entry->buyout};\n    if (botBuyer.RollBuyChance(&itemInfo, auctionData)) {\n\
      \        botBuyer.PlaceBid(entry);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies heavily on the internal configuration of AuctionBotBuyer.
    Ensure that all buyer settings are properly initialized before calling this function
    to avoid unexpected behavior. The method may be called frequently during auction
    house scans, so performance is important.
  warnings: Do not call this method without valid pointers to ahInfo and auction parameters;
    passing null or invalid data can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also,
    ensure that the auction data array contains at least the required number of elements
    expected by the implementation.
