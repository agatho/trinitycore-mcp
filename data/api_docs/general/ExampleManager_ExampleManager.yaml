  class: ExampleManager
  method: ExampleManager
  signature: void ExampleManager::ExampleManager(Player * bot, BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new ExampleManager instance with the specified player and AI
    components
  description: The ExampleManager constructor initializes a new instance of the ExampleManager
    class, setting up internal references to the provided Player object and BotAI
    instance. This method is typically called during bot creation or initialization
    phases within the TrinityCore framework. The constructor establishes the necessary
    context for the manager to interact with the player's game state and AI behavior.
    It performs no direct game mechanics operations but prepares the object for subsequent
    method calls that may manipulate or query bot behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character that
      this manager will control or interact with
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI object containing AI logic and state information
      for the bot
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Example
    code: 'ExampleManager* manager = new ExampleManager(bot, ai);

      // Manager is now initialized with bot and AI references'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Bot Creation Context
    code: 'Player* playerBot = ...; // Get or create bot player

      BotAI* botAI = ...; // Get or create bot AI instance

      ExampleManager manager(playerBot, botAI);

      // Manager is ready to be used for bot operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any asynchronous operations or heavy initialization.
    It simply stores the provided pointers and sets up internal state. The actual
    AI behavior implementation would occur through other methods in the class, not
    during construction.
  warnings: Ensure that both bot and ai parameters are valid non-null pointers before
    calling this constructor. Passing null pointers will likely cause crashes or undefined
    behavior later when methods try to access these objects.
