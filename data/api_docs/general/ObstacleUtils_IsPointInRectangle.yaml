  method: IsPointInRectangle
  signature: bool ObstacleUtils::IsPointInRectangle(const int & point, const int &
    rectMin, const int & rectMax)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given point lies within the boundaries of a specified
    rectangle.
  description: The IsPointInRectangle method evaluates if a point defined by its coordinates
    falls inside or on the edge of a rectangle. This utility function is commonly
    used in pathfinding, collision detection, and spatial queries within the game
    world. The method takes three integer parameters representing the point's coordinate
    and the minimum and maximum bounds of the rectangle. It performs a simple boundary
    check to determine inclusion. The implementation assumes that rectMin represents
    the lower bound (minimum) and rectMax represents the upper bound (maximum) of
    the rectangle along each axis.
  parameters:
  - name: point
    description: The coordinate value of the point to be checked for inclusion within
      the rectangle.
  - name: rectMin
    description: The minimum boundary value of the rectangle along the same axis as
      the point.
  - name: rectMax
    description: The maximum boundary value of the rectangle along the same axis as
      the point.
  returns: Returns true if the point lies within or on the edge of the rectangle defined
    by rectMin and rectMax; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Point-in-Rectangle Check
    code: 'bool result = ObstacleUtils::IsPointInRectangle(5, 0, 10);

      // Returns true because 5 is within [0, 10]'
    language: cpp
  - title: Edge Case - Point on Rectangle Boundary
    code: 'bool result = ObstacleUtils::IsPointInRectangle(0, 0, 10);

      // Returns true because 0 is on the boundary of [0, 10]'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple one-dimensional check. For two-dimensional
    point-in-rectangle checks, multiple calls to this function would be required for
    x and y coordinates respectively. The method does not validate that rectMin is
    less than or equal to rectMax; it assumes valid input parameters.
  warnings: Ensure that the point coordinate and rectangle boundaries are correctly
    aligned along the same axis. Passing invalid or unordered boundary values may
    lead to incorrect results. This function is not suitable for checking points in
    multi-dimensional space without additional logic.
