  class: ArmsWarriorRefactored
  method: GetSpellResourceCost
  signature: uint32 ArmsWarriorRefactored::GetSpellResourceCost(uint32 spellId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the resource cost of a specified spell for the Arms Warrior class.
  description: The GetSpellResourceCost method calculates and returns the resource
    cost associated with executing a given spell within the Arms Warrior specialization.
    This cost typically represents the mana or rage required to cast the spell, and
    may vary based on the warrior's current state, buffs, debuffs, and equipped items.
    The method is designed to be used during spell casting logic to determine whether
    the player has sufficient resources before proceeding with the spell execution.
    It does not modify any internal state but rather provides a read-only view of
    the spell's resource requirements.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the resource cost (e.g., mana or rage)
    required to cast the specified spell. A return value of 0 typically indicates
    that the spell does not consume any resources or that the spell ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 cost = warrior->GetSpellResourceCost(12345); // Get cost for a specific\
      \ spell\nif (cost > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with spell casting logic\n    if (warrior->HasEnoughResource(cost))\n\
      \    {\n        warrior->SpendResource(cost);\n        // Cast the spell\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spell data and class-specific modifiers. It
    assumes that the spell ID passed is valid for the Arms Warrior specialization.
    The returned cost may be affected by temporary effects such as buffs, debuffs,
    or item enchantments.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided spell ID corresponds to a valid Arms Warrior
    spell; otherwise, the method might return an unexpected value or zero. This method
    should not be used directly in combat situations where performance is critical
    due to potential lookups and calculations.
