    int group, int ignoredPlayer) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a packet to all members of the group, with optional filtering based
    on raid status and group assignment.
  description: The BroadcastPacket method sends a WorldPacket to all players in the
    group, allowing for selective broadcasting based on group membership and raid
    status. It supports ignoring players in battleground raids and can target specific
    groups within a larger raid. This functionality is commonly used for sending synchronized
    updates, such as loot notifications, combat messages, or other game state changes
    that should be visible to all group members. The method ensures efficient packet
    delivery while respecting player grouping and battleground constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: packet
    description: A pointer to the WorldPacket object containing the data to be broadcasted
      to group members. This packet must be properly constructed with valid opcode
      and payload before being passed to this method.
  - name: ignorePlayersInBGRaid
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether players in battleground raids should
      be excluded from receiving the broadcast. When true, players currently engaged
      in battlegrounds will not receive the packet.
  - name: group
    description: Integer specifying which subgroup (0-4) to target within the group.
      A value of -1 indicates all groups, while valid values range from 0 to 4 representing
      individual subgroups.
  - name: ignoredPlayer
    description: Integer representing the GUID of a player who should be excluded
      from receiving the broadcast. Set to 0 or invalid GUID to include all players
      in the broadcast.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Broadcast loot notification to all group members
    code: 'WorldPacket packet(SMSG_LOOT_START_ROLL, 12);

      packet << uint32(12345); // Loot ID

      packet << uint32(67890); // Item ID

      packet << uint8(1);     // Roll type


      // Broadcast to all group members, ignoring battleground players

      this->BroadcastPacket(&packet, true, -1, 0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Send combat message to specific subgroup in raid
    code: 'WorldPacket packet(SMSG_MESSAGE_CHAT, 64);

      packet << uint8(CHAT_MSG_RAID); // Chat type

      packet << uint32(LANG_YOUR_RAID_LEADER); // Language

      packet << "Raid update for group 2"; // Message


      // Broadcast to subgroup 2 only, excluding battleground players

      this->BroadcastPacket(&packet, true, 2, 0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the assumption that the Group object is properly
    initialized and contains valid group members. It internally handles player filtering
    based on battleground status and group assignments. The packet must be fully constructed
    with appropriate opcode and data before calling this method, as it does not perform
    any validation of the packet contents.
  warnings: Improperly constructed WorldPackets can cause client-side crashes or undefined
    behavior. Always ensure that packets are properly formatted before broadcasting.
    Using invalid GUID values for ignoredPlayer may result in unexpected filtering
    behavior. The group parameter should be validated to prevent out-of-bounds access
    when targeting specific subgroups.
