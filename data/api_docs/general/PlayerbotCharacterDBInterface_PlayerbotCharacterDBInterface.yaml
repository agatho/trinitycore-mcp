documentation:
  brief: Moves a PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface object to another instance, transferring
    all owned resources and leaving the source in a valid but unspecified state.
  description: This is a move constructor for the PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface class.
    It transfers ownership of resources from the source object (param0) to the newly
    constructed object. The move constructor is typically used when an object needs
    to be initialized with the contents of another object, such as during return value
    optimization or when passing objects by value. In the context of TrinityCore's
    playerbot system, this interface likely handles database operations for bot characters.
    After the move, the source object should not be used in a meaningful way, though
    it remains in a valid state. This operation is generally more efficient than copying
    as it avoids expensive deep copies of internal data structures.

  - title: Move Construction Example
    code: 'PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface sourceInterface;

      // ... perform operations on sourceInterface ...

      PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface newInterface = std::move(sourceInterface); //
      Move constructor called

      // sourceInterface is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This move constructor follows the standard C++ move semantics. The source
    object after moving should not be accessed for meaningful operations, though it
    remains in a valid state. This implementation likely avoids deep copying of internal
    data structures, making it more efficient than a copy constructor.
