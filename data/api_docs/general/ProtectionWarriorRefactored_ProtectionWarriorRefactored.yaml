  class: ProtectionWarriorRefactored
  method: ProtectionWarriorRefactored
  signature: void ProtectionWarriorRefactored::ProtectionWarriorRefactored(Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Protection Warrior AI bot with the specified player character.
  description: The ProtectionWarriorRefactored constructor initializes a Protection
    Warrior AI bot by setting up its internal state and configuration based on the
    provided Player object. This method configures the bot's behavior, abilities,
    and combat strategy according to the protection warrior class specialization.
    It ensures that the bot is properly integrated into the TrinityCore AI system
    and ready to perform protective duties in both solo and group scenarios. The initialization
    process includes setting up target selection logic, ability usage patterns, and
    defensive cooldown management specific to the protection warrior role.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the Protection Warrior
      AI bot to be initialized. This parameter must not be null and should reference
      a valid player instance with protection warrior class characteristics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Player* myWarrior = new Player();

      // ... configure player ...

      ProtectionWarriorRefactored warriorAI(myWarrior);

      // Bot is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The Player
    object passed must already be properly configured as a protection warrior class
    character with appropriate stats and equipment. The initialization process may
    involve loading AI behavior templates from database or configuration files.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the bot parameter will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the Player object is fully initialized before
    passing it to this constructor, including proper class assignment and stat distribution.
