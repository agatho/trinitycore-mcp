  class: MountManager
  method: DismountPlayer
  signature: bool MountManager::DismountPlayer(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Dismounts the specified player from their current mount.
  description: The DismountPlayer method removes the specified player from their currently
    active mount. This function typically handles the removal of mount-related auras,
    updates the player's movement state, and may trigger related events or visual
    effects. It is commonly used when a player logs out, changes zones, or explicitly
    dismounts using in-game commands. The method expects a valid player reference
    and performs necessary cleanup to ensure the player's state is properly updated
    after dismounting.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter must point to a valid player object within the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the player was successfully dismounted, false otherwise.
    A return value of false may indicate that the player was not mounted or that the
    operation failed due to invalid input.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Dismount Usage
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nbool success = mountManager.DismountPlayer(&playerId);\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Player successfully dismounted\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Failed\
      \ to dismount player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player reference provided is valid and corresponds
    to an active player in the game world. It does not perform any validation on the
    player's current mount status before attempting to dismount.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed to this method points to a valid,
    active player object. Passing an invalid or null reference may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes.
