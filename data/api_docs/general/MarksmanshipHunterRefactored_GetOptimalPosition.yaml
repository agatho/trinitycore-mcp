  class: MarksmanshipHunterRefactored
  method: GetOptimalPosition
  signature: int MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::GetOptimalPosition(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal positioning for a marksmanship hunter
    based on target distance and environmental factors.
  description: The GetOptimalPosition method determines the best positional stance
    for a marksmanship hunter to maximize damage output or accuracy. This method evaluates
    various game mechanics including target distance, terrain, line of sight, and
    hunter-specific abilities such as Aimed Shot and Hunter's Mark. It considers environmental
    obstacles, movement states, and combat conditions to compute an optimal position
    that enhances the hunter's performance in ranged combat. The result is typically
    used by AI systems or advanced scripting to dynamically adjust hunter positioning
    during encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated optimal position index.
    A positive value indicates a specific recommended position, while negative values
    may indicate error conditions or that no optimal position exists under current
    circumstances.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int optimalPos = hunter.GetOptimalPosition(nullptr);\nif (optimalPos >\
      \ 0) {\n    // Apply the recommended positioning\n    printf(\"Optimal position:\
      \ %d\\n\", optimalPos);\n} else {\n    // Handle error or no recommendation\n\
      \    printf(\"No optimal position available\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs complex calculations involving target distance,
    environmental factors, and hunter state. It may cache previous results for performance
    optimization in high-frequency scenarios. The exact positioning logic is implementation-dependent
    and could vary based on the current combat situation.
  warnings: The method may return negative values indicating error conditions or invalid
    states. Always validate the return value before using it for positioning decisions.
    In dynamic combat situations, the optimal position may change rapidly, requiring
    frequent recalculations.
