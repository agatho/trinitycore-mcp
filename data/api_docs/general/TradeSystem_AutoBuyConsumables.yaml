documentation:
  brief: Automatically purchases consumable items for the specified player character.
  description: The AutoBuyConsumables method is designed to automatically acquire
    and purchase consumable items such as health potions, mana potions, food, and
    other temporary effect items for a given player character. This functionality
    is typically used in automated gameplay systems or botting scenarios where the
    player's inventory needs to be maintained without manual intervention. The method
    evaluates the player's current resource levels and inventory status to determine
    which consumables are needed and then proceeds to purchase them from available
    vendors within the game world.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get a valid player reference

      TradeSystem::AutoBuyConsumables(player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the game's trading system and vendor interfaces
    to locate available consumables. It may have internal logic to prioritize certain
    consumables based on player class or current combat state. Performance considerations
    should be taken into account when calling this method frequently, as it may involve
    multiple network requests to vendor NPCs.
  warnings: This method should only be called with valid Player objects; passing a
    null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior. Additionally, using this
    functionality in automated scripts may violate game terms of service and could
    lead to account penalties if detected by anti-cheat systems.
