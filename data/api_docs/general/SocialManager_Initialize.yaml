  class: SocialManager
  method: Initialize
  signature: void SocialManager::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the social manager's internal data structures and prepares it
    for handling player social interactions.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the SocialManager class by loading and
    preparing all necessary social data structures, including friend lists, ignore
    lists, and group membership information. This method is typically called during
    server startup or when a player logs in to ensure that social functionality is
    fully operational. It initializes internal caches and prepares the manager to
    handle social-related requests such as adding friends, ignoring players, or managing
    guild relationships. The method ensures that all social data is synchronized with
    the database and ready for real-time interaction processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = new SocialManager();

      socialMgr->Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization During Player Login
    code: "void Player::OnLogin()\n{\n    // Other login logic...\n    sSocialMgr->Initialize();\n\
      \    // Continue with other login procedures\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the manager's lifecycle. Repeated
    calls may cause data inconsistencies or memory leaks. The initialization process
    can be resource-intensive as it loads all social data from the database into memory
    caches.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to undefined
    behavior and memory corruption. Ensure that this method is not called concurrently
    from multiple threads without proper synchronization mechanisms.
