documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BattlegroundScore object and releases its allocated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BattlegroundScore class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used by the score object
    during a battleground match. This method is automatically invoked when a BattlegroundScore
    instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore, this ensures proper cleanup of player score data after
    a battleground session has ended, preventing memory leaks and maintaining system
    stability. The destructor does not take any parameters and performs no return
    operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BattlegroundScore
    code: "void EndBattleground() {\n    BattlegroundScore* score = new BattlegroundScore();\n\
      \    // ... use the score object ...\n    delete score; // This calls the destructor\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called when objects are destroyed. Developers
    should not manually invoke destructors unless implementing custom memory management
    patterns. In battleground scenarios, this destructor ensures that player statistics
    and related data structures are properly freed after match completion.
