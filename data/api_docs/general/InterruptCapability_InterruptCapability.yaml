documentation:
  brief: Initializes an InterruptCapability object with default values for interrupt
    handling.
  description: The InterruptCapability constructor initializes a new instance of the
    InterruptCapability class. This method sets up the internal state required for
    managing interruptible abilities and their associated capabilities within the
    TrinityCore framework. The constructor typically configures default interrupt
    parameters such as interrupt duration, cost, and whether the capability is active.
    It ensures that all member variables are properly initialized before the object
    can be used in gameplay mechanics involving ability interruption.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a new InterruptCapability instance
    code: 'InterruptCapability capability;

      // The object is now initialized and ready for use in interrupt handling logic'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore system
    when creating interrupt-related objects. Developers should not need to manually
    instantiate InterruptCapability objects unless implementing custom interrupt mechanics.
    The initialization process may involve setting up internal data structures that
    track interruptible spells and their properties.
