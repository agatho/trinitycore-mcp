  class: LFGMgr
  method: SetTeam
  signature: void LFGMgr::SetTeam(int guid, uint8 team)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the team for a given player GUID in the LFG system.
  description: The SetTeam method assigns a specific team (Alliance or Horde) to a
    player identified by their GUID within the Looking For Group (LFG) subsystem.
    This is typically used during character creation, faction switching, or when updating
    a player's team affiliation for group matching purposes. The method directly modifies
    internal LFG data structures to reflect the new team assignment for the specified
    player.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose team is being set.
      This should be a valid player GUID from the game database.
  - name: team
    description: The team to assign to the player. Valid values are 0 for Alliance
      and 1 for Horde.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Player Team to Horde
    code: LFGMgr::instance()->SetTeam(123456, 1); // Assigns player with GUID 123456
      to Horde team
    language: cpp
  - title: Set Player Team to Alliance
    code: LFGMgr::instance()->SetTeam(player->GetGUID().GetCounter(), 0); // Assigns
      current player to Alliance team
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the LFG manager singleton instance and directly modifies
    internal data structures. It should only be called when the player's team assignment
    needs to be updated, such as during faction change events or character creation.
    The method does not perform any validation of the GUID or team value beyond basic
    type checking.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid GUID may result in undefined behavior
    or data corruption within the LFG system. Ensure that the GUID corresponds to
    a valid player before calling this method. Also, be aware that changing a player's
    team while they are in a group or queue might cause unexpected behavior in group
    matching.
