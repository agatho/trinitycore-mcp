  brief: Sets the multi-action bar mask for the player, enabling or disabling specific
    action bar slots.
  description: This method configures the multi-action bar mask for a player character,
    determining which action bar slots are enabled or disabled. The mask parameter
    controls the activation of different action bar slots, allowing players to customize
    their action bar setup based on game mechanics and gameplay requirements. This
    method is typically used in conjunction with other action bar related functions
    to manage player's action bar configuration during gameplay.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetMultiActionBars(0x0F); // Enable first four action bar slots'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint8 mask = 0xFF;

      player->SetMultiActionBars(mask);

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other action bar related
    methods to manage player's action bar configuration. The mask value should be
    carefully considered as it affects gameplay mechanics and player's ability to
    access different action bar slots.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect action bar configurations,
    potentially causing players to lose access to certain action bar slots or enabling
    unwanted slots. Care should be taken when setting the mask value to ensure proper
    game balance.
