  method: GetSpellManaCost
  signature: uint32 CombatSpecializationBase::GetSpellManaCost(uint32 spellId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the mana cost of a specified spell for the combat specialization.
  description: The GetSpellManaCost method returns the base mana cost associated with
    a given spell ID within the context of the current combat specialization. This
    method is typically used to determine resource requirements for spell casting,
    particularly in scenarios where different specializations may have varying mana
    costs for the same spell. The returned value represents the absolute mana cost
    and does not account for modifiers such as buffs, debuffs, or class-specific adjustments
    that might affect actual casting costs during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: The method returns a uint32 value representing the base mana cost of the
    specified spell. If the spell ID is invalid or not found within the combat specialization's
    data, the method may return zero or an undefined value depending on implementation
    details.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Mana Cost for Fireball Spell
    code: "uint32 fireballManaCost = combatSpec->GetSpellManaCost(133); // Assuming\
      \ 133 is Fireball spell ID\nif (fireballManaCost > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Fireball\
      \ requires %u mana to cast.\\n\", fireballManaCost);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the combat specialization has been properly initialized
    and contains valid spell data. It is recommended to verify that the spell ID exists
    in the game's spell database before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent spell ID may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect mana cost values. Always validate input parameters
    when possible.
