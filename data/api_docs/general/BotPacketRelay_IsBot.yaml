  class: BotPacketRelay
  method: IsBot
  signature: bool BotPacketRelay::IsBot(const Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given player is a bot character.
  description: The IsBot method checks if the specified Player object represents a
    bot character within the TrinityCore framework. This utility function is commonly
    used in bot-related systems to differentiate between regular player characters
    and automated bot instances. The method typically examines internal flags, character
    properties, or other identifying characteristics that distinguish bot characters
    from real players. It's essential for maintaining proper behavior and permissions
    handling in bot management systems.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object to be checked. Must not be null; passing
      a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
  returns: Returns true if the player is identified as a bot character, false otherwise.
    The method performs a quick check against bot-specific flags or properties stored
    within the Player object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a player is a bot
    code: "Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Some player object\nif (botPacketRelay.IsBot(targetPlayer))\
      \ {\n    // Handle bot-specific logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Detected bot character:\
      \ %s\", targetPlayer->GetName().c_str());\n} else {\n    // Handle regular player\
      \ logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Regular player: %s\", targetPlayer->GetName().c_str());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsBot in packet relay filtering
    code: "void BotPacketRelay::HandleIncomingPacket(WorldPacket& packet, Player*\
      \ sender) {\n    if (IsBot(sender)) {\n        // Process bot packets differently\n\
      \        HandleBotPacket(packet, sender);\n    } else {\n        // Forward\
      \ regular player packets normally\n        ForwardPlayerPacket(packet, sender);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal bot identification flags or character
    creation metadata. It's designed for performance-critical scenarios and should
    be used sparingly in high-frequency code paths. The implementation may vary depending
    on how bots are registered within the TrinityCore instance.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null, as dereferencing a null pointer will cause a crash. This method should only
    be called on initialized Player objects that have been properly added to the world.
