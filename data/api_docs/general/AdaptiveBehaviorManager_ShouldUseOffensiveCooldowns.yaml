  signature: bool AdaptiveBehaviorManager::ShouldUseOffensiveCooldowns() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the AI should use offensive cooldowns based on current
    combat state and strategy.
  description: The ShouldUseOffensiveCooldowns method evaluates the current combat
    situation and adaptive behavior settings to decide if it's appropriate for the
    AI-controlled unit to activate its offensive cooldown abilities. This decision
    is typically made during active combat scenarios where cooldown management plays
    a crucial role in optimizing damage output or tactical positioning. The method
    considers factors such as target health, available resources, cooldown timers,
    and overall combat strategy defined by the AdaptiveBehaviorManager. It returns
    true when the AI should proceed with using offensive cooldowns, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI should use offensive cooldowns in the current situation;
    otherwise returns false. The decision is based on internal state evaluation of
    combat conditions and adaptive behavior rules.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (adaptiveBehaviorManager.ShouldUseOffensiveCooldowns()) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with using offensive cooldown\n    unit->UseOffensiveCooldown();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in Combat Logic
    code: "void UnitAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (me->IsInCombat()) {\n   \
      \     if (adaptiveBehaviorManager.ShouldUseOffensiveCooldowns()) {\n       \
      \     // Execute offensive cooldown logic\n            DoOffensiveCooldownAction();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the adaptive AI system in TrinityCore and relies on
    internal state tracking. It should be called frequently during combat updates
    to ensure timely decision-making. The behavior may vary depending on the specific
    AI module or class implementing this logic.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat situations without proper checks,
    as it might return unexpected results if the unit is not actively engaged in battle.
    Ensure that cooldown usage logic properly handles the returned boolean value to
    avoid unnecessary resource consumption.
