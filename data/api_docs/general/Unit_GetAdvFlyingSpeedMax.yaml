  signature: float Unit::GetAdvFlyingSpeedMax(AdvFlyingRateTypeRange speedType) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum advanced flying speed for the specified speed type.
  description: This method retrieves the maximum flying speed that a unit can achieve
    while in advanced flying mode. The method takes into account various factors such
    as player level, equipment, and buffs that affect flying speed. It is primarily
    used to determine the highest possible flying speed for a unit in the game world,
    particularly for players who are capable of flying at maximum speeds. This method
    is essential for calculating and managing flight paths in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the maximum flying speed for the specified
    AdvFlyingRateTypeRange. The value is typically expressed in yards per second and
    can vary based on game mechanics and player characteristics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: float maxSpeed = unit->GetAdvFlyingSpeedMax(ADV_FLYING_SPEED_TYPE_NORMAL);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "float maxSpeed = unit->GetAdvFlyingSpeedMax(ADV_FLYING_SPEED_TYPE_NORMAL);\n\
      if (maxSpeed > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Use the speed value for calculations\n    //\
      \ e.g., calculating flight path duration\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other flying-related methods
    to determine overall flying capabilities of a unit. It may be affected by various
    buffs, debuffs, and game mechanics that influence speed calculations.
  warnings: The return value may vary depending on the specific type of AdvFlyingRateTypeRange
    provided; ensure correct usage of the parameter to avoid incorrect speed calculations.
