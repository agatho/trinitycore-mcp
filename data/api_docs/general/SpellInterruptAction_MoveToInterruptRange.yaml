  class: SpellInterruptAction
  method: MoveToInterruptRange
  signature: ActionResult SpellInterruptAction::MoveToInterruptRange(BotAI * ai, ::Unit
    * target, float requiredRange)
documentation:
  brief: Moves the bot to within interrupt range of the target unit.
  description: The MoveToInterruptRange method instructs the bot's AI to navigate
    towards the specified target unit until it reaches a distance suitable for interrupting
    spell casts. This method is typically used in combat scenarios where the bot needs
    to position itself to effectively interrupt enemy spellcasters. The method evaluates
    the current distance to the target and initiates movement if the required range
    is not met. It returns an ActionResult indicating success or failure of the movement
    operation.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance controlling the bot's behavior.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target unit to move toward.
  - name: requiredRange
    description: The minimum distance (in yards) that the bot should maintain from
      the target for successful spell interruption.
  returns: ActionResult indicating whether the movement was initiated successfully
    or if an error occurred. Possible values include SUCCESS, FAILED, or IN_PROGRESS
    depending on the current state of the bot's movement.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to interrupt a target
    code: "SpellInterruptAction interruptAction;\nBotAI* ai = bot->GetBotAI();\nUnit*\
      \ target = unit;\nfloat interruptRange = 8.0f; // Standard melee range\nActionResult\
      \ result = interruptAction.MoveToInterruptRange(ai, target, interruptRange);\n\
      if (result == ActionResult::SUCCESS) {\n    // Movement initiated successfully\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with dynamic interrupt range
    code: "SpellInterruptAction interruptAction;\nBotAI* ai = bot->GetBotAI();\nUnit*\
      \ target = unit;\nfloat interruptRange = target->GetDistance(bot) > 30.0f ?\
      \ 30.0f : 8.0f; // Adjust based on distance\nActionResult result = interruptAction.MoveToInterruptRange(ai,\
      \ target, interruptRange);\nif (result == ActionResult::IN_PROGRESS) {\n   \
      \ // Bot is moving towards the target\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the bot's movement system and may not work correctly
    if the bot is in an invalid state or if pathfinding fails. The requiredRange parameter
    should be set appropriately for the spell being interrupted to ensure effectiveness.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit pointer is valid before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer will likely cause undefined behavior. Also, be cautious
    when using this method in fast-paced combat situations where the target might
    move out of range quickly.
