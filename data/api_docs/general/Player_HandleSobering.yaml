  brief: Reduces player's drunken state and associated effects
  description: The HandleSobering method is responsible for decrementing a player's
    drunken state level and removing or reducing the effects associated with intoxication.
    This method is typically invoked when a player's alcohol consumption decreases
    naturally over time or when they consume sobering items. The method manages the
    removal of drunk-related visual effects, movement impairments, and other gameplay
    mechanics tied to intoxication. It ensures that players gradually return to their
    normal state without abrupt changes in behavior or abilities.

    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->HandleSobering();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically called by the game's update loop when a player's
    drunken state decreases. It may also be invoked manually when items like 'Sobering
    Potion' are consumed. The method internally handles all visual and gameplay effect
    removals.
