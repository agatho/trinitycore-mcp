documentation:
  brief: Handles state change events for game objects within the AI system
  description: The OnStateChanged method is a virtual callback function in the GameObjectAI
    class that is invoked whenever a game object's state changes. This method allows
    custom AI behavior to be implemented in response to various state transitions,
    such as activation, deactivation, or other lifecycle events. The method provides
    a mechanism for game objects to react dynamically to their environment and interact
    with the world based on their current state. It is typically called by the core
    game engine when internal state modifications occur, enabling developers to extend
    default object behavior through custom implementations.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The new state identifier that the game object has transitioned to.
      This value represents the specific state code which determines how the object
      should behave or respond to the change.
  returns: null

      \        break;\n            default:\n                // Handle unknown state\n\

      \ state);\n        \n        if (state == 3)\n        {\n            // Trigger\
      \ quest event when object enters specific state\n            if (Player* player\
      \ = GetGameObject()->GetMap()->GetPlayer(GetGameObject()->GetOwnerGUID()))\n\
      \            {\n                player->KilledMonsterCredit(GetGameObject()->GetEntry());\n\
      \            }\n        }\n    }\n};"

  notes: This method is part of the GameObjectAI virtual interface and must be overridden
    in derived classes to provide custom behavior. The state parameter value is determined
    by the core engine and may vary depending on the specific type of game object
    and its intended functionality. Implementations should avoid performing heavy
    operations within this method as it may be called frequently during gameplay.
  warnings: Do not call base class implementation directly unless explicitly required,
    as this could lead to unexpected behavior. Ensure that all state transitions are
    properly handled to prevent undefined behavior or crashes in the game object's
    AI logic.
