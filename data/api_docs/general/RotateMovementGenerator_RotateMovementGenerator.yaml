  class: RotateMovementGenerator
  method: RotateMovementGenerator
  signature: void RotateMovementGenerator::RotateMovementGenerator(int id, RotateDirection
    direction, int duration, int turnSpeed, int totalTurnAngle, int param5)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a rotation movement generator with specified parameters for entity
    rotation behavior.
  description: The RotateMovementGenerator constructor initializes a movement generator
    responsible for rotating an entity over a defined duration. It configures the
    rotation direction, turn speed, total angle to rotate, and optional parameters.
    This method is typically used in AI systems or scripted events where controlled
    entity rotation is required. The generator will apply continuous rotation at the
    specified turn speed until the total rotation angle is completed or the duration
    expires, whichever comes first. The movement generator integrates with TrinityCore's
    movement system to ensure smooth animation and positioning updates during the
    rotation.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: Unique identifier for this rotation movement generator instance.
      Used to track and manage multiple concurrent rotations.
  - name: direction
    description: Specifies the direction of rotation, typically either clockwise or
      counter-clockwise. Values are usually defined as enum constants like ROTATE_DIRECTION_CLOCKWISE
      or ROTATE_DIRECTION_COUNTER_CLOCKWISE.
  - name: duration
    description: Total duration in milliseconds for the rotation to complete. If set
      to 0, the rotation continues indefinitely until manually stopped.
  - name: turnSpeed
    description: Rotation speed in degrees per second. Controls how fast the entity
      rotates during the movement.
  - name: totalTurnAngle
    description: Total angle in degrees that the entity should rotate. Positive values
      indicate clockwise rotation, negative values indicate counter-clockwise rotation.
  - name: param5
    description: Reserved parameter for future extensions or custom behavior flags.
      Currently unused but may be utilized by specific implementations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Rotation Setup
    code: 'RotateMovementGenerator gen(1, ROTATE_DIRECTION_CLOCKWISE, 2000, 90, 180,
      0);

      // Rotates entity clockwise 180 degrees over 2 seconds at 90 deg/sec'
    language: cpp
  - title: Indefinite Rotation with Custom Speed
    code: 'RotateMovementGenerator gen(2, ROTATE_DIRECTION_COUNTER_CLOCKWISE, 0, 45,
      360, 0);

      // Rotates entity counter-clockwise at 45 deg/sec indefinitely (360 degrees
      per rotation)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly initializes internal movement state variables and does
    not perform immediate rotation. The actual rotation begins when the movement generator
    is activated through the movement manager. The generator will automatically clean
    up its resources upon completion or cancellation.
  warnings: Ensure that the turnSpeed parameter is within reasonable bounds to avoid
    unnatural-looking rotations. Setting duration to 0 without proper cleanup can
    lead to memory leaks if not managed properly by the calling code.
