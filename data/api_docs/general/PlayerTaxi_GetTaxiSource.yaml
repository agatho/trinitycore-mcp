  class: PlayerTaxi
  method: GetTaxiSource
  signature: uint32 PlayerTaxi::GetTaxiSource() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier of the taxi node from which the player is
    currently boarding or has boarded.
  description: The GetTaxiSource method returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the
    taxi node that serves as the source for the player's current taxi path. This value
    corresponds to the entry in the `taxi_nodes` database table and represents the
    starting location of a flight path. The method is typically used during taxi travel
    to determine where the player originated before initiating a flight. It may return
    0 if no valid taxi source is set or if the player is not currently on a taxi path.
    This identifier can be used for various game mechanics such as validating flight
    paths, tracking player movement, or triggering events based on departure locations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the GUID of the taxi node that serves as the
    source for the current taxi path. Returns 0 if no valid taxi source is set or
    if the player is not currently in a taxi travel state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Get Taxi Source
    code: "uint32 sourceNode = player->GetTaxi().GetTaxiSource();\nif (sourceNode\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Process the taxi source node\n    sLog->outString(\"Player's\
      \ taxi source is: %u\", sourceNode);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validate Taxi Source Before Flight
    code: "PlayerTaxi& taxi = player->GetTaxi();\nuint32 source = taxi.GetTaxiSource();\n\
      if (source == 0)\n{\n    // Player is not currently on a taxi path\n    player->SendTaxiMenu();\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Proceed with flight logic using the source node\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Valid taxi source found: %u\", source);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PlayerTaxi class and should only be called when
    the player is in a valid taxi travel state. The returned value corresponds directly
    to entries in the `taxi_nodes` database table. If this method is called outside
    of a taxi path context, it will return 0, which may indicate either no active
    flight or an invalid state.
  warnings: Calling this method when the player is not on a taxi path will return
    0, which could be mistaken for a valid node ID if not properly checked. Always
    validate that the player is actually in transit before relying on the returned
    value.
