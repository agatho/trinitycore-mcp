  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: UpdateGroupDungeon
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::UpdateGroupDungeon(Group * group, uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the state of a group dungeon instance based on elapsed time and group
    activity.
  description: The UpdateGroupDungeon method is responsible for managing the progression
    and state changes within a group dungeon instance. It processes the time elapsed
    since the last update (diff parameter) and evaluates the current status of the
    group, including player activity, completion conditions, and potential timeouts.
    This method ensures that dungeon instances behave correctly according to World
    of Warcraft's dungeon mechanics, such as tracking boss kills, handling group disbands,
    and managing instance expiration timers. The method operates on a provided Group
    object and modifies internal dungeon state variables accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the dungeon group. Must
      be a valid pointer to an active group participating in a dungeon instance.
  - name: diff
    description: Elapsed time in milliseconds since last update call. Used to determine
      progression of timers and cooldowns within the dungeon instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateGroupDungeon Usage
    code: "void UpdateDungeonState(Group* dungeonGroup, uint32 deltaTime)\n{\n   \
      \ if (dungeonGroup)\n        dungeonBehavior->UpdateGroupDungeon(dungeonGroup,\
      \ deltaTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Update all active group\
      \ dungeons\n    for (auto& dungeon : activeDungeons)\n    {\n        if (dungeon->GetGroup())\n\
      \            dungeon->UpdateGroupDungeon(dungeon->GetGroup(), diff);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game loop or instance update
    handlers. It's designed to be lightweight and efficient, processing only necessary
    state changes without blocking other operations. The implementation likely includes
    checks for group member validity, instance expiration, and boss encounter status.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed is valid and represents an active
    dungeon group; passing a null or invalid group pointer may cause undefined behavior.
    The diff parameter should represent actual elapsed time to maintain proper dungeon
    timing mechanics.
