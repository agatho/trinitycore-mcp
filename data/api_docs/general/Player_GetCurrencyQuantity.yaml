documentation:
  brief: Returns the quantity of a specific currency item the player has.
  description: The GetCurrencyQuantity method retrieves the current amount of a specified
    currency item that the player possesses. This method is commonly used in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to access player currency data, such as honor
    points, arena points, or other game currencies. It provides a way to check the
    player's currency balance without needing to manually iterate through the player's
    inventory or currency collection. The method works with any valid currency ID
    defined in the game's currency system and returns zero if the currency is not
    found or if the player has no quantity of that specific currency.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the quantity of the specified currency
    item. If the currency ID is invalid or the player doesn't possess any quantity
    of that currency, it returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'uint32 honorPoints = player->GetCurrencyQuantity(CURRENCY_ID_HONOR);

      // Returns the number of honor points the player has'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. Performance-wise,
    it's a lightweight operation that directly accesses the player's currency data
    without requiring complex calculations or database queries.
  warnings: Be aware that this method will return 0 for invalid currency IDs. It's
    important to validate currency IDs before calling this method to avoid unexpected
    results.
