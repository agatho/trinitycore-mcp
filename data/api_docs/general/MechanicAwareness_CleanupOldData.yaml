documentation:
  brief: Removes outdated mechanic awareness data from the system based on current
    time.
  description: The CleanupOldData method is responsible for purging stale or expired
    mechanic awareness entries from the internal tracking system. This method ensures
    that old data does not accumulate indefinitely, which could lead to memory bloat
    or performance degradation. It typically iterates through stored mechanic awareness
    records and removes those whose expiration timestamps are earlier than the provided
    current time value. The cleanup process is essential for maintaining optimal performance
    and data integrity within the game's mechanic tracking subsystem.

  - title: Basic Cleanup Usage
    code: 'uint32 currentTime = WorldTimer::getMSTime();

      mechanicAwareness->CleanupOldData(currentTime);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called periodically as part of the game's maintenance
    routines to prevent data accumulation. It is likely invoked from a global update
    loop or timer-based cleanup mechanism.
