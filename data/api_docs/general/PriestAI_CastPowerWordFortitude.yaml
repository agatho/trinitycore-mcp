documentation:
  brief: 'Casts the Power Word: Fortitude spell on the target.'
  description: 'The CastPowerWordFortitude method is responsible for casting the Power
    Word: Fortitude spell, a healing spell that increases the target''s armor by 10%
    for 1 hour. This method is typically used by PriestAI to enhance the survivability
    of friendly targets in combat situations. The spell requires the priest to be
    within casting range and have sufficient mana. It does not interrupt the priest''s
    current action or movement, but may cause a brief delay depending on the spell''s
    casting time and the AI''s implementation. This method is part of the general
    AI behavior for priests in TrinityCore.'

  - title: Basic Usage in Priest AI
    code: "void PriestAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    if (me->HasAura(SPELL_POWER_WORD_FORTITUDE))\n     \
      \   return;\n\n    CastPowerWordFortitude();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'This method is likely part of a larger AI system that evaluates when to
    cast beneficial spells. It should be called only when the target does not already
    have the Power Word: Fortitude buff, and the priest has sufficient mana to cast
    the spell.'
  warnings: Ensure that the target is valid and within casting range before calling
    this method. Calling it without checking for existing buffs or mana may lead to
    unnecessary spell casts or resource waste.
