  class: HealthTrigger
  method: HealthTrigger
  signature: void HealthTrigger::HealthTrigger(const std::string & name, float threshold)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a health trigger with a specified name and threshold value for
    use in AI behavior.
  description: The HealthTrigger constructor initializes a new health-based trigger
    object that can be used within TrinityCore's AI system to monitor unit health
    levels. This method sets up the internal state of the trigger, associating it
    with a unique identifier (name) and defining a health threshold percentage that
    determines when the trigger should activate. The threshold value is typically
    expressed as a float between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 represents 0% health and 1.0
    represents 100% health. This functionality allows for conditional AI behaviors
    based on unit health status, such as initiating healing actions or switching to
    defensive modes when health drops below certain levels.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A unique string identifier for this health trigger. Used to distinguish
      between multiple triggers within the same AI context and must be non-empty.
  - name: threshold
    description: The health percentage threshold at which this trigger activates.
      Should be a float value between 0.0 (0%) and 1.0 (100%). Values outside this
      range may cause undefined behavior or trigger activation at unexpected times.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Health Trigger Initialization
    code: 'HealthTrigger trigger("low_health", 0.3f);

      // This creates a health trigger named "low_health" that activates when health
      drops below 30%.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Health Triggers for Different Thresholds
    code: 'HealthTrigger low("low", 0.25f);

      HealthTrigger medium("medium", 0.5f);

      HealthTrigger high("high", 0.75f);

      // Creates three triggers for different health thresholds to enable tiered AI
      responses.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with AI decision-making systems
    where health-based conditions are required. The trigger name should be unique
    within the scope of an AI context to avoid conflicts. Internally, this method
    likely stores the parameters in member variables and may register the trigger
    with a global or local event system for monitoring unit health changes.
  warnings: The threshold parameter must be between 0.0 and 1.0; values outside this
    range could lead to incorrect behavior or crashes. Additionally, since this is
    a constructor, it should only be called during object initialization and not modified
    after creation without proper synchronization in multi-threaded environments.
