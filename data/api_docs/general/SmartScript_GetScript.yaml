documentation:
  brief: Retrieves and initializes the smart script for an AI-controlled creature
    or game object
  description: The GetScript method is responsible for fetching and setting up the
    SmartScript instance associated with a creature or game object. This method ensures
    that the AI behavior system is properly initialized and ready to execute scripted
    events based on various triggers such as player interactions, combat states, or
    environmental changes. It typically gets called during the object's initialization
    phase or when the script needs to be activated. The method handles loading of
    script data from the database and prepares internal structures required for AI
    decision making.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in creature AI
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void Reset() override\n\
      \    {\n        // Initialize smart script for this creature\n        me->GetScript();\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    a creature or game object needs to be equipped with AI behavior. Developers should
    not normally call this directly unless implementing custom AI logic that requires
    explicit script initialization.
  warnings: Calling GetScript() on an already initialized script may result in unexpected
    behavior or memory leaks. This method should only be called once per object during
    its lifecycle.
