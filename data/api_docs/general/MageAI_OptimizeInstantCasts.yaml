documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the casting behavior of instant spells for the Mage AI.
  description: The OptimizeInstantCasts method adjusts the casting strategy for instant
    spells within the Mage AI system. It evaluates the current spell queue and available
    mana to determine the most efficient sequence of instant casts, ensuring optimal
    resource usage and damage output. This method is typically invoked during combat
    to dynamically adapt spell selection based on game state conditions such as cooldowns,
    mana availability, and target status. The optimization process considers factors
    like spell priority, casting time reduction effects, and tactical positioning
    to maximize effectiveness.

    code: "void MyMageAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    OptimizeInstantCasts();\n    // ... continue with combat actions ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat updates to maintain
    optimal spell casting behavior. The implementation may vary depending on the specific
    Mage specialization and current gear configuration.
