documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the armor value of an item based on its item level.
  description: The GetArmor method computes the armor value of an ItemTemplate instance
    at a specified item level. This method is used internally by the TrinityCore server
    to determine the protective capabilities of items when they are equipped by players
    or NPCs. The calculation typically takes into account the base armor value stored
    in the item template, scaling factors based on item level, and potentially other
    modifiers such as item quality or enchantments. It's important to note that this
    method does not directly access the item's current state but rather calculates
    what the armor would be at a given item level.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the calculated armor of the item at
    the specified item level. This value indicates how much physical damage the item
    can mitigate when equipped by a character.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);

      uint32 armorValue = itemTemplate->GetArmor(80);

      // armorValue now contains the armor value for item 12345 at item level 80'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during item instantiation or when calculating
    character stats. The armor calculation may vary depending on the item type (weapon,
    armor, etc.) and the specific implementation in the TrinityCore codebase. It's
    recommended to cache results if this method is called frequently for performance
    reasons.
  warnings: Ensure that the item level passed to this method is valid and within expected
    ranges; invalid item levels may lead to unexpected armor calculations or potential
    overflow issues. This method should not be used with item templates that are not
    properly initialized.
