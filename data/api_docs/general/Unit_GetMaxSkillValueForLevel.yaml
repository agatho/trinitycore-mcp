documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum skill value a unit can achieve for a given level.
  description: This method retrieves the maximum skill value that can be achieved
    by a unit at a specific level, typically used in conjunction with skill system
    mechanics within TrinityCore. The method is designed to provide accurate skill
    cap information based on the target unit's level and relevant game mechanics.
    It serves as a crucial component for determining skill progression and player
    advancement in World of Warcraft. This function is particularly important for
    calculating skill values for players and NPCs, ensuring proper skill caps are
    maintained across different levels.
  parameters: []
  returns: Represents the maximum skill value achievable by the unit at the specified
    level, typically ranging from 0 to 300 depending on game mechanics and level progression.
    Returns 0 if no valid skill information is available or if the target unit is
    invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint16 maxSkill = unit->GetMaxSkillValueForLevel(target);\nif (maxSkill\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process skill value\n    std::cout << \"Max skill value: \"\
      \ << maxSkill << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other skill-related functions
    and may involve performance considerations when called frequently. Implementation
    details include handling of different unit types and level-based skill caps. Thread
    safety should be considered when using this method in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: The method may return 0 if the target unit is invalid or if skill data
    is not properly initialized, potentially causing issues in skill progression calculations.
    Be cautious when using this method with non-player units as it may not behave
    as expected for NPCs or creatures.
