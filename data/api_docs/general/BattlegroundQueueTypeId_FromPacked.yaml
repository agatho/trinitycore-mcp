  method: FromPacked
  signature: BattlegroundQueueTypeId BattlegroundQueueTypeId::FromPacked(uint64 packedQueueId)
documentation:
  brief: Decodes a packed battleground queue identifier into a structured queue type
    ID.
  description: The FromPacked method is used to deserialize a 64-bit packed identifier
    back into a BattlegroundQueueTypeId object. This method is typically employed
    when retrieving queue information from storage or network communications where
    the queue ID has been compacted for efficiency. The packed format likely combines
    multiple fields such as battleground type, bracket, and instance ID into a single
    integer value. This decoding process allows the system to reconstruct the original
    queue type identifier for further processing within the battleground queue management
    system.
  parameters:
  - name: packedQueueId
    description: A 64-bit unsigned integer containing the packed battleground queue
      identifier. This value is typically constructed by combining various queue metadata
      fields into a compact representation for storage or transmission purposes.
  returns: Returns a BattlegroundQueueTypeId object that represents the decoded queue
    type identifier. The returned object contains all the information previously encoded
    in the packed value, including battleground type, bracket, and instance details.
  examples:
  - title: Decoding a Packed Queue ID
    code: 'uint64 packedId = 0x123456789ABCDEF0;

      BattlegroundQueueTypeId queueId = BattlegroundQueueTypeId::FromPacked(packedId);

      // queueId now contains the decoded battleground queue type information'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Decoded Queue ID for Queue Management
    code: "uint64 packedId = player->GetBattlegroundQueueId();\nBattlegroundQueueTypeId\
      \ queueId = BattlegroundQueueTypeId::FromPacked(packedId);\nif (queueId.GetBgTypeId()\
      \ == BATTLEGROUND_AV)\n{\n    // Handle AV specific queue logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the packed identifier follows a predefined bit layout
    that matches the internal structure of BattlegroundQueueTypeId. Developers should
    ensure compatibility with the packing format used by the corresponding ToPacked()
    method. The implementation likely uses bit manipulation to extract individual
    components from the packed value.
  warnings: Incorrect bit layout assumptions in the packed format can lead to invalid
    queue type identifiers being returned. Ensure that this method is only called
    with properly formatted packed IDs generated by the matching ToPacked() method.
    Using malformed packed values may result in undefined behavior or incorrect queue
    handling.
