  class: BotMemoryManager
  method: GenerateLeakReport
  signature: void BotMemoryManager::GenerateLeakReport(std::string & report) const
documentation:
  brief: Generates a detailed memory leak report for bot-related allocations within
    the TrinityCore instance.
  description: The GenerateLeakReport method constructs a comprehensive textual report
    detailing any detected memory leaks associated with bot memory management. This
    function is typically used during debugging or performance analysis to identify
    potential issues in how bots allocate and deallocate memory. The generated report
    includes information about leaked memory blocks, their sizes, and potentially
    the allocation sites if debugging symbols are available. It's important to note
    that this method should only be called when the system is in a stable state to
    ensure accurate reporting. The report string passed by reference will be overwritten
    with the new content upon execution.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'std::string leakReport;

      botMemoryManager.GenerateLeakReport(leakReport);

      std::cout << "Memory Leak Report:\n" << leakReport << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may have performance implications if called frequently due to
    internal scanning and reporting processes. It's recommended for use during development
    or debugging sessions rather than in production environments. The report format
    might vary depending on the build configuration (debug vs release).
  warnings: Calling this function while bots are actively running or during high-load
    scenarios may produce incomplete or misleading results. Ensure that all bot operations
    are paused or completed before invoking this method for accurate leak detection.
