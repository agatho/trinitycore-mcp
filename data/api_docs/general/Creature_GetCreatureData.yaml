  method: GetCreatureData
  signature: const CreatureData * Creature::GetCreatureData() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the creature data structure containing spawn information for this
    creature instance.
  description: This method retrieves the CreatureData object that contains all the
    essential information about how this creature was spawned, including its spawn
    coordinates, orientation, faction, and other spawn-related parameters. The returned
    data structure is typically used by the game engine to determine how the creature
    should behave based on its spawn configuration. This method is commonly used during
    creature initialization and spawning processes, particularly when dealing with
    dynamic spawn systems or when querying creature-specific data for AI behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the CreatureData structure which contains all the
    spawn information for this creature instance. The returned pointer may be nullptr
    if the creature has not yet been initialized or if it's a temporary creature without
    valid spawn data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Creature* creature = ...;\nCreatureData const* data = creature->GetCreatureData();\n\
      if (data)\n{\n    // Use data->spawnPos.x, data->spawnPos.y, etc.\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during the initialization phase of a creature.
    The returned CreatureData object is usually immutable and should not be modified
    directly. It's important to note that this method may return nullptr if the creature
    has not been properly initialized or if it's a temporary creature without valid
    spawn data.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in scenarios where the creature might
    not have been initialized yet, as it could return a null pointer. Also, avoid
    modifying the returned CreatureData structure directly as it's meant to be immutable.
