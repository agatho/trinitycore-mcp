  method: GetTradeSecurityLevel
  signature: uint8 PlayerbotTradeConfig::GetTradeSecurityLevel()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the trade security level configuration setting for player bot trading
    behavior.
  description: The GetTradeSecurityLevel method returns a uint8 value that represents
    the configured security threshold for player bot trade interactions within the
    TrinityCore framework. This value determines how strictly the bot enforces trade
    rules and restrictions, such as whether to allow trades with players below a certain
    level or with specific reputation states. The returned value typically corresponds
    to predefined security levels (e.g., 0 = no restrictions, 1 = basic checks, 2
    = strict enforcement) that are defined in the playerbot configuration system.
    This method is used internally by the bot's trading logic to make decisions about
    which trades to accept or reject based on the configured security policy.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A uint8 value representing the trade security level, where typical values
    might be: 0 = no restrictions, 1 = basic security checks, 2 = strict enforcement.
    The exact meaning of each level depends on the implementation in the playerbot
    configuration system.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Trade Security Level
    code: "uint8 securityLevel = playerBot->GetTradeSecurityLevel();\nif (securityLevel\
      \ >= 2)\n{\n    // Enable strict trade validation\n    // ... trading logic\
      \ here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PlayerbotTradeConfig class which manages bot-specific
    trading behaviors. The returned value should be interpreted according to the specific
    configuration schema used by the TrinityCore playerbot system, as different installations
    may define custom security level meanings.
