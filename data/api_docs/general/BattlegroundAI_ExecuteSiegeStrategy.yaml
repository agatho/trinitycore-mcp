  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: ExecuteSiegeStrategy
  signature: void BattlegroundAI::ExecuteSiegeStrategy(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the siege strategy for the battleground, handling siege weapon behavior
    and objectives.
  description: The ExecuteSiegeStrategy method is responsible for managing the core
    logic of siege warfare within a battleground environment. This method typically
    handles the activation, deployment, and interaction of siege weapons such as catapults
    or ballistae, including their targeting, damage application, and objective fulfillment.
    It coordinates with the battleground's state management to ensure that siege mechanics
    align with the overall battle progression and win conditions. The method may also
    handle player interactions with siege objects, such as mounting, repairing, or
    destroying siege weapons.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player index or identifier
      involved in the siege strategy execution. This parameter is used to determine
      which player's actions trigger specific siege behaviors or to track player involvement
      in siege objectives.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Siege Strategy Execution
    code: 'void battlegroundAI->ExecuteSiegeStrategy(&playerIndex);

      // Triggers the siege strategy for the specified player index'
    language: cpp
  - title: Siege Strategy with Player Context
    code: 'int playerID = 12345;

      BattlegroundAI* bgAI = GetBattleground()->GetBattlegroundAI();

      bgAI->ExecuteSiegeStrategy(&playerID);

      // Executes siege strategy specific to player ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during battleground updates or when specific
    siege events occur. It may interact with the battleground's objective system and
    requires proper synchronization with the game state to avoid race conditions.
  warnings: Ensure that the player parameter points to a valid player index; passing
    an invalid pointer or uninitialized value can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
