  signature: float LootAnalysis::CalculateAccessoryValue(Player * player, const LootItem
    & item)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the value of a loot item for accessory analysis.
  description: The CalculateAccessoryValue method determines the relative worth of
    a given loot item within the context of accessory evaluation. This function is
    typically used in loot distribution systems to assess item quality and desirability
    for players, particularly when considering accessory items such as rings, necklaces,
    or other equipable accessories. The calculation may take into account factors
    like item level, stats, rarity, and player class preferences. It serves as a core
    component in determining optimal loot allocation strategies during group loot
    sessions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the accessory value is being
      calculated. This parameter is essential as it provides context about the player's
      class, level, and preferences that influence the valuation.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to a LootItem structure representing the specific item
      whose accessory value is to be computed. The item contains information such
      as item ID, stats, and other properties relevant to the valuation process.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated accessory value of the given
    loot item. Higher values indicate more desirable or valuable accessories for the
    specified player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float value = lootAnalysis.CalculateAccessoryValue(player, lootItem);\n\
      if (value > 10.0f) {\n    // Item is considered highly valuable for accessory\
      \ purposes\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Loot Distribution Logic
    code: "float playerValue = lootAnalysis.CalculateAccessoryValue(player, item);\n\
      float otherPlayerValue = lootAnalysis.CalculateAccessoryValue(otherPlayer, item);\n\
      if (playerValue > otherPlayerValue) {\n    // Assign item to current player\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal algorithms that consider player class-specific
    stat preferences, item level scaling, and gear slot requirements. It may also
    factor in server-side loot rules or expansion-specific balancing parameters.
  warnings: Ensure the player and item parameters are valid before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. The returned float value should be interpreted within
    the context of the game's loot system and not used in isolation for critical decisions.
