    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves threat ability data associated with a specific spell ID from the
    database.
  description: The GetAbility method is used to fetch the ThreatAbilityData structure
    that corresponds to a given spell ID within the ThreatAbilitiesDB. This database
    stores information about how various spells affect threat generation and management
    in World of Warcraft's combat system. The method performs a lookup operation using
    the provided spell ID as the key, returning a pointer to the corresponding data
    structure if found. If no matching entry exists for the specified spell ID, the
    method returns a null pointer. This functionality is essential for AI behavior
    scripting and threat management systems that need to understand how different
    abilities influence aggro mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to a ThreatAbilityData structure if an entry exists
    for the given spell ID; otherwise, returns nullptr indicating no data was found
    for the specified spell.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const ThreatAbilityData* ability = threatDB->GetAbility(12345);\nif (ability\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use ability data\n    printf(\"Threat generated: %f\\\
      n\", ability->threatAmount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation which typically uses an internal
    hash map or similar data structure for O(1) average-case performance. The returned
    pointer is guaranteed to be valid only during the lifetime of the ThreatAbilitiesDB
    instance and should not be stored or used beyond that scope.
  warnings: The returned pointer may be null if no threat ability data exists for
    the specified spell ID. Always check for null before dereferencing the result
    to prevent segmentation faults or undefined behavior.
