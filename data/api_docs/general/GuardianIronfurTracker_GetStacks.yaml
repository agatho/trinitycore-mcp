  signature: uint32 GuardianIronfurTracker::GetStacks() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current stack count of the Ironfur buff applied to a guardian.
  description: The GetStacks method returns the number of active stacks of the Ironfur
    ability that is currently affecting the guardian. This method is typically used
    in AI logic or spell handling to determine how many times the buff has been applied,
    which may affect damage reduction, movement speed, or other mechanics tied to
    the buff's stacking behavior. The returned value represents a non-negative integer
    indicating the current stack level of the Ironfur effect.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of stacks currently active on the
    guardian's Ironfur buff. Returns 0 if the buff is not active or has expired.
  examples:
  - title: Check Ironfur Stacks Before Applying Additional Effect
    code: "if (guardian->GetStacks() < MAX_IRONFUR_STACKS)\n{\n    // Apply additional\
      \ Ironfur stack\n    guardian->AddAura(IRONFUR_AURA_ID, guardian);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on a valid Guardian object that has the
    Ironfur ability implemented. The stack count is managed internally by the game's
    aura system and may change based on spell application, removal, or duration events.
