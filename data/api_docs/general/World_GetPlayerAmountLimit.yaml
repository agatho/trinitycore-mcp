  brief: Returns the maximum number of players allowed on the server
  description: The GetPlayerAmountLimit method retrieves the configured player limit
    for the World instance. This value represents the maximum concurrent player connections
    allowed on the server, as defined by the server configuration. The method is typically
    used to enforce server capacity limits and can be queried by various subsystems
    to manage player access and session handling. It returns a uint32 value that corresponds
    to the hard-coded or configuration-defined maximum player count.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of players allowed on the
    server at any given time. This value is typically configured in the server's configuration
    files and represents a hard limit enforced by the World instance.
  examples:
  - title: Check player capacity before allowing new connections
    code: "uint32 maxPlayers = sWorld->GetPlayerAmountLimit();\nuint32 currentPlayers\
      \ = sWorld->GetPlayerCount();\nif (currentPlayers >= maxPlayers)\n{\n    //\
      \ Deny new player connection\n    SendLoginFailedPacket(LOGIN_FAILED_SERVER_FULL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. The returned
    value is typically set during server initialization and does not change during
    runtime unless the configuration is reloaded.
