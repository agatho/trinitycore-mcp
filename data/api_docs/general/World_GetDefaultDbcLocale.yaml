documentation:
  brief: Returns the default locale constant used for DBC file lookups in the world.
  description: This method retrieves the default locale constant that is used throughout
    the TrinityCore server for accessing localized data from DBC (Database Client)
    files. The returned locale constant determines which language version of game
    data will be used for various in-game systems such as item names, creature names,
    and other localized strings. This value is typically initialized during server
    startup based on configuration settings and affects how client requests are processed
    when no specific locale is provided. The method is thread-safe and provides a
    consistent locale identifier across all subsystems that require DBC data access.
  parameters: []
  returns: A LocaleConstant enum value representing the default locale used for DBC
    file lookups. This typically corresponds to one of the standard locale constants
    like LOCALE_en, LOCALE_ko, LOCALE_fr, etc., indicating the language of the default
    client data.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Default DBC Locale
    code: 'LocaleConstant defaultLocale = sWorld->GetDefaultDbcLocale();

      printf("Default DBC locale: %d\n", defaultLocale);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Use Default Locale for Localization
    code: "LocaleConstant defLocale = sWorld->GetDefaultDbcLocale();\nif (defLocale\
      \ == LOCALE_en)\n{\n    // Handle English DBC data\n}\nelse if (defLocale ==\
      \ LOCALE_fr)\n{\n    // Handle French DBC data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The default DBC locale is determined at server startup and typically matches
    the server's configured language setting. This value may be overridden by specific
    client connections or configuration options, but this method always returns the
    global default used for general DBC lookups.
