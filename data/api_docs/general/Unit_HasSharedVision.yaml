  signature: bool Unit::HasSharedVision() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit has shared vision with other units.
  description: This method determines whether a unit has shared vision capabilities
    with other units in the game world. It is commonly used to check if a player or
    creature can see other units that are normally invisible or hidden, such as stealthed
    targets or units with shared vision abilities. The method returns true when the
    unit has shared vision enabled and false otherwise, which is essential for determining
    visibility in combat situations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit has shared vision enabled, false otherwise. This
    indicates that the unit can see other units that would normally be invisible or
    hidden.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->HasSharedVision()) {\n    // Unit can see other units with shared\
      \ vision\n    // Perform visibility-related actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other visibility-related
    methods to determine if a unit can see another unit. It may be affected by various
    game mechanics such as stealth, invisibility, and shared vision abilities. Performance
    considerations are minimal as this is a simple boolean check.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a unit can see another
    unit in combat situations without considering other visibility factors. The method
    does not account for different types of vision or visibility conditions that may
    affect the result.
