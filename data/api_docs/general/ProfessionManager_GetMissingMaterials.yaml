  class: ProfessionManager
  method: GetMissingMaterials
  signature: int ProfessionManager::GetMissingMaterials(int * player, const RecipeInfo
    & recipe) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines the number of missing material resources required to craft a specified
    recipe for a player.
  description: The GetMissingMaterials method evaluates whether a player has all the
    necessary materials to craft a given recipe. It checks against the player's current
    inventory and returns the count of missing items. This method is typically used
    during crafting operations to determine if a player can proceed with a recipe
    or needs to gather additional resources. The method does not modify any state
    but provides essential information for crafting logic validation.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object whose inventory is checked for required
      materials.
  - name: recipe
    description: Reference to a RecipeInfo structure containing details about the
      recipe being evaluated, including required material items and quantities.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of missing material resources.
    A return value of zero indicates that all materials are available; a positive
    integer indicates how many materials are missing.
  examples:
  - title: Check Missing Materials for Crafting
    code: "int missing = professionManager.GetMissingMaterials(&player, recipeInfo);\n\
      if (missing == 0) {\n    // Player can craft the item\n    player.CraftItem(recipeInfo);\n\
      } else {\n    // Notify player about missing materials\n    player.SendNotification(\"\
      Missing %d materials for crafting.\", missing);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's inventory being up-to-date and may not
    account for temporary or conditional item availability. It is recommended to call
    this method before attempting a craft operation to provide immediate feedback
    to the user.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as passing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    Also, be aware that the method only checks for direct item availability and does
    not consider alternative crafting paths or quest-based materials.
