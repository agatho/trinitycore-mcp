  signature: bool SoulShardResource::HasSoulShards(float shards) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player has at least the specified number of soul shards
    available.
  description: The HasSoulShards method determines if a player possesses a minimum
    required amount of soul shards, which are used by warlocks for various abilities
    and spells. This method is typically invoked before casting spells that consume
    soul shards to ensure the player has sufficient resources. The check is performed
    against the current soul shard count stored within the SoulShardResource object.
    It returns true if the available soul shards meet or exceed the specified threshold,
    and false otherwise. This functionality is integral to warlock gameplay mechanics
    where resource management directly affects spell casting capabilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has at least the specified number of soul shards;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (player->GetSoulShardResource()->HasSoulShards(1.0f)) {\n    // Player\
      \ can cast a spell that costs 1 soul shard\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_CONSUME_SHARDS,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spell Casting
    code: "float requiredShards = 3.0f;\nif (player->GetSoulShardResource()->HasSoulShards(requiredShards))\
      \ {\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_SEED_OF_DEATH, true);\n} else {\n \
      \   player->SendSystemMessage(\"Not enough soul shards to cast Seed of Death.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the current soul shard count and does not modify
    it. It's commonly used in conjunction with other resource management functions
    such as GetSoulShards() or SpendSoulShards(). The method assumes that the SoulShardResource
    object is properly initialized and accessible through the player's resource system.
  warnings: Ensure that the SoulShardResource pointer is not null before calling this
    method. Also, be aware that soul shard counts may change during combat or between
    game ticks, so repeated checks might be necessary for critical spell casting decisions.
