    processing. It may involve database queries to fetch reward-related data, and
    should be used carefully in context of quest handling logic. Performance considerations
    include potential database load if called frequently.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect display of rewards or
    missing visual effects for players. Ensure that the quest object is properly initialized
    before calling this method.
