  class: BotTalentManager

  signature: uint32 BotTalentManager::MakeLoadoutKey(uint8 cls, uint8 spec, uint32
    level) const
documentation:
  brief: Creates a unique loadout key based on class, spec, and level for bot talent
    management.
  description: The MakeLoadoutKey method generates a unique 32-bit identifier by combining
    class, specialization, and level information into a single uint32 value. This
    key is used internally by the BotTalentManager to uniquely identify and retrieve
    specific talent loadouts for different bot classes and specs at various levels.
    The method ensures that each combination of class, spec, and level produces a
    distinct key, enabling efficient lookup and management of bot talents within the
    TrinityCore framework. The generated key is typically used as an index or hash
    in internal data structures to store and retrieve precomputed talent build information
    for AI-controlled bots.
  parameters:
  - name: cls
    description: The class identifier (0-11) representing the bot's character class.
      Valid values correspond to standard WoW class IDs.
  - name: spec
    description: The specialization identifier (0-2) representing the bot's talent
      specialization. For most classes, this represents primary, secondary, and tertiary
      specs.
  - name: level
    description: The level of the bot (1-80) used to determine appropriate talent
      points allocation for the loadout key.
  returns: A unique 32-bit integer representing the combined class, spec, and level
    information. This value serves as a lookup key for accessing specific talent loadouts
    in the bot talent management system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: uint32 key = botTalentManager->MakeLoadoutKey(CLASS_WARRIOR, SPEC_PROTECTION,
      60);
    language: cpp
  - title: Generating Multiple Loadout Keys
    code: "for (uint8 cls = 0; cls < MAX_CLASSES; ++cls)\n{\n    for (uint8 spec =\
      \ 0; spec < MAX_SPECS; ++spec)\n    {\n        uint32 key = botTalentManager->MakeLoadoutKey(cls,\
      \ spec, 70);\n        // Use key to store or retrieve talent data\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method uses bit manipulation to pack class (4 bits), spec (2 bits), and
    level (26 bits) into a single uint32 value. This packing strategy allows for efficient
    storage and retrieval of talent loadouts while maintaining uniqueness across all
    valid combinations. The implementation assumes that class values are less than
    16, spec values less than 4, and level values are within reasonable bounds.
  warnings: Ensure that the input parameters are validated before calling this method
    to avoid unexpected behavior due to out-of-range values. The method does not perform
    parameter validation internally, so invalid inputs may produce unexpected key
    combinations.
