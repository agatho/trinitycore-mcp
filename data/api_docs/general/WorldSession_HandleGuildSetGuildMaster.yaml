documentation:
  brief: Sets a new guild master for the player's guild
  description: This method handles the client request to transfer guild leadership
    to another guild member. It validates that the calling player has sufficient permissions
    (guild leader status) and that the target player is a current guild member. The
    method updates the guild's master GUID in the database and broadcasts the change
    to all guild members. This operation requires the player to be in a guild and
    possess the necessary privileges to promote other members.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage when player is guild leader
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleGuildSetGuildMaster(WorldPackets::Guild::GuildSetGuildMaster&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Method implementation checks permissions and updates guild\
      \ master\n    // Sends update to all guild members\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs database operations to persist the new guild master.
    It assumes proper authentication and authorization checks are already performed
    by the calling framework. Thread safety is ensured through session-based locking
    mechanisms.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player has guild leader privileges.
    Attempting to call it without proper permissions will result in no action being
    taken. The target player must actually be a member of the same guild for the operation
    to succeed.
