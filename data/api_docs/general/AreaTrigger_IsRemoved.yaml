  signature: bool AreaTrigger::IsRemoved() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the area trigger has been removed from the world.
  description: The IsRemoved method determines if an AreaTrigger object has been marked
    for removal from the game world. This typically occurs when the trigger's duration
    expires, its conditions are no longer met, or it is explicitly removed by the
    server logic. The method returns true if the area trigger is in a removed state
    and false otherwise. In TrinityCore, area triggers are used for various game mechanics
    such as quest objectives, spell effects, and environmental interactions. This
    check is essential for preventing operations on invalid or expired triggers.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the area trigger has been removed from the world and false
    if it is still active and valid.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if an area trigger is removed before processing
    code: "if (!areaTrigger->IsRemoved()) {\n    // Process the area trigger logic\n\
      \    areaTrigger->HandlePlayerEnter(player);\n} else {\n    // Skip processing\
      \ for removed triggers\n    sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Area trigger\
      \ %u is already removed\", areaTrigger->GetEntry());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsRemoved in a loop to clean up expired triggers
    code: "for (auto& itr : m_areaTriggers) {\n    if (itr.second && itr.second->IsRemoved())\
      \ {\n        // Remove from container and delete\n        m_areaTriggers.erase(itr.first);\n\
      \        delete itr.second;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with area trigger lifecycle
    management. The removal state may be set asynchronously by the server, so it's
    important to check this flag before performing operations that might cause undefined
    behavior. Performance-wise, this is a simple boolean check and should not impact
    performance significantly.
  warnings: Avoid performing operations on area triggers that return true from IsRemoved()
    as they may have been freed or are in an invalid state. Always ensure proper cleanup
    of removed triggers to prevent memory leaks.
