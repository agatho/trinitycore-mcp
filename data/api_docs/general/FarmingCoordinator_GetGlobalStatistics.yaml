  class: FarmingCoordinator
  method: GetGlobalStatistics
  signature: const FarmingStatistics & FarmingCoordinator::GetGlobalStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the global farming statistics for the entire server or world.
  description: The GetGlobalStatistics method provides access to aggregated farming
    data across the entire TrinityCore server instance. This includes overall crop
    yields, player farming activity, resource consumption, and other metrics that
    track the collective farming behavior of all players. The returned FarmingStatistics
    object is a const reference, ensuring that the statistics cannot be modified through
    this interface. This method is typically used for server monitoring, administrative
    oversight, and game balance analysis. The data is updated periodically based on
    farming activities occurring throughout the world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a FarmingStatistics object containing aggregated
    global farming metrics such as total crops harvested, average yield per player,
    resource usage statistics, and other server-wide farming-related data.
  examples:
  - title: Access Global Farming Statistics
    code: 'const FarmingStatistics& stats = farmingCoordinator.GetGlobalStatistics();

      uint32 totalCrops = stats.GetTotalCropsHarvested();

      float averageYield = stats.GetAverageYieldPerPlayer();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a const reference, so modifications to the returned statistics
    object will not affect the actual internal data. The statistics are typically
    updated asynchronously and may not reflect real-time changes. This method is thread-safe
    as it only provides read access to immutable global data.
