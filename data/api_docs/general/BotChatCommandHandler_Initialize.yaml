  signature: void BotChatCommandHandler::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot chat command handler by setting up internal data structures
    and registering available commands.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the BotChatCommandHandler for use by
    constructing necessary internal mappings, loading command definitions, and registering
    all supported bot chat commands with the game's command system. This method must
    be called before any bot chat commands can be processed or executed. It typically
    runs during the server startup phase or when a new bot instance is created. The
    initialization process ensures that all command handlers are properly linked and
    that the handler can correctly parse and execute incoming bot chat messages.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'BotChatCommandHandler handler;

      handler.Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of a BotChatCommandHandler
    instance. Re-initialization may lead to duplicate command registrations or memory
    leaks. The initialization process is typically non-blocking but may involve file
    I/O operations if command definitions are loaded from external sources.
  warnings: Calling Initialize() multiple times without proper cleanup can result
    in undefined behavior. Ensure that all previous command handlers are properly
    unregistered before re-initializing the handler.
