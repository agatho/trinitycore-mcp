documentation:
  brief: Logs the creation of an item as part of a spell effect
  description: The ExecuteLogEffectCreateItem method is responsible for recording
    the creation of an item as a result of a spell effect execution. This method typically
    gets invoked during spell processing when an effect causes an item to be created,
    such as when a spell generates a consumable or loot item. The method handles logging
    this event in the game's audit system, which can be used for debugging, achievement
    tracking, or maintaining game state consistency. It ensures that item creation
    events are properly tracked within the context of spell effects.
  parameters:
  - name: effect
    description: The index or identifier of the spell effect that caused the item
      creation. This parameter determines which effect in the spell's effect list
      triggered the item creation.
  - name: entry
    description: The unique database entry ID of the item being created. This corresponds
      to the item_template entry in the database and identifies the specific item
      type being generated.
  returns: null

    code: "void MySpell::HandleItemCreation()\n{\n    // Assume we're processing a\
      \ spell effect that creates an item\n    int effectIndex = 0;\n    uint32 itemId\
      \ = 12345;\n    \n    // Log the creation of the item as part of the spell effect\n\
      \    ExecuteLogEffectCreateItem(effectIndex, itemId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Item Creation in Custom Spell
    code: "class CustomHealingSpell : public Spell\n{\npublic:\n    void ApplyEffects()\
      \ override\n    {\n        // ... spell logic ...\n        \n        // When\
      \ healing effect creates a potion\n        if (roll > 0.5f)\n        {\n   \
      \         ExecuteLogEffectCreateItem(1, 45678); // Log potion creation\n   \
      \     }\n        \n        // ... more logic ...\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the spell system during effect
    execution. Developers should ensure that the effect index and item entry values
    are valid before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior or database
    inconsistencies.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid effect indices or non-existent item entries
    may result in logging errors or inconsistent game state. Ensure all parameters
    are validated before use, especially in custom spell implementations.
