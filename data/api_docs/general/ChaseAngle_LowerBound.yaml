  class: ChaseAngle
  method: LowerBound
  signature: float ChaseAngle::LowerBound() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the lower bound value of the chase angle configuration.
  description: The LowerBound method retrieves the minimum allowable angle value for
    chase behavior in the AI system. This value defines the smallest angular deviation
    from the target direction that the unit will consider when determining its movement
    path during pursuit. The method is typically used in conjunction with other chase-related
    parameters to control how aggressively an AI unit follows its target while maintaining
    realistic movement patterns. This configuration is crucial for preventing unnatural
    or jittery movement behaviors during combat engagement.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the minimum allowable angle (in degrees) that
    the chase behavior will consider when calculating movement direction relative
    to the target.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float lowerBound = unit->GetChaseAngle()->LowerBound();\n// Use the lower\
      \ bound value for custom AI logic\nif (angle < lowerBound)\n{\n    // Adjust\
      \ movement behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Chase Behavior
    code: "ChaseAngle* chaseAngle = unit->GetChaseAngle();\nfloat lower = chaseAngle->LowerBound();\n\
      float upper = chaseAngle->UpperBound();\n\n// Configure movement constraints\
      \ based on bounds\nif (chaseAngle->GetCurrentAngle() < lower)\n{\n    unit->SetMovementDirection(MovementDirection::BACKWARD);\n\
      }\nelse if (chaseAngle->GetCurrentAngle() > upper)\n{\n    unit->SetMovementDirection(MovementDirection::FORWARD);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI chase behavior system and should be called
    frequently during combat to maintain accurate movement calculations. The returned
    value is typically configured through database entries or AI scripts and may vary
    between different creature types.
  warnings: Ensure that the lower bound is always less than the upper bound, otherwise
    the chase behavior may produce unexpected results. This method should not be used
    in performance-critical sections without caching the result.
