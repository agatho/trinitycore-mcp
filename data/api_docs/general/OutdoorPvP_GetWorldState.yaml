  signature: int OutdoorPvP::GetWorldState(int worldStateId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current value of a specified world state variable used in Outdoor
    PvP systems.
  description: The GetWorldState method retrieves the current integer value associated
    with a specific world state identifier within an OutdoorPvP zone. World states
    are used by TrinityCore's Outdoor PvP system to track various dynamic conditions
    such as control points, faction dominance, or objective progress. This method
    allows scripts and systems to query the current state of these variables without
    modifying them. The returned value typically represents a flag or counter that
    can be used for UI updates, quest progression, or gameplay logic decisions. This
    method is commonly called during zone updates or player interactions with Outdoor
    PvP objectives.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the current value of the specified world
    state. The meaning of this value depends on the specific world state ID being
    queried and is typically used to determine the current status of Outdoor PvP objectives
    or zones.
  examples:
  - title: Querying Control Point Status
    code: "OutdoorPvP* pvp = sOutdoorPvPMgr->GetOutdoorPvP(4190);\nif (pvp)\n{\n \
      \   int controlPointStatus = pvp->GetWorldState(2501); // Example world state\
      \ ID\n    if (controlPointStatus == 1)\n        SendSystemMessage(\"Control\
      \ point is under Alliance control.\");\n    else if (controlPointStatus == 2)\n\
      \        SendSystemMessage(\"Control point is under Horde control.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not modify any state and is safe to call from multiple threads.
    The world state IDs are typically defined in the OutdoorPvP implementation and
    may vary between different Outdoor PvP zones. It's important to validate that
    the OutdoorPvP instance exists before calling this method.
