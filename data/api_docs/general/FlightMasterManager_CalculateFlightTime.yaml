  method: CalculateFlightTime
  signature: uint32 FlightMasterManager::CalculateFlightTime(float distance) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the flight time required for a player to travel a specified distance
    using the FlightMaster system.
  description: The CalculateFlightTime method determines the amount of time, in milliseconds,
    that a player will take to fly a given distance through the game's flight system.
    This calculation is typically used by the FlightMaster service to provide accurate
    travel times for flight paths. The method takes into account various factors such
    as the player's mount speed, flight path mechanics, and potential bonuses or penalties
    from buffs, debuffs, or zone effects. It returns a uint32 value representing the
    total flight time in milliseconds. This method is part of the core flight management
    logic within TrinityCore's AI and game mechanics system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the flight time in milliseconds required
    to travel the specified distance. A return value of 0 typically indicates an invalid
    or zero-distance flight path, while larger values represent longer travel times
    based on the calculated speed and distance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Flight Time Calculation
    code: 'uint32 time = flightMasterManager.CalculateFlightTime(100.0f);

      // Returns estimated flight time in milliseconds for a 100-unit distance'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Calculated Flight Time for UI Display
    code: 'float distance = 500.0f;

      uint32 flightTimeMs = flightMasterManager.CalculateFlightTime(distance);

      uint32 flightTimeSeconds = flightTimeMs / 1000;

      // Display "Estimated travel time: X seconds" to the player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the FlightMaster service and may
    be influenced by player-specific factors such as mount type, speed bonuses, or
    current game state. It assumes that the distance parameter is a valid positive
    value representing units in the game world. The actual flight time calculation
    might involve additional logic for path optimization, terrain effects, or server-side
    modifiers.
  warnings: Ensure that the input distance is validated before calling this method
    to avoid unexpected behavior or division-by-zero errors if the implementation
    relies on distance-based calculations. This method may not account for dynamic
    factors like player movement speed changes during flight in some implementations.
