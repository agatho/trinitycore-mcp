documentation:
  brief: Updates the Monk AI's buff states and applies appropriate healing or damage
    mitigation buffs based on current combat conditions.
  description: The UpdateMonkBuffs method is responsible for managing the application
    and maintenance of all relevant buffs for a Monk AI character. This includes evaluating
    the current combat situation, determining which buffs are most beneficial, and
    applying them accordingly. The method ensures that the Monk maintains optimal
    performance in both damage dealing and support roles by dynamically adjusting
    its buff usage based on target health, threat levels, and available resources.
    It typically integrates with the broader AI decision-making system to prioritize
    buff application over other actions.

    code: "void MyMonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    UpdateMonkBuffs();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should not
    be invoked manually unless specifically required for custom behavior. The implementation
    may involve checking for existing buff durations, comparing against optimal usage
    windows, and ensuring no conflicting buffs are active simultaneously.
