documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new TargetInfo object with default values.
  description: The TargetInfo constructor initializes a new instance of the TargetInfo
    class, setting up internal data structures and default state values. This method
    is typically called when creating a new target tracking object within the TrinityCore
    framework's combat or targeting system. The constructor ensures that all member
    variables are properly initialized to their default states, which may include
    resetting flags, clearing target references, and initializing counters or timers
    used in target management logic. This initialization is crucial for maintaining
    consistent behavior across different game scenarios such as player combat, NPC
    AI targeting, or spell casting mechanics.

  - title: Creating a new TargetInfo instance
    code: 'TargetInfo target;

      // The target object is now initialized with default values

      // Ready to be used for tracking targets in combat or spell casting'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is automatically called when declaring a TargetInfo variable
    on the stack. For dynamic allocation, developers should ensure proper memory management.
    The initialization process may involve setting internal flags and clearing any
    previous target state information.
