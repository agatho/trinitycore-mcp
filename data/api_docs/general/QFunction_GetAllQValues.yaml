documentation:
  brief: Retrieves all quest values associated with the specified state for the current
    quest function.
  description: The GetAllQValues method is used to fetch all quest-related integer
    values that are currently associated with a given state within the QFunction class.
    This method operates on the internal state of the quest function and returns an
    aggregated integer value representing the combined or total quest values for that
    specific state. It's commonly used in World of Warcraft TrinityCore environments
    where quest states and their associated data need to be accessed programmatically.
    The method does not modify any internal state but rather provides read-only access
    to quest-related data based on the provided state parameter.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the combined or total quest values for the
    specified state. Returns zero if no values are associated with the given state,
    or if an error occurs during retrieval.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int questValue = qFunction.GetAllQValues(QUEST_STATE_INCOMPLETE);

      // Returns the total quest value for incomplete quests'
    language: cpp
  - title: State-Based Value Retrieval
    code: "int completeQuests = qFunction.GetAllQValues(QUEST_STATE_COMPLETE);\nif\
      \ (completeQuests > 0) {\n    // Process completed quest values\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Total completed quests: \" << completeQuests << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the internal state management of QFunction is properly
    initialized. The returned value may be a cumulative sum or bitwise combination
    of all quest values for the specified state, depending on the implementation details.
    It's important to note that this method is typically used in conjunction with
    other quest-related APIs within TrinityCore's framework.
  warnings: Ensure that the state parameter passed to this method corresponds to valid
    quest states defined within the TrinityCore quest system. Passing an invalid or
    uninitialized state value may lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect return
    values. This method should not be called on uninitialized QFunction objects.
