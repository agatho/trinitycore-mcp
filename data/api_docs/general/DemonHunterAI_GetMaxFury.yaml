documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum fury value for the Demon Hunter AI.
  description: The GetMaxFury method retrieves the maximum fury amount that can be
    accumulated by a Demon Hunter AI instance. This value represents the upper limit
    of the fury resource, which is used for various abilities and mechanics in the
    Demon Hunter's gameplay loop. The method is typically called during AI decision-making
    processes to determine available fury capacity for ability selection and execution.
    This value may vary based on the Demon Hunter's level, gear, or other game state
    factors that influence fury generation and maximum limits.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the maximum fury value that can be reached by the
    Demon Hunter AI. This value typically ranges from 100 to 120 depending on the
    Demon Hunter's level and equipped items.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int maxFury = demonHunterAI->GetMaxFury();\nif (currentFury >= maxFury)\
      \ {\n    // Execute fury-based ability\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Fury Management
    code: "int maxFury = demonHunterAI->GetMaxFury();\nint currentFury = demonHunterAI->GetFury();\n\
      float furyPercentage = (float)currentFury / maxFury * 100.0f;\nif (furyPercentage\
      \ >= 90.0f) {\n    // Consider using high-cost ability\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Demon Hunter AI system and should only be called
    on valid DemonHunterAI instances. The returned value may change during combat
    if the Demon Hunter's gear or abilities modify their maximum fury capacity.
  warnings: Ensure that the DemonHunterAI instance is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as calling it on an uninitialized or destroyed instance may
    result in undefined behavior.
