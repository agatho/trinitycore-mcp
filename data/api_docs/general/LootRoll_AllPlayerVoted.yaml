  class: LootRoll
  method: AllPlayerVoted
  signature: bool LootRoll::AllPlayerVoted(int & winnerItr)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether all players have voted on a loot roll.
  description: The AllPlayerVoted method checks if every player participating in a
    loot roll has submitted their vote. This is used during the loot rolling process
    to determine when the final winner can be decided. The method returns true once
    all eligible players have voted, and false otherwise. If all players have voted,
    the method also sets the winnerItr parameter to the index of the winning player
    in the list of players who voted. This function is essential for managing the
    loot distribution mechanics in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: winnerItr
    description: Reference to an integer that will be set to the index of the winning
      player if all players have voted. If not all players have voted, this value
      is undefined.
  returns: Returns true if all players have voted on the loot roll; otherwise returns
    false. When true, the winnerItr parameter is updated with the index of the winning
    player.
  examples:
  - title: Check if all players have voted and determine winner
    code: "LootRoll* roll = ...; // Assume a valid LootRoll object\nint winnerIndex;\n\
      if (roll->AllPlayerVoted(winnerIndex)) {\n    printf(\"Winner is player at index\
      \ %d\\n\", winnerIndex);\n} else {\n    printf(\"Not all players have voted\
      \ yet.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the loot rolling process to determine
    when a decision can be made. It's important to note that this method does not
    perform any voting itself; it only checks the current state of votes. The winnerItr
    parameter should only be used when the return value is true.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the winnerItr parameter, as its contents are undefined
    if the method returns false. Always check the return value before attempting to
    use the winnerIndex.
