  class: QuestPickup
  method: SynchronizeGroupQuestProgress
  signature: void QuestPickup::SynchronizeGroupQuestProgress(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Synchronizes quest progress for all group members with the current player's
    quest data.
  description: The SynchronizeGroupQuestProgress method ensures that all players within
    a specified group have their quest progress updated to match the current player's
    state. This is typically used when a player completes a quest or makes progress
    on a quest that should be reflected across the entire group. The method iterates
    through all members of the provided group and updates their individual quest tracking
    data accordingly. It is commonly invoked during quest completion events or when
    group members join or leave a quest-related activity.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players whose quest progress
      needs synchronization. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Synchronize Quest Progress for Group
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (playerGroup)\n{\n    QuestPickup::SynchronizeGroupQuestProgress(playerGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    quest-related events. It assumes that the group pointer is valid and contains
    at least one member. Performance may be impacted when synchronizing large groups,
    as each member's quest data must be individually updated.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed to this method is valid and not null
    before calling. Calling this method with an invalid group pointer will result
    in undefined behavior or crash. This method should only be called when quest progress
    changes need to be propagated to group members.
