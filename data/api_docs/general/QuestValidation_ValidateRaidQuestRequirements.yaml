api:
  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateRaidQuestRequirements
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateRaidQuestRequirements(uint32 questId, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player meets all raid quest requirements for a specified
    quest ID.
  description: The ValidateRaidQuestRequirements method checks if a given player has
    met all necessary conditions to be eligible for a specific raid quest. This includes
    verifying that the player's level, completed quests, faction status, and other
    relevant criteria are satisfied. The method is typically used during quest acceptance
    or validation phases in TrinityCore's quest system to ensure players can only
    take on quests they are properly equipped for within the context of raid content.
    It returns true if all requirements are met, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest being validated. Must correspond
      to a valid raid quest entry in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player whose quest
      requirements are being validated. Cannot be null.
  returns: Returns true if all raid quest requirements are satisfied by the player,
    false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate missing prerequisites, incorrect
    level, or other disqualifying conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to validate a player's eligibility for a raid quest
    code: "if (sQuestValidation->ValidateRaidQuestRequirements(12345, player)) {\n\
      \    // Player can accept the quest\n    player->AddQuest(12345);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Player does not meet requirements\n    player->SendNotification(\"You\
      \ do not meet the requirements for this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a custom quest acceptance handler
    code: "bool OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest) override {\n   \
      \ uint32 questId = quest->GetQuestId();\n    if (!sQuestValidation->ValidateRaidQuestRequirements(questId,\
      \ player)) {\n        player->SendQuestInvalidReason(QUEST_INVALID_REASON_NOT_HAVE_REQ);\n\
      \        return false;\n    }\n    return true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database lookups and checks against the player's
    current state including quest completion status, level requirements, and faction
    alignment. It is recommended to cache results where possible for performance reasons
    in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid before calling this function to
    avoid null pointer dereferences. The method assumes that the questId corresponds
    to a valid raid quest entry; invalid IDs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    validation results.
