  brief: Executes a spell cast operation, handling spell execution and potential validation
    checks
  description: The Spell::cast method performs the core spell execution functionality
    within TrinityCore's spell system. It triggers the spell's casting process including
    any necessary validation checks, cooldown management, and target processing. This
    method is typically invoked when a player or creature initiates a spell cast,
    handling both the immediate execution and potential skipping of certain validation
    checks based on the skipCheck parameter. The method manages the spell's internal
    state and ensures proper execution according to game mechanics and rules.
  parameters:
  - name: skipCheck
    description: When true, bypasses certain validation checks that would normally
      prevent spell casting. When false, performs all standard validation checks including
      mana cost, target requirements, and cooldown restrictions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Casting
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(player, spellId);

      spell->cast(false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Skipping Validation Checks
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(player, spellId);

      spell->cast(true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method internally handles spell cooldowns, mana requirements, and target
    validation. It's designed to be thread-safe when used properly. Performance considerations
    include potential delays from validation checks, especially for spells with complex
    requirements.
  warnings: Improper use of the skipCheck parameter can lead to invalid spell casting
    or game rule violations. The method should not be called directly without proper
    context and initialization of spell objects.
