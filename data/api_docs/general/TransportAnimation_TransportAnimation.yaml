  brief: Moves a TransportAnimation object, transferring ownership of its resources
    to the new instance.
  description: The TransportAnimation move constructor transfers all resources from
    the source TransportAnimation object to the current object. This operation is
    performed efficiently without deep copying of data. After the move, the source
    object is left in a valid but unspecified state, typically with null or default
    values for its internal members. This constructor is part of the C++ move semantics
    implementation and is used primarily when objects need to be transferred between
    containers or returned from functions. In the context of TrinityCore's transport
    system, this allows efficient handling of transport animation data during object
    creation and management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Construction
    code: 'TransportAnimation anim1;

      // ... initialize anim1 ...

      TransportAnimation anim2 = std::move(anim1); // Moves resources from anim1 to
      anim2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move in Function Return
    code: "TransportAnimation createAnimation() {\n    TransportAnimation anim;\n\
      \    // ... initialize animation ...\n    return anim; // Move semantics automatically\
      \ applied\n}\n\nTransportAnimation mainAnim = createAnimation(); // Efficient\
      \ move operation"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a copy constructor. It should only be used
    when the source object will no longer be used. The moved-from object should not
    be accessed after the move operation unless reinitialized.
  warnings: Using the move constructor on an already-moved-from object results in
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the source object is not used afterward, as it
    may contain invalid or dangling references.
