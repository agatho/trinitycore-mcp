  class: CombatStateAnalyzer
  method: NeedsToKite
  signature: bool CombatStateAnalyzer::NeedsToKite() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit should perform a kiting movement during combat.
  description: The NeedsToKite method evaluates the current combat state of a unit
    to determine if it should initiate or continue a kiting behavior. Kiting is a
    tactical maneuver where a unit moves while attacking to maintain optimal distance
    from its target, often used by ranged attackers or when the unit is at a disadvantage.
    This method typically considers factors such as health percentage, target proximity,
    available mana, and combat stance to make this decision. The result influences
    AI behavior decisions related to movement and positioning during encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit's current combat state indicates that kiting behavior
    is necessary or beneficial; otherwise returns false. This typically occurs when
    the unit is low on health, under threat, or when maintaining distance provides
    tactical advantage.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (analyzer.NeedsToKite()) {\n    unit->SetMovementFlag(MOVEFLAG_KITING);\n\
      \    // Initiate kiting behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat state evaluation
    code: "void UnitAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff) {\n    if (combatAnalyzer.NeedsToKite())\
      \ {\n        // Perform kiting logic\n        MoveOutOfMeleeRange();\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the combat state analysis system and should be called
    regularly during AI updates. The decision-making process considers multiple factors
    including unit health, target distance, and resource availability. The implementation
    may vary depending on the specific unit type (player vs NPC) and class-specific
    mechanics.
  warnings: The method assumes that the CombatStateAnalyzer has been properly initialized
    with current combat data. Calling this method without up-to-date combat state
    information may lead to incorrect kiting decisions. Additionally, kiting behavior
    should be combined with other movement logic to avoid unrealistic or harmful AI
    behavior.
