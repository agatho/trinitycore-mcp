  class: MovementIntegration
  method: GetOptimalPosition
  signature: int MovementIntegration::GetOptimalPosition()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal movement position for an entity within
    the game world.
  description: The GetOptimalPosition method determines the best possible location
    for an entity to move to, considering factors such as terrain, obstacles, and
    pathfinding constraints. This method is typically used in AI behavior systems
    to ensure smooth and realistic movement patterns. It evaluates the current state
    of the entity's surroundings and computes a position that minimizes collision
    risks while maintaining efficient navigation through the game world. The result
    is an integer value representing a unique identifier or index for the calculated
    optimal position.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value that represents the identifier or index of the computed
    optimal movement position. This value can be used to reference the specific location
    in subsequent movement operations or pathfinding calculations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Movement
    code: "class EnemyAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateMovement() {\n        int optimalPos\
      \ = movementIntegration.GetOptimalPosition();\n        // Use optimalPos to\
      \ set target position for movement\n        MoveToPosition(optimalPos);\n  \
      \  }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform computationally intensive pathfinding calculations
    depending on the complexity of the environment. It is recommended to cache results
    when possible to avoid repeated expensive operations during high-frequency updates.
  warnings: The returned position identifier should not be directly used for movement
    without validating its accessibility and safety in the current game context. Always
    ensure that the calculated position does not conflict with existing obstacles
    or restricted zones.
