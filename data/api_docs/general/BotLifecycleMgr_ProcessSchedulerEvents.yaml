documentation:
  brief: Processes scheduled events for bot lifecycle management.
  description: The ProcessSchedulerEvents method handles the execution of scheduled
    tasks and events within the bot lifecycle management system. It iterates through
    queued scheduler events and executes them according to their defined timing and
    conditions. This method is typically called during the game loop to ensure that
    bot-related scheduled actions are performed in a timely manner, such as respawn
    triggers, behavior updates, or cleanup operations. The method ensures proper synchronization
    of bot states with the game world's timeline.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // Other update logic...\n    sBotLifecycleMgr->ProcessSchedulerEvents();\n\
      \    // Other update logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to maintain proper
    bot scheduling behavior. It is designed to be thread-safe and does not block other
    operations, though it may perform time-sensitive operations that could affect
    bot responsiveness.
