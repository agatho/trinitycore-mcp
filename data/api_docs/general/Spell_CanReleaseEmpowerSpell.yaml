  signature: bool Spell::CanReleaseEmpowerSpell() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell can release an empowered spell.
  description: This method checks if the current spell instance is capable of releasing
    an empowered version of itself. It typically evaluates whether the spell has the
    necessary conditions, resources, or state to enable empowerment mechanics. The
    method is commonly used in spell processing logic to determine if a spell should
    proceed with empowerment behavior rather than standard execution. This functionality
    is crucial for spells that support empowerment such as those involving mana cost
    reduction, increased damage, or enhanced effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell can release an empowered version; otherwise false
    if the spell cannot release an empowered version due to lack of conditions or
    resources.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spell->CanReleaseEmpowerSpell()) {\n    // Proceed with empowered spell\
      \ logic\n}\nelse {\n    // Execute standard spell logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves checking internal spell state flags, resource
    requirements, and cooldown conditions. Implementation may involve checking if
    the spell has been empowered or if certain preconditions are met before allowing
    empowerment.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with other
    spell-related methods, as incorrect usage can lead to improper spell execution
    or resource consumption. Ensure that the spell's state is properly initialized
    before calling this method.
