  class: BloodDeathKnight
  method: CanUseAbility
  signature: bool BloodDeathKnight::CanUseAbility(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a Blood Death Knight can use a specified ability based
    on current game state and resource requirements.
  description: The CanUseAbility method evaluates if a Blood Death Knight character
    is eligible to cast or activate a specific spell or ability. It checks various
    conditions such as mana, rage, runic power, cooldowns, and other resource constraints
    relevant to the Death Knight class. This method is typically used in AI decision-making
    logic to determine valid actions during combat. The method considers the character's
    current state including buffs, debuffs, and any restrictions imposed by the game
    mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell or ability being checked for usability.
      This corresponds to the Spell.dbc entry ID in the TrinityCore database.
  returns: Returns true if the Blood Death Knight can currently use the specified
    ability, considering all relevant game state conditions and resource requirements.
    Returns false if any condition prevents the ability from being used.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (bloodDK->CanUseAbility(49998)) {\n    // Execute Death Strike\n   \
      \ bloodDK->CastSpell(target, 49998);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Decision Logic
    code: "uint32 abilities[] = { 49998, 50001, 50002 };\nfor (uint32 spellId : abilities)\
      \ {\n    if (bloodDK->CanUseAbility(spellId)) {\n        bloodDK->CastSpell(target,\
      \ spellId);\n        break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used within AI logic and should be called before
    attempting to cast any spell or ability. The implementation may vary depending
    on the specific subclass of Death Knight (Blood, Frost, Unholy). Performance-wise,
    this method performs quick state checks and does not involve heavy computations.
  warnings: Do not assume that a true return value guarantees successful spell casting
    - additional validation may be required for complex abilities. This method does
    not account for target restrictions or line-of-sight requirements beyond basic
    resource availability.
