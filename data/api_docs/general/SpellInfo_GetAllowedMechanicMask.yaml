  method: GetAllowedMechanicMask
  signature: uint64 SpellInfo::GetAllowedMechanicMask() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the mechanic mask that defines which mechanics are allowed for this
    spell.
  description: This method retrieves the allowed mechanic mask for a spell, which
    determines what mechanical effects can be applied to targets of this spell. The
    returned value represents a bitmask where each bit corresponds to a specific mechanic
    type, such as stun, root, or silence. This is used primarily for determining whether
    a spell can affect targets with certain mechanics active, and is crucial for proper
    spell interaction handling in World of Warcraft combat system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint64 value representing the allowed mechanic mask for this
    spell. Each bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific mechanic type,
    allowing developers to determine which mechanics are permitted for this spell's
    effects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint64 mechanicMask = spellInfo->GetAllowedMechanicMask();\nif (mechanicMask\
      \ & MECHANIC_STUN)\n{\n    // This spell can be applied to targets with stun\
      \ mechanic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    to determine compatibility between spells and mechanics. The returned value should
    be interpreted as a bitmask where each bit represents a specific mechanic type.
    Performance considerations are minimal as this is a simple getter method.
  warnings: Care must be taken when interpreting the returned bitmask, as incorrect
    usage can lead to improper spell targeting or mechanics application. This method
    should not be used for determining whether a spell can be applied to targets with
    specific mechanics active - use GetDisallowedMechanicMask() instead.
