  class: BotProfiler
  method: GenerateHotspotAnalysis
  signature: void BotProfiler::GenerateHotspotAnalysis(const int & hotspots, std::string
    & analysis)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a hotspot analysis report for bot behavior profiling
  description: The GenerateHotspotAnalysis method analyzes and compiles data about
    frequently visited locations or areas where bots exhibit specific behaviors. This
    analysis is typically used to identify high-traffic zones, combat hotspots, or
    areas of interest within the game world that may require optimization or monitoring.
    The resulting analysis string contains structured data describing these hotspots,
    their frequency, and associated metrics. The method operates on internal profiling
    data collected by the BotProfiler class and formats it into a human-readable report.
  parameters:
  - name: hotspots
    description: Reference to an integer parameter that determines the number of top
      hotspots to include in the analysis report. This value controls the granularity
      and scope of the generated hotspot data.
  - name: analysis
    description: Reference to a string where the generated hotspot analysis report
      will be stored. The method populates this string with formatted analysis data
      containing hotspot information, visit counts, and related metrics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Hotspot Analysis Generation
    code: 'int hotspotCount = 10;

      std::string analysisReport;

      botProfiler.GenerateHotspotAnalysis(hotspotCount, analysisReport);

      // analysisReport now contains the hotspot analysis for top 10 hotspots'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Dynamic Hotspot Count
    code: 'int dynamicHotspotCount = 25;

      std::string detailedAnalysis;

      botProfiler.GenerateHotspotAnalysis(dynamicHotspotCount, detailedAnalysis);

      // Process the detailed analysis report for further evaluation

      TC_LOG_INFO("bot", "Hotspot Analysis: %s", detailedAnalysis.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on pre-existing profiling data being collected by the
    BotProfiler. The hotspots parameter controls how many top-ranked locations are
    included in the report, with higher values producing more comprehensive but potentially
    less focused analysis. The output format of the analysis string is determined
    by internal implementation and may change between versions.
  warnings: Ensure that sufficient bot activity data has been collected before calling
    this method, as empty or minimal profiling data will result in an incomplete analysis.
    The hotspots parameter should be validated to prevent negative values which could
    cause unexpected behavior.
