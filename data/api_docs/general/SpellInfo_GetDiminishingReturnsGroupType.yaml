documentation:
  brief: Returns the diminishing returns group type for a spell
  description: This method retrieves the diminishing returns group type associated
    with a spell, which determines how the spell interacts with diminishing returns
    mechanics in World of Warcraft. Diminishing returns are applied to certain effects
    like crowd control abilities, and this value defines which group the spell belongs
    to for the purpose of applying these mechanics. The returned value is used to
    determine whether similar spells should be subject to diminishing returns based
    on their group type.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the diminishing returns group type, where
    0 indicates no group, and positive values indicate specific group types that are
    used for applying diminishing returns mechanics. Values typically range from 1-10,
    with higher numbers indicating stronger diminishing returns effects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int groupType = spellInfo->GetDiminishingReturnsGroupType();\nif (groupType\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // This spell belongs to a specific diminishing returns group\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used during spell processing and combat calculations.
    It's important to note that this value is set at compile time based on the spell's
    configuration in the database, and may not be dynamically changeable during runtime.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it directly relates to
    game mechanics that affect player behavior and combat outcomes. Incorrect use
    of diminishing returns group types can lead to improper application of crowd control
    effects or other gameplay elements.
