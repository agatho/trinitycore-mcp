  method: ShouldMaintainRange
  signature: bool SurvivalHunterRefactored::ShouldMaintainRange() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the survival hunter should maintain optimal ranged combat
    distance from the target.
  description: This method evaluates the current combat state and positioning of the
    survival hunter to decide if maintaining or adjusting range is necessary for effective
    gameplay. It considers factors such as the hunter's current distance to the target,
    available abilities, and threat level. The return value indicates whether the
    AI should attempt to adjust its position to maintain an optimal combat range,
    typically used in decision-making loops for movement and ability selection. This
    method plays a crucial role in the survival hunter's tactical behavior during
    combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the hunter should maintain or adjust to an optimal ranged
    distance from the target; false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision loop
    code: "if (hunter->ShouldMaintainRange()) {\n    // Execute logic to move towards\
      \ or away from target\n    hunter->MoveToTarget();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat state evaluation
    code: "class CombatManager {\npublic:\n    void UpdateCombatState(SurvivalHunterRefactored*\
      \ hunter) {\n        if (hunter->ShouldMaintainRange()) {\n            // Adjust\
      \ positioning logic\n            hunter->AdjustPositioning();\n        } else\
      \ {\n            // Continue with current positioning\n            hunter->ContinueAttacking();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI's update cycle to make tactical
    decisions about positioning. It may be influenced by the hunter's current health,
    mana levels, and the presence of specific enemy abilities that affect optimal
    distance.
  warnings: The method should not be used as a standalone indicator for movement actions;
    it must be combined with other tactical checks to ensure proper combat behavior
    and avoid unnecessary movement.
