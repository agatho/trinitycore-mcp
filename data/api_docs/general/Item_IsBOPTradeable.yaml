  class: Item
  method: IsBOPTradeable
  signature: bool Item::IsBOPTradeable() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the item can be traded to other players.
  description: The IsBOPTradeable method checks if an item is bound to a player and
    can be traded to other players. This method evaluates the item's binding status,
    specifically checking if it is bound by soulbind (BOP) or bound by account (BOA),
    and whether it can be traded. Items that are BOP cannot be traded, while items
    that are BOA can be traded. This method is crucial for determining item trading
    eligibility in World of Warcraft's auction house system and player-to-player trading
    mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item can be traded to other players, false otherwise.
    Items with BOP binding cannot be traded, while BOA items can be traded.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByGuid(12345);\nif (item->IsBOPTradeable())\
      \ {\n    // Item can be traded\n} else {\n    // Item cannot be traded\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the item's binding state and is typically used in conjunction
    with other binding checks. It's important to note that items bound by soulbind
    (BOP) are not tradeable, regardless of their other binding status.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it directly affects trading mechanics.
    Items that are BOP cannot be traded even if they are not bound by account (BOA).
