  class: IManagerBase
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool IManagerBase::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the manager base instance and prepares it for use within the
    TrinityCore framework.
  description: The Initialize method is responsible for setting up the internal state
    of an IManagerBase implementation. This typically involves allocating resources,
    registering callbacks, initializing subsystems, or performing any necessary setup
    required for the manager to function correctly. The method should be called once
    during the application's startup sequence before the manager is used. It returns
    true if initialization was successful and false otherwise, allowing callers to
    detect and handle initialization failures gracefully.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the manager was successfully initialized, false if initialization
    failed or was already completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Check
    code: "IManagerBase* manager = new SomeManagerImplementation();\nif (manager->Initialize())\
      \ {\n    // Manager is ready for use\n    printf(\"Manager initialized successfully\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n    printf(\"Failed to\
      \ initialize manager\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called only once during the lifetime of a manager
    instance. It should not be invoked again after successful initialization unless
    there's a specific reset mechanism implemented. The method may perform operations
    that are expensive or blocking, so it's recommended to call it during application
    startup rather than at runtime.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to undefined
    behavior or resource leaks. Ensure all dependencies required by the manager are
    available before calling this method. Some managers might require specific context
    or environment setup before initialization can succeed.
