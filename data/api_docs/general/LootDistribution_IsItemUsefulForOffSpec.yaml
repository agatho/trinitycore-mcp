  class: LootDistribution
  method: IsItemUsefulForOffSpec
  signature: bool LootDistribution::IsItemUsefulForOffSpec(Player * player, const
    LootItem & item)
documentation:
  brief: Determines if a loot item is useful for a player's off-spec specialization.
  description: The IsItemUsefulForOffSpec method evaluates whether a given loot item
    provides meaningful benefit to a player when considering their secondary (off-spec)
    specialization. This method is typically used during loot distribution to help
    determine optimal item allocation among group members with different roles or
    specializations. It considers factors such as item type, stats, and the player's
    current specialization setup to assess usefulness for off-spec purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose off-spec usefulness is being evaluated
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing information about
      the item being assessed
  returns: Returns true if the item provides meaningful benefit for the player's off-spec
    specialization, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in loot distribution
    code: "if (lootDist.IsItemUsefulForOffSpec(player, lootItem)) {\n    // Item is\
      \ useful for off-spec, consider giving it to this player\n    player->AddItem(lootItem.itemTemplate);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with group loot logic
    code: "void DistributeLoot(Player* player, LootItem& item) {\n    if (lootDist.IsItemUsefulForOffSpec(player,\
      \ item)) {\n        // Give item to player for off-spec benefit\n        player->AddItem(item.itemTemplate);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Item not useful for off-spec, pass to next eligible\
      \ player\n        PassLootToNextPlayer(player, item);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the loot distribution system and is typically called
    during group loot scenarios where items are distributed based on specialization
    roles. The implementation likely considers item class, stat types (e.g., agility
    vs. intellect), and player's current spec to make decisions.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer and LootItem reference are valid before
    calling this method to avoid undefined behavior. This method may not account for
    all edge cases in complex specialization setups or custom loot rules.
