  signature: void BattlePetMgr::GrantBattlePetExperience(int guid, int xp, BattlePetXpSource
    xpSource)
documentation:
  brief: Grants experience points to a battle pet based on the provided GUID and XP
    source.
  description: The GrantBattlePetExperience method is used to provide experience points
    to a specific battle pet within the World of Warcraft Battle Pet system. It takes
    the unique identifier (GUID) of the battle pet, the amount of experience points
    to grant, and the source of the experience as parameters. This method is typically
    invoked when a battle pet wins a battle or completes a quest that awards experience.
    The XP source helps determine how the experience is applied and whether it contributes
    to leveling up the pet or other game mechanics such as skill improvements.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the battle pet to which experience
      points will be granted. This value identifies a specific pet instance within
      the game world.
  - name: xp
    description: The amount of experience points to grant to the battle pet. This
      is typically a positive integer representing the XP reward.
  - name: xpSource
    description: An enumeration or flag indicating the source of the experience points,
      such as 'Battle', 'Quest', or 'Training'. This affects how the experience is
      processed and applied to the pet.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Grant XP from a battle victory
    code: battlePetMgr->GrantBattlePetExperience(12345, 100, BattlePetXpSource::BATTLE);
    language: cpp
  - title: Grant XP for completing a quest
    code: battlePetMgr->GrantBattlePetExperience(67890, 250, BattlePetXpSource::QUEST);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal battle pet data structures and
    may trigger UI updates or level-up events when sufficient XP is accumulated. It's
    important to ensure that the GUID corresponds to an active and valid battle pet
    before calling this function.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in
    undefined behavior or errors within the Battle Pet system. Always validate the
    existence of a battle pet before granting experience points.
