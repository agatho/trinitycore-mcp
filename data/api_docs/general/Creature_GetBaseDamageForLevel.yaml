  class: Creature
  method: GetBaseDamageForLevel
  signature: float Creature::GetBaseDamageForLevel(uint8 level) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the base damage value for a creature at the specified level.
  description: This method retrieves the base damage value for a creature based on
    its level, which is used in calculating the creature's damage output. The method
    takes into account the creature's level and returns a float representing the base
    damage range. This functionality is essential for determining creature behavior
    in combat and is typically used when calculating damage values for creatures at
    different levels. The method is part of the general creature API and is commonly
    used in game mechanics calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the base damage range for the creature
    at the specified level. The value may be zero or negative if the creature's level
    is below the minimum threshold, or it may represent a specific damage range depending
    on the creature's type and level.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float damage = creature->GetBaseDamageForLevel(10);

      // This returns the base damage for a level 10 creature'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other damage calculation
    methods to determine overall creature damage output. It may be subject to changes
    based on game balance updates and should be used carefully when calculating damage
    values.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it may return zero or negative
    values if the creature's level is below minimum thresholds, potentially leading
    to incorrect damage calculations.
