  signature: void QuestCompletion::ExecuteEfficientStrategy(Player * bot, QuestProgressData
    & progress)
documentation:
  brief: Executes an efficient quest completion strategy for a player bot, updating
    quest progress data.
  description: The ExecuteEfficientStrategy method is designed to optimize and execute
    quest completion logic specifically for player bots within the TrinityCore framework.
    It processes the current quest progress data of a specified bot player, applying
    optimized handling to ensure efficient quest advancement without unnecessary resource
    consumption. This method typically integrates with the AI system to determine
    optimal actions based on available quest data and player state. The strategy execution
    may involve checking quest requirements, managing quest objectives, and updating
    the player's quest progress accordingly. It is intended for use in automated quest
    completion systems where performance and efficiency are critical.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will execute
      the quest completion strategy. Must be a valid player instance with active quest
      data.
  - name: progress
    description: Reference to QuestProgressData structure containing current quest
      progress information for the bot. This data is modified in-place during strategy
      execution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecuteEfficientStrategy
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Get bot player instance

      QuestProgressData progress;

      // Initialize progress data with current quest state

      questCompletion.ExecuteEfficientStrategy(bot, progress);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI quest system
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateQuestCompletion()\n{\n    Player* bot = GetBot();\n \
      \   QuestProgressData progress = bot->GetQuestStatus();\n    questCompletion.ExecuteEfficientStrategy(bot,\
      \ progress);\n    // Process updated quest status\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the automated quest completion system and should be
    called within appropriate AI update cycles. The method modifies the QuestProgressData
    in-place, so any external references to this data should be refreshed after execution.
    Performance optimization is achieved by minimizing redundant checks and focusing
    only on active quests.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter is a valid player instance before calling
    this method, as passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. The
    progress data must be properly initialized with current quest information to avoid
    incorrect strategy execution.
