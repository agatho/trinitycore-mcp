  method: UpdatePredictionAccuracy
  signature: void PlayerPatternRecognition::UpdatePredictionAccuracy()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the accuracy of pattern predictions for player behavior analysis.
  description: The UpdatePredictionAccuracy method recalculates and refines the predictive
    model's accuracy based on recent player actions and observed patterns. This method
    is typically invoked during gameplay to dynamically adjust AI behavior prediction
    models, ensuring that NPC responses and actions remain realistic and contextually
    appropriate. It processes incoming data from player interactions, updates internal
    statistical models, and adjusts confidence levels in predicted outcomes. The method
    does not require any explicit parameters as it operates on the instance's internal
    state and recent activity logs.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameUpdate()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    playerPatternRecognition->UpdatePredictionAccuracy();\n\
      \    // ... continue with AI updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Action Handler
    code: "void HandlePlayerMovement(Player* player)\n{\n    // Process movement logic\n\
      \    playerPatternRecognition->UpdatePredictionAccuracy();\n    // Use updated\
      \ accuracy for AI decision making\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is performance-sensitive and should be called judiciously during
    game updates. It relies on recent player behavior data stored in the instance's
    internal buffers, so frequent calls without sufficient data may result in suboptimal
    accuracy adjustments.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without adequate data accumulation
    may lead to unstable prediction models. Ensure that sufficient player interaction
    data is available before invoking this method for meaningful accuracy improvements.
