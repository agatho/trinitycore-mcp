documentation:
  brief: Destroys an ExampleManager instance and cleans up associated resources
  description: The destructor for the ExampleManager class is responsible for properly
    cleaning up all dynamically allocated memory and resources that were managed by
    this instance. In TrinityCore's context, this typically involves releasing references
    to objects, clearing internal data structures, and ensuring no memory leaks occur
    when the manager is no longer needed. The destructor is automatically called when
    an ExampleManager object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of ExampleManager
    code: 'ExampleManager* manager = new ExampleManager();

      // ... use the manager ...

      delete manager; // Triggers ~ExampleManager()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic destruction via stack allocation
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    ExampleManager manager; // Constructor called\n\
      \    // ... use manager ...\n} // ~ExampleManager() automatically called here"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should be declared as virtual if this class is intended to
    be inherited from, ensuring proper cleanup of derived class members. In TrinityCore's
    architecture, destructors often need to handle cleanup of database connections,
    memory pools, or other system resources that may have been allocated during the
    object's lifetime.
