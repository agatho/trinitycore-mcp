  class: LFGGroupCoordinator
  method: TrackTeleport
  signature: void LFGGroupCoordinator::TrackTeleport(int playerGuid, uint32 dungeonId,
    uint32 timestamp)
documentation:
  brief: Tracks a player's teleportation event to a specific dungeon with associated
    timestamp.
  description: The TrackTeleport method records teleportation data for a player entering
    a specific dungeon. It logs the player's GUID, the dungeon identifier, and the
    timestamp of the teleport event. This functionality is typically used within the
    LFG (Looking For Group) system to monitor player movement and group coordination
    during dungeon encounters. The method likely updates internal tracking structures
    or databases to maintain accurate records of player activities for group matching,
    cooldown management, or quest progression purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who teleported. This is
      typically a 32-bit integer representing the player's database entry.
  - name: dungeonId
    description: The identifier of the dungeon the player teleported to. This corresponds
      to the dungeon template ID used in the game's database.
  - name: timestamp
    description: The Unix timestamp indicating when the teleportation occurred. This
      is usually a 32-bit unsigned integer representing seconds since epoch.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic teleport tracking example
    code: 'LFGGroupCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.TrackTeleport(123456, 7890, 1678886400);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger LFG system that manages group formation
    and tracking. The timestamp parameter suggests this data may be used for cooldown
    calculations or event logging. Implementation details may involve thread-safe
    operations since multiple players could teleport simultaneously.
