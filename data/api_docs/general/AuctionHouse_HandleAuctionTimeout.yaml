  signature: void AuctionHouse::HandleAuctionTimeout(uint32 auctionId)
documentation:
  brief: Processes the timeout of an auction item in the auction house system
  description: The HandleAuctionTimeout method is responsible for managing the expiration
    of auctions within the TrinityCore auction house system. When an auction reaches
    its time limit without being purchased, this method is invoked to handle the cleanup
    process. It typically removes the auction from the active listings, refunds the
    bidder's deposit if applicable, and updates the auction database state. This method
    ensures that expired auctions are properly managed according to World of Warcraft's
    auction house mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: auctionId
    description: The unique identifier of the auction that has timed out. This value
      corresponds to the AuctionHouseEntry ID in the database and is used to locate
      and process the specific expired auction.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AuctionHouse* ah = sAuctionHouseMgr;

      ah->HandleAuctionTimeout(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Auction Timeout Event
    code: "void OnAuctionTimeout(uint32 auctionId)\n{\n    AuctionHouse* ah = sAuctionHouseMgr;\n\
      \    if (ah)\n        ah->HandleAuctionTimeout(auctionId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the auction house system when
    an auction's time limit expires. Developers should ensure that the auction ID
    passed to this method is valid and corresponds to an existing auction entry in
    the database to prevent undefined behavior or database corruption.
  warnings: Passing an invalid auctionId to this method may result in database inconsistencies
    or crashes. Always validate that the auction exists before calling this method.
    This method modifies database state, so it should be used carefully in performance-critical
    code paths.
