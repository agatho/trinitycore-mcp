  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: IsGroupThreatStable
  signature: bool ThreatCoordinator::IsGroupThreatStable() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the threat situation within a group is currently stable.
  description: The IsGroupThreatStable method evaluates the current state of threat
    distribution among group members in a World of Warcraft instance. It returns true
    if the group's threat dynamics are considered stable, meaning no single member
    has accumulated significantly more threat than others to the point of causing
    potential aggro issues or combat imbalance. This method is typically used by the
    AI system to make decisions about when it's safe to switch targets or when threat
    management needs intervention. The stability check considers factors such as threat
    deltas between group members and overall threat distribution variance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group's threat situation is considered stable, indicating
    that no single member has excessive threat compared to others. Returns false if
    threat distribution is unstable, suggesting potential for aggro issues or combat
    imbalance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Stability Check
    code: "if (threatCoordinator->IsGroupThreatStable()) {\n    // Proceed with normal\
      \ combat behavior\n    unit->CastSpell(target, SPELL_NORMAL_ATTACK);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Adjust threat management strategy\n    threatCoordinator->ManageGroupThreat();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Making
    code: "class CombatAI {\npublic:\n    void Update() {\n        if (threatCoordinator->IsGroupThreatStable())\
      \ {\n            // Safe to perform actions that might shift threat\n      \
      \      DoSafeCombatAction();\n        } else {\n            // Avoid actions\
      \ that could destabilize threat further\n            DoDefensiveAction();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in the context of group-based combat AI where
    maintaining balanced threat distribution is crucial for optimal gameplay. The
    implementation likely involves comparing threat values across all group members
    and determining if any individual exceeds a defined threshold that would be considered
    unstable.
  warnings: Using this method without proper context may lead to incorrect combat
    decisions. The definition of 'stable' can vary based on the specific encounter
    mechanics and difficulty level, so results should be interpreted within the appropriate
    game context.
