  method: GetVisibleAppearanceModId
  signature: uint16 Item::GetVisibleAppearanceModId(const Player * owner) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the modifier ID associated with the visible appearance of an item
    for a specific player.
  description: This method retrieves the modifier ID that determines how an item appears
    to a particular player, based on their character's appearance settings. The returned
    value represents the visual modification applied to the item's display, which
    may include cosmetic enhancements such as enchantment effects or appearance changes.
    This is used primarily in determining how items are visually presented to players
    during gameplay, particularly when items are equipped or displayed in character
    inventory slots.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint16 value representing the modifier ID for the visible appearance
    of the item. This value typically corresponds to an enchantment or appearance
    effect that modifies how the item appears to the owner player, and may be zero
    if no visible modification is applied.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint16 modId = item->GetVisibleAppearanceModId(player);\nif (modId > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Item has a visible appearance modifier\n    // Handle accordingly\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other item display-related
    functions to determine how items are visually presented to players. It may be
    influenced by player's character settings or game mechanics such as enchantment
    effects and appearance changes.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly for determining item quality or
    type, as it only affects visual appearance and not the actual item properties.
    Be cautious when using this in scenarios where item modifications are involved,
    as incorrect handling may lead to visual inconsistencies.
