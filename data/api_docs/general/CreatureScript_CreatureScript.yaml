  class: CreatureScript
  method: CreatureScript
  signature: void CreatureScript::CreatureScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a CreatureScript instance with the specified name for use in
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore AI system.
  description: The CreatureScript constructor is used to initialize a creature AI
    script instance with a unique name identifier. This name is crucial for the TrinityCore
    framework to properly register and associate the script with specific creatures
    in the game world. The constructor sets up internal data structures required for
    AI behavior management, including linking the script to the global AI registry.
    When a creature with matching entry ID is spawned, the framework will automatically
    instantiate this script if it has been correctly registered. This constructor
    should only be called during server initialization or script registration phase,
    not during runtime execution.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated string that uniquely identifies this creature AI
      script. This name must be globally unique across all registered scripts and
      is used by the TrinityCore framework to associate the script with specific creature
      entries in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic CreatureScript Initialization
    code: "class MyCustomCreatureAI : public CreatureScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyCustomCreatureAI()\
      \ : CreatureScript(\"MyCustomCreatureAI\") {}\n\n    // AI implementation here\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering Custom Creature Script
    code: "void AddSC_my_custom_creature()\n{\n    new MyCustomCreatureAI();\n}\n\n\
      // In your .cpp file that registers scripts\nvoid AddSC_example_scripts()\n\
      {\n    new MyCustomCreatureAI(); // Registers the script with name \"MyCustomCreatureAI\"\
      \n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The name parameter is used internally by TrinityCore's AI system to maintain
    a registry of available scripts. It should match exactly with the name specified
    in creature_template's AIName field for proper functionality. The constructor
    does not perform any runtime operations but prepares the script for registration
    and future instantiation when creatures are created.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor multiple times with the same name as it may
    cause registry conflicts or undefined behavior. Ensure that the name parameter
    is a valid, unique string that doesn't contain special characters that could interfere
    with internal framework parsing. Never instantiate CreatureScript directly; always
    derive from it and call the base constructor.
