    This includes initializing profession skills, unlocking appropriate profession
    nodes, setting up specialization-specific profession requirements, and ensuring
    proper integration with the character's Demon Hunter class mechanics. The method
    is typically called during character creation or when a player switches to the
    Demon Hunter class, ensuring that all profession-related systems are properly
    configured for the Demon Hunter's unique gameplay requirements.

      \    // Profession systems are now ready for Demon Hunter\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the character has been fully initialized
    with Demon Hunter class data. The method performs several database operations
    and internal state updates that may impact performance if called frequently during
    gameplay.
  warnings: Do not call this method on non-Demon Hunter characters as it may cause
    undefined behavior or corruption of profession data. Ensure all prerequisite systems
    (like class initialization) are completed before calling this method.
