documentation:
  brief: Loads localized quest objective data from the database into memory for use
    in the game client.
  description: The LoadQuestObjectivesLocale method is responsible for loading localized
    strings associated with quest objectives from the database tables. This method
    ensures that quest descriptions, objective texts, and related localization data
    are properly loaded into memory so that players can see correctly translated content
    based on their locale settings. It typically runs during server startup or when
    locale changes occur, populating internal data structures used by the quest system
    to display localized information. The method does not take any parameters and
    performs its operations internally using database queries and data management
    functions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadData()\n{\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadQuestObjectivesLocale();\n\
      \    // Other loading operations...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or when updating
    locale settings. It may involve database queries that could impact startup time
    depending on the number of localized quest objectives in the database. The method
    should only be called after the database connection is established and the necessary
    tables are populated.
  warnings: This method should not be called before the database has been initialized,
    as it will fail to load any data. Additionally, calling this method repeatedly
    during runtime may cause memory leaks or duplicate entries if not properly managed.
