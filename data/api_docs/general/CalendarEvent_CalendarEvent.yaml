documentation:
  brief: Moves a calendar event object to another location in memory, transferring
    ownership of its resources.
  description: The CalendarEvent constructor taking an rvalue reference serves as
    a move constructor for the CalendarEvent class. It transfers the internal state
    and resources from the source CalendarEvent object to the newly constructed object,
    leaving the source object in a valid but unspecified state. This is typically
    used when creating new calendar events by transferring existing ones, avoiding
    unnecessary copying of potentially large data structures. The method is part of
    the standard C++ move semantics implementation for the class, enabling efficient
    resource management in scenarios involving temporary objects or explicit move
    operations.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to an existing CalendarEvent object whose resources
      will be moved to this new instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing a Calendar Event
    code: 'CalendarEvent event1;

      // ... initialize event1 ...

      CalendarEvent event2 = std::move(event1); // Move constructor called here'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Move in Container Operations
    code: 'std::vector<CalendarEvent> events;

      CalendarEvent newEvent;

      events.push_back(std::move(newEvent)); // Efficiently moves newEvent into vector'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is automatically generated by the compiler if not explicitly
    defined, but may be explicitly implemented for performance reasons. After a move
    operation, the source object should not be used in any way that requires its previous
    state, as it will be left in a valid but unspecified state.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after a move operation results in undefined
    behavior. Always ensure that the source object is not accessed or modified after
    being moved from.
