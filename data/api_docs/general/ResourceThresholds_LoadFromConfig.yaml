  brief: Initializes resource thresholds from configuration settings.
  description: The LoadFromConfig method reads and applies resource threshold values
    from the TrinityCore configuration system. This method is typically called during
    server startup or configuration reload to ensure that all resource-related thresholds
    (such as health, mana, rage, energy, etc.) are properly initialized according
    to the defined settings in the config files. It updates internal state variables
    within the ResourceThresholds class based on the loaded configuration values.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ResourceThresholds thresholds;

      thresholds.LoadFromConfig();

      // Resource thresholds are now initialized from config'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the configuration system has been
    properly initialized. It's typically invoked during server initialization or when
    configuration changes are detected and need to be reloaded.
