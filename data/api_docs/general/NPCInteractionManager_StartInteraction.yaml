  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: StartInteraction
  signature: bool NPCInteractionManager::StartInteraction(Creature * npc)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates an interaction with a specified NPC for the player.
  description: 'The StartInteraction method begins a dialogue or interaction sequence
    with a given Creature (NPC) object. It typically handles the setup of interaction
    state, triggers relevant quest events, and prepares the game client to display
    appropriate UI elements such as gossip options or quest accept dialogs. This method
    is commonly used in player-NPC interaction systems where the player''s actions
    need to initiate specific NPC behaviors or responses. The method returns true
    if the interaction was successfully initiated, false otherwise. Precondition:
    The Creature pointer must be valid and represent an active NPC within the game
    world.'
  parameters:
  - name: npc
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the NPC with which the
      interaction should begin. Must not be null and must point to a valid, spawned
      NPC in the current map.
  returns: Returns true if the interaction was successfully started with the provided
    NPC; returns false if the interaction could not be initiated due to invalid input
    or internal state issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic NPC Interaction Start
    code: "if (player->GetNPCInteractionManager()->StartInteraction(npc)) {\n    //\
      \ Interaction started successfully\n    player->SendGossipMenu(12345, npc->GetGUID());\n\
      } else {\n    // Failed to start interaction\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Cannot interact with this NPC.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's AI and interaction system. It relies
    on proper initialization of the NPC's gossip and quest data. The method may internally
    call other subsystems like QuestManager or GossipHandler to complete the interaction
    process.
  warnings: Ensure that the Creature pointer passed into StartInteraction is valid
    and not destroyed before the interaction completes. Passing a null or invalid
    pointer will likely cause undefined behavior or crashes.
