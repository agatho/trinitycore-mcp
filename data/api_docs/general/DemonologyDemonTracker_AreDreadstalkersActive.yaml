  signature: bool DemonologyDemonTracker::AreDreadstalkersActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if any dreadstalkers are currently active for the demonology warlock.
  description: The AreDreadstalkersActive method determines whether any dreadstalker
    pets are currently summoned and active for the demonology warlock. This method
    is typically used in spell and ability logic to check if dreadstalkers are available
    for use, such as when determining if certain abilities can be cast or if specific
    effects should trigger. The method returns true if at least one dreadstalker is
    active, and false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper
    game state and ensuring correct behavior of warlock abilities that depend on dreadstalker
    presence.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if any dreadstalkers are currently active and summoned; returns
    false if no dreadstalkers are active or summoned.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Logic
    code: "if (player->GetDemonologyDemonTracker()->AreDreadstalkersActive()) {\n\
      \    // Apply dreadstalker-based effects\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_DREADSTALKER_DAMAGE,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Before Casting Ability
    code: "if (!player->GetDemonologyDemonTracker()->AreDreadstalkersActive()) {\n\
      \    // Handle case where dreadstalkers are not active\n    player->SendSpellFailed(SPELL_FAILED_NO_DREADSTALKERS);\n\
      \    return;\n}\n// Proceed with ability execution"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of pet states within the DemonologyDemonTracker
    class. It should be called only when the player has a valid demonology warlock
    character with access to dreadstalker abilities. The method does not account for
    temporary removals or debuffs that might affect dreadstalker activity.
  warnings: This method may return false if dreadstalkers are summoned but in an inactive
    state (e.g., due to being commanded to stay). It is recommended to also check
    the pet's actual status using other methods like GetDreadstalkerCount() or IsPetActive()
    for more comprehensive validation.
