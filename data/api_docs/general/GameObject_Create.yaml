documentation:
  brief: Creates a game object with specified entry, position, rotation, and other
    parameters
  description: The GameObject::Create method initializes a new game object instance
    within the World of Warcraft environment. It allows developers to spawn objects
    with specific properties including entry ID, position coordinates, rotation quaternion,
    animation progress, state, art kit, and dynamic flags. This method is essential
    for creating interactive world objects such as doors, chests, or other environmental
    elements that can be placed in various maps. The method supports both static and
    dynamic object creation, enabling developers to control whether the object behaves
    as a static or dynamic entity within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The entry ID of the game object to create, which corresponds to the
      database entry in the gameobject_template table. This determines what type of
      object is created.
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the map ID where the object will be created. This parameter
      can be null if the object is to be placed in a specific map, or it can be used
      to specify which map the object belongs to.
  - name: pos
    description: Reference to position coordinates (x, y, z) where the object will
      be placed. This defines the exact location in the world where the object appears.
  - name: rotation
    description: QuaternionData representing the rotation of the object in 3D space.
      This controls how the object is oriented in the world.
  - name: animProgress
    description: Animation progress value that determines how much of the animation
      has been completed for the object. This can be used to set specific animation
      states.
  - name: goState
    description: The state of the game object, which defines whether it's active or
      inactive. This parameter controls the object's behavior in the world.
  - name: artKit
    description: Art kit ID used to define visual appearance of the object. This determines
      how the object looks in the game world.
  - name: dynamic
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the object is dynamic or static.
      Dynamic objects can change state and behavior, while static objects remain fixed.
  - name: spawnid
    description: Spawn ID used to identify the specific spawn point for the object.
      This allows developers to track and manage object spawns within the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the object was successfully created, false otherwise. A
    return value of false indicates that the creation failed due to invalid parameters
    or other issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic GameObject Creation
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      bool success = go->Create(12345, &mapId, pos, rotation, 0, 1, 0, true, 1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced GameObject Creation with Rotation
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      QuaternionData rotation;

      rotation.w = 1.0f;

      rotation.x = 0.0f;

      rotation.y = 0.0f;

      rotation.z = 0.0f;

      bool success = go->Create(12345, &mapId, pos, rotation, 50, 2, 100, false, 2);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it requires proper initialization
    of object parameters. It is recommended to use this method only when the object
    is properly initialized and ready for creation. The method may not work correctly
    if parameters are invalid or if the object is already created.
  warnings: The method requires that all parameters be valid and properly initialized.
    If any parameter is invalid, the method will return false. Additionally, creating
    objects with invalid entry IDs can cause errors in the game world.
