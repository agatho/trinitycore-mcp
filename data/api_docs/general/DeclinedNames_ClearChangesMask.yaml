  class: DeclinedNames
  method: ClearChangesMask
  signature: void DeclinedNames::ClearChangesMask()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of declined names, resetting modification flags.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with declined names. This operation typically clears any flags that indicate which
    parts of the declined name structure have been modified since the last synchronization
    or save. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this is used to manage
    the state of player character declined names, ensuring that only relevant portions
    are updated when saving data to the database. The method does not take any parameters
    and performs no return operations. It is commonly invoked after a successful save
    operation to ensure that subsequent changes can be properly tracked.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing Changes Mask After Saving Declined Names
    code: 'DeclinedNames declinedNames;

      // ... populate declined names ...

      // Save to database

      // ... perform save operation ...

      declinedNames.ClearChangesMask(); // Reset changes mask after successful save'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core system when saving
    declined names to prevent redundant updates. Developers should be aware that calling
    this method prematurely may cause subsequent change detection to fail, potentially
    leading to missed updates.
  warnings: Calling ClearChangesMask without first ensuring that changes have been
    properly saved may result in data loss or inconsistent state. Always verify that
    the underlying data has been successfully committed before clearing the mask.
