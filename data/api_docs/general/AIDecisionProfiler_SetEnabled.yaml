  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::SetEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the AI decision profiling functionality.
  description: The SetEnabled method controls whether the AIDecisionProfiler collects
    and logs performance data for AI decisions within the TrinityCore server. When
    enabled, this profiler tracks timing and decision-making processes of AI-controlled
    creatures, providing valuable insights for debugging and optimization. The profiler
    can be toggled at runtime to allow dynamic monitoring without requiring a server
    restart. This functionality is typically used by developers and administrators
    to analyze AI behavior and performance bottlenecks in game entities.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      the AI decision profiling. When true, profiling data will be collected; when
      false, profiling is suspended.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable AI Decision Profiling
    code: AIDecisionProfiler::SetEnabled(true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable AI Decision Profiling
    code: AIDecisionProfiler::SetEnabled(false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    profiler state change takes effect immediately upon calling the method. Profiling
    data is typically stored in memory and may be flushed to logs or files depending
    on server configuration.
