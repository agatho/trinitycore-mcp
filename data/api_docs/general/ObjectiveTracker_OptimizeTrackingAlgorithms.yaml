  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: OptimizeTrackingAlgorithms
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::OptimizeTrackingAlgorithms()
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the tracking algorithms used by the objective tracker to improve
    performance and reduce resource consumption.
  description: The OptimizeTrackingAlgorithms method is responsible for refining and
    enhancing the internal tracking mechanisms of the ObjectiveTracker class. This
    method likely re-evaluates active objectives, adjusts their update frequencies,
    and streamlines data processing to ensure efficient operation within the World
    of Warcraft client. It may also handle cleanup of obsolete or completed objectives,
    recalculating priority levels, and optimizing memory usage for tracking systems.
    The optimization process is typically triggered during specific game events or
    periodic maintenance cycles to maintain optimal performance without impacting
    gameplay experience.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    objectiveTracker->OptimizeTrackingAlgorithms();\n\
      \    // ... continue with other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called periodically during game updates to maintain
    optimal tracking performance. It's likely designed to run with minimal overhead
    and may involve internal throttling to prevent excessive CPU usage.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently might cause unnecessary processing
    overhead, while not calling it often enough could lead to degraded performance
    over time. Ensure it's integrated into the appropriate update cycle of your game
    loop.
