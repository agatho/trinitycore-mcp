  class: LootDistribution

  signature: void LootDistribution::AnalyzeItemForPlayer(Player * player, const LootItem
    & item)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes a loot item for a specific player to determine eligibility and distribution
    outcome.
  description: The AnalyzeItemForPlayer method evaluates whether a given loot item
    is eligible for distribution to a specific player within the context of a loot
    distribution. It typically checks various conditions such as player's loot rules,
    item restrictions, and group/raid settings. This method plays a key role in determining
    how loot is allocated during group looting scenarios, ensuring that items are
    distributed according to predefined rules like need before greed, round-robin,
    or free-for-all systems. The method does not directly distribute the item but
    prepares internal state for distribution decisions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the loot item is being analyzed.
      Must be a valid player instance; null pointers will cause undefined behavior.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure representing the item being evaluated
      for distribution. Contains information such as item ID, stack size, and distribution
      flags.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in loot processing
    code: 'LootDistribution* lootDist = new LootDistribution();

      Player* player = ...; // valid player instance

      LootItem item = ...; // valid loot item

      lootDist->AnalyzeItemForPlayer(player, item);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with group loot system
    code: "void ProcessGroupLoot(Player* player, LootItem& item)\n{\n    LootDistribution*\
      \ dist = sLootMgr->GetLootDistribution(player->GetGroup());\n    if (dist)\n\
      \        dist->AnalyzeItemForPlayer(player, item);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the loot distribution process before
    making final decisions about item assignment. It may modify internal state within
    the LootDistribution object to track player eligibility and preferences. The method
    assumes that the player and item parameters are valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for either 'player' or 'item' will likely result
    in a crash or undefined behavior. Ensure all parameters are validated before calling
    this method. This function is part of an internal loot system and should not be
    invoked directly by external modules without proper context.
