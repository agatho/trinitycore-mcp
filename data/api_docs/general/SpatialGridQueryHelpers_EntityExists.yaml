  class: SpatialGridQueryHelpers
  method: EntityExists
  signature: bool SpatialGridQueryHelpers::EntityExists(Player * bot, int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specified entity exists within the spatial grid query context
    for a given player.
  description: The EntityExists method determines whether a specific entity, identified
    by its GUID, is currently present in the spatial grid associated with the provided
    player. This utility function is commonly used in AI and quest scripts to verify
    the presence of objects such as NPCs, game objects, or other players before performing
    actions that depend on their existence. The method leverages the spatial grid
    system which organizes entities based on their location to optimize query performance.
    It ensures that only entities within the player's current view or interaction
    range are considered.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the entity whose spatial
      grid context is used for the check. Must not be null.
  - name: guid
    description: Integer value representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the entity
      being checked for existence. Should correspond to a valid entity in the game
      world.
  returns: Returns true if the entity with the specified GUID exists within the spatial
    grid context of the player; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (SpatialGridQueryHelpers::EntityExists(player, 12345)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with actions assuming entity exists\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in AI Logic
    code: "bool hasTarget = SpatialGridQueryHelpers::EntityExists(bot, targetGuid);\n\
      if (!hasTarget) {\n    bot->Say(\"Target not found.\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n  \
      \  return;\n}\n// Continue with attack or interaction logic"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying spatial grid implementation which may
    cache entity locations. Entities that are outside of the player's current grid
    cells will not be found even if they exist in the world. Performance is optimized
    through spatial partitioning, but frequent calls should consider caching results
    when appropriate.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed is valid and corresponds to an actual entity
    in the game world; invalid or stale GUIDs may lead to incorrect behavior. Be cautious
    of race conditions if entities are frequently added/removed from the grid during
    execution.
