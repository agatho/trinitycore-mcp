  method: UseMirrorImage
  signature: void MageAI::UseMirrorImage()
documentation:
  brief: Executes the Mirror Image spell casting logic for a Mage AI.
  description: The UseMirrorImage method is responsible for triggering the Mirror
    Image spell within the Mage AI's behavior system. This method handles the decision-making
    process to determine when and how to cast the Mirror Image ability, which creates
    illusory duplicates of the mage to confuse enemies. The implementation likely
    checks for valid conditions such as mana availability, cooldown status, and combat
    state before executing the spell. It is part of the Mage's core AI functionality
    that enhances survivability and damage output through strategic use of illusions.

    code: "void MageAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        if (me->IsWithinMeleeRange(target))\n            DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n\
      \        else\n            UseMirrorImage(); // Cast Mirror Image when not in\
      \ melee range\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the MageAI's UpdateAI function
    or other combat-related logic. The actual spell execution and visual effects are
    handled by the core TrinityCore spell system, while this method manages the AI
    decision process.
