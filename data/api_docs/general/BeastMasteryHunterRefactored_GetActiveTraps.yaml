documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of active traps currently set by the hunter
  description: The GetActiveTraps method retrieves the number of traps that are currently
    active and deployed by the Beast Mastery hunter. This includes all trap types
    such as Immolation Trap, Frost Trap, and Snake Trap that have been placed but
    not yet expired or destroyed. The method provides a simple integer value representing
    how many traps are currently active in the hunter's possession. This functionality
    is crucial for determining the hunter's current trap deployment status and affects
    various game mechanics including trap cooldowns, damage calculations, and pet
    behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the total count of active traps currently
    deployed by the hunter. Returns 0 if no traps are active or if the hunter is not
    a Beast Mastery hunter.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int activeTraps = hunter->GetActiveTraps();\nif (activeTraps > 0) {\n \
      \   std::cout << \"Hunter has \" << activeTraps << \" active traps.\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Trap Management Check
    code: "BeastMasteryHunterRefactored* bmHunter = dynamic_cast<BeastMasteryHunterRefactored*>(player);\n\
      if (bmHunter && bmHunter->GetActiveTraps() < 4) {\n    // Allow placing another\
      \ trap\n    bmHunter->PlaceTrap();\n} else {\n    // Notify player that maximum\
      \ traps are active\n    player->SendNotification(\"Maximum number of traps already\
      \ active.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only counts traps that are currently active and deployed, not
    those in the hunter's inventory or in cooldown. The implementation likely checks
    the hunter's trap summoning state and trap timer data to determine active status.
    This function may be called frequently during combat situations where trap management
    is important.
  warnings: Be aware that this method may return different values depending on the
    specific hunter specialization and current game state. In some edge cases, particularly
    with certain pet behaviors or spell interactions, the returned value might not
    immediately reflect the actual number of visible traps in the world.
