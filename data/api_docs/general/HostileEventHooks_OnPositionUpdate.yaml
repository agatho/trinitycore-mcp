  class: HostileEventHooks
  method: OnPositionUpdate
  signature: void HostileEventHooks::OnPositionUpdate(int * unit, float x, float y,
    float z)
documentation:
  brief: Handles position update events for hostile units in the game world
  description: The OnPositionUpdate method is invoked when a hostile unit's position
    changes within the game world. This hook allows custom logic to be executed whenever
    such movement occurs, enabling features like tracking, AI behavior modification,
    or event triggering based on unit positioning. The method receives a pointer to
    the unit object along with its new X, Y, and Z coordinates. It is typically used
    in custom AI modules or event systems to respond dynamically to hostile unit movements.
  parameters:
  - name: unit
    description: Pointer to the hostile unit whose position is being updated. This
      parameter represents a reference to the game object's internal data structure.
  - name: x
    description: New X coordinate of the unit's position in the game world
  - name: y
    description: New Y coordinate of the unit's position in the game world
  - name: z
    description: New Z coordinate of the unit's position in the game world
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Position Update Handler
    code: "void HostileEventHooks::OnPositionUpdate(int* unit, float x, float y, float\
      \ z)\n{\n    // Log the new position of hostile units\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Hostile unit at position: %.2f, %.2f, %.2f\", x, y, z);\n    // Additional custom\
      \ logic can be added here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Position Update with AI Reaction
    code: "void HostileEventHooks::OnPositionUpdate(int* unit, float x, float y, float\
      \ z)\n{\n    // Trigger an AI reaction when hostile unit moves closer than 10\
      \ yards\n    if (GetDistanceToPlayer(unit) < 10.0f)\n    {\n        // Activate\
      \ special behavior or alert nearby NPCs\n        TriggerHostileAlert(unit);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called frequently during gameplay, so implementations should
    be optimized to avoid performance bottlenecks. The unit pointer may be null in
    certain edge cases, so proper validation is recommended. This hook operates within
    the game's main thread context.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy computations or blocking operations within this
    method as it can impact game performance. Ensure that any modifications to unit
    state are thread-safe and don't cause race conditions with other systems.
