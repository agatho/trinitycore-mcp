  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: GetGlobalObjectiveAnalytics
  signature: const ObjectiveAnalytics & ObjectiveTracker::GetGlobalObjectiveAnalytics()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the global objective analytics data structure for tracking player
    progress and statistics.
  description: The GetGlobalObjectiveAnalytics method provides access to a structured
    collection of analytics related to global objectives within the game world. This
    data typically includes information about completed objectives, progression metrics,
    and statistical tracking for players or groups. The returned reference allows
    direct access to the analytics without copying the underlying data structure,
    making it efficient for read-only operations. This method is commonly used in
    conjunction with objective tracking systems to provide real-time updates on player
    achievements and progress toward global goals.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an ObjectiveAnalytics object containing all tracked
    global objective statistics and progress data. The returned object should not
    be modified directly as it represents the current state of analytics within the
    tracker.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Global Objective Analytics
    code: 'ObjectiveTracker* tracker = player->GetObjectiveTracker();

      const ObjectiveAnalytics& analytics = tracker->GetGlobalObjectiveAnalytics();

      uint32 completedObjectives = analytics.GetCompletedCount();

      uint32 totalObjectives = analytics.GetTotalCount();'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to internal data managed by the ObjectiveTracker.
    Modifications to the analytics object should be done through appropriate tracker
    methods rather than direct manipulation. This method is thread-safe for read operations
    but may require synchronization if concurrent modifications occur.
  warnings: Direct modification of the returned ObjectiveAnalytics reference can lead
    to inconsistent state in the objective tracking system. Always use the provided
    setter or update methods to modify analytics data instead of modifying the returned
    reference directly.
