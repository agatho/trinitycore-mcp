documentation:
  brief: Retrieves validation statistics including total validations, failures, and
    stuck detections.
  description: The GetStatistics method retrieves three key metrics from the MovementValidator
    class that track movement validation behavior. These metrics include the total
    number of validations performed, the count of failed validations, and the number
    of times stuck detections were triggered. This method is typically used for monitoring
    and debugging purposes to understand how often movement validation is being executed
    and how many validations are failing or detecting stuck states. The method does
    not modify any internal state and is safe to call at any time during runtime.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 totalValidations = 0;

      uint32 failures = 0;

      uint32 stuckDetections = 0;

      movementValidator.GetStatistics(totalValidations, failures, stuckDetections);

      TC_LOG_INFO("movement", "Validations: %u, Failures: %u, Stuck: %u", totalValidations,
      failures, stuckDetections);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it only reads from internal counters without
    modifying them. The statistics are updated incrementally during movement validation
    operations and may be reset or modified by other system components depending on
    the implementation details of MovementValidator.
