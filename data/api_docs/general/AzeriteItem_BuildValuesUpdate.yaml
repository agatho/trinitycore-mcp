documentation:
  brief: Populates update buffer with azerite item data for client synchronization
  description: The BuildValuesUpdate method constructs and fills an update buffer
    containing all relevant azerite item properties for transmission to clients. This
    method is typically invoked during packet building for item updates, ensuring
    that the client has accurate information about the azerite item's state including
    its power level, unlocked essences, and other azerite-specific attributes. The
    method operates on internal data structures and prepares them according to the
    World of Warcraft update system conventions, using provided flags to determine
    which fields should be included in the update packet.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array that will receive the packed update values.
      This buffer must be pre-allocated with sufficient space to hold all required
      data fields.
  - name: flags
    description: Integer bitmask specifying which portions of the azerite item data
      should be included in the update. Different flag values control inclusion of
      different azerite properties such as power level, essence data, or unlocked
      abilities.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer array that serves as the target for the update
      operation. This parameter may be used to specify which fields should be updated
      or to provide reference data for the update process.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in item update
    code: 'AzeriteItem* azeriteItem = player->GetAzeriteItem();

      int updateData[256];

      int flags = AzeriteUpdateFlags::POWER_LEVEL | AzeriteUpdateFlags::ESSENCE_DATA;

      azeriteItem->BuildValuesUpdate(updateData, flags, nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating with specific target data
    code: 'AzeriteItem* azeriteItem = player->GetAzeriteItem();

      int updateData[128];

      int targetData[32];

      targetData[0] = 100; // Example target value

      azeriteItem->BuildValuesUpdate(updateData, AzeriteUpdateFlags::ESSENCE_DATA,
      targetData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal update system and should only be called
    when preparing data for network transmission. The size of the data buffer must
    be sufficient to accommodate all fields specified by the flags parameter. This
    method does not perform any validation on input parameters, so callers must ensure
    proper allocation and valid flag values.
  warnings: Improperly sized data buffers can cause memory corruption or undefined
    behavior. Always ensure that the 'data' parameter points to a buffer large enough
    for the update operation. The target parameter should be carefully managed as
    it may affect how certain fields are processed during the update.
