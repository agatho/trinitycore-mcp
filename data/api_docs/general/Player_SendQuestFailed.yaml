documentation:
  brief: Sends a quest failed message to the player, indicating that a quest has not
    been completed successfully.
  description: The SendQuestFailed method is used to notify a player that a specific
    quest has failed to be completed. This method is typically called when a quest
    objective fails or when the player cannot meet the requirements for completing
    a quest. The method takes a quest ID and an optional reason parameter, which can
    be used to provide additional context about why the quest failed. This functionality
    is essential for maintaining game progression and ensuring that players receive
    appropriate feedback regarding their quest status.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest that has failed. This value corresponds
      to a specific quest in the database.
  - name: reason
    description: An optional integer value indicating the reason for quest failure.
      This parameter allows developers to specify why the quest failed, such as 'failed'
      or 'not enough items'.
  returns: null

  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's quest system and should be used
    in conjunction with other quest-related methods to maintain proper game flow.
    It is typically called during quest completion checks or when a player fails to
    meet quest requirements.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may result in incorrect quest status updates,
    leading to players being unable to progress through the game's quest line. Care
    should be taken to ensure that the quest ID exists and that the reason parameter
    is correctly set.
