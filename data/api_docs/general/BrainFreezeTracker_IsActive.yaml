  class: BrainFreezeTracker
  method: IsActive
  signature: bool BrainFreezeTracker::IsActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the BrainFreeze effect is currently active on the target.
  description: The IsActive method determines if a character currently has the Brain
    Freeze buff applied. This buff typically prevents spell casting for a short duration
    and is often caused by specific abilities or talents. The method returns true
    if the effect is active, false otherwise. This check is commonly used in spell
    systems to prevent casting while the character is under the influence of this
    debuff.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Brain Freeze effect is currently active on the target,
    false if it is not active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (player->GetBrainFreezeTracker()->IsActive()) {\n    // Prevent spell\
      \ casting\n    player->SendSpellFailed(0, SPELL_FAILED_SPELL_IN_PROGRESS);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Logic
    code: "void Player::CastSpellWithBrainFreezeCheck(uint32 spellId) {\n    if (GetBrainFreezeTracker()->IsActive())\
      \ {\n        SendSpellFailed(spellId, SPELL_FAILED_SPELL_IN_PROGRESS);\n   \
      \     return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with normal spell casting logic\n    DoCastSpell(spellId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple state check and should be efficient to call.
    It's recommended to cache the result if checking this condition multiple times
    within a single game tick.
  warnings: Ensure that the BrainFreezeTracker object is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as calling it on a null pointer will cause undefined behavior.
