  method: ShouldBeSuppressed
  signature: bool ThreatReference::ShouldBeSuppressed() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the threat reference should be suppressed from threat
    calculations.
  description: The ShouldBeSuppressed method checks if a ThreatReference object is
    marked for suppression in threat generation or management systems. This typically
    occurs when a unit's threat contributions should not be considered for aggro purposes,
    such as during certain boss mechanics, specific spell effects, or temporary invulnerability
    states. The method returns true if the reference is suppressed and false otherwise.
    This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper combat behavior in complex
    encounters where some entities may temporarily become non-threatening to players.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the threat reference should be suppressed from threat calculations,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (threatRef.ShouldBeSuppressed())\n{\n    // Skip adding threat or applying\
      \ effects\n    return;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the threat manager to filter out
    units that should not contribute to threat tables. It may be called frequently
    during combat updates, so performance is important. The suppression state could
    be influenced by various game mechanics such as stealth, divine shield, or specific
    encounter phases.
  warnings: Do not rely on this method's return value for core gameplay logic without
    understanding the full context of when suppression is applied. Misusing it might
    lead to incorrect threat behavior in encounters.
