    const int & request, int callback)
documentation:
  brief: Asynchronously selects a character for bot account management by recursively
    processing account indices.
  description: The SelectCharacterAsyncRecursive method is responsible for asynchronously
    selecting characters for bot accounts within the TrinityCore framework. This recursive
    function processes a specified number of accounts starting from a given index,
    handling character selection operations in a non-blocking manner to prevent UI
    freezing during bulk bot account initialization. The method utilizes an asynchronous
    callback mechanism to manage the flow of character selection across multiple accounts
    and handles potential errors or timeouts during the selection process. It is typically
    invoked as part of automated bot spawning routines where multiple accounts need
    to have their characters selected before further bot operations can proceed.
  parameters:
  - name: accounts
    description: The total number of bot accounts to process for character selection.
      This parameter defines the upper bound of accounts to iterate through in the
      recursive operation.
  - name: index
    description: The current account index being processed in the recursive call.
      This serves as the starting point for character selection and is incremented
      with each recursive iteration.
  - name: request
    description: A reference to an integer representing the request identifier or
      type for character selection. This value may indicate specific character selection
      criteria or operation types.
  - name: callback
    description: An integer parameter that specifies the callback function identifier
      to be invoked upon completion of each character selection operation. Used to
      determine which handler should process the result.
  returns: None. This method performs asynchronous operations and does not return
    a value directly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Character Selection
    code: 'BotSpawner spawner;

      spawner.SelectCharacterAsyncRecursive(5, 0, requestType, callbackId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recursive Account Processing
    code: "void ProcessBots()\n{\n    BotSpawner spawner;\n    int totalAccounts =\
      \ 10;\n    int requestId = 1;\n    int callbackId = 42;\n    spawner.SelectCharacterAsyncRecursive(totalAccounts,\
      \ 0, requestId, callbackId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates asynchronously and should be called from a context that
    can handle non-blocking operations. The recursive nature of this function means
    it may lead to stack overflow if processing large numbers of accounts without
    proper termination conditions. The implementation likely uses TrinityCore's async
    task system for handling the actual character selection work.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method with very large account counts as it may cause
    stack overflow due to deep recursion. Ensure that the callback mechanism is properly
    implemented to handle results from asynchronous operations. This method should
    not be called directly from UI threads to prevent blocking the game interface.
