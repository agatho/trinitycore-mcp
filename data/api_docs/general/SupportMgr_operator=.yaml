  class: SupportMgr
  method: operator=
  signature: SupportMgr & SupportMgr::operator=(SupportMgr && param0)
documentation:
  brief: Moves the contents of one SupportMgr object to another, leaving the source
    object in a valid but unspecified state.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment operation on the SupportMgr
    class. This implementation transfers ownership of resources from the source SupportMgr
    object (passed as an rvalue reference) to the target object. After the move, the
    source object will be left in a valid but unspecified state, meaning it can still
    be safely destroyed or assigned to, but its contents are no longer guaranteed
    to be meaningful. This is a standard move assignment operator commonly used for
    efficient resource management in C++ and follows the typical semantics of move
    semantics where expensive operations like memory allocation are transferred rather
    than copied.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to another SupportMgr object whose contents will
      be moved to this object. This parameter represents the source of the resource
      transfer operation.
  returns: A reference to the current SupportMgr object (this) after the move assignment
    has been completed, enabling method chaining.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'SupportMgr manager1;

      SupportMgr manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Uses move constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      manager1 = std::move(manager2); // Uses move assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Container Context
    code: "std::vector<SupportMgr> managers;\nmanagers.emplace_back();\n// Later in\
      \ code...\nif (!managers.empty()) {\n    SupportMgr temp = std::move(managers.back());\n\
      \    managers.pop_back();\n    // temp now owns the resources previously held\
      \ by managers.back()\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the C++ move semantics family and should only be used
    when the source object is no longer needed. It's important to understand that
    after a move operation, the source object is left in a valid but unspecified state,
    which means it can be safely destroyed or assigned to again, but its internal
    data may not be meaningful. This operator is typically generated automatically
    by the compiler for classes without explicitly defined move operations, but may
    be manually implemented for performance optimization.
  warnings: Do not use the source object after a move operation unless you explicitly
    assign to it again. The state of the moved-from object is undefined and should
    not be relied upon. Also, ensure that the class properly implements move semantics
    if it manages dynamic memory or other resources, otherwise the default implementation
    may lead to resource leaks or double-free errors.
