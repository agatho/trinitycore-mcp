  class: SmartAreaTriggerAI
  method: GetScript
  signature: SmartScript * SmartAreaTriggerAI::GetScript()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the SmartScript instance associated with this area trigger AI.
  description: The GetScript method returns a pointer to the SmartScript object that
    controls the behavior of the area trigger. This script contains all the AI logic
    and event handling for the area trigger, including triggers, actions, and conditions.
    The returned SmartScript pointer is used internally by the AI system to execute
    scripted behaviors when area trigger events occur. The method ensures that the
    script is properly initialized before returning it, making it safe to use for
    retrieving or modifying the area trigger's behavior at runtime.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the SmartScript instance associated with this area trigger
    AI, or nullptr if no script has been assigned or initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "SmartScript* script = areaTriggerAI->GetScript();\nif (script)\n{\n   \
      \ // Use the script for further operations\n    script->ProcessEvent(EVENT_ON_TRIGGER);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Script Validity
    code: "SmartAreaTriggerAI* ai = CAST_AI(SmartAreaTriggerAI, unit);\nSmartScript*\
      \ script = ai->GetScript();\nif (script != nullptr)\n{\n    // Safe to access\
      \ script methods\n    script->SetGlobalVar(1, 42);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ case where no script is assigned\n    sLog->outError(\"No SmartScript assigned\
      \ to area trigger\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within the AI context of an area trigger.
    The returned SmartScript pointer remains valid for the lifetime of the area trigger
    AI instance. Be cautious when modifying script behavior directly through this
    pointer, as it may interfere with the normal operation of the AI system.
  warnings: Do not store the returned SmartScript pointer beyond the scope of the
    current AI execution context, as it may become invalid if the area trigger is
    destroyed or reinitialized. Avoid calling this method from multiple threads simultaneously
    without proper synchronization.
