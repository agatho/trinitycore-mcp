  class: MovementGenerator
  method: Initialize
  signature: void MovementGenerator::Initialize(Unit * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the movement generator for a given unit, setting up internal
    state and preparing it for movement operations.
  description: The Initialize method prepares a MovementGenerator instance for use
    with a specific Unit object. This method is typically called during the initialization
    phase of a creature or player's movement behavior, ensuring that all necessary
    internal data structures are properly set up. It establishes the ownership relationship
    between the movement generator and the unit it will control, and may perform additional
    setup such as initializing movement parameters, registering with movement managers,
    or preparing pathfinding data. The method is part of the core movement system
    in TrinityCore, which handles how units navigate through the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that this movement generator will control.
      Must be a valid pointer to an existing Unit instance. The owner is typically
      a Creature or Player object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement Generator Initialization
    code: 'MovementGenerator* gen = new RandomMovementGenerator();

      Unit* owner = creature;

      gen->Initialize(owner);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing a Pathfinding Movement Generator
    code: 'MovementGenerator* gen = new PathFinderMovementGenerator(targetPosition);

      Unit* owner = player;

      gen->Initialize(owner);

      // The generator is now ready to handle pathfinding for the player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per MovementGenerator instance. Calling
    Initialize multiple times on the same generator may lead to undefined behavior
    or resource leaks. The owner parameter must not be null, as this will likely cause
    crashes or assertion failures in debug builds.
  warnings: Never call Initialize with a null owner pointer. This will result in crashes
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the MovementGenerator instance is properly
    allocated before calling Initialize.
