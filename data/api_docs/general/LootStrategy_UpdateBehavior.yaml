  class: LootStrategy
  method: UpdateBehavior
  signature: void LootStrategy::UpdateBehavior(BotAI * ai, uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the loot behavior for a bot AI instance based on elapsed time.
  description: The UpdateBehavior method is responsible for managing and updating
    the loot decision-making process within a BotAI instance. It processes the current
    loot strategy, evaluates available loot items, and makes decisions about which
    items to loot or pass on. This method is typically called periodically by the
    AI system to ensure that bot behavior remains responsive to changing loot conditions.
    The method uses the provided time difference (diff) to determine how much time
    has passed since the last update, which can affect loot timing or cooldown behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that owns this loot strategy. This
      parameter is required and must not be null.
  - name: diff
    description: Time difference in milliseconds since the last update call. Used
      to determine timing for loot decisions and cooldowns.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateBehavior Call
    code: "void Update() {\n    LootStrategy* strategy = bot->GetLootStrategy();\n\
      \    strategy->UpdateBehavior(bot->GetAI(), 100);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (lootStrategy)\n        lootStrategy->UpdateBehavior(this,\
      \ diff);\n    // Other AI updates...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within the main AI update loop. It's
    important that the BotAI instance passed to this method is valid and properly
    initialized. The 'diff' parameter should represent actual elapsed time since last
    call for accurate behavior.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'ai' will likely result in a crash or undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the BotAI object is fully constructed before calling this
    method.
