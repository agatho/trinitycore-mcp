  brief: Moves an InstanceLockData object, transferring its resources to a new instance.
  description: The InstanceLockData move constructor transfers all resources from
    the source InstanceLockData object to the newly constructed object. This operation
    is typically used when an InstanceLockData object needs to be moved into a container
    or passed by value without copying. The source object becomes invalid after the
    move and should not be used. In the context of TrinityCore's instance locking
    system, this constructor supports efficient management of lock data structures
    during instance creation, player entry, and lock state transitions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Moving InstanceLockData to a vector
    code: 'std::vector<InstanceLockData> locks;

      InstanceLockData lock1;

      locks.push_back(std::move(lock1)); // Move lock1 into the vector'
    language: cpp
  - title: Returning moved InstanceLockData from a function
    code: "InstanceLockData GetInstanceLock() {\n    InstanceLockData lock;\n    //\
      \ ... populate lock ...\n    return std::move(lock); // Efficiently move the\
      \ object\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a copy constructor. After moving, the source
    object's state is undefined and should not be accessed. The move operation is
    typically O(1) in complexity as it only transfers pointers or handles rather than
    deep-copying data.
  warnings: Do not use the source InstanceLockData object after moving it. Attempting
    to access members of a moved-from object results in undefined behavior. This constructor
    should only be used when you no longer need the original object.
