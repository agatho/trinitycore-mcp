documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the InstanceLockData class with default values.
  description: The InstanceLockData constructor initializes a new instance of the
    InstanceLockData class, setting up internal data structures and default state
    values. This method is typically called when creating a new instance lock object
    to manage player access permissions and lock states within a dungeon or raid instance.
    The constructor ensures that all member variables are properly initialized to
    their default values, including instance ID, lock status, and associated player
    data. It serves as the entry point for creating valid InstanceLockData objects
    used by the TrinityCore instance management system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new InstanceLockData object
    code: 'InstanceLockData lockData;

      // The lockData object is now initialized with default values

      // and ready to be used for instance locking operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is automatically called when declaring a new InstanceLockData
    variable. Developers should not need to explicitly invoke this method unless performing
    custom object initialization. The constructor ensures thread safety by initializing
    all internal state without external dependencies.
