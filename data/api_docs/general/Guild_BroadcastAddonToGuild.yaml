documentation:
  brief: Sends an addon message to all guild members or officers.
  description: The BroadcastAddonToGuild method sends a custom addon message to either
    all members of the guild or only officers, depending on the officerOnly flag.
    This functionality is used for communication between addons and players within
    the guild context. The message includes a prefix and can be logged based on the
    isLogged parameter. It uses the provided WorldSession to determine the sender
    and ensures that only valid guild members receive the broadcast.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession of the player sending the addon message.
      Used to identify the sender and validate permissions.
  - name: officerOnly
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the message should be sent only to
      guild officers (true) or to all guild members (false).
  - name: msg
    description: String view containing the actual addon message content to be broadcasted.
  - name: prefix
    description: String view specifying a prefix to prepend to the addon message,
      typically used for identifying the addon source.
  - name: isLogged
    description: Boolean flag determining whether the broadcast should be logged in
      the game's log system for administrative purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Broadcast message to all guild members
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    guild->BroadcastAddonToGuild(session,\
      \ false, \"Hello Guild!\", \"[MyAddon]\", true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Send officer-only addon message
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    guild->BroadcastAddonToGuild(session,\
      \ true, \"Important update\", \"[GM]\", false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the WorldSession to ensure proper authentication and
    authorization of the sender. It is typically used by addon developers to communicate
    with players in a guild context without requiring direct player interaction. The
    prefix helps distinguish messages from different addons, while logging can assist
    in debugging or monitoring guild communications.
  warnings: Ensure that the session parameter is valid and represents an authenticated
    player; otherwise, the broadcast may fail silently. Be cautious when using isLogged=true
    as it could increase server log volume significantly if used frequently.
