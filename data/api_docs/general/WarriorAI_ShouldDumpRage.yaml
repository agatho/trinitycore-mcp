  class: WarriorAI
  method: ShouldDumpRage
  signature: bool WarriorAI::ShouldDumpRage()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the warrior should dump rage during combat.
  description: The ShouldDumpRage method evaluates the current state of the warrior
    AI to decide if it is appropriate to consume accumulated rage for executing abilities.
    This decision is based on factors such as available rage amount, target threat
    level, and the effectiveness of rage-consuming abilities in the current combat
    scenario. The method ensures optimal resource management by preventing unnecessary
    rage accumulation when abilities that consume rage are not viable or beneficial
    to use at the moment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the warrior should dump rage (i.e., use rage-consuming
    abilities), false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the AI has
    determined it is advantageous to spend accumulated rage on active abilities, while
    false suggests that rage should be conserved for future use.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Logic
    code: "if (warriorAI->ShouldDumpRage()) {\n    warriorAI->ExecuteRageAbility();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Making Loop
    code: "void WarriorAIBehavior::UpdateAI() {\n    if (ShouldDumpRage()) {\n   \
      \     // Use abilities that consume rage\n        if (me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\n\
      \            return;\n        \n        // Execute rage-consuming ability\n\
      \        DoCast(me->GetVictim(), SPELL_SLAM);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the warrior AI's update loop to make
    real-time decisions about rage consumption. It considers both immediate tactical
    needs and long-term resource planning, ensuring that rage is not wasted on suboptimal
    abilities. The decision-making process may involve checking for cooldowns, target
    conditions, and the presence of beneficial effects.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly without verifying that the AI has a valid
    target and that the warrior is in combat state. Incorrect usage could lead to
    inappropriate ability casting or rage waste if called outside of proper combat
    context.
