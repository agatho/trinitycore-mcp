documentation:
  brief: Generates a unique identifier for a pet, ensuring no duplicate GUIDs are
    assigned within the game world.
  description: The GeneratePetNumber method is responsible for creating and returning
    a unique 32-bit identifier (GUID) specifically for in-game pets. This function
    ensures that each pet in the World of Warcraft instance receives a distinct identifier
    to prevent conflicts in the object management system. It typically maintains an
    internal counter or uses a database-assigned sequence to guarantee uniqueness
    across all active pets. The generated number is used when spawning new pets and
    is essential for proper tracking, serialization, and networking of pet objects
    within TrinityCore's architecture.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the unique identifier (GUID) assigned to a
    new pet. This number is guaranteed to be unique among all currently active pets
    in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Pet Spawning
    code: 'uint32 petGuid = sObjectMgr->GeneratePetNumber();

      Creature* pet = new Creature();

      pet->SetGUID(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Pet, petGuid));

      sObjectMgr->AddCreatureToGrid(pet);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it internally handles synchronization for GUID
    generation. It's commonly used during pet creation and should be called before
    assigning the GUID to any new pet object.
