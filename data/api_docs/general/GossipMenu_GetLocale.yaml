  method: GetLocale
  signature: LocaleConstant GossipMenu::GetLocale() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the locale constant associated with the gossip menu for localization
    purposes.
  description: The GetLocale method returns the LocaleConstant that represents the
    language and regional settings of the gossip menu. This is used in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore to determine how text should be localized for different client languages.
    The returned value corresponds to the standard locale identifiers used throughout
    the game's localization system, allowing NPCs to present appropriate messages
    based on the player's selected language. This method does not modify any internal
    state and is typically called when preparing or displaying gossip options to ensure
    proper text rendering.
  parameters: []
  returns: A LocaleConstant value indicating the language and regional settings of
    this gossip menu. Possible values include LOCALE_enUS, LOCALE_koKR, LOCALE_frFR,
    LOCALE_deDE, LOCALE_zhCN, LOCALE_zhTW, LOCALE_esES, LOCALE_esMX, LOCALE_ruRU,
    etc., depending on the client's language settings.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and log gossip menu locale
    code: "void OnGossipHello(Player* player, Creature* creature)\n{\n    GossipMenu&\
      \ menu = creature->GetGossipMenu();\n    LocaleConstant locale = menu.GetLocale();\n\
      \    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"player.gossip\", \"Gossip menu locale: %u\", locale);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the TrinityCore framework to
    manage localization of gossip text. The locale information is usually set when
    the gossip menu is initialized or modified through other API calls. Developers
    should not modify the locale directly using this getter; instead, use appropriate
    setter methods if locale changes are required.
