documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the priority value for a given spell's cooldown based
    on stacking optimization logic.
  description: The GetCooldownPriority method computes a floating-point priority score
    for a specified spell ID, determining how urgently that spell should be used in
    relation to other cooldowns. This is typically used within AI decision-making
    systems or cooldown management modules to optimize spell usage sequences. The
    method evaluates factors such as spell effectiveness, cooldown duration, and strategic
    importance to assign a relative priority between 0.0 (lowest) and 1.0 (highest).
    It does not modify any internal state and is purely a query function. The implementation
    likely considers game mechanics like spell damage output, utility benefits, and
    cooldown reset timing.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated priority of the specified spell's
    cooldown. Values range from 0.0 (lowest priority) to 1.0 (highest priority), where
    higher values indicate that the spell should be prioritized for use when its cooldown
    is ready.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float priority = optimizer.GetCooldownPriority(12345);\nif (priority >\
      \ 0.8f)\n{\n    // Use this spell immediately when available\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Sorting Spells by Priority
    code: "std::vector<uint32> spellIds = {12345, 67890, 54321};\nstd::sort(spellIds.begin(),\
      \ spellIds.end(), [&optimizer](uint32 a, uint32 b)\n{\n    return optimizer.GetCooldownPriority(a)\
      \ > optimizer.GetCooldownPriority(b);\n});"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger cooldown optimization system that
    takes into account multiple factors beyond just spell ID. It may cache or precompute
    values for performance reasons, especially in high-frequency AI decision loops.
    The exact algorithm used to compute the priority is not exposed but is expected
    to be consistent across calls with the same input.
  warnings: The returned value is relative and context-dependent; it should not be
    interpreted as an absolute measure of spell worthiness without considering other
    game state factors such as current mana, target health, or encounter phase. Repeated
    calls to this method with the same spell ID may return different values if internal
    conditions change.
