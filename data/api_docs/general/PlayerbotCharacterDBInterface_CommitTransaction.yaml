documentation:
  brief: Commits a database transaction for player bot character data operations
  description: The CommitTransaction method finalizes an ongoing database transaction
    within the PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface class. This method ensures that all pending
    database modifications are permanently saved to the storage backend. The transaction
    is identified by the provided transaction handle, and can optionally be executed
    asynchronously. This functionality is crucial for maintaining data consistency
    in player bot character management systems where multiple related operations need
    to be treated as a single atomic unit of work.
  parameters:
  - name: trans
    description: Transaction handle identifier returned by a previous BeginTransaction
      call. This parameter uniquely identifies the transaction context that should
      be committed.
  - name: async
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the commit operation should be performed
      asynchronously (true) or synchronously (false). Asynchronous commits allow the
      calling thread to continue execution without waiting for database I/O completion.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Transaction Commit
    code: 'int transactionId = characterDBInterface.BeginTransaction();

      // Perform multiple database operations here

      characterDBInterface.CommitTransaction(transactionId, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Asynchronous Transaction Commit
    code: 'int transactionId = characterDBInterface.BeginTransaction();

      // Perform multiple database operations here

      characterDBInterface.CommitTransaction(transactionId, true); // Non-blocking
      commit'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after a successful BeginTransaction call.
    The transaction handle must be valid and not previously committed or rolled back.
    Asynchronous commits may not immediately reflect changes in memory but will eventually
    persist to the database.
  warnings: Calling CommitTransaction with an invalid transaction handle can result
    in undefined behavior or database corruption. Always ensure that transactions
    are properly begun before committing, and avoid committing the same transaction
    multiple times.
