  class: EquipmentManager
  method: CalculateAccessoryScore
  signature: float EquipmentManager::CalculateAccessoryScore(int * player, int * accessory)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the score value of an accessory item based on player
    and accessory parameters.
  description: The CalculateAccessoryScore method computes a numerical score for a
    given accessory item, taking into account the player's current equipment and stats.
    This score is used internally by the game to determine accessory effectiveness,
    item comparisons, and potential upgrades. The method evaluates various factors
    such as item level, stat bonuses, and compatibility with the player's class and
    specialization. It serves as a core component in the game's inventory management
    and gear optimization systems.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or data
      structure. This parameter contains information about the player's current stats,
      level, class, and equipped items that influence accessory scoring.
  - name: accessory
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the accessory item's identifier
      or data structure. This parameter holds details about the accessory such as
      its item level, stats, type, and other properties that contribute to the score
      calculation.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated accessory score. Higher scores
    typically indicate better performance or utility of the accessory in the context
    of the player's current setup.
  examples:
  - title: Basic accessory scoring
    code: 'int playerData = 12345;

      int accessoryData = 67890;

      float score = equipmentManager.CalculateAccessoryScore(&playerData, &accessoryData);

      printf("Accessory Score: %.2f\n", score);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other inventory management
    functions to provide players with gear recommendations. The exact scoring algorithm
    may vary based on game updates and balance changes.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and accessory parameters are properly initialized
    before calling this method, as invalid data could lead to incorrect calculations
    or undefined behavior.
