  class: ClassAI
  method: CastSpell
  signature: bool ClassAI::CastSpell(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates casting of a specified spell by the AI-controlled unit.
  description: The CastSpell method is used to trigger the casting of a spell from
    the ClassAI's spell list. It attempts to cast the spell with the given ID, handling
    the necessary checks and execution logic for AI spell casting within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method typically integrates with the AI's decision-making process
    to select and execute appropriate spells during combat or other scripted events.
    The method performs validation on the spell ID and ensures that the unit has the
    required resources (mana, rage, energy, etc.) before attempting to cast.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to be cast. This value must correspond
      to a valid spell entry in the TrinityCore database.
  returns: Returns true if the spell casting was successfully initiated, false otherwise.
    The return value indicates whether the spell could be queued or started, not necessarily
    completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Casting
    code: "if (ai->CastSpell(12345)) {\n    // Spell casting initiated successfully\n\
      \    // Additional logic can be added here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spell Casting with Error Handling
    code: "uint32 spellToCast = 67890;\nif (ai->CastSpell(spellToCast)) {\n    //\
      \ Spell successfully queued for casting\n} else {\n    // Handle case where\
      \ spell could not be cast\n    // Possibly log error or select alternative action\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within AI behavior trees or decision-making
    logic. It does not directly execute the spell effect; instead, it schedules the
    spell to be cast according to the AI's execution cycle. The actual spell effect
    is handled by the core game engine once the casting is initiated.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId passed to this method corresponds to a valid spell
    in the database. Invalid spell IDs may result in silent failures or undefined
    behavior. Also, calling this method without checking for sufficient resources
    (mana, rage, etc.) may lead to failed casts or unexpected AI behavior.
