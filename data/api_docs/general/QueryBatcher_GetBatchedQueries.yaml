  class: QueryBatcher
  method: GetBatchedQueries
  signature: std::vector<BatchedQuery> QueryBatcher::GetBatchedQueries()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves all batched database queries that have been queued for execution.
  description: The GetBatchedQueries method returns a vector containing all the BatchedQuery
    objects that are currently stored in the QueryBatcher instance. These queries
    represent database operations that have been accumulated and are pending execution,
    typically used to optimize performance by batching multiple small queries into
    a single larger query. This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's database
    subsystem to manage and retrieve queued SQL operations before they are executed
    against the world database. The returned vector provides access to the batched
    queries for inspection or manipulation, though modifications to the returned vector
    do not affect the internal state of the QueryBatcher.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector<BatchedQuery> containing all the currently batched database
    queries that have been queued for execution. Each BatchedQuery object represents
    a single SQL query or operation that will be executed as part of a batch.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and process batched queries
    code: "QueryBatcher batcher;\n// ... Add some queries to the batcher ...\nstd::vector<BatchedQuery>\
      \ queries = batcher.GetBatchedQueries();\nfor (const auto& query : queries)\n\
      {\n    // Process each batched query\n    std::cout << \"Query: \" << query.GetQueryString()\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a read-only view of the internal batched queries. Modifications
    to the returned vector do not affect the QueryBatcher's internal state. The method
    is typically used in conjunction with other QueryBatcher methods like AddQuery
    or ExecuteBatches to manage database operations efficiently.
