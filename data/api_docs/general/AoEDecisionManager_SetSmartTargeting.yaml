documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables smart targeting behavior for area of effect decisions.
  description: The SetSmartTargeting method configures whether the AoEDecisionManager
    should use intelligent targeting logic when selecting targets for area of effect
    abilities. When enabled, the system will consider factors such as target positioning,
    threat levels, and proximity to determine optimal target selection. This feature
    enhances AI decision-making by making area attacks more strategic rather than
    random. The method does not validate the current state of the manager or perform
    any immediate targeting calculations; it simply sets a flag that affects future
    targeting behavior.

  examples:
  - title: Enable Smart Targeting
    code: 'AoEDecisionManager* manager = ...;

      manager->SetSmartTargeting(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Smart Targeting
    code: 'AoEDecisionManager* manager = ...;

      manager->SetSmartTargeting(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during AI initialization or configuration phases.
    Changes to smart targeting settings take effect immediately for subsequent targeting
    decisions, but do not retroactively affect ongoing actions. The implementation
    likely involves internal state management and may interact with other AI decision
    components.
