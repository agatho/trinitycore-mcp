  brief: Sends a summon request to the player from a summoner.
  description: This method facilitates the sending of a summon request from another
    player or NPC to the current player, enabling the player to accept or reject the
    summon request. It typically involves triggering a UI popup that allows the player
    to respond to the summon request, with the request being sent through the game's
    communication system. The method is part of the player's interaction with summon
    mechanics and is used in scenarios where players need to be summoned by others.
  parameters:
  - name: summoner
    description: Pointer to the entity that is sending the summon request. This can
      be a player or NPC, and represents the source of the summon request.
  returns: null

      player->SendSummonRequestFrom(summoner);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method may involve internal game state management and requires proper
    handling of the summon request to ensure correct behavior. It is typically used
    in conjunction with other player summoning methods and may be part of a larger
    system involving player-to-player or player-to-NPC communication.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without proper context, as it
    may lead to unexpected behavior if used incorrectly. Ensure that the summoner
    parameter is valid before calling this method.
