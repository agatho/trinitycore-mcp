  method: ObjectUpdater
  signature: void ObjectUpdater::ObjectUpdater(const int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates all game objects in the world with the specified time delta.
  description: The ObjectUpdater::ObjectUpdater method is responsible for processing
    and updating all active game objects within the TrinityCore world instance. This
    method is typically called during the game loop's update cycle to ensure that
    all entities such as players, creatures, game objects, and dynamic objects are
    properly updated with the elapsed time delta. It handles movement updates, AI
    behavior, spell effects, and other time-dependent systems for all objects in the
    world. The method processes object updates in a controlled manner to maintain
    consistent game state and performance across all active entities.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time delta in milliseconds since the last update cycle. This
      value represents how much time has passed since the previous update iteration,
      used to calculate proper movement, animation timing, and other time-dependent
      behaviors for game objects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Update all game objects\
      \ with the time delta\n    ObjectUpdater::ObjectUpdater(diff);\n    \n    //\
      \ Continue with other update logic\n    UpdateSessions(diff);\n    UpdateMapUpdates();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with server tick system
    code: "void World::UpdateWorld()\n{\n    static uint32 updateTime = 0;\n    uint32\
      \ currentUpdateTime = getMSTime();\n    uint32 diff = currentUpdateTime - updateTime;\n\
      \    \n    if (diff > 0)\n    {\n        // Update all objects with the time\
      \ difference\n        ObjectUpdater::ObjectUpdater(diff);\n        updateTime\
      \ = currentUpdateTime;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game loop and should be called
    regularly to maintain proper object state. The implementation may involve multiple
    internal update passes for different categories of objects (players, creatures,
    etc.). Performance considerations include avoiding excessive processing time in
    this method as it directly affects overall server responsiveness.
  warnings: Calling this method with incorrect or zero time deltas can cause erratic
    behavior in object movement and AI. This method should not be called from multiple
    threads simultaneously without proper synchronization mechanisms.
