  method: GetOutdoorPvP
  signature: OutdoorPvP * OutdoorPvPScript::GetOutdoorPvP(Map * map) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the OutdoorPvP object associated with the specified map.
  description: The GetOutdoorPvP method is used to obtain a pointer to the OutdoorPvP
    instance that manages the given Map. This is typically called during map initialization
    or when handling outdoor PvP-related events. The method ensures that only one
    OutdoorPvP instance exists per map and returns a valid pointer if the map supports
    outdoor PvP mechanics. If the map does not have an associated OutdoorPvP instance,
    it will return nullptr.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the OutdoorPvP object managing the specified map, or nullptr
    if no such instance exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "OutdoorPvP* outdoorPvp = script->GetOutdoorPvP(map);\nif (outdoorPvp)\n\
      {\n    // Perform operations with the OutdoorPvP instance\n    outdoorPvp->Update(0);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Event Handling Context
    code: "void OnPlayerEnter(Map* map, Player* player)\n{\n    OutdoorPvP* pvp =\
      \ GetOutdoorPvP(map);\n    if (pvp && pvp->IsEnabled())\n    {\n        // Handle\
      \ player entering PvP zone\n        pvp->HandlePlayerEnter(player);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in OutdoorPvP script implementations to access
    the PvP zone's management object. It relies on internal map-to-OutdoorPvP mapping
    which is established during server initialization or when the map is first loaded.
  warnings: Ensure that the Map pointer passed to this method is valid and has been
    properly initialized before calling GetOutdoorPvP. Calling this method with an
    invalid or uninitialized map may lead to undefined behavior.
