  class: SurvivalHunterRefactored
  method: HandleDeadZone
  signature: void SurvivalHunterRefactored::HandleDeadZone(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the dead zone logic for a survival hunter, likely managing threat
    or positioning behavior when the hunter is in a vulnerable state.
  description: "The HandleDeadZone method is responsible for implementing specific\
    \ behavioral logic within the SurvivalHunterRefactored AI class. This method is\
    \ designed to manage how the hunter responds when entering or being in a 'dead\
    \ zone'\u2014a game mechanic that typically represents a dangerous area where\
    \ the hunter's actions are restricted or modified. The method likely adjusts the\
    \ hunter's threat generation, positioning, or ability usage based on its current\
    \ state and proximity to enemies or environmental hazards. It may also handle\
    \ transitions between different combat states, such as switching from aggressive\
    \ to defensive behavior when the hunter is at risk."
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer parameter that likely represents a state flag,
      threat level, or zone identifier. The exact meaning depends on the implementation
      context and how it's used within the AI decision-making process.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void SurvivalHunterRefactored::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other\
      \ logic ...\n    int deadZoneState = GetDeadZoneStatus();\n    HandleDeadZone(&deadZoneState);\n\
      \    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Threat Management System
    code: "void SurvivalHunterRefactored::HandleDeadZone(int* param0)\n{\n    if (*param0\
      \ > 0)\n    {\n        // Adjust behavior based on dead zone state\n       \
      \ SetMeleeAttack(false);\n        UseAbility(SPELL_DEAD_ZONE_ESCAPE);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI decision-making framework for a survival hunter
    class. It's expected to be called during regular AI update cycles and may influence
    combat behavior, ability usage, or positioning. The parameter passed should be
    carefully managed to ensure consistent state transitions.
  warnings: Improper handling of the integer parameter could lead to incorrect AI
    behavior or unexpected state changes. Ensure that param0 is properly initialized
    before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
