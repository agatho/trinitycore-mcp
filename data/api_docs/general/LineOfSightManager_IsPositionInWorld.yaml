  method: IsPositionInWorld
  signature: bool LineOfSightManager::IsPositionInWorld(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given position is within the boundaries of the game
    world.
  description: The IsPositionInWorld method checks if a specified position, represented
    by an integer identifier, lies within the valid boundaries of the game world.
    This utility function is commonly used in pathfinding, line-of-sight calculations,
    and spatial queries to ensure that positions being evaluated are not outside the
    playable area. The method likely performs bounds checking against internal world
    dimensions or grid systems used by TrinityCore's map management system.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer identifier representing a position in the game world.
      This parameter is expected to be a unique identifier for a specific location,
      possibly derived from coordinates or grid references within the world system.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is within the valid world boundaries;
    otherwise, returns false. A return value of false typically indicates that the
    position is either outside the map limits or invalid in the context of the current
    world instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to validate a position
    code: "LineOfSightManager losManager;\nint testPosition = 12345;\nbool isValid\
      \ = losManager.IsPositionInWorld(testPosition);\nif (isValid)\n{\n    // Proceed\
      \ with operations using the valid position\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using within a line-of-sight check
    code: "LineOfSightManager losManager;\nint startPosition = 54321;\nint endPosition\
      \ = 67890;\n\nif (losManager.IsPositionInWorld(startPosition) && losManager.IsPositionInWorld(endPosition))\n\
      {\n    // Both positions are valid, proceed with LOS calculation\n    bool hasClearPath\
      \ = CalculateLineOfSight(startPosition, endPosition);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using internal world boundary data structures
    and may involve coordinate system transformations. It's important to note that
    the parameter 'pos' should represent a valid position identifier as expected by
    the LineOfSightManager class, which might be based on grid coordinates or other
    spatial referencing systems.
  warnings: Ensure that the input parameter represents a valid position identifier
    before calling this method. Invalid identifiers may lead to unexpected behavior
    or incorrect results when evaluating world boundaries.
