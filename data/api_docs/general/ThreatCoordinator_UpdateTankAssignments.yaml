documentation:
  brief: Updates the current tank assignments for threat management in the creature's
    AI system.
  description: The UpdateTankAssignments method is responsible for recalculating and
    assigning the primary and secondary threat targets (tanks) for a creature's AI
    behavior. This method ensures that the creature properly identifies which player
    or unit currently holds the highest threat level, and manages the assignment of
    tank roles to maintain proper combat dynamics within the World of Warcraft environment.
    It typically runs during each AI update cycle to ensure accurate threat distribution
    and tank switching based on current combat conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    threatCoordinator->UpdateTankAssignments();\n    // ... rest of AI logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system during regular
    update cycles and should not be invoked manually unless implementing custom threat
    management behavior. The method may trigger tank switching events if a new higher
    threat target is detected.
