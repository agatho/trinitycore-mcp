  class: QuestEventBus
  method: GetQueueSnapshot
  signature: int QuestEventBus::GetQueueSnapshot() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current number of queued quest events in the QuestEventBus.
  description: The GetQueueSnapshot method returns an integer representing the total
    count of quest events currently pending in the event queue of the QuestEventBus.
    This snapshot provides insight into the backlog of quest-related events that have
    been scheduled but not yet processed. The method is typically used for monitoring,
    debugging, or performance analysis purposes to understand how many events are
    queued at any given time. It does not modify the queue state and is safe to call
    from any thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value indicating the number of quest events currently queued
    in the QuestEventBus. A return value of zero means no events are pending, while
    a positive value indicates the count of queued events.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Queue Size
    code: "int queuedEvents = sQuestEventBus->GetQueueSnapshot();\nif (queuedEvents\
      \ > 100)\n{\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Warning: %d quest events\
      \ are queued.\", queuedEvents);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a non-blocking read of the current queue size. It is
    optimized for frequent calls and does not perform any locking or synchronization
    overhead during execution. The returned value reflects the state at the moment
    of the call and may change immediately after.
  warnings: Because this method returns a snapshot, it's possible that the actual
    number of events in the queue could differ by the time the result is used, especially
    if other threads are actively queuing or processing events.
