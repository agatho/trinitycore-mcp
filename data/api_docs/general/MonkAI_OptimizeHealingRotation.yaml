  signature: void MonkAI::OptimizeHealingRotation()
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the healing rotation for a Monk AI by evaluating and selecting
    the most effective healing abilities based on current combat conditions and target
    health.
  description: The OptimizeHealingRotation method is responsible for determining the
    optimal sequence of healing spells and abilities for a Monk AI character. This
    method evaluates various factors including target health percentages, available
    mana, cooldowns of healing abilities, and the presence of beneficial effects or
    debuffs on targets. It dynamically adjusts the healing priority to maximize efficiency
    and ensure that the most critical targets receive healing in a timely manner.
    The method is typically called during the AI's decision-making cycle to update
    its current healing strategy based on real-time game state information.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void MyMonkAI::Update()\n{\n    // Other AI logic...\n    OptimizeHealingRotation();\n\
      \    // Continue with other actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Logic
    code: "void MonkAI::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    // Initialize healing rotation when\
      \ entering combat\n    OptimizeHealingRotation();\n}\n\nvoid MonkAI::OnTargetChanged(Unit*\
      \ newTarget)\n{\n    // Re-evaluate healing rotation when target changes\n \
      \   OptimizeHealingRotation();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI decision-making process and should be
    called frequently during active combat. The optimization considers both immediate
    healing needs and long-term resource management, including mana conservation and
    cooldown tracking. It's recommended to call this method before executing any healing
    actions to ensure the most up-to-date rotation strategy.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat or AI decision-making contexts
    as it may cause unexpected behavior. The method assumes that target information
    and player state are properly initialized before execution. Calling this method
    too frequently without proper cooldown management may lead to performance degradation
    in high-frequency update scenarios.
