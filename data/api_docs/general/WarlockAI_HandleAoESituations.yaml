documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and responds to area-of-effect combat situations for the warlock
    AI.
  description: The HandleAoESituations method is responsible for assessing the current
    battlefield environment and determining appropriate actions when multiple enemies
    are present within an area-of-effect range. This method evaluates enemy positioning,
    threat levels, and available AoE spells to optimize spell selection and targeting.
    It ensures that the warlock AI prioritizes the most effective AoE abilities based
    on combat conditions and player capabilities. The method typically integrates
    with the broader AI decision-making framework to dynamically adapt to changing
    combat scenarios.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void WarlockAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    HandleAoESituations();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should be
    invoked after basic threat assessment but before individual spell selection. The
    implementation may vary between different warlock specializations (Affliction,
    Demonology, Destruction) as each has distinct AoE capabilities and priorities.
  warnings: Care must be taken when calling this method in contexts where enemy positioning
    or threat levels have not been properly updated, as it could lead to suboptimal
    spell selection. The method assumes that the AI's target list and threat calculations
    are current before execution.
