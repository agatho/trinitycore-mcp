  class: DungeonScript
  method: HandlePositioning
  signature: void DungeonScript::HandlePositioning(int * player, int * boss)
documentation:
  brief: Positions players and boss entities within a dungeon scenario.
  description: The HandlePositioning method is responsible for managing the spatial
    arrangement of player characters and boss entities during dungeon encounters.
    This method typically handles the initial placement, movement, or repositioning
    of units within the dungeon environment to ensure proper gameplay mechanics and
    encounter flow. It may be invoked at various stages of a dungeon script execution,
    such as when a boss is engaged, during phase transitions, or when resetting the
    encounter. The method operates on integer pointers representing player and boss
    identifiers, allowing for dynamic positioning adjustments based on encounter logic.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier (GUID) that
      needs to be positioned within the dungeon.
  - name: boss
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the boss identifier (GUID) that
      requires positioning during the dungeon encounter.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Positioning Usage
    code: "void example() {\n    int playerGuid = 12345;\n    int bossGuid = 67890;\n\
      \    dungeonScript->HandlePositioning(&playerGuid, &bossGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Positioning in Encounter
    code: "void HandleBossEngage() {\n    for (auto& player : playersInDungeon) {\n\
      \        int* playerPtr = &player->GetGUID();\n        int* bossPtr = &boss->GetGUID();\n\
      \        dungeonScript->HandlePositioning(playerPtr, bossPtr);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically part of a larger dungeon encounter script system
    and may interact with AI pathfinding or zone management systems. It assumes valid
    GUIDs are passed through the pointers and does not perform validation checks on
    them.
  warnings: Passing invalid or null pointers to this method can lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure that player and boss identifiers are valid before invoking this
    method.
