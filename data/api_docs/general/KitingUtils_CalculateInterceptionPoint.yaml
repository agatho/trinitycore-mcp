  class: KitingUtils
  method: CalculateInterceptionPoint
  signature: int KitingUtils::CalculateInterceptionPoint(const int & target, const
    int & targetVel, const int & interceptor, float interceptorSpeed)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the interception point for a moving target and an interceptor
    with specified speed.
  description: The CalculateInterceptionPoint method computes the position at which
    an interceptor, moving at a given speed, will meet a target that is also moving.
    This utility is commonly used in game mechanics involving pursuit or evasion behaviors,
    such as calculating where a hunter's arrow will hit a fleeing mob or where a player's
    ability will intercept an enemy's movement path. The method assumes both entities
    move in straight lines at constant velocities and calculates the point of intersection
    based on their current positions and speeds.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The current position of the target entity (e.g., mob or player).
  - name: targetVel
    description: The velocity vector or speed of the target's movement (can be positive
      or negative depending on direction).
  - name: interceptor
    description: The current position of the interceptor entity (e.g., hunter, spell,
      or projectile).
  - name: interceptorSpeed
    description: The constant speed at which the interceptor moves towards the target.
      Must be a positive float value.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the calculated interception point along
    the path of movement. The exact meaning depends on the coordinate system used
    in the game world, but typically corresponds to a position value (e.g., distance
    or coordinate) where the interceptor should move to intercept the target.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for calculating interception point
    code: 'int targetPos = 100;

      int targetVelocity = 5;

      int interceptorPos = 20;

      float interceptorSpeed = 10.0f;

      int result = KitingUtils::CalculateInterceptionPoint(targetPos, targetVelocity,
      interceptorPos, interceptorSpeed);

      // Result represents the calculated point where interceptor meets target'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes linear motion and constant speeds for both entities.
    It does not account for acceleration, turning radius, or complex movement patterns.
    For accurate results in dynamic environments, additional checks or adjustments
    may be required.
  warnings: Ensure that interceptorSpeed is a positive value; negative values may
    lead to incorrect calculations. Also, if the interceptor speed is less than the
    target's velocity, the interception point might not exist or could be behind the
    target.
