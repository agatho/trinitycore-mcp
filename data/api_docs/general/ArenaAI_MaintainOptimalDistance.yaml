  class: ArenaAI
  method: MaintainOptimalDistance
  signature: bool ArenaAI::MaintainOptimalDistance(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Maintains optimal distance between the arena AI unit and its target player
    during combat.
  description: The MaintainOptimalDistance method is responsible for controlling the
    movement behavior of an ArenaAI unit to ensure it maintains a strategic distance
    from its target player during arena combat. This method evaluates the current
    positioning of both the AI unit and the player, determining whether the AI should
    move closer, retreat, or remain stationary based on combat mechanics and arena-specific
    rules. It is typically called during the AI's update cycle to dynamically adjust
    positioning for optimal engagement. The method returns true if the distance was
    successfully maintained or adjusted, and false if no action was taken or if the
    target is invalid.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or index
      within the arena context. This parameter allows the AI to locate and track the
      specific target it should maintain distance from.
  returns: Returns true if the optimal distance was successfully maintained or adjusted,
    indicating that the AI unit has taken appropriate movement actions. Returns false
    if no action was needed or if an error occurred during distance calculation or
    adjustment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in arena combat
    code: "if (arenaAI->MaintainOptimalDistance(&targetPlayerId)) {\n    // Distance\
      \ maintained successfully\n    // Continue with other AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI update loop
    code: "void ArenaAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (Unit* target = GetVictim())\
      \ {\n        int playerId = target->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n        MaintainOptimalDistance(&playerId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core arena AI behavior system in TrinityCore,
    where positioning is critical for competitive gameplay. The optimal distance may
    vary based on the unit's class and abilities. The method assumes that the player
    pointer refers to a valid target within the arena context.
  warnings: Ensure that the player parameter points to a valid player entity; otherwise,
    the method may return false or cause undefined behavior. This method should not
    be called outside of combat or arena contexts where distance control is relevant.
