  class: BotResourcePool
  method: IsSessionReusable
  signature: bool BotResourcePool::IsSessionReusable(const std::shared_ptr<BotSession>
    & session)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot session can be reused for another bot.
  description: The IsSessionReusable method evaluates whether a given bot session
    is eligible for reuse by checking various internal conditions such as session
    state, resource availability, and bot activity status. This method is typically
    used in bot management systems to optimize resource allocation and prevent conflicts
    when multiple bots are operating within the same environment. The method ensures
    that only sessions which are not currently active or in an invalid state are considered
    for reuse.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: A shared pointer to the BotSession object that is being evaluated
      for reusability. This parameter must not be null; passing a null session will
      result in undefined behavior.
  returns: Returns true if the bot session can be safely reused, otherwise returns
    false. A return value of true indicates that the session's resources are available
    and it is not currently engaged in active operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check session reusability
    code: "std::shared_ptr<BotSession> session = botPool->GetAvailableSession();\n\
      if (botPool->IsSessionReusable(session)) {\n    // Reuse the session for a new\
      \ bot\n    botPool->AssignSessionToBot(session, newBot);\n} else {\n    // Create\
      \ a new session instead\n    botPool->CreateNewSession(newBot);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsSessionReusable in a loop to find reusable sessions
    code: "for (auto& existingSession : botPool->GetAllSessions()) {\n    if (botPool->IsSessionReusable(existingSession))\
      \ {\n        // Found a reusable session\n        botPool->AssignSessionToBot(existingSession,\
      \ newBot);\n        break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs lightweight checks on session state and should not introduce
    significant performance overhead. It is recommended to cache the result of this
    check if it's used multiple times in quick succession.
  warnings: Do not pass null pointers to this method as it will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Always validate that the session pointer is valid before
    calling IsSessionReusable.
