  method: IsConnectionIdle
  signature: bool BotSession::IsConnectionIdle() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot session's connection is currently idle.
  description: The IsConnectionIdle method determines if the bot session's network
    connection has been inactive for a specified period. This is typically used to
    identify when a bot session can be safely terminated or put into a low-power state.
    The method evaluates the last activity timestamp of the connection and compares
    it against a configured idle timeout threshold. If the time elapsed since the
    last activity exceeds this threshold, the connection is considered idle.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot session's connection has been idle for longer than
    the configured timeout period; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (botSession.IsConnectionIdle()) {\n    // Handle idle connection\n \
      \   botSession.Disconnect();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Connection Status
    code: "void MonitorBotSession(BotSession& session) {\n    if (session.IsConnectionIdle())\
      \ {\n        sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_BOTS, \"Bot session is idle, cleaning\
      \ up resources.\");\n        // Perform cleanup tasks\n    } else {\n      \
      \  sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_BOTS, \"Bot session is active.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate timestamp tracking of the last network activity.
    The idle timeout value is configurable and typically set based on game server
    requirements and bot behavior patterns.
  warnings: Do not assume that an idle connection will remain idle indefinitely; network
    conditions can change rapidly. Always validate connection state before performing
    operations that require active communication.
