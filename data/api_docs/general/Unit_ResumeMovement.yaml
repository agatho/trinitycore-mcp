  class: Unit
  method: ResumeMovement
  signature: void Unit::ResumeMovement(uint32 timer, uint8 slot)
documentation:
  brief: Resumes movement of a unit after it has been suspended.
  description: The ResumeMovement method is used to restore movement functionality
    for a Unit object that was previously suspended, typically through the PauseMovement
    method. This method allows the unit to continue its movement behavior after being
    paused, with optional delay and slot parameters to control timing and execution
    context. It is commonly used in AI scripts or movement-related code where units
    need to be temporarily suspended and then resumed.
  parameters:
  - name: timer
    description: The delay in milliseconds before resuming movement. A value of 0
      means immediate resume, while higher values indicate delayed execution.
  - name: slot
    description: The movement slot identifier that determines which movement state
      to resume. This is typically used for controlling different movement types or
      states within the unit's movement system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = GetUnit();

      unit->ResumeMovement(0, 0);

      // Resumes movement immediately'
    language: cpp
  - title: Delayed resume example
    code: 'Unit* unit = GetUnit();

      unit->ResumeMovement(1000, 1);

      // Resumes movement after 1 second with slot 1'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with PauseMovement to control
    unit behavior during AI execution. It may be called from within movement-related
    scripts or event handlers, and the timer parameter allows for precise control
    over when movement resumes. Implementation details include handling of movement
    state tracking and ensuring proper synchronization between pause/resume operations.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method with different slot values
    as it may affect specific movement states or behaviors. Incorrect use of timer
    or slot parameters can lead to unexpected movement behavior or timing issues in
    AI scripts.
