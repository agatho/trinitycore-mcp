  class: FlightMasterManager
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: const Statistics & FlightMasterManager::GetStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flight master statistics including total flights, completed
    routes, and travel data.
  description: The GetStatistics method returns a constant reference to the internal
    Statistics structure that holds comprehensive data about the flight master's performance
    and usage. This includes metrics such as the number of flights taken, total travel
    time, route completions, and other relevant flight-related statistics. The returned
    Statistics object is immutable and should not be modified directly. This method
    is typically used for logging, debugging, or providing administrative insights
    into flight master usage patterns within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the Statistics structure containing flight master
    usage metrics including total flights, completed routes, travel time data, and
    other relevant statistics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'const FlightMasterManager& fm = ...;

      const auto& stats = fm.GetStatistics();

      std::cout << "Total Flights: " << stats.totalFlights << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Statistics for Logging
    code: "void LogFlightMasterStats() {\n    const FlightMasterManager& fm = sObjectMgr->GetFlightMasterManager();\n\
      \    const auto& stats = fm.GetStatistics();\n    LOG_INFO(\"server\", \"Flight\
      \ Master Stats - Flights: {}, Routes: {}\", \n             stats.totalFlights,\
      \ stats.completedRoutes);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Statistics object is read-only and reflects the state at the
    time of the method call. Modifications to the statistics must be done through
    dedicated setter methods or internal update mechanisms. The method is thread-safe
    as it only returns const references to immutable data.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the returned Statistics reference directly, as
    it is a constant reference. Any modifications should be made through appropriate
    interfaces or methods designed for updating flight master statistics.
