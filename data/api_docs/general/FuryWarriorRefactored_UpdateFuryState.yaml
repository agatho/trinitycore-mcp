  method: UpdateFuryState
  signature: void FuryWarriorRefactored::UpdateFuryState(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the fury state of a Fury Warrior based on target unit.
  description: The UpdateFuryState method is responsible for recalculating and applying
    the current fury state of a Fury Warrior class character. This method typically
    manages the warrior's fury resource, which influences various combat abilities
    and passive effects. It evaluates the provided target unit to determine how fury
    should be modified or consumed, potentially triggering fury-based abilities or
    updating internal fury counters. The method is commonly called during combat events
    such as attacks, abilities usage, or state transitions to ensure the warrior's
    fury status remains accurate and up-to-date.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target Unit that influences the fury state update.
      This parameter defines the context for how fury should be handled, such as whether
      to consume fury for an attack or modify fury based on target type.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: 'FuryWarriorRefactored* warrior = ...;

      Unit* target = player->GetSelectedUnit();

      warrior->UpdateFuryState(target);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Fury State After Ability Cast
    code: 'FuryWarriorRefactored* warrior = ...;

      Unit* target = ...;

      // Perform some fury-consuming ability

      warrior->UpdateFuryState(target); // Re-evaluate fury state after ability use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely invoked frequently during combat, so performance considerations
    are important. It may interact with other fury-related systems such as rage conversion
    or fury-based cooldowns. Ensure that the target parameter is valid before calling
    to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid target unit can lead to unexpected
    behavior or crashes. The method assumes that the warrior has an active combat
    state and may not behave correctly if called outside of combat scenarios.
