  class: AuctionEventBus
  method: DeliverEvent
  signature: void AuctionEventBus::DeliverEvent(const AuctionEvent & event)
documentation:
  brief: Delivers an auction event to all registered listeners in the auction event
    bus.
  description: 'The DeliverEvent method broadcasts a given AuctionEvent to all subscribers
    of the AuctionEventBus. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore auction
    system to notify interested parties about events such as item sales, bids, or
    auction timeouts. It ensures that all components interested in auction-related
    activities receive timely updates. The method does not return any value and operates
    synchronously, meaning it will block until all listeners have processed the event.
    Precondition: The AuctionEvent must be properly initialized before being passed
    to this method. Postcondition: All registered listeners will have received and
    processed the event.'
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The AuctionEvent object containing details about the auction event
      that needs to be delivered to all subscribers. This parameter must not be null
      or invalid.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Delivery
    code: 'AuctionEvent auctionEvent;

      // Initialize auctionEvent with relevant data

      AuctionEventBus::Instance()->DeliverEvent(auctionEvent);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Delivering a Bid Event
    code: 'AuctionEvent bidEvent;

      bidEvent.type = AUCTION_BID_PLACED;

      bidEvent.itemId = 12345;

      bidEvent.bidAmount = 10000;

      AuctionEventBus::Instance()->DeliverEvent(bidEvent);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the event-driven architecture used in TrinityCore's
    auction system. It is designed to be thread-safe and should not be called from
    within a critical section where deadlocks might occur. Performance-wise, it may
    become a bottleneck if too many listeners are registered or if they perform heavy
    processing during event handling.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or uninitialized AuctionEvent object
    can lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that all fields of the AuctionEvent are
    properly set before delivery. Avoid calling DeliverEvent from within another event
    handler to prevent potential recursive calls or stack overflow issues.
