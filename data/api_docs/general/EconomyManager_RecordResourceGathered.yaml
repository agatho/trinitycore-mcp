  signature: void EconomyManager::RecordResourceGathered(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Records the gathering of a resource item for economy tracking purposes.
  description: The RecordResourceGathered method logs the collection of a specific
    resource item within the game's economy system. This function is typically invoked
    when a player successfully gathers a resource such as ore, herbs, or other materials
    from the environment. It updates internal tracking mechanisms to monitor resource
    availability, player activity, and potentially triggers related economy events
    or achievements. The method does not return any value but contributes to the overall
    economic data model used by TrinityCore's economy manager.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item that was gathered. This must correspond
      to a valid item entry in the game's database, typically representing a resource
      such as ore, herb, or mineral.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'EconomyManager* economyMgr = sEconomyManager;

      economyMgr->RecordResourceGathered(12345); // Records gathering of item with
      ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Player Interaction Context
    code: "void Player::OnGatherResource(uint32 itemId)\n{\n    // Perform gathering\
      \ logic here\n    sEconomyManager->RecordResourceGathered(itemId);\n    // Additional\
      \ processing...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal databases or tracking systems
    to maintain accurate records of resource collection events. It may be used in
    conjunction with other economy-related functions like updating player statistics,
    triggering quest progress, or modifying world state variables.
