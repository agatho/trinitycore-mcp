  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: SetFollowMode
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::SetFollowMode(FollowMode mode)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the follow mode for a leader-follower behavior in the AI system.
  description: The SetFollowMode method configures the behavior of a leader-follower
    relationship within the TrinityCore AI framework. It determines how a follower
    unit should behave when following a leader, such as maintaining distance, staying
    close, or using specific movement patterns. This method is typically used by AI
    scripts to control unit positioning and movement during group activities like
    quests, combat, or scripted events. The follow mode affects the internal state
    of the behavior and influences subsequent movement decisions made by the follower
    unit.
  parameters:
  - name: mode
    description: The FollowMode enumeration value that specifies the desired follow
      behavior. Valid values include standard modes like FOLLOW_MODE_NORMAL, FOLLOW_MODE_DEFENSIVE,
      or FOLLOW_MODE_AGGRESSIVE depending on the implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Normal Follow Mode
    code: 'LeaderFollowBehavior* behavior = new LeaderFollowBehavior();

      behavior->SetFollowMode(FOLLOW_MODE_NORMAL);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Defensive Follow Mode
    code: "if (player->GetAI())\n{\n    LeaderFollowBehavior* followBehavior = dynamic_cast<LeaderFollowBehavior*>(player->GetAI()->GetBehavior(BEHAVIOR_LEADER_FOLLOW));\n\
      \    if (followBehavior)\n    {\n        followBehavior->SetFollowMode(FOLLOW_MODE_DEFENSIVE);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the LeaderFollowBehavior
    object and may trigger immediate updates to the follower's movement behavior.
    The actual implementation may vary based on the specific AI module being used,
    as different behaviors might interpret the same mode differently.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring that the behavior is properly initialized
    or associated with a valid leader-follower relationship may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always verify that the behavior object and its parent AI
    context are correctly set up before invoking this method.
