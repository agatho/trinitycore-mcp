  class: DependencyValidator
  method: ValidateAllDependencies
  signature: bool DependencyValidator::ValidateAllDependencies()
documentation:
  brief: Validates all dependencies within the system and returns true if all dependencies
    are satisfied, false otherwise.
  description: The ValidateAllDependencies method performs a comprehensive check of
    all registered dependencies in the TrinityCore system. It ensures that required
    components, libraries, or configurations are properly initialized and available
    before allowing further operations to proceed. This method is typically used during
    system startup, module loading, or configuration validation phases. The validation
    process may include checking database connections, verifying file paths, ensuring
    required services are running, and confirming that all necessary subsystems have
    been correctly initialized. The method returns immediately upon encountering the
    first failed dependency check, making it efficient for early failure detection.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all dependencies are successfully validated and satisfied,
    false if any dependency fails validation. A return value of false typically indicates
    a critical system issue that must be resolved before the application can function
    properly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Dependency Validation
    code: "if (DependencyValidator::ValidateAllDependencies()) {\n    // All dependencies\
      \ are satisfied, proceed with normal operation\n    LOG_INFO(\"server\", \"\
      All system dependencies validated successfully\");\n} else {\n    // Critical\
      \ dependency failure detected\n    LOG_ERROR(\"server\", \"Failed to validate\
      \ system dependencies\");\n    // Handle the error appropriately\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization and module loading
    phases. It may perform blocking operations while checking dependencies, so it
    should not be called from time-critical code paths. The validation process might
    vary depending on the specific TrinityCore build configuration and installed modules.
  warnings: Do not call this method in performance-sensitive contexts as it may block
    execution while performing dependency checks. If this method returns false, the
    system is in an unstable state and should not be used until all reported dependencies
    are resolved.
