  class: GridCell
  method: IsOccupied
  signature: bool GridCell::IsOccupied() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the grid cell contains any objects or units.
  description: The IsOccupied method checks if a GridCell has any entities, such as
    players, creatures, game objects, or dynamic objects currently present within
    its boundaries. This is a critical utility for pathfinding, object management,
    and spatial queries in the TrinityCore world system. The method performs a simple
    check on internal occupancy flags or container sizes to determine if the cell
    is considered occupied. It does not perform any complex calculations or external
    lookups, making it efficient for frequent checks during world updates or AI processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the grid cell contains at least one object or unit; otherwise
    returns false. This indicates that the cell is currently in use by active entities
    within the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Occupancy Check
    code: "GridCell* cell = player->GetMap()->GetGrid(x, y);\nif (cell->IsOccupied())\
      \ {\n    // Handle occupied cell logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Grid cell at (%u,\
      \ %u) is occupied.\", x, y);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Pathfinding
    code: "if (!gridCell->IsOccupied()) {\n    // Add to valid path nodes\n    validNodes.push_back(gridCell);\n\
      } else {\n    // Skip or mark as blocked\n    blockedNodes.push_back(gridCell);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with grid-based spatial partitioning
    systems. It relies on internal tracking of entities within the grid, so it's important
    to ensure that entity movement updates are properly synchronized with grid state
    changes. The method is thread-safe for read operations when used correctly with
    proper locking mechanisms.
  warnings: Do not rely solely on this method for critical pathfinding decisions without
    considering additional factors like object type or movement restrictions. Also,
    be aware that the occupancy status may change between the time you check IsOccupied
    and when you act upon it, especially in multi-threaded environments.
