  signature: uint32 DeathRecoveryManager::GetResurrectionSicknessSpellId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the spell ID associated with resurrection sickness.
  description: The GetResurrectionSicknessSpellId method retrieves the unique identifier
    of the spell that represents the resurrection sickness effect in World of Warcraft.
    This spell is applied to players who have been resurrected, typically causing
    temporary debuffs such as reduced movement speed or mana regeneration. The returned
    value corresponds to an entry in the Spell.dbc file and is used internally by
    the TrinityCore server to apply and manage the resurrection sickness state. This
    method does not take any parameters and returns a uint32 representing the spell
    ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the spell ID of the resurrection sickness effect.
    This ID maps to an entry in the Spell.dbc database file which defines the properties
    and behavior of the resurrection sickness spell.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 sicknessSpellId = deathRecoveryMgr.GetResurrectionSicknessSpellId();\n\
      if (sicknessSpellId != 0)\n{\n    // Apply the resurrection sickness spell to\
      \ a player\n    player->AddAura(sicknessSpellId, player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with death and resurrection
    handling logic within the TrinityCore framework. The returned spell ID may vary
    between different World of Warcraft expansions or custom configurations. It's
    important to note that this method returns a constant value based on server configuration
    and does not dynamically change during runtime.
