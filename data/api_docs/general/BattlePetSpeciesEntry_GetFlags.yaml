documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flag bitmask associated with a battle pet species entry.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the combined
    flags that define various properties and behaviors of a specific battle pet species
    within the TrinityCore framework. These flags are typically used to determine
    if a pet species has special characteristics such as being a companion, having
    unique mechanics, or being restricted in certain contexts. The returned bitmask
    can be evaluated using bitwise operations to check for specific flag states. This
    method is commonly used during pet initialization, validation, and gameplay logic
    where the behavior of a pet needs to be determined based on its defined flags.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the combined flag bitmask for the battle pet species.
    Each bit in the integer corresponds to a specific property or behavior of the
    pet species. Common flag values may include bits indicating if the pet is a companion,
    if it has special abilities, or if it's restricted from certain game modes.
  examples:
  - title: Checking for Companion Flag
    code: "BattlePetSpeciesEntry* entry = sBattlePetSpeciesStore.LookupEntry(12345);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    int flags = entry->GetFlags();\n    if (flags & 0x01) //\
      \ Assuming 0x01 represents companion flag\n    {\n        // Pet is a companion\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validating Battle Pet Restrictions
    code: "BattlePetSpeciesEntry* entry = sBattlePetSpeciesStore.LookupEntry(67890);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    int flags = entry->GetFlags();\n    if (flags & 0x10) //\
      \ Assuming 0x10 represents restricted flag\n    {\n        // Pet is restricted\
      \ in current game mode\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The exact meaning of each bit within the returned flag value is defined by
    the game's internal constants and may vary between different versions of TrinityCore.
    Developers should consult the relevant header files or documentation for specific
    flag definitions. The method is safe to call from any thread context as long as
    the BattlePetSpeciesEntry object itself is properly synchronized.
  warnings: The returned integer value represents a bitmask, so direct comparisons
    against flag values should be done using bitwise AND operations rather than equality
    checks. Incorrectly interpreting or modifying these flags can lead to unexpected
    behavior in battle pet mechanics and gameplay.
