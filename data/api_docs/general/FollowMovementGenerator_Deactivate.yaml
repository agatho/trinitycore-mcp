  class: FollowMovementGenerator
  method: Deactivate
  signature: void FollowMovementGenerator::Deactivate(Unit * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Deactivates the follow movement generator, stopping the unit from following
    its target.
  description: The Deactivate method is used to halt the execution of a follow movement
    generator. When called, it stops the unit from continuing to follow its assigned
    target. This method is typically invoked when the follow behavior needs to be
    terminated, such as when the target becomes unreachable or when the movement generator
    is being removed from the unit's movement list. The method does not reset the
    generator state but rather disables its active operation.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that owns the movement generator. This
      parameter specifies which unit's follow behavior should be deactivated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Deactivation Example
    code: 'Unit* target = ...; // some unit

      FollowMovementGenerator* followGen = new FollowMovementGenerator(target);

      followGen->Deactivate(target); // Deactivates the movement generator for the
      target unit'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the MovementGenerator system in TrinityCore and is
    typically called internally by the AI or movement subsystem. It does not free
    memory or destroy the generator object itself.
