  brief: Removes completed quests from the player's quest log and updates associated
    quest data.
  description: The CleanupCompletedQuests method is responsible for removing all completed
    quests from a player's active quest log within the Dynamic Quest System. This
    function ensures that quest data is properly cleaned up after completion, preventing
    duplicate entries or stale information in the system. It typically handles the
    removal of quest tracking data, updates quest status flags, and may perform cleanup
    operations on related quest objects or dependencies. The method is usually invoked
    automatically when a player finishes a quest or during periodic maintenance routines
    to keep the quest log clean and efficient.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'DynamicQuestSystem* questSystem = player->GetDynamicQuestSystem();

      questSystem->CleanupCompletedQuests();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly to maintain optimal performance of
    the quest system. It may trigger additional cleanup operations on quest-related
    data structures and should not be called during active quest interactions to avoid
    potential race conditions.
  warnings: Calling this method while a player is actively engaged in quest completion
    or while quest events are being processed may lead to inconsistent state or data
    corruption. Always ensure the player's quest state is stable before invoking this
    cleanup routine.
