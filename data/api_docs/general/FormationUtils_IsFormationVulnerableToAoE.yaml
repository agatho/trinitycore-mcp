  class: FormationUtils
  method: IsFormationVulnerableToAoE
  signature: bool FormationUtils::IsFormationVulnerableToAoE(FormationType formation,
    float aoERadius)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given formation is vulnerable to area-of-effect attacks
    based on its type and the radius of the attack.
  description: The IsFormationVulnerableToAoE method evaluates if a specific formation
    type is susceptible to area-of-effect (AoE) damage. It takes into account the
    structural characteristics of different formations and how they interact with
    AoE mechanics in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment. This utility function
    is typically used by AI systems or game logic to make decisions about targeting,
    positioning, or spell casting strategies. The method considers formation types
    such as linear, circular, or clustered arrangements and assesses their vulnerability
    based on predefined thresholds and game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: formation
    description: The FormationType enum value representing the specific formation
      configuration to evaluate for AoE vulnerability.
  - name: aoERadius
    description: A float value indicating the radius of the area-of-effect attack
      that is being tested against the formation. This determines how much of the
      formation is affected by the attack.
  returns: Returns true if the specified formation is considered vulnerable to the
    given AoE attack, false otherwise. Vulnerability is determined based on formation
    structure and AoE radius relative to formation density or spread.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (FormationUtils::IsFormationVulnerableToAoE(FormationType::LINEAR, 5.0f))\
      \ {\n    // Execute AoE-focused strategy\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Radius
    code: "float radius = spell.GetRadius();\nif (FormationUtils::IsFormationVulnerableToAoE(FormationType::CIRCLE,\
      \ radius)) {\n    // Cast AoE spell targeting this formation\n    caster.CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_AOE_DAMAGE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal constants or configuration data to determine
    vulnerability thresholds for different formation types. The implementation may
    be optimized for performance since it's called frequently during combat AI calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that the FormationType enum values are valid before calling this
    method, as invalid values could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
    Also note that the AoE radius should be a positive value greater than zero.
