  class: Corpse
  method: Create
  signature: bool Corpse::Create(int guidlow, int * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and sets up a corpse object with the specified GUID and owner.
  description: The Create method is responsible for initializing a Corpse object within
    the TrinityCore framework. It assigns a unique low GUID to the corpse and associates
    it with an owner, typically a player who has died. This method is crucial for
    managing player corpses in the game world, ensuring that each corpse is properly
    registered and linked to its respective player. The method performs necessary
    setup operations such as setting up the corpse's data structures, initializing
    its properties, and preparing it for storage in the database or in-memory structures.
    It also handles validation of the provided GUID and owner information before proceeding
    with the creation process.
  parameters:
  - name: guidlow
    description: The low GUID value to assign to the corpse. This should be a unique
      identifier within the server's GUID space, typically obtained from the object
      manager or database.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the GUID of the owner (typically a player) associated
      with this corpse. The value pointed to should represent a valid player GUID
      in the server's system.
  returns: Returns true if the corpse was successfully created and initialized, false
    otherwise. Failure can occur due to invalid parameters, memory allocation issues,
    or other internal errors during initialization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic corpse creation
    code: "Corpse* corpse = new Corpse();\nuint32 guidLow = sObjectMgr->GenerateLowGuid(HIGHGUID_CORPSE);\n\
      uint32 ownerGuid = player->GetGUID();\nbool success = corpse->Create(guidLow,\
      \ &ownerGuid);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Corpse created successfully\n    sObjectMgr->AddCorpse(corpse);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after allocating memory for the Corpse
    object. The GUID provided must be unique within the corpse's high GUID type space
    to prevent conflicts. The owner parameter should point to a valid player GUID,
    otherwise the behavior is undefined.
  warnings: Do not call this method on an already initialized corpse object as it
    may lead to resource leaks or inconsistent state. Ensure that the guidlow value
    is properly generated and unique before calling this method.
