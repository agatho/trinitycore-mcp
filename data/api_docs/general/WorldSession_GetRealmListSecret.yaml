documentation:
  brief: Returns the 32-byte secret used for authenticating realm list requests.
  description: The GetRealmListSecret method retrieves a 32-byte cryptographic secret
    associated with the current WorldSession. This secret is typically used during
    the authentication process when communicating with the realm list server to verify
    the identity of the client session. The returned value is a constant reference
    to an std::array<uint8, 32>, ensuring that the data cannot be modified externally
    while providing efficient access. This method is part of the secure communication
    protocol between the client and the server, helping to prevent unauthorized access
    or spoofing attempts in the realm listing system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::array<uint8, 32> containing the realm list
    authentication secret. The array holds exactly 32 bytes of binary data that serves
    as the cryptographic key for realm list communication.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the Realm List Secret
    code: "const auto& secret = session->GetRealmListSecret();\nfor (size_t i = 0;\
      \ i < secret.size(); ++i)\n{\n    printf(\"%02x\", secret[i]);\n}\nprintf(\"\
      \\n\");"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned secret is generated and managed internally by the TrinityCore
    server. It's typically tied to the session's authentication context and may be
    regenerated upon certain security events or session resets. The method is thread-safe
    as it only returns a reference to existing data without modifying any state.
