  class: RoleAssignment
  method: ExecuteDungeonStrategy
  signature: void RoleAssignment::ExecuteDungeonStrategy(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the dungeon role assignment strategy for a given group.
  description: The ExecuteDungeonStrategy method determines and assigns appropriate
    roles (such as tank, healer, or damage dealer) to players within a group for dungeon
    encounters. It evaluates each player's class, specialization, and gear to ensure
    optimal team composition. This method is typically invoked when a group enters
    a dungeon or when role reassignment is needed during gameplay. The strategy considers
    the group's overall needs and individual player capabilities to maximize efficiency
    and success rate in dungeon content.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing players who need role assignment.
      Must not be null and should contain valid players with proper class and specialization
      data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Role Assignment Execution
    code: "Group* dungeonGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (dungeonGroup && dungeonGroup->isInDungeon())\n\
      {\n    RoleAssignment roleAssign;\n    roleAssign.ExecuteDungeonStrategy(dungeonGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies group member roles in-place and may trigger UI updates
    for players. It assumes that all group members have valid class and specialization
    data. The implementation relies on internal dungeon strategy tables and player
    role preferences.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure the group contains valid players before execution. This method
    does not validate if the group is actually in a dungeon context, so calling it
    outside of proper dungeon scenarios may lead to incorrect role assignments.
