  brief: Manages and optimizes resource efficiency for Mage AI behavior.
  description: The ManageResourceEfficiency method is responsible for optimizing how
    a Mage AI character utilizes its resources, such as mana and spell cooldowns,
    to maximize damage output or survivability during combat. This method evaluates
    current resource levels, available spells, and combat conditions to determine
    the most efficient spell casting order or resource-saving strategies. It plays
    a crucial role in ensuring that the Mage AI makes optimal decisions regarding
    when and which spells to cast based on resource availability and tactical requirements.

      \    // Continue with other actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the main AI update loop of a Mage
    class. It may interact with internal state tracking for mana levels, cooldowns,
    and spell priorities. Developers should ensure that this method is not called
    too frequently to avoid performance overhead.
