documentation:
  brief: Schedules recurring guild events for all members.
  description: 'The ScheduleRecurringEvents method initializes and registers recurring
    guild events within the GuildEventCoordinator system. This method is responsible
    for setting up periodic events such as guild raids, member check-ins, or other
    time-based activities that occur regularly. It ensures that these events are properly
    scheduled and managed according to the guild''s configured schedule. The method
    operates on all guild members and sets up event timers that will trigger at predetermined
    intervals. Precondition: The GuildEventCoordinator must be initialized and have
    active guild members. Postcondition: Recurring events are scheduled and ready
    to execute.'
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.ScheduleRecurringEvents(nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the GuildEventCoordinator has been
    properly initialized with valid guild data. The method may have performance implications
    when dealing with large guilds, as it needs to schedule events for each member.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the GuildEventCoordinator
    may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure all guild members are properly
    registered before calling this method.
