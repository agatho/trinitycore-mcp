documentation:
  brief: Returns the header string associated with the instance script.
  description: The GetHeader method retrieves a constant string that represents the
    header identifier for the current instance script. This header is typically used
    to uniquely identify the script context within the instance, often corresponding
    to the instance's name or a predefined identifier. The returned string is immutable
    and should not be modified by the caller. This method is commonly used during
    instance initialization or when identifying which script handler is managing a
    specific instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the header identifier
    for this instance script. The string is guaranteed to be valid and non-empty within
    the context of an active instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "class MyInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyInstanceScript(Map*\
      \ map) : InstanceScript(map) {}\n    \n    void Initialize() override\n    {\n\
      \        std::string header = GetHeader();\n        // Use the header to identify\
      \ this instance script\n        sLog->outString(\"Instance header: %s\", header.c_str());\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned string is managed internally by the InstanceScript class and
    should not be modified. This method is safe to call during instance initialization
    or any other valid script lifecycle phase.
