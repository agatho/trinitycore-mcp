  class: GroupCoordination
  method: IsInFormation
  signature: bool GroupCoordination::IsInFormation(uint32 memberGuid, float tolerance)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a group member is within the specified formation tolerance.
  description: The IsInFormation method determines whether a specified group member
    is positioned within an acceptable distance (tolerance) from their expected formation
    position. This method is typically used in group coordination systems to verify
    that players are maintaining proper positioning during group activities such as
    raids, dungeons, or PvP scenarios. The tolerance parameter defines the maximum
    allowed deviation from the ideal formation coordinates. The method returns true
    if the member's current position is within the specified tolerance, and false
    otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: memberGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group member to check. This should
      correspond to a valid player in the current group.
  - name: tolerance
    description: The maximum allowed distance (in yards) from the expected formation
      position. Values should be non-negative, with 0 indicating exact positioning.
  returns: Returns true if the specified group member's current position is within
    the given tolerance of their expected formation position; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (groupCoordination->IsInFormation(playerGuid, 5.0f)) {\n    // Player\
      \ is within 5 yards of expected formation position\n    SendSystemMessage(\"\
      You are in formation.\");\n} else {\n    // Player is outside the formation\
      \ tolerance\n    SendSystemMessage(\"You are out of formation.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Formation Validation for Raid
    code: "uint32 raidMemberGuid = GetPlayerGUID();\nfloat formationTolerance = 3.0f;\n\
      if (!groupCoordination->IsInFormation(raidMemberGuid, formationTolerance)) {\n\
      \    // Teleport player back to formation position\n    TeleportToFormationPosition(raidMemberGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal group coordination data structures
    that track member positions and expected formation coordinates. It may be used
    in conjunction with other methods like SetFormationPosition or GetFormationPosition
    to maintain dynamic group positioning during combat or movement.
  warnings: Ensure that the memberGuid corresponds to a valid player in the current
    group, as invalid GUIDs may cause undefined behavior or errors. The tolerance
    value should be carefully chosen based on game mechanics and player movement capabilities.
