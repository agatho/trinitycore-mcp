  class: AuctionManager
  method: ScanAuctionHouse
  signature: void AuctionManager::ScanAuctionHouse(Player * bot, uint32 auctionHouseId)
documentation:
  brief: Scans the auction house for items and processes them for a given player bot.
  description: The ScanAuctionHouse method iterates through all auctions in the specified
    auction house and performs processing logic on each item. This method is typically
    used by AI bots or automated systems to analyze available auctions, compare prices,
    and make decisions based on market data. The method operates within the context
    of a specific player bot and auction house ID, allowing for targeted scanning
    of different auction houses such as those for different factions or zones. It
    does not directly modify auction data but rather analyzes existing auctions for
    strategic purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will scan
      the auction house. This player must be valid and have appropriate permissions
      to access the auction house.
  - name: auctionHouseId
    description: Unique identifier for the auction house to scan. Valid values correspond
      to predefined auction house IDs in the game database, such as 1 for Alliance
      auction houses or 2 for Horde auction houses.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Auction House Scan
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume valid bot instance

      AuctionManager::ScanAuctionHouse(myBot, 1); // Scan Alliance auction house'
    language: cpp
  - title: Scanning Multiple Auction Houses
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nfor (uint32 id : {1, 2, 3}) {\n    AuctionManager::ScanAuctionHouse(bot,\
      \ id);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal callbacks or events that allow other
    systems to react to scanned auctions. It may involve database queries and should
    be used judiciously in performance-critical contexts. The scanning process is
    typically asynchronous or batched to avoid blocking the main game thread.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided bot player object is valid and properly initialized
    before calling this method, as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined
    behavior. Also, excessive scanning may trigger anti-cheat measures or server-side
    throttling in some configurations.
