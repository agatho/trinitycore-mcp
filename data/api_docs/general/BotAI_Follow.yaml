  class: BotAI
  method: Follow
  signature: void BotAI::Follow(::Unit * target, float distance)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates following behavior for a bot unit towards a specified target at
    a given distance.
  description: The Follow method configures a bot AI to begin following a designated
    target unit at a specific distance. This method is typically used in World of
    Warcraft TrinityCore server implementations where bot characters need to track
    and move alongside other units. The bot will adjust its movement to maintain the
    specified distance from the target, handling pathfinding and movement updates
    automatically. The method does not return any value but modifies the internal
    state of the bot's AI behavior system.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that the bot should follow. Must be a
      valid unit instance; passing nullptr will result in undefined behavior or potential
      crashes.
  - name: distance
    description: The desired distance to maintain from the target unit. Should be
      a positive floating-point value representing yards. Values of zero or negative
      may cause unexpected behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Following Example
    code: 'BotAI* botAI = ...;

      Unit* targetPlayer = ...;

      botAI->Follow(targetPlayer, 3.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Following with Dynamic Distance
    code: 'BotAI* botAI = ...;

      Unit* targetNPC = ...;

      float followDistance = 5.0f;

      botAI->Follow(targetNPC, followDistance);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the target unit is valid and exists within the same map/instance
    as the bot. The bot will automatically stop following when the target becomes
    invalid or dies. This method integrates with TrinityCore's movement system and
    pathfinding algorithms to ensure smooth following behavior.
  warnings: Passing a nullptr for the target parameter may cause crashes or undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the target unit is valid and alive before calling this method.
    The distance parameter should be positive; negative values may lead to erratic
    bot movement patterns.
