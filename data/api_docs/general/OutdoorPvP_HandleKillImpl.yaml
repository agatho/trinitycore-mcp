  signature: void OutdoorPvP::HandleKillImpl(Player * param0, Unit * param1)
documentation:
  brief: Processes the kill event for a player in an OutdoorPvP zone, updating objectives
    and rewards.
  description: The HandleKillImpl method is responsible for managing the logic that
    occurs when a player kills another unit within an OutdoorPvP zone. This includes
    updating the player's kill count, checking if the kill contributes to any capture
    objectives, awarding relevant rewards or achievements, and potentially triggering
    zone-specific events. The method integrates with the broader OutdoorPvP system
    to ensure proper tracking of territorial control and player progression during
    dynamic battlefield encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Player object who performed the kill. This player's
      state and progress will be updated based on the kill event.
  - name: param1
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that was killed. This could be another
      player, NPC, or creature depending on the context of the kill.
  returns: null
  examples:

    code: "void ExampleClass::OnPlayerKill(Player* killer, Unit* killed) {\n    if\
      \ (OutdoorPvP* pvp = sOutdoorPvPMgr->GetOutdoorPvPToZoneId(killer->GetMap()->GetZoneId()))\
      \ {\n        pvp->HandleKillImpl(killer, killed);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when a kill
    event occurs in an OutdoorPvP zone. It assumes that the player and unit parameters
    are valid and not null. Developers should ensure proper validation before calling
    this method directly.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or null pointers may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that both Player and Unit objects are properly initialized
    before invoking HandleKillImpl.
