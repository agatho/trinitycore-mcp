  class: StormkeeperTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void StormkeeperTracker::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the stormkeeper tracker state for the specified player bot.
  description: The Update method in the StormkeeperTracker class is responsible for
    refreshing or recalculating the internal state of the stormkeeper tracking system
    for a given player bot. This typically involves checking the current status of
    stormkeeper-related conditions, updating any cached data, and ensuring that the
    tracker reflects the most recent game state. The method is commonly called during
    AI decision-making cycles or when specific events occur that might affect the
    stormkeeper's behavior or availability. It operates on a per-bot basis and modifies
    the tracker's internal state to maintain accuracy in bot behavior decisions.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose stormkeeper
      tracking state needs to be updated. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (m_stormkeeperTracker)\n        m_stormkeeperTracker->Update(m_bot);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Update Based on Game State
    code: "void StormkeeperManager::HandleEvent(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player\
      \ && player->IsInWorld())\n    {\n        if (player->HasAura(SPELL_STORMKEEPER_AURA))\n\
      \            m_tracker->Update(player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently during bot AI updates to ensure accurate
    tracking. It may perform operations that involve checking aura states, cooldowns,
    or other player conditions related to stormkeeper mechanics. The implementation
    assumes the player object is valid and in a world context.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'bot' parameter is not null before calling this method.
    Calling Update on an invalid or uninitialized player pointer may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Additionally, frequent calls to this method without proper
    throttling could impact performance during high-frequency AI updates.
