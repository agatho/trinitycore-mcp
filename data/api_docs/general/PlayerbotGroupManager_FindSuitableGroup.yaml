api:
  class: PlayerbotGroupManager
  method: FindSuitableGroup
  signature: uint32 PlayerbotGroupManager::FindSuitableGroup(Player * player, GroupRole
    role)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the GUID of a suitable group for the specified player based
    on their role.
  description: The FindSuitableGroup method searches through existing player groups
    to locate one that matches the specified GroupRole for the given player. It evaluates
    group composition, availability, and role requirements to determine an appropriate
    match. This method is typically used in bot management systems to assign players
    to suitable groups for coordinated activities such as dungeons, raids, or battlegrounds.
    The method ensures that the returned group has sufficient space and meets the
    role-based criteria defined by the player's bot configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which a suitable group is being
      searched. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: role
    description: The GroupRole enum value indicating the desired role (e.g., TANK,
      HEALER, DAMAGE) that the returned group should accommodate for this player.
  returns: Returns the GUID of the suitable group if one is found; otherwise returns
    0 if no appropriate group exists or if the search fails.
  examples:
  - title: Finding a suitable group for a healer bot
    code: "Player* healerBot = ...;\nGroupRole role = GroupRole::HEALER;\nuint32 groupId\
      \ = PlayerbotGroupManager::FindSuitableGroup(healerBot, role);\nif (groupId\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with joining the group\n    Group* group = sGroupMgr->GetGroupByGUID(groupId);\n\
      \    if (group)\n        group->AddMember(healerBot);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Finding a suitable group for a tank role
    code: "Player* tankBot = ...;\nGroupRole role = GroupRole::TANK;\nuint32 groupId\
      \ = PlayerbotGroupManager::FindSuitableGroup(tankBot, role);\nif (groupId !=\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Attempt to join the group\n    Group* group = sGroupMgr->GetGroupByGUID(groupId);\n\
      \    if (group && !group->IsFull())\n        group->AddMember(tankBot);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that player bots are managed by a bot manager system
    and that groups have been properly initialized. The implementation may involve
    checking group size, role availability, and other constraints to ensure compatibility
    with the requesting player's bot configuration.
  warnings: Ensure that the player parameter is valid and not null before calling
    this method. Also, be aware that if no suitable group exists, the method returns
    0, which should be checked to avoid unexpected behavior when attempting to join
    a non-existent group.
