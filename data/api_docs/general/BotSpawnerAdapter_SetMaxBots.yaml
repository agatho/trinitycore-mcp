  class: BotSpawnerAdapter
  method: SetMaxBots
  signature: void BotSpawnerAdapter::SetMaxBots(uint32 maxBots)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum number of bots that can be spawned by the bot spawner adapter.
  description: The SetMaxBots method configures the upper limit for the number of
    bots that the BotSpawnerAdapter instance is allowed to create and manage. This
    method typically affects the behavior of bot spawning logic within the TrinityCore
    framework, ensuring that the system does not exceed a specified cap on active
    bots. It is commonly used in bot management systems or test environments where
    controlled bot deployment is required. The change takes effect immediately, affecting
    subsequent bot spawn requests.
  parameters:
  - name: maxBots
    description: The maximum number of bots allowed to be spawned. Must be a non-negative
      integer. Values of zero will disable bot spawning.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Maximum Bots to 10
    code: 'BotSpawnerAdapter adapter;

      adapter.SetMaxBots(10);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Bot Spawning
    code: 'BotSpawnerAdapter adapter;

      adapter.SetMaxBots(0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not validate whether the current number of active bots exceeds
    the new limit; it only sets the maximum allowed count for future spawns. If the
    current bot count is higher than the new limit, existing bots will remain active
    until they are explicitly removed or despawned.
