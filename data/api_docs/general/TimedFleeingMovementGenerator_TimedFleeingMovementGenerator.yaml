  class: TimedFleeingMovementGenerator
  method: TimedFleeingMovementGenerator
  signature: void TimedFleeingMovementGenerator::TimedFleeingMovementGenerator(int
    fleeTargetGUID, int time, int param2)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a timed fleeing movement generator for an AI-controlled unit.
  description: The TimedFleeingMovementGenerator constructor initializes a movement
    generator that causes an AI-controlled unit to flee from a specified target for
    a given duration. This generator is typically used in creature AI to implement
    temporary fear-based fleeing behavior, where the unit will move away from the
    target for a set time period before returning to normal behavior. The generator
    uses internal timers and pathfinding logic to ensure smooth movement during the
    flee sequence.
  parameters:
  - name: fleeTargetGUID
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the unit that the AI-controlled unit
      should flee from. This is typically the unit that triggered the fleeing behavior,
      such as a player or another creature.
  - name: time
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the fleeing behavior should
      persist. After this time has elapsed, the movement generator will stop and the
      unit will return to its normal AI behavior.
  - name: param2
    description: An additional parameter that may be used for specific flee behavior
      customization. The exact meaning of this parameter depends on the implementation
      and can vary between different AI modules or game mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Flee Initialization
    code: 'TimedFleeingMovementGenerator fleeGen(12345, 5000, 0);

      // Causes creature with GUID 12345 to flee for 5 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Flee from Player Target
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetVictim();\nif (target)\n{\n    TimedFleeingMovementGenerator\
      \ fleeGen(target->GetGUID().GetRawValue(), 3000, 1);\n    // Creature flees\
      \ from player for 3 seconds with custom parameter\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This movement generator integrates with TrinityCore's AI system and requires
    the target unit to be valid and within the same map instance. The generator automatically
    handles pathfinding and will interrupt if the target becomes invalid or moves
    out of range. It is designed to work seamlessly with the creature's existing AI
    state machine.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly on a movement generator that is
    already active, as it may cause undefined behavior. Ensure that the fleeTargetGUID
    refers to a valid unit in the same map instance. The time parameter should be
    carefully chosen to avoid excessive CPU usage from frequent generator recreation.
