  class: ThreatManager
  method: FixateTarget
  signature: void ThreatManager::FixateTarget(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the specified unit as the fixed target for threat generation and management.
  description: The FixateTarget method assigns a given Unit as the primary target
    for threat calculations within the ThreatManager. This ensures that all threat
    generated by the manager's owner (typically an AI-controlled creature) will be
    directed toward this specific target, overriding normal threat distribution mechanics.
    The method is commonly used in boss encounters or scripted AI behaviors where
    maintaining aggro on a particular player or unit is critical. It does not immediately
    change the target of the owning unit but rather influences how threat is calculated
    and applied during combat.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that will become the fixed threat target.
      Must be a valid Unit instance; passing nullptr may result in undefined behavior
      or removal of fixation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Fixation Usage
    code: "void BossAI::JustEngagedWith(Unit* who) {\n    if (who)\n        me->GetThreatManager().FixateTarget(who);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Fixation with Validation
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (!me->GetThreatManager().IsInCombat())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    Unit* target = me->GetVictim();\n    if (target && target->IsPlayer())\n\
      \        me->GetThreatManager().FixateTarget(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it can interfere with normal AI behavior
    and threat distribution. It is typically called during combat initiation or when
    a specific target needs to be prioritized for aggro management.
  warnings: Passing a nullptr to this method may lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
    Ensure the target unit is valid and in the same map before calling FixateTarget.
