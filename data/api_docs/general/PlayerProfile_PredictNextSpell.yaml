  signature: uint32_t PlayerProfile::PredictNextSpell() const
documentation:
  brief: Predicts and returns the spell ID of the next spell that will be cast by
    the player based on their current casting state and spell queue.
  description: The PredictNextSpell method analyzes the player's current casting state,
    spell queue, and any pending actions to determine which spell will be executed
    next. This functionality is particularly useful for addons or modules that need
    to anticipate player actions, such as for UI elements, cooldown tracking, or combat
    analysis. The method does not modify any internal state but provides a read-only
    prediction based on the current context. It assumes the player is in a valid casting
    state and may return 0 if no predictable spell is available.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32_t representing the SpellID of the next predicted spell.
    If no spell can be predicted, it returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32_t nextSpellId = playerProfile->PredictNextSpell();\nif (nextSpellId\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Next spell to be cast: \" << nextSpellId << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Cooldown Tracking
    code: "uint32_t predictedSpell = playerProfile->PredictNextSpell();\nif (predictedSpell\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Update UI or tracking logic based on the predicted spell\n\
      \    SpellInfo const* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(predictedSpell);\n\
      \    if (spellInfo)\n    {\n        // Use spellInfo to update cooldown timers,\
      \ icons, etc.\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal player casting state and may not account for
    all possible spell triggers or delays. It is intended primarily for predictive
    UI updates rather than core gameplay logic. The prediction accuracy depends on
    the completeness of the player's current casting queue and active spell data.
  warnings: Do not use this method as a definitive source for spell execution order
    in critical gameplay systems, as it only provides predictions and may not reflect
    real-time changes in spell casting. Misusing this for game mechanics could lead
    to inconsistent behavior or exploits.
