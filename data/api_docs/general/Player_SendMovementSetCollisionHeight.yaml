  class: Player
  method: SendMovementSetCollisionHeight
  signature: void Player::SendMovementSetCollisionHeight(float height, WorldPackets::Movement::UpdateCollisionHeightReason
    reason)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the collision height for the player's movement.
  description: This method sends a packet to update the collision height of the player's
    movement, which affects how the player interacts with terrain and objects in the
    game world. It is used primarily during movement updates and can be triggered
    by various game mechanics such as swimming, flying, or changing stance. The method
    allows for precise control over the player's collision height during different
    movement states.
  parameters:
  - name: height
    description: The new collision height value to set for the player's movement.
      This determines how high the player can move above ground level, typically used
      for swimming or flying states.
  - name: reason
    description: The reason for updating the collision height, indicating why the
      change is being applied. This could be related to swimming, flying, or other
      movement states that require different collision heights.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      float height = 1.5f;

      WorldPackets::Movement::UpdateCollisionHeightReason reason = WorldPackets::Movement::UpdateCollisionHeightReason::Swimming;

      player->SendMovementSetCollisionHeight(height, reason);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the movement system and should be called during appropriate
    movement updates. It's typically used in conjunction with other movement-related
    methods to ensure proper player interaction with the environment.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause incorrect collision height settings,
    leading to issues with player movement or interaction with terrain objects. Care
    must be taken when setting height values to avoid conflicts with game mechanics
    like swimming or flying.
