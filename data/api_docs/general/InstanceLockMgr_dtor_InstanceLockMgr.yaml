documentation:
  brief: Destroys an InstanceLockMgr object and cleans up all associated instance
    lock data.
  description: The destructor for the InstanceLockMgr class is responsible for properly
    cleaning up all resources associated with instance locks. This includes releasing
    any held locks, clearing internal data structures that manage player-instance
    relationships, and ensuring no memory leaks occur when the manager is destroyed.
    In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, this typically occurs when a map
    or instance is being unloaded or when the server shuts down. The destructor ensures
    that all pending lock requests are properly handled and that any active instance
    locks are released to prevent orphaned lock states.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of InstanceLockMgr
    code: "void CleanupInstance()\n{\n    // InstanceLockMgr is automatically destroyed\
      \ when it goes out of scope\n    InstanceLockMgr lockManager;\n    // ... use\
      \ lockManager ...\n} // Destructor called here automatically"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called manually unless you are managing the
    object's lifetime explicitly. It is typically invoked automatically when the object
    goes out of scope or during server shutdown. The destruction process ensures that
    all instance locks are properly released to maintain data integrity.
