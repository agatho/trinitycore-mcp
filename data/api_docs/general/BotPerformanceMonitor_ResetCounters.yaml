documentation:
  brief: Resets all performance counters within the bot performance monitoring system.
  description: The ResetCounters method clears and initializes all internal performance
    tracking metrics used by the BotPerformanceMonitor class. This method is typically
    invoked to reset statistics before starting a new monitoring period or to clear
    accumulated data that may no longer be relevant. The operation ensures that subsequent
    performance measurements start from a clean state, providing accurate baseline
    data for evaluating bot behavior and resource usage within the TrinityCore environment.

    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

  notes: This method should be called carefully as it will erase all previously recorded
    performance data. It's recommended to call ResetCounters before initiating a new
    performance analysis session or after completing a measurement cycle.
