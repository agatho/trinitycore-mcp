documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a quest is worth accepting based on player progress and
    system criteria
  description: The IsQuestWorthwhile method evaluates if a given quest should be considered
    valuable or beneficial for a specific player character. This function typically
    checks various conditions such as quest completion status, player level requirements,
    quest prerequisites, and dynamic system factors that influence quest value. It's
    commonly used in automated questing systems or AI-driven quest selection logic
    to filter out quests that may not provide meaningful rewards or progression for
    the player. The method returns true if the quest meets all worthwhile criteria,
    false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to evaluate. Must be a valid quest
      ID present in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character for whom
      the quest worthiness is being evaluated. Cannot be null.
  returns: Returns true if the quest is deemed worthwhile for the specified player,
    false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the quest meets all relevant
    criteria such as level requirements, completion status, and other dynamic factors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Worthiness Check
    code: "if (dynamicQuestSystem.IsQuestWorthwhile(12345, playerBot)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with quest acceptance logic\n    playerBot->AddQuest(12345);\n} else {\n \
      \   // Skip or ignore this quest\n    playerBot->SendNotification(\"This quest\
      \ is not worthwhile at this time.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Automated Questing System
    code: "std::vector<uint32> availableQuests = GetAvailableQuests(playerBot);\n\
      std::vector<uint32> worthwhileQuests;\n\nfor (uint32 questId : availableQuests)\
      \ {\n    if (dynamicQuestSystem.IsQuestWorthwhile(questId, playerBot)) {\n \
      \       worthwhileQuests.push_back(questId);\n    }\n}\n\n// Process only worthwhile\
      \ quests\nfor (uint32 questId : worthwhileQuests) {\n    AcceptAndCompleteQuest(playerBot,\
      \ questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database lookups and condition checks that could
    impact performance if called frequently. It's recommended to cache results when
    evaluating the same quests multiple times. The exact criteria for determining
    worthiness may vary based on game version and server configuration.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer will likely cause undefined behavior. The questId must
    correspond to an actual existing quest in the database; otherwise, results are
    unpredictable.
