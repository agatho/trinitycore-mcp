  signature: void AssassinationDotTracker::ApplyDot(uint32 spellId, uint32 comboPoints)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a damage-over-time effect to the target based on spell ID and combo
    points.
  description: The ApplyDot method is responsible for applying a damage-over-time
    (DoT) effect to a target in the context of an Assassination rogue's gameplay.
    This method takes a spell identifier and the number of combo points as inputs
    to determine the appropriate DoT application, including its duration, damage calculation,
    and visual effects. It integrates with the core TrinityCore combat system to ensure
    proper stacking, refreshment, and interaction with other DoTs or abilities. The
    method is typically invoked during the execution of assassination abilities such
    as Rupture or Envenom, where combo points are consumed to apply or refresh DoT
    effects on the target.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell that applies the damage-over-time
      effect. This ID corresponds to a specific DoT ability in the game's spell database,
      such as Rupture (ID 1943) or Envenom (ID 30981). Valid values are defined within
      the TrinityCore spell system.
  - name: comboPoints
    description: The number of combo points consumed to apply or refresh the DoT.
      This value determines the intensity and duration of the effect, as higher combo
      point counts generally result in stronger or longer-lasting damage over time
      effects. Must be a non-negative integer.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying Rupture with 5 Combo Points
    code: 'AssassinationDotTracker dotTracker;

      dotTracker.ApplyDot(1943, 5); // Applies Rupture with 5 combo points'
    language: cpp
  - title: Refreshing Envenom DoT with 3 Combo Points
    code: 'AssassinationDotTracker dotTracker;

      dotTracker.ApplyDot(30981, 3); // Refreshes Envenom DoT with 3 combo points'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Assassination rogue's specialization logic and
    interacts closely with the core combat system. It assumes that the target is valid
    and within range, and that the player has sufficient combo points to apply the
    DoT. The internal implementation may involve checking for existing DoTs on the
    target, calculating damage based on spell properties and combo point values, and
    updating visual effects or aura states accordingly.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without validating the existence of a valid
    target or sufficient combo points can lead to undefined behavior or client/server
    desynchronization. Ensure that all preconditions are met before calling ApplyDot
    to avoid unexpected gameplay issues.
