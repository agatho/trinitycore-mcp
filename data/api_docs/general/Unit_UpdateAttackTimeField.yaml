  class: Unit
  method: UpdateAttackTimeField
  signature: void Unit::UpdateAttackTimeField(int att)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the attack time field for the unit based on the specified attack
    type.
  description: The UpdateAttackTimeField method is responsible for adjusting the attack
    speed or cooldown timing of a Unit based on the provided attack type parameter.
    This method typically modifies internal fields that control how frequently a unit
    can perform attacks, such as melee, ranged, or spell attacks. It may also update
    related combat timers and synchronization states within the unit's combat system.
    The method is generally called during combat events to ensure proper timing and
    balance of attack actions.
  parameters:
  - name: att
    description: An integer value representing the attack type. Valid values typically
      correspond to different attack categories such as melee (0), ranged (1), or
      spell (2) attacks. The exact mapping depends on internal enum definitions within
      TrinityCore's combat system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Melee Attack Time
    code: 'Unit* player = ...;

      player->UpdateAttackTimeField(0); // Updates melee attack time'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Ranged Attack Time in Combat
    code: "Unit* npc = ...;\nif (npc->IsInCombat()) {\n    npc->UpdateAttackTimeField(1);\
      \ // Update ranged attack timing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal combat state tracking and may
    trigger updates to the unit's attack timer fields. It should be called only when
    necessary, as frequent calls can impact performance in high-frequency combat scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context or during inappropriate states
    (e.g., out of combat) may lead to incorrect timing behavior or synchronization
    issues. Ensure that the attack type parameter is valid before calling.
