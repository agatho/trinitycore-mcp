  class: GuildIntegration
  method: ContributeToGuildAchievements
  signature: void GuildIntegration::ContributeToGuildAchievements(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Contributes player actions to guild achievements, tracking progress toward
    guild-based rewards and milestones.
  description: The ContributeToGuildAchievements method is responsible for updating
    and progressing guild-related achievements based on player activities within the
    game. This function typically records player contributions such as quest completions,
    kills, or other in-game actions that contribute to collective guild goals. It
    integrates with the TrinityCore's achievement system to ensure that individual
    player efforts are properly attributed to the guild's overall progress. The method
    likely updates internal tracking structures and may trigger notifications or rewards
    when specific thresholds are met. This function is essential for maintaining accurate
    guild progression and ensuring that players receive appropriate recognition for
    their contributions to guild achievements.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) who is contributing to guild achievements. The value should correspond
      to a valid player in the current game session.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.ContributeToGuildAchievements(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Event Handling
    code: "void OnPlayerKill(Player* player, Unit* target) {\n    int playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      \    GuildIntegration guildInt;\n    guildInt.ContributeToGuildAchievements(&playerId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the achievement system and may require
    synchronization with database updates. It should be called whenever a player performs
    an action that contributes to guild achievements, such as completing quests or
    defeating bosses. The implementation may involve checking if the player is in
    a guild and has appropriate permissions before updating achievement progress.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed to this method points to a valid
    player object; passing invalid or null pointers could lead to undefined behavior.
    This function should only be called during active gameplay sessions when the player
    is properly initialized within the TrinityCore framework.
