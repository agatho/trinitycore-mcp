documentation:
  brief: Analyzes the efficiency of instance coordination for a given group
  description: This method evaluates how effectively a group is coordinating within
    an instance environment. It examines various factors such as player positioning,
    role distribution, and synchronization status to determine overall coordination
    efficiency. The analysis may influence instance difficulty adjustments or provide
    feedback to players about their group's performance. This method is typically
    invoked during instance events or when evaluating group performance for rewards
    or achievements.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group whose coordination
      efficiency will be analyzed. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    instanceCoordination.AnalyzeCoordinationEfficiency(myGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal calculations based on group member positions,
    roles, and activity levels. It may modify internal state variables or trigger
    events related to group performance metrics.
