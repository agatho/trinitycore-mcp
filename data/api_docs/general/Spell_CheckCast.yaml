  class: Spell
  method: CheckCast
  signature: SpellCastResult Spell::CheckCast(bool strict, int32 * param1, int32 *
    param2)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a spell can be cast and returns the result of the check.
  description: The CheckCast method evaluates whether a spell can be cast under current
    conditions, including mana requirements, target restrictions, and other game mechanics.
    It returns a SpellCastResult indicating success or failure of the cast attempt.
    This method is commonly used in spell handling logic to validate casting before
    actually executing the spell. The strict parameter determines whether the check
    should be more or less lenient, with strict checking typically preventing any
    casting if conditions are not met. This method is essential for proper spell execution
    and can be used to prevent invalid spell casts from occurring in-game.
  parameters:
  - name: strict
    description: When true, enforces stricter validation checks; when false, allows
      some flexibility in the casting conditions. This parameter affects how stringently
      the method evaluates the spell's requirements.
  - name: param1
    description: Pointer to an integer value representing a potential parameter for
      the spell check. The specific meaning depends on the spell being checked and
      is typically used for additional validation or parameter handling.
  - name: param2
    description: Pointer to another integer value representing a second parameter
      for the spell check. This parameter may be used for additional validation or
      to handle specific spell conditions depending on the context.
  returns: SpellCastResult indicating whether the spell can be cast successfully or
    if there are errors preventing casting. Possible return values include SPELL_CAST_OK,
    SPELL_FAILED, and other error codes depending on the validation results.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Cast Check
    code: "SpellCastResult result = spell->CheckCast(false, nullptr, nullptr);\nif\
      \ (result == SPELL_CAST_OK)\n{\n    // Proceed with spell execution\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Strict Spell Cast Check
    code: "SpellCastResult result = spell->CheckCast(true, &param1, &param2);\nif\
      \ (result != SPELL_CAST_OK)\n{\n    // Handle failed cast\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    to determine whether a spell should proceed with execution. It's important to
    note that this method does not actually cast the spell, but merely checks if it
    can be cast. Performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary calls when
    casting is already known to be invalid.
  warnings: The method may return different SpellCastResult values depending on the
    context and parameters provided. Care must be taken when interpreting results
    as some values might indicate temporary or permanent failure conditions.
