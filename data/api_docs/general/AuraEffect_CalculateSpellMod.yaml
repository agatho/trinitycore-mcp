  class: AuraEffect
  method: CalculateSpellMod
  signature: void AuraEffect::CalculateSpellMod()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the spell modifier value for the aura effect based on its type
    and parameters.
  description: The CalculateSpellMod method computes the effective spell modifier
    value applied by an aura effect. This calculation takes into account various factors
    such as the aura's type, stack count, caster's level, and any applicable modifiers.
    The result is used to adjust spell properties like damage, healing, or duration.
    This method is typically invoked during spell application or when aura state changes
    occur. It modifies internal aura data structures to store the calculated modifier
    value for use in subsequent spell calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Aura Effect Modifier Calculation
    code: "AuraEffect* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    aura->CalculateSpellMod();\n\
      \    // The modifier is now calculated and stored in the aura\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the aura effect is active and has
    valid parameters. It may trigger additional calculations if the aura has dependent
    effects or requires complex modifier computations. The calculated value is cached
    within the aura object for performance reasons.
  warnings: Calling this method on inactive or invalid aura effects can lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the aura effect has been properly initialized before calling
    this method.
