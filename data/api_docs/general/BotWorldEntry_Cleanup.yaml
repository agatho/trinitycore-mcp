documentation:
  brief: Performs cleanup operations on the bot world entry, releasing associated
    resources and resetting internal state.
  description: The Cleanup method is responsible for performing necessary cleanup
    operations on a BotWorldEntry instance. This typically involves releasing any
    dynamically allocated memory, resetting internal flags or counters, and ensuring
    that all associated resources are properly freed. The method ensures that the
    bot world entry can be safely reused or destroyed without leaving dangling references
    or leaked memory. It is commonly called during object destruction or when transitioning
    between different states in the bot's lifecycle.

  - title: Basic Cleanup Usage
    code: 'BotWorldEntry entry;

      // ... perform operations with the entry ...

      entry.Cleanup(); // Clean up resources'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before destroying a BotWorldEntry object to
    ensure proper resource deallocation. It is typically invoked automatically by
    destructors or cleanup routines in the TrinityCore framework.
