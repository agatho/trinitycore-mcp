  class: InterruptManager
  method: AdaptToEncounterMechanics
  signature: void InterruptManager::AdaptToEncounterMechanics(uint32 encounterId)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts interrupt behavior based on encounter-specific mechanics for the
    given encounter ID.
  description: The AdaptToEncounterMechanics method modifies the interrupt manager's
    behavior to align with specific encounter mechanics defined by the provided encounter
    ID. This method is typically invoked during encounter start or initialization
    phases to ensure that interruptible actions and their timing are properly configured
    according to the unique rules of the current encounter. It may adjust conditions
    under which abilities can be interrupted, modify cooldowns, or alter the priority
    of interrupts based on encounter-specific triggers or mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Encounter Start
    code: "void BossEncounter::OnEnterCombat(Unit* who)\n{\n    if (who->GetTypeId()\
      \ == TYPEID_UNIT)\n    {\n        // Adjust interrupt behavior for this specific\
      \ boss encounter\n        sInterruptManager->AdaptToEncounterMechanics(BOSS_ENCOUNTER_ID);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal encounter state tracking and may
    require the encounter to be properly initialized before calling. The actual implementation
    details depend on how encounter mechanics are defined within the TrinityCore framework.
  warnings: Ensure that the encounter ID passed is valid and corresponds to a known
    encounter in the database; invalid IDs may lead to undefined behavior or no effect.
