  signature: const GameObjectOverride * GameObject::GetGameObjectOverride() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the GameObjectOverride structure associated with this game object.
  description: This method retrieves the GameObjectOverride structure that defines
    override behaviors and properties for a specific game object. The GameObjectOverride
    contains information about how the object should behave in different scenarios,
    including its visual appearance, interaction mechanics, and other game-specific
    attributes. This method is typically used by developers to access game object
    configuration data without direct manipulation of the underlying object data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the GameObjectOverride structure for this game object,
    or nullptr if no override exists. The returned pointer should be treated as const
    and not modified directly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const GameObjectOverride* override = gameObject->GetGameObjectOverride();\n\
      if (override)\n{\n    // Use override data\n    uint32 displayId = override->DisplayId;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. It's recommended
    to check for null return values before accessing the override structure to avoid
    potential crashes.
  warnings: This method should not be used to modify the GameObjectOverride directly,
    as doing so may cause unexpected behavior or data corruption in the game object
    system.
