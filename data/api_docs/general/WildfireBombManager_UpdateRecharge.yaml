documentation:
  brief: Updates the recharge state of wildfire bombs in the manager.
  description: "The UpdateRecharge method manages the cooldown and recharging process\
    \ for wildfire bombs within the WildfireBombManager. It typically iterates through\
    \ active or pending wildfire bomb instances, checking their current recharge status\
    \ and updating their internal timers or states accordingly. This method is essential\
    \ for maintaining proper game balance and ensuring that players cannot spam or\u6EE5\
    \u7528 wildfire bombs beyond the intended cooldown periods. The method may also\
    \ handle cleanup of expired or completed bomb states."

      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called periodically during the game loop to ensure
    real-time updates of bomb recharge states. It may involve iteration over a container
    of active bombs, and performance could be impacted if many bombs are active simultaneously.
