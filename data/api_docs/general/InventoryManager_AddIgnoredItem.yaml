  signature: void InventoryManager::AddIgnoredItem(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a specified item ID to the inventory manager's ignored items list.
  description: The AddIgnoredItem method registers a given item identifier into the
    InventoryManager's internal collection of ignored items. This functionality is
    typically used to exclude specific items from certain inventory operations, such
    as automatic looting, item tracking, or quest item handling. The method does not
    perform any validation on the provided item ID and simply adds it to an internal
    set or list for future reference. It is commonly utilized in custom scripts or
    modules where specific items need to be excluded from standard game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item to be added to the ignored list.
      This value must correspond to a valid item entry in the game's item database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'InventoryManager* inventory = player->GetInventory();

      inventory->AddIgnoredItem(12345); // Ignores item with ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Items Ignoring Example
    code: 'InventoryManager* inventory = player->GetInventory();

      inventory->AddIgnoredItem(1001);

      inventory->AddIgnoredItem(2002);

      inventory->AddIgnoredItem(3003); // Ignores three items with IDs 1001, 2002,
      and 3003'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the InventoryManager instance.
    It is recommended to call this method before performing operations that might
    be affected by ignored items. The ignored items list may be used in conjunction
    with other inventory management functions like RemoveIgnoredItem or IsItemIgnored.
  warnings: Ensure that the itemId parameter corresponds to a valid item in the game
    database, as adding an invalid item ID could lead to unexpected behavior during
    inventory processing. This method does not validate whether the item is already
    ignored; calling it multiple times with the same itemId will result in duplicate
    entries.
