documentation:
  brief: Returns the most recent instance ID for a specified map
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier of the most recently entered
    instance for the specified map. It is commonly used to track player progress and
    instance completion status within the game's instance system. The method returns
    zero if no instance has been entered or if the player has not yet entered an instance
    of that specific map. This functionality is essential for tracking instance progression
    and managing instance-related gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the instance ID of the most recent instance entered for the specified
    map, or zero if no instance has been entered or the player has not yet entered
    an instance of that map.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 instanceId = player->GetRecentInstanceId(100);\nif (instanceId !=\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Player has entered an instance of map 100\n    // Do something\
      \ with the instance ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other instance tracking
    methods and should be considered when implementing instance-related logic. Performance-wise,
    this method does not involve complex operations but may require checking player's
    instance history.
  warnings: This method will return zero if the player has never entered an instance
    of the specified map, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about player progress
    if not handled properly.
