  class: PathOptimizer
  method: ResetStatistics
  signature: void PathOptimizer::ResetStatistics()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all internal statistics tracking within the PathOptimizer instance.
  description: The ResetStatistics method clears and initializes all accumulated statistical
    data within the PathOptimizer class. This includes resetting counters, timers,
    and any performance metrics that have been collected during pathfinding operations.
    The method is typically invoked to prepare the optimizer for a new set of path
    calculations or to clear stale data that may affect subsequent performance measurements.
    It ensures that statistics start from a clean state without affecting the core
    functionality of the pathfinding algorithm itself.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PathOptimizer optimizer;

      // ... perform some pathfinding operations ...

      optimizer.ResetStatistics();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before beginning new performance testing or
    when statistics need to be reset for accurate measurement. It does not affect
    the actual pathfinding behavior or results, only the internal tracking of metrics.
