documentation:
  brief: Updates real-time metrics for AI decision profiling.
  description: The UpdateRealTimeMetrics method collects and updates performance statistics
    related to AI decision-making within the TrinityCore framework. This includes
    tracking execution times, decision frequencies, and other timing-related data
    that helps developers monitor and optimize NPC behavior. The method is typically
    called during game ticks or at regular intervals to ensure accurate profiling
    of AI systems. It operates on internal profiling structures and does not directly
    interact with external systems.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    aiDecisionProfiler.UpdateRealTimeMetrics();\n\
      \    // ... continue game loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently during the game loop and
    should not introduce significant performance overhead. It's intended for profiling
    purposes only and does not modify any core AI behavior or state.
