  signature: uint64 SpellInfo::GetSpellMechanicMaskByEffectMask(uint32 effectMask)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the mechanic mask associated with a spell's effect mask.
  description: This method returns the mechanic mask that corresponds to a specific
    effect mask within the spell information. It is used to determine what mechanical
    effects are applied by a spell, which is crucial for understanding how spells
    interact with various game mechanics such as immunity, resistance, and status
    effects. The method operates on the internal spell data structure and provides
    a way to map effect masks to mechanic masks for further processing or filtering.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint64 representing the mechanic mask associated with the specified
    effect mask. This value can be used to identify specific mechanical effects applied
    by the spell, such as stun, root, or silence.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint64 mechanicMask = spellInfo->GetSpellMechanicMaskByEffectMask(1);

      // This retrieves the mechanic mask for effect mask 1'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related functions
    to determine how a spell affects different game mechanics. It may be used in spell
    processing logic or when checking against specific mechanical resistances.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method, as incorrect usage can lead
    to misinterpretation of spell effects and potentially cause issues with game balance
    or player behavior.
