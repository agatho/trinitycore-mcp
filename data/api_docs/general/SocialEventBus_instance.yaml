documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the SocialEventBus class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the SocialEventBus
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the social event bus exists throughout
    the application. This method is used to access the global social event handling
    system which manages various social interactions and events within the World of
    Warcraft environment. The returned pointer provides access to all social event
    functionality including player communications, guild activities, and group interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single instance of SocialEventBus. The method never returns
    NULL as the singleton pattern guarantees its existence.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the SocialEventBus singleton
    code: "SocialEventBus* eventBus = SocialEventBus::instance();\n// Use eventBus\
      \ to handle social events\nif (eventBus)\n{\n    // Perform social event operations\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and designed for use in multi-threaded environments.
    The singleton instance is created on first access and persists for the lifetime
    of the application. Developers should not attempt to manually create or destroy
    SocialEventBus instances.
  warnings: Do not call this method during static initialization before the singleton
    is properly constructed. Avoid storing the returned pointer in global variables
    as it may lead to undefined behavior during shutdown.
