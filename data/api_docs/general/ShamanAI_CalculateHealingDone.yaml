  class: ShamanAI
  method: CalculateHealingDone
  signature: int ShamanAI::CalculateHealingDone() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the total healing amount that the shaman AI unit can perform based
    on current stats and spell effects.
  description: The CalculateHealingDone method computes the effective healing output
    for a shaman AI unit by evaluating various factors such as base stats, spell modifiers,
    buffs, debuffs, and any active healing spells. This calculation is typically used
    during AI decision-making processes to determine optimal healing targets or actions.
    The result represents an estimated healing value that accounts for all relevant
    game mechanics including critical strike chances, healing multipliers, and talent
    bonuses. This method does not modify any internal state and is purely a read-only
    computation.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the calculated total healing amount. A positive
    value indicates the effective healing output, while zero or negative values may
    indicate no healing potential or invalid conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "int healingAmount = shamanAI->CalculateHealingDone();\nif (healingAmount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with healing logic\n    target = FindLowestHealthTarget();\n\
      \    CastHealSpell(target, healingAmount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Healing Prioritization
    code: "int currentHealing = shamanAI->CalculateHealingDone();\nint targetHealing\
      \ = targetAI->CalculateHealingDone();\nif (currentHealing > targetHealing *\
      \ 1.5)\n{\n    // Prioritize self-healing over target healing\n    DoSelfHeal();\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Focus on healing the target\n    HealTarget(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in the context of AI decision-making and should
    not be called excessively during combat loops due to potential performance implications
    from complex calculations. The returned value may vary depending on the current
    state of the shaman unit, including active spells, buffs, and gear configuration.
  warnings: Do not assume that the calculated healing amount will always be accurate
    in real-time scenarios as it does not account for dynamic factors like incoming
    damage or immediate spell cooldowns. This method should only be used for predictive
    AI behavior and not for direct spell casting decisions without additional validation.
