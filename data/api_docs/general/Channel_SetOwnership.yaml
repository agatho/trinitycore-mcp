documentation:
  brief: Sets the ownership status of the channel
  description: The SetOwnership method is used to assign or remove ownership of a
    channel to a player. This method controls whether a player has administrative
    privileges over the channel, allowing them to perform actions such as kicking
    members, setting channel permissions, or changing the channel's properties. Ownership
    is typically granted when a player creates a channel or explicitly given to another
    player by an existing owner. The method updates internal channel state and may
    trigger synchronization with client-side channel data.
  parameters:
  - name: ownership
    description: Boolean value indicating ownership status. True grants ownership,
      false removes it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Granting Channel Ownership
    code: "Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"General\", player);\nif (channel)\n\
      {\n    channel->SetOwnership(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Revoking Channel Ownership
    code: "Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"MyGuild\", player);\nif (channel\
      \ && channel->IsOwner(player))\n{\n    channel->SetOwnership(false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on channels that are currently active and
    accessible. It is typically used internally by the channel management system when
    players join or leave channels, or when administrative actions are performed.
    The ownership flag affects permissions but does not directly control channel visibility
    or membership.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation may result in inconsistent
    channel state. Ensure that only authorized players can modify ownership status
    to prevent unauthorized access to channel controls. This method does not validate
    whether the player actually has permission to change ownership, so callers must
    implement appropriate checks.
