  signature: void FrostDeathKnightRefactored::FrostDeathKnightRefactored(Player *
    bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Frost Death Knight AI bot with the specified player.
  description: The FrostDeathKnightRefactored constructor initializes a Frost Death
    Knight AI behavior for a given player character. This method sets up the core
    AI logic and state management for the frost specialization of the Death Knight
    class within the TrinityCore framework. It configures the bot's ability usage,
    spell selection, and combat strategies specific to the frost death knight playstyle.
    The initialization process includes setting up target selection mechanisms, resource
    management systems, and cooldown tracking for frost-specific abilities such as
    Howling Blast, Frost Strike, and Obliterate. This constructor is typically called
    when a new frost death knight AI bot is created or respawned in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AI Bot Initialization
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Get reference to player

      FrostDeathKnightRefactored frostDK(bot);

      // The bot is now initialized with frost death knight AI behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the TrinityCore AI system and requires a valid
    Player object reference. The initialization process may involve loading configuration
    settings from database tables or hardcoded values specific to frost death knights.
    The AI logic will automatically handle spell casting, target selection, and movement
    patterns based on the current combat state.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player parameter is not null before calling this constructor,
    as it will likely cause a crash or undefined behavior if passed an invalid reference.
    This method should only be called once per bot instance to avoid memory leaks
    or inconsistent AI states.
