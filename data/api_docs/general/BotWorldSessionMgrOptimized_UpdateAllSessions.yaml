  method: UpdateAllSessions
  signature: void BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::UpdateAllSessions(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates all bot world sessions with the specified time difference.
  description: The UpdateAllSessions method iterates through all active bot world
    sessions managed by the BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized class and performs necessary
    updates for each session. This typically includes processing queued commands,
    updating session state, handling timeouts, and synchronizing data with the game
    world. The method is designed to be called regularly from the main game loop to
    ensure that bot behaviors remain responsive and consistent with the current game
    state. It handles time-based operations using the provided diff parameter which
    represents the elapsed milliseconds since the last update.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = getMSTime();\n    botWorldSessionMgr.UpdateAllSessions(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently (typically every game tick or at
    regular intervals) to maintain proper session synchronization. The implementation
    likely uses a container such as std::vector or std::map to store active sessions,
    and iterates through them efficiently. Performance considerations include minimizing
    overhead during iteration and avoiding blocking operations within the update loop.
