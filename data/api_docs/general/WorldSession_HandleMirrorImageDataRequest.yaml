documentation:
  brief: Handles requests for mirror image data from the client, typically related
    to spell or ability visual effects.
  description: The HandleMirrorImageDataRequest method processes incoming requests
    from the client for mirror image data, which is used in World of Warcraft to display
    visual representations of spells or abilities that create mirror images. This
    method is part of the WorldSession class and is invoked when a client sends a
    GetMirrorImageData packet. It likely retrieves and sends back relevant information
    about mirror image effects associated with the player's current state or active
    spells. The method does not return any value but may trigger visual updates or
    data transmissions to the client.
  parameters:
  - name: getMirrorImageData
    description: The incoming packet containing mirror image data request parameters
      from the client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in WorldSession handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleMirrorImageDataRequest(WorldPackets::Spells::GetMirrorImageData\
      \ & getMirrorImageData)\n{\n    // Process mirror image data request\n    //\
      \ Send relevant mirror image information back to client\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the spell system and may be invoked when players
    use abilities that create mirror images, such as the Mirror Image spell. It's
    important to note that this method operates within the context of a WorldSession,
    so it has access to player state information and can send packets back to the
    client.
