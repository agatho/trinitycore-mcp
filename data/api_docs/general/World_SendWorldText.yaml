  method: SendWorldText
  signature: void World::SendWorldText(uint32 string_id)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a localized world text message to all players in the current world.
  description: The SendWorldText method broadcasts a localized string identifier to
    every player currently logged into the game world. This method is typically used
    for global announcements, system messages, or server-wide notifications that should
    be visible to all players simultaneously. The message is retrieved from the server's
    localization tables using the provided string_id parameter, which corresponds
    to a specific entry in the database's localized text system. The method does not
    require any specific player context as it operates on the entire world population.
  parameters:
  - name: string_id
    description: The unique identifier for the localized message string stored in
      the server's localization database. This ID maps to a specific text entry that
      will be displayed to all players in the world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Broadcast Server Maintenance Notice
    code: World::SendWorldText(12345); // Sends localized message with ID 12345 to
      all players
    language: cpp
  - title: Announce PvP Event Start
    code: World::SendWorldText(54321); // Broadcasts PvP event start notification
      to entire world
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates synchronously and sends the message immediately to all
    connected players. It uses the global world context and does not require any player
    references. The string_id must correspond to a valid localization entry in the
    database, otherwise no message will be displayed.
  warnings: Using this method excessively can cause performance issues due to sending
    messages to potentially thousands of players simultaneously. Ensure that string_ids
    reference valid localized entries to prevent silent failures or empty messages.
