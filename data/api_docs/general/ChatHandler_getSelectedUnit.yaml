  method: getSelectedUnit
  signature: Unit * ChatHandler::getSelectedUnit()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the currently selected Unit object from the player's selection.
  description: The getSelectedUnit method retrieves the Unit object that is currently
    selected by the player in the game world. This method is commonly used in command
    handlers to perform actions on the targeted unit. The returned Unit pointer can
    be null if no unit is selected or if the selected unit is not a valid Unit object.
    In TrinityCore, this method typically interfaces with the player's current selection
    state and ensures that the selected target is accessible for command execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the currently selected Unit object, or nullptr if no unit
    is selected or if the selection is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a command handler
    code: "void HandleTeleportCommand(ChatHandler* handler)\n{\n    Unit* target =\
      \ handler->getSelectedUnit();\n    if (!target)\n    {\n        handler->SendSysMessage(\"\
      No unit selected.\");\n        return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with teleporting\
      \ the selected unit\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's current selection state and should only
    be called within a command handler context where player input is expected. The
    returned Unit pointer is valid only during the current execution context and must
    not be stored for later use without proper validation.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a command handler context may result in
    undefined behavior or null pointer dereferences. Always validate the return value
    before using it to avoid crashes.
