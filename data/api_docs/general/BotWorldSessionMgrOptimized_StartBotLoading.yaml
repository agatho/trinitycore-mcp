  class: BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized
  method: StartBotLoading
  signature: bool BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::StartBotLoading(int playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the loading process for a bot associated with the specified player
    GUID.
  description: The StartBotLoading method is responsible for beginning the initialization
    sequence of a bot controlled by a specific player in the TrinityCore environment.
    It typically handles setting up necessary data structures, allocating resources,
    and triggering the bot's startup routines. This method ensures that all required
    systems are prepared before the bot becomes active within the game world. The
    method may perform checks to validate the player GUID and ensure that the corresponding
    bot is eligible for loading. It is part of the optimized bot session management
    system designed to improve performance and resource utilization in large-scale
    bot deployments.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose bot is to be loaded.
      This value must correspond to a valid player entry in the database, and the
      associated bot must be configured for automatic loading or manual initiation.
  returns: Returns true if the bot loading process was successfully initiated; otherwise
    returns false if the operation failed due to invalid input, missing data, or system
    constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Loading Initiation
    code: "BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized* sessionMgr = BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::Instance();\n\
      bool success = sessionMgr->StartBotLoading(12345);\nif (success) {\n    // Bot\
      \ loading started successfully\n} else {\n    // Handle failure case\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Bot Loading with Error Handling
    code: "BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized* sessionMgr = BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::Instance();\n\
      uint32 playerGuid = 98765;\n\nif (playerGuid > 0) {\n    bool result = sessionMgr->StartBotLoading(playerGuid);\n\
      \    if (!result) {\n        sLog->outError(\"Failed to start loading bot for\
      \ player GUID %u\", playerGuid);\n    }\n} else {\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid\
      \ player GUID provided\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or when a player requests
    to load their bot. It assumes that the player's bot configuration exists in the
    database and that sufficient system resources are available for loading. The implementation
    may include locking mechanisms to prevent concurrent access issues during initialization.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent player GUID will likely
    result in failure and should be avoided. Ensure proper validation of the player
    GUID before invoking this function to avoid unexpected behavior or crashes.
