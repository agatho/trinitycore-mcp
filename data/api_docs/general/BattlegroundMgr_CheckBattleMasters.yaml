  signature: void BattlegroundMgr::CheckBattleMasters()
documentation:
  brief: Checks and updates the status of Battle Masters in active battlegrounds.
  description: The CheckBattleMasters method iterates through all active battlegrounds
    and verifies the validity and presence of Battle Masters (NPCs that manage battleground
    queues and rewards). It ensures that each battleground has a properly assigned
    Battle Master, and if not, it attempts to spawn one or marks the battleground
    as invalid. This method is crucial for maintaining proper battleground functionality
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage

  notes: This method is typically called periodically by the server's update loop
    to maintain battleground integrity. It may spawn new Battle Masters if they are
    missing, which can impact performance during high-traffic periods.
