  class: FormationManager
  method: MoveFormationToPosition
  signature: bool FormationManager::MoveFormationToPosition(const int & targetPos,
    float orientation)
documentation:
  brief: Moves a formation to a specified target position with given orientation.
  description: The MoveFormationToPosition method is responsible for repositioning
    a formation within the game world to a designated target location. This method
    typically handles pathfinding and movement logic for groups of units that are
    part of a formation, ensuring they move cohesively toward the new position while
    maintaining their relative positions. The orientation parameter controls the facing
    direction of the formation upon reaching the target location. This functionality
    is commonly used in AI-driven group behaviors, such as moving a group of NPCs
    or players to a specific area during quest events or combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: targetPos
    description: The target position index within the formation's movement path. This
      parameter specifies which position in the formation should be moved to the new
      location. Values are typically integers representing positions in an ordered
      sequence, with negative values possibly indicating special movement modes or
      error conditions.
  - name: orientation
    description: "The desired facing orientation (in radians) of the formation upon\
      \ reaching the target position. This controls the direction the formation will\
      \ be facing after movement is complete. Values are usually in the range [0,\
      \ 2\u03C0] representing standard angular measurements."
  returns: Returns true if the formation movement was successfully initiated and processed;
    otherwise returns false if the operation failed due to invalid parameters, pathfinding
    issues, or other internal errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Formation Movement
    code: "if (formationManager->MoveFormationToPosition(3, 1.57f)) {\n    // Movement\
      \ initiated successfully\n    LOG_INFO(\"server\", \"Formation moved to position\
      \ 3 with orientation 1.57 radians\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Formation Reorientation
    code: "const float facing = M_PI / 4; // 45 degrees in radians\nif (formationManager->MoveFormationToPosition(0,\
      \ facing)) {\n    // Move formation to first position with specific orientation\n\
      \    LOG_DEBUG(\"server\", \"Formation repositioned at angle {}\", facing);\n\
      } else {\n    LOG_ERROR(\"server\", \"Failed to move formation to target position\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve asynchronous pathfinding operations and should not
    be assumed to complete immediately. The actual movement of units might occur over
    several game ticks depending on the complexity of the path and server load. Additionally,
    this method likely interacts with internal formation state tracking and may require
    the formation to be in a valid state before execution.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid targetPos indices or extreme orientation
    values may result in undefined behavior or movement failures. Ensure that the
    target position exists within the formation's defined range and that the orientation
    is within acceptable bounds for the game world.
