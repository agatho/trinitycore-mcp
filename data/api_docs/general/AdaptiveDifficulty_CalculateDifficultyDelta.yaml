  method: CalculateDifficultyDelta
  signature: float AdaptiveDifficulty::CalculateDifficultyDelta(float currentWinRate,
    float targetWinRate) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the difficulty delta based on current and target win rates for
    adaptive difficulty adjustment.
  description: The CalculateDifficultyDelta method computes a floating-point value
    that represents how much the difficulty should be adjusted given the current win
    rate and the desired target win rate. This method is typically used in adaptive
    difficulty systems where the game adjusts challenge levels dynamically to maintain
    an engaging experience. The calculation considers the difference between actual
    performance (current win rate) and expected performance (target win rate), returning
    a delta value that can be applied to modify difficulty settings. It's commonly
    used in battlegrounds, raids, or other competitive game modes where maintaining
    balanced challenge is important.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float representing the calculated difficulty adjustment delta. Positive
    values indicate the difficulty should be increased, negative values suggest decreasing
    difficulty, and zero means no adjustment is needed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AdaptiveDifficulty diffSystem;

      float currentRate = 0.7f; // 70% win rate

      float targetRate = 0.5f; // 50% target win rate

      float delta = diffSystem.CalculateDifficultyDelta(currentRate, targetRate);

      // delta will be positive, indicating difficulty should increase'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment
    code: "AdaptiveDifficulty diffSystem;\nfloat currentWinRate = 0.3f; // Low win\
      \ rate\nfloat targetWinRate = 0.5f; // Target is higher\nfloat delta = diffSystem.CalculateDifficultyDelta(currentWinRate,\
      \ targetWinRate);\nif (delta > 0.0f) {\n    // Increase difficulty\n    ModifyDifficultySettings(delta);\n\
      } else if (delta < 0.0f) {\n    // Decrease difficulty\n    ModifyDifficultySettings(delta);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger adaptive difficulty system and should be
    called regularly during gameplay to provide smooth difficulty adjustments. The
    calculation logic may vary depending on the specific implementation within TrinityCore's
    codebase, but generally follows a proportional difference approach between current
    and target win rates.
  warnings: Ensure that the input parameters are valid win rates (between 0.0f and
    1.0f) to avoid unexpected behavior. This method should not be called with extreme
    values outside of normal game conditions as it might cause abrupt difficulty changes.
