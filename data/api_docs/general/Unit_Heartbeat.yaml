  brief: Triggers the unit's heartbeat mechanism to update its state and perform periodic
    actions
  description: The Heartbeat method is a core functionality in TrinityCore's Unit
    class that manages the periodic updating of a unit's state, including handling
    combat states, movement updates, and other game mechanics. It ensures that units
    maintain proper synchronization with the game world and perform necessary actions
    at regular intervals. This method typically runs during each tick of the game
    loop and is crucial for maintaining the integrity of unit behavior in various
    scenarios such as combat, movement, and AI updates.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->Heartbeat();'
    language: cpp
  notes: The heartbeat method is typically called automatically by the game engine
    during each tick, but developers may need to manually invoke it when dealing with
    special scenarios or custom AI implementations. Performance considerations include
    avoiding unnecessary calls in high-frequency situations.
  warnings: Improper handling of heartbeat calls can lead to synchronization issues
    and potentially cause unit behavior anomalies in combat or movement states.
