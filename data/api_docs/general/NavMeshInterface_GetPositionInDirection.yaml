  class: NavMeshInterface
  method: GetPositionInDirection
  signature: bool NavMeshInterface::GetPositionInDirection(Map * map, const int &
    origin, float direction, float distance, int & result) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates a new position at a specified distance and direction from an origin
    point within a given map.
  description: The GetPositionInDirection method computes a destination coordinate
    that lies at a specific angular direction and distance away from a starting point.
    This utility is commonly used in pathfinding, AI movement logic, and spatial calculations
    within the game world. The method takes into account the map's navigation mesh
    to ensure the resulting position is valid for movement. It requires a valid Map
    object and will return false if the calculation cannot be performed due to invalid
    inputs or navigation mesh issues.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object where the position calculation should occur.
      Must be a valid, loaded map instance.
  - name: origin
    description: The starting position identifier or index within the navigation mesh.
      This typically represents a node or point in the navmesh.
  - name: direction
    description: The angular direction in radians from which to calculate the new
      position. Zero radians points east, with positive values rotating counterclockwise.
  - name: distance
    description: The distance in world units to move from the origin point along the
      specified direction. Must be non-negative.
  - name: result
    description: Output parameter that will contain the calculated destination position
      identifier or index after successful computation.
  returns: True if the new position was successfully calculated and is valid within
    the navigation mesh; false otherwise, which may occur due to invalid inputs, out-of-bounds
    calculations, or navigation mesh errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for calculating a point ahead of an NPC
    code: "Map* map = ...; // Assume valid map\nint origin = 12345; // Starting navmesh\
      \ node\nfloat direction = M_PI / 4.0f; // 45 degrees in radians\nfloat distance\
      \ = 10.0f;\nint result;\nif (navMeshInterface->GetPositionInDirection(map, origin,\
      \ direction, distance, result)) {\n    // Use result as new destination for\
      \ NPC movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying navigation mesh data structure and may
    have performance implications when called frequently in tight loops. The 'origin'
    parameter should refer to a valid node within the navmesh, otherwise results are
    undefined. The method does not perform any collision detection beyond checking
    the validity of the resulting position in the navmesh.
  warnings: Passing invalid map pointers or negative distance values may lead to undefined
    behavior. The result position might be outside of expected movement boundaries
    even if the function returns true, especially near map edges or in areas with
    sparse navigation data.
