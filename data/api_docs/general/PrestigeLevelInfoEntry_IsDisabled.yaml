  method: IsDisabled
  signature: bool PrestigeLevelInfoEntry::IsDisabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the prestige level entry is disabled in the game system.
  description: The IsDisabled method checks if a PrestigeLevelInfoEntry is marked
    as disabled within the TrinityCore database or configuration. This typically indicates
    that the prestige level should not be available to players, either due to being
    locked behind certain conditions, deprecated, or intentionally hidden from gameplay.
    The method returns a boolean value where true signifies the entry is disabled
    and false means it is active and usable.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating the disable status of the prestige level entry.
    Returns true if the entry is disabled, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a Prestige Level is Disabled
    code: "PrestigeLevelInfoEntry* entry = sPrestigeLevelMgr->GetPrestigeLevelInfo(10);\n\
      if (entry && entry->IsDisabled()) {\n    // Handle disabled prestige level\n\
      \    printf(\"Prestige level 10 is currently disabled.\\n\");\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Proceed with normal operations\n    printf(\"Prestige level 10 is active.\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely reads from an internal flag or database field that determines
    the visibility and usability of a prestige level in-game. It's commonly used during
    character progression checks, UI rendering logic, and validation before allowing
    access to advanced content.
