  signature: LocaleConstant World::GetAvailableDbcLocale(LocaleConstant locale) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the highest available DBC locale for the given locale constant.
  description: The GetAvailableDbcLocale method determines the highest available locale
    that is supported for DBC (Database Client) files based on the provided locale
    constant. This method is used internally by TrinityCore to ensure that client
    data is loaded in the most appropriate language or fallback locale when a specific
    locale is not available. It typically checks against the server's configured locales
    and returns the best matching locale that has corresponding DBC files. The returned
    locale constant represents the actual locale that can be used for loading localized
    game data such as item names, creature descriptions, and other text elements.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a LocaleConstant representing the highest available locale that
    supports DBC files for the given input locale. If the input locale is not supported,
    it may return a fallback locale (such as LocaleConstant::LOCALE_en).
  examples:
  - title: Get Available DBC Locale for English
    code: 'LocaleConstant availableLocale = sWorld->GetAvailableDbcLocale(LocaleConstant::LOCALE_en);

      // Returns LOCALE_en if English DBC files are available, otherwise returns a
      fallback locale.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Available Locale for French
    code: "LocaleConstant frenchLocale = sWorld->GetAvailableDbcLocale(LocaleConstant::LOCALE_fr);\n\
      if (frenchLocale == LocaleConstant::LOCALE_fr)\n{\n    // French DBC files are\
      \ available\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Fall back to another locale\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during server initialization and locale validation.
    It relies on the server's configured supported locales and DBC file availability.
    The implementation may vary depending on how the server was compiled with localization
    support.
  warnings: Be aware that this method does not validate whether a specific DBC file
    actually exists for the returned locale; it only checks if the locale is considered
    available by the server configuration.
