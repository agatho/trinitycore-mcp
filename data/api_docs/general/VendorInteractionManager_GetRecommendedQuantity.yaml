  signature: uint32 VendorInteractionManager::GetRecommendedQuantity(const ItemTemplate
    * item) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the recommended quantity of an item a player should
    purchase from a vendor.
  description: The GetRecommendedQuantity method determines the optimal number of
    items a player should buy from a vendor based on various game mechanics such as
    item stacking limits, player inventory space, and vendor stock availability. This
    method is typically used in vendor interaction logic to provide intuitive purchasing
    suggestions to players. The calculation considers both client-side and server-side
    constraints to ensure that the recommended quantity is both feasible and beneficial
    for the player's current inventory state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the recommended quantity of items to
    purchase. This value will typically be 1 or greater, but may return 0 if no items
    can be purchased due to inventory constraints or vendor limitations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Vendor Interaction
    code: "ItemTemplate const* item = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nuint32\
      \ recommendedQty = vendorManager.GetRecommendedQuantity(item);\nif (recommendedQty\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with purchasing recommended quantity\n    player->AddItem(item->ItemId,\
      \ recommendedQty);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal vendor data structures and player
    inventory management systems. It may cache calculations for performance reasons
    in active vendor sessions. The exact algorithm used to determine the recommendation
    is implementation-specific but generally aims to prevent overstocking while maximizing
    utility for the player.
  warnings: The returned quantity does not guarantee that the purchase will succeed
    - additional checks such as gold balance, item availability, and inventory space
    must still be validated before executing a transaction. This method should not
    be used as the sole validation mechanism for vendor purchases.
