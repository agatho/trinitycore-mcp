  class: GroupModel
  method: ~GroupModel
  signature: void GroupModel::~GroupModel()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a GroupModel instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~GroupModel destructor is automatically invoked when a GroupModel
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory, internal data structures, and resources
    held by the GroupModel instance. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft
    emulation, GroupModel objects are typically used to manage group-based data such
    as player formations, vehicle groups, or other collective entity behaviors. The
    destructor performs necessary cleanup operations to prevent memory leaks and maintain
    system stability.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of GroupModel instance
    code: 'GroupModel* model = new GroupModel();

      // ... use the model ...

      delete model; // Triggers ~GroupModel destructor'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic destruction via scope exit
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    GroupModel model;\n    // ... use model ...\n\
      } // ~GroupModel automatically called here"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when objects are destroyed.
    Developers should not manually invoke destructors unless performing low-level
    memory management. The GroupModel destructor likely handles cleanup of internal
    collections, references to other objects, and any cached data structures.
  warnings: Do not manually call the destructor unless implementing custom memory
    management patterns. Calling ~GroupModel directly on an already-destroyed object
    will result in undefined behavior. Ensure all references to the GroupModel are
    cleared before destruction to prevent dangling pointers.
