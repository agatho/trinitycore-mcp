  class: BotPopulationManager
  method: CalculateZoneTargets
  signature: void BotPopulationManager::CalculateZoneTargets()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and updates the target population counts for bot zones based on
    current server conditions and configuration settings.
  description: The CalculateZoneTargets method determines how many bots should be
    present in each zone by evaluating various factors such as player density, zone
    difficulty, and configured bot population limits. This method is typically invoked
    during periodic updates or when zone conditions change to ensure optimal bot distribution
    across the game world. It processes all active zones and adjusts their target
    bot counts accordingly, which may influence future bot spawning operations. The
    calculation considers both static configuration values and dynamic server metrics
    to maintain balanced gameplay environments.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotPopulationManager* manager = BotPopulationManager::Instance();

      manager->CalculateZoneTargets();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called from a periodic timer or event handler and
    should not be invoked manually in most cases. The calculation results are stored
    internally and affect subsequent bot spawning logic. Performance may be impacted
    during high server load due to zone enumeration and data processing.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently can cause unnecessary computational
    overhead. It's designed to run at regular intervals rather than on-demand, so
    avoid direct calls unless specifically required for debugging or special circumstances.
