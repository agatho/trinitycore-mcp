  class: DestructionWarlockRefactored
  method: ExecuteSingleTargetRotation
  signature: void DestructionWarlockRefactored::ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(int *
    target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the destruction warlock's single-target rotation logic for the specified
    target.
  description: The ExecuteSingleTargetRotation method implements the core combat logic
    for a destruction warlock when engaging a single enemy target. This method evaluates
    the current spell cooldowns, mana availability, and target conditions to determine
    the optimal sequence of spells to cast. It typically includes the use of primary
    damage abilities such as Shadow Bolt, Incinerate, and Chaos Bolt, while considering
    the effects of talents like Immolate and Conflagrate. The method is designed to
    maximize damage output per second (DPS) for single-target encounters within the
    TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's unique identifier
      or index in the combat system. This parameter defines which enemy unit the rotation
      logic will apply to.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int targetId = 12345;

      warlock->ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Manager
    code: "void WarlockAI::Update()\n{\n    if (me->getVictim())\n    {\n        int\
      \ target = me->getVictim()->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n        ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(&target);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the warlock has a valid target and sufficient resources
    (mana, spell cooldowns) to execute its rotation. It should be called within a
    combat context where the AI is actively engaged with an enemy. The implementation
    may vary based on the specific version of TrinityCore and any custom modifications
    made to the warlock AI.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid, alive enemy unit;
    otherwise, the method may cause undefined behavior or crashes. Avoid calling this
    method outside of combat or when the warlock is not properly initialized with
    required spell data.
