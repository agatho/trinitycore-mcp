  signature: void EvokerAI::ManageBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Manages the application and removal of beneficial buffs for the evoker unit.
  description: The ManageBuffs method is responsible for handling the logic that determines
    when to apply or remove beneficial auras (buffs) on an EvokerAI-controlled unit.
    This includes checking the current state of the unit's auras, evaluating conditions
    such as health thresholds or combat status, and invoking appropriate spell casting
    or aura management functions. The method ensures that the evoker maintains optimal
    buffing behavior in accordance with its role and the game's AI rules. It typically
    runs during each AI update cycle to dynamically adjust the unit's active buffs
    based on evolving battlefield conditions.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n \
      \   ManageBuffs();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called from within the AI's main update loop and should
    not be invoked manually unless necessary. It relies on internal state tracking
    of the unit's current buffs, so it must be called after any changes to the unit's
    aura status have been processed.
  warnings: Improper implementation or calling this method outside of the intended
    context may lead to incorrect buff application or removal, potentially causing
    gameplay imbalance or unexpected behavior in the evoker's performance.
