documentation:
  brief: Loads reward choice items for a quest, populating the internal data structure
    with item information.
  description: This method initializes and loads the reward choice items associated
    with a specific quest. It processes the quest's reward choices by parsing the
    provided fields array and populating internal structures that represent the available
    reward options. The method is typically invoked during quest loading phases when
    the quest data needs to be processed for reward selection. This functionality
    is essential for handling quest rewards where players can choose from multiple
    item options, such as in quest completion scenarios where the player must select
    one of several possible rewards.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Reward Choice Loading
    code: 'Quest quest;

      int fields[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};

      quest.LoadRewardChoiceItems(fields);

      // This loads reward choices for the quest using the provided fields array'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest loading process and should not
    be called directly by external code. It requires proper initialization of quest
    data structures before execution. The method may involve database queries or data
    parsing depending on how the quest data was loaded.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect reward choices being
    displayed to players, potentially causing game balance issues or player confusion
    during quest completion. This method should only be called when the quest data
    is fully initialized and ready for processing.
