  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: CalculateStandardDeviation
  signature: float MarketAnalysis::CalculateStandardDeviation(const int & prices)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the standard deviation of a set of market prices.
  description: The CalculateStandardDeviation method computes the statistical standard
    deviation of a collection of market prices, which is used to measure the volatility
    or dispersion of price data. This calculation helps traders and analysts understand
    how much variation exists in the pricing data from the average price. The method
    operates on a predefined set of prices stored within the MarketAnalysis class
    instance and returns a floating-point value representing the standard deviation.
    In the context of World of Warcraft's auction house system, this metric can be
    used to assess market stability or identify unusual price fluctuations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated standard deviation of the market
    prices. A higher value indicates greater volatility in the price data, while a
    lower value suggests more stable pricing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analyzer;

      float stdDev = analyzer.CalculateStandardDeviation();

      std::cout << "Standard Deviation: " << stdDev << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the MarketAnalysis class has a member variable containing
    price data. The implementation likely uses a population standard deviation formula
    (dividing by N) rather than sample standard deviation (dividing by N-1). Performance
    is dependent on the number of prices stored in the internal data structure.
  warnings: The method may throw an exception or return an invalid value if no price
    data is available. Ensure that price data has been properly initialized before
    calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
