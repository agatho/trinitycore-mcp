  class: LfgPlayerData
  method: SetRoles
  signature: void LfgPlayerData::SetRoles(uint8 roles)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's LFG roles for dungeon finding.
  description: The SetRoles method updates the player's selected roles within the
    Looking for Group (LFG) system. This method is used to define which roles a player
    is willing to take on during dungeon group matching, such as tank, healer, or
    damage dealer. The roles parameter is typically a bitmask representing one or
    more role types. This method directly affects how the LFG system matches players
    into groups and should be called when a player changes their preferred roles.
  parameters:
  - name: roles
    description: A bitmask value representing the player's selected LFG roles. Common
      values include LFG_ROLE_TANK, LFG_ROLE_HEALER, LFG_ROLE_DAMAGE, or combinations
      of these flags.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Player's Role to Tank
    code: 'LfgPlayerData* playerData = sLFGMgr->GetPlayerData(playerGuid);

      playerData->SetRoles(LFG_ROLE_TANK);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Multiple Roles for a Player
    code: 'LfgPlayerData* playerData = sLFGMgr->GetPlayerData(playerGuid);

      uint8 roles = LFG_ROLE_TANK | LFG_ROLE_HEALER;

      playerData->SetRoles(roles);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called whenever a player updates their role preferences
    in the LFG interface. Changes made through this method will immediately affect
    future group matching operations. The roles parameter is expected to be a valid
    bitmask and may be validated by the LFG manager before being applied.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or unsupported role bitmask may result
    in unexpected behavior during group matching. Ensure that only defined LFG_ROLE_*
    constants are used to avoid undefined behavior.
