  method: GetAuctionsById
  signature: AuctionHouseObject * AuctionHouseMgr::GetAuctionsById(uint32 auctionHouseId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the auction house object associated with the specified auction
    house identifier.
  description: The GetAuctionsById method fetches an AuctionHouseObject instance from
    the internal auction house manager cache based on the provided auction house ID.
    This method is typically used to access specific auction house data structures
    for processing auctions, retrieving auction listings, or managing auction-related
    operations within the game world. The method assumes that the auction house ID
    corresponds to a valid auction house in the game's database and will return a
    pointer to the corresponding AuctionHouseObject if found. If no matching auction
    house is found, the method may return nullptr depending on implementation details.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an AuctionHouseObject instance representing the auction house
    with the specified ID, or nullptr if no such auction house exists in the system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "AuctionHouseObject* auctionHouse = sAuctionHouseMgr->GetAuctionsById(1);\n\
      if (auctionHouse != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process the auction house data\n   \
      \ sLog->outString(\"Found auction house with ID: %u\", auctionHouse->GetId());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Auction House Validity
    code: "uint32 auctionHouseId = 5;\nAuctionHouseObject* ah = sAuctionHouseMgr->GetAuctionsById(auctionHouseId);\n\
      if (ah != nullptr && ah->GetId() == auctionHouseId)\n{\n    // Safe to use the\
      \ auction house object\n    std::string name = ah->GetName();\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Auction House '%s' found.\", name.c_str());\n}\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Invalid or missing auction house ID: %u\", auctionHouseId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses a cached collection of auction houses managed by the
    AuctionHouseMgr singleton. It is recommended to check for null returns before
    using the returned pointer. The method does not perform any database lookups directly;
    it operates on pre-loaded data structures.
  warnings: Always verify that the returned pointer is not null before dereferencing
    it. Using an invalid auction house ID may lead to undefined behavior or crashes
    if not properly validated.
