  class: NavMeshInterface
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: void NavMeshInterface::GetStatistics(uint32 & queries, uint32 & hits,
    uint32 & avgTime) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves navigation mesh query statistics including total queries, hits,
    and average query time.
  description: The GetStatistics method collects and returns performance metrics from
    the navigation mesh system. It provides insight into how frequently pathfinding
    queries are being executed, how many of those queries successfully found a path,
    and the average time taken for each query. This information is crucial for developers
    monitoring AI pathfinding performance in World of Warcraft environments. The method
    updates the provided reference parameters with current statistics values, making
    it useful for debugging, optimization, and performance analysis of navigation
    systems.
  parameters:
  - name: queries
    description: Reference to a uint32 variable that will be updated with the total
      number of navigation mesh queries executed since the last reset.
  - name: hits
    description: Reference to a uint32 variable that will be updated with the number
      of successful pathfinding queries (queries that found a valid path).
  - name: avgTime
    description: Reference to a uint32 variable that will be updated with the average
      time (in microseconds) taken for each navigation mesh query.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 totalQueries = 0;

      uint32 successfulHits = 0;

      uint32 averageTime = 0;

      navMeshInterface->GetStatistics(totalQueries, successfulHits, averageTime);

      std::cout << "Total Queries: " << totalQueries << ", Hits: " << successfulHits
      << ", Avg Time: " << averageTime << " microseconds" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Example
    code: "void MonitorNavigationPerformance() {\n    static uint32 lastQueries =\
      \ 0;\n    static uint32 lastHits = 0;\n    static uint32 lastTime = 0;\n   \
      \ \n    uint32 currentQueries, currentHits, currentTime;\n    navMeshInterface->GetStatistics(currentQueries,\
      \ currentHits, currentTime);\n    \n    if (currentQueries > lastQueries) {\n\
      \        float hitRate = (float)(currentHits - lastHits) / (currentQueries -\
      \ lastQueries) * 100.0f;\n        printf(\"Navigation Hit Rate: %.2f%%, Avg\
      \ Time: %u \u03BCs\\n\", hitRate, currentTime);\n    }\n    \n    lastQueries\
      \ = currentQueries;\n    lastHits = currentHits;\n    lastTime = currentTime;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for performance monitoring and debugging navigation
    issues. The statistics are cumulative and reset periodically by the system. It's
    recommended to call this method at regular intervals or during specific profiling
    phases rather than continuously in high-frequency loops.
  warnings: Be aware that calling GetStatistics too frequently can introduce minor
    overhead, though it's generally negligible. The returned values represent cumulative
    statistics since the last reset, so they should be compared against previous values
    for meaningful performance analysis.
