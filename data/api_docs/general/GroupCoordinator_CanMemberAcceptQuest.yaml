    const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a group member can accept a specified quest based on group
    coordination rules.
  description: The CanMemberAcceptQuest method determines if a given player member
    of a group is eligible to accept a specific quest. This check typically involves
    verifying that the player meets prerequisites such as level requirements, quest
    completion status, and group coordination rules. The method ensures that only
    appropriate players within the group can take on quests, maintaining game balance
    and preventing exploits. It's commonly used in group quest systems where quest
    acceptance must be coordinated among group members.
  parameters:
  - name: member
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the group member who wishes
      to accept the quest. Must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest that the player is attempting
      to accept. Must be a valid quest ID present in the game database.
  returns: Returns true if the member can accept the quest according to group coordination
    rules, false otherwise. The method returns false if the player is not in a group,
    if the quest has already been accepted by another group member, or if the player
    does not meet the prerequisites for accepting the quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Acceptance Check
    code: "if (groupCoordinator->CanMemberAcceptQuest(player, 12345)) {\n    // Player\
      \ can accept quest 12345\n    player->AddQuest(12345);\n} else {\n    // Player\
      \ cannot accept the quest\n    player->SendNotification(\"You cannot accept\
      \ this quest at this time.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Group Quest Acceptance Validation
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group) {\n    for (Group::MemberSlotList::const_iterator\
      \ itr = group->GetMemberSlots().begin();\n         itr != group->GetMemberSlots().end();\
      \ ++itr)\n    {\n        Player* member = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(itr->guid);\n\
      \        if (member && groupCoordinator->CanMemberAcceptQuest(member, questId))\
      \ {\n            // Proceed with quest assignment\n            member->AddQuest(questId);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against the group's quest coordination
    state and may interact with the player's quest log to prevent duplicate quest
    acceptance. It is designed to be thread-safe as part of the group management system,
    but direct access to group data should consider locking mechanisms if accessed
    from multiple threads.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method. Invalid pointers can lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Additionally,
    this method may not account for all quest-specific conditions beyond group coordination,
    so further validation might be required in some cases.
