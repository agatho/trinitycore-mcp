api:
  class: ComplaintTicket
  method: SetChatLog
  signature: void ComplaintTicket::SetChatLog(const int & log)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the chat log for a complaint ticket to the specified integer value.
  description: The SetChatLog method assigns a chat log identifier to a complaint
    ticket, which typically corresponds to a specific set of chat messages or logs
    related to the reported issue. This method is used internally by the TrinityCore
    server to associate chat data with player complaints, allowing administrators
    to review relevant communication when processing tickets. The parameter represents
    an identifier that maps to a particular chat log entry within the game's logging
    system. This method does not validate the provided log value against existing
    chat logs; it simply assigns the given integer as the ticket's chat log reference.
  parameters:
  - name: log
    description: An integer value representing the identifier of the chat log to be
      associated with this complaint ticket. This value typically corresponds to a
      unique index or ID in the server's chat logging system, and should reference
      an existing log entry for proper functionality.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Chat Log for Complaint Ticket
    code: 'ComplaintTicket* ticket = new ComplaintTicket();

      ticket->SetChatLog(12345); // Assigns chat log ID 12345 to the ticket'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during complaint ticket creation or modification.
    It's important to ensure that the provided log value corresponds to a valid chat
    log entry in the system, otherwise the associated data may not be retrievable.
    The method performs no validation of the input parameter.
  warnings: Using an invalid or non-existent log ID may result in missing or corrupted
    data when administrators attempt to review the chat logs associated with this
    ticket. Ensure that all log IDs passed to this method are valid and exist within
    the server's chat logging subsystem.
