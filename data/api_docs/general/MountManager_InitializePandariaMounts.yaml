  brief: Initializes Pandaria-specific mount data and configurations for the MountManager.
  description: The InitializePandariaMounts method sets up all necessary mount-related
    data and configurations specific to the Pandaria expansion content. This includes
    loading mount templates, setting up mount criteria, and ensuring that Pandaria-themed
    mounts are properly registered within the game system. The method is typically
    called during server initialization or when expanding the mount database to include
    Pandaria content. It ensures that players can access and acquire Pandaria-specific
    mounts through normal gameplay progression.

  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'MountManager* mountMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetMountManager();

      mountMgr->InitializePandariaMounts();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server startup or when adding
    Pandaria content to an existing server. It modifies global mount data structures
    and may impact performance if called repeatedly. The method assumes that Pandaria
    expansion data is properly loaded in the game system.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in duplicate mount entries
    or unexpected behavior. Ensure that all Pandaria-related data files are correctly
    loaded before invoking this method.
