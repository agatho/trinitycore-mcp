  method: EmergencyMemoryCleanup
  signature: void BotMemoryManager::EmergencyMemoryCleanup()
documentation:
  brief: Performs immediate cleanup of bot memory resources to prevent memory leaks
    during emergency situations.
  description: The EmergencyMemoryCleanup method is designed to forcefully release
    all allocated memory resources used by bot instances in the TrinityCore environment.
    This method is typically invoked when the server encounters critical conditions
    such as memory exhaustion, system shutdown, or unexpected errors that require
    immediate resource deallocation. It ensures that no dangling pointers or leaked
    memory persist after bot operations have terminated unexpectedly. The cleanup
    process may involve releasing memory pools, clearing data structures, and resetting
    internal state variables to prevent further memory corruption or instability.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Emergency Cleanup Usage
    code: 'BotMemoryManager::EmergencyMemoryCleanup();

      // Called during server shutdown or critical error handling'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called in emergency scenarios as it bypasses normal
    cleanup procedures. It is not intended for regular use and may leave bots in an
    inconsistent state if invoked outside of proper error recovery contexts.
  warnings: Invoking this method during normal operation can cause undefined behavior
    or crashes if bot systems are still active. It should only be used when other
    cleanup mechanisms have failed or when the system is entering a shutdown sequence.
