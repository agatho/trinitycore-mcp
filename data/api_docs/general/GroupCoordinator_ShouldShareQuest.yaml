documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a quest should be shared with group members based on group
    coordination rules.
  description: The ShouldShareQuest method evaluates whether a specific quest, identified
    by its quest ID, should be made available to other players in the same group.
    This functionality is part of the Group Coordinator's logic that manages quest
    distribution within player groups. The method typically checks various conditions
    such as quest flags, group member requirements, and quest sharing rules defined
    in the game's configuration or database. It ensures that quests are only shared
    when appropriate according to the group's coordination settings and the quest's
    properties.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest should be shared with group members; otherwise
    returns false. A return value of true indicates that the quest meets all criteria
    for group sharing, while false means it should remain private or be handled differently
    within the group context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check quest sharing eligibility
    code: "if (groupCoordinator->ShouldShareQuest(12345)) {\n    // Quest can be shared\
      \ with group members\n    SendQuestToGroupMembers(12345);\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Quest should not be shared\n    Player->SendQuestFailed(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal group coordination settings and
    quest flags stored in the database. It may also consider player roles, quest levels,
    and other group-specific parameters to determine sharing eligibility. The implementation
    might be optimized for performance since it's called frequently during group operations.
  warnings: Do not rely on this method alone for quest validation; always verify that
    the quest is actually available to players before attempting to share it. Incorrect
    use of this method may lead to quests being shared inappropriately or not shared
    when they should be.
