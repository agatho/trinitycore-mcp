documentation:
  brief: Adds a game object GUID to the destroy list for network updates
  description: The AddDestroyObject method adds a specified game object's unique identifier
    (GUID) to the internal destroy object list within the UpdateData class. This method
    is typically used during world object updates to inform clients about objects
    that should be removed from their local world state. The GUID parameter represents
    the unique identifier of the object being destroyed, which could be a player,
    creature, game object, or item. When this method is called, the GUID is queued
    for transmission in the next network update packet sent to relevant clients.
  parameters: []
  returns: void

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'UpdateData data;

      ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::GameObject>(12345);

      data.AddDestroyObject(guid.GetRawValue());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's update system and works in conjunction
    with other UpdateData methods like AddUpdateObject and BuildUpdatePacket. The
    GUID should be a valid object identifier from the game world, otherwise behavior
    is undefined. This method does not immediately remove objects from memory; it
    only marks them for destruction in client updates.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may cause client-side
    errors or unexpected behavior. Ensure that the GUID corresponds to an actual object
    in the world before calling this method. Do not call this method on objects that
    are already marked for destruction, as it may lead to duplicate entries in the
    update packet.
