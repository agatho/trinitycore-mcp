  class: LootAnalysis
  method: AnalyzeWeaponItem
  signature: float LootAnalysis::AnalyzeWeaponItem(Player * player, const LootItem
    & item)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns a numerical score representing the value of a weapon
    item for a given player.
  description: The AnalyzeWeaponItem method computes a float-based value score for
    a weapon item based on various factors such as item level, damage statistics,
    enchantments, and the player's current gear context. This score helps determine
    the relative worth of the weapon in comparison to other potential loot items.
    The method considers the player's class, specialization, and current equipped
    weapons to provide an accurate assessment. It is typically used in loot distribution
    systems or for evaluating item quality during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose inventory and preferences are
      considered when analyzing the weapon item.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to a LootItem structure representing the weapon being analyzed,
      containing item data such as stats and quality.
  returns: A float value representing the computed score of the weapon. Higher values
    indicate better relative worth or desirability for the given player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nLootItem item = ...;\nfloat score = lootAnalysis.AnalyzeWeaponItem(player,\
      \ item);\nif (score > 10.0f) {\n    // Consider this weapon highly valuable\
      \ for the player\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Loot Distribution
    code: "void DistributeLoot(Player* player, std::vector<LootItem>& lootItems) {\n\
      \    float bestScore = -1.0f;\n    LootItem* bestItem = nullptr;\n    \n   \
      \ for (auto& item : lootItems) {\n        float score = lootAnalysis.AnalyzeWeaponItem(player,\
      \ item);\n        if (score > bestScore) {\n            bestScore = score;\n\
      \            bestItem = &item;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    if (bestItem) {\n\
      \        // Award the highest-value weapon to the player\n        player->AddItem(bestItem->itemid,\
      \ 1);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal algorithms that weigh weapon stats like
    damage per second (DPS), item level, and bonus attributes against the player's
    current gear. It may also factor in class-specific preferences or specialization
    requirements.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and item parameters are valid and not null before
    calling this method to avoid undefined behavior. The returned score is relative
    and should not be used as an absolute measure of item value outside of its intended
    context.
