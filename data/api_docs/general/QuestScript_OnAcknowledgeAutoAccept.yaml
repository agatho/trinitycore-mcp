  class: QuestScript
  method: OnAcknowledgeAutoAccept
  signature: void QuestScript::OnAcknowledgeAutoAccept(Player * player, const Quest
    * quest)
documentation:
  brief: Called when a player acknowledges an auto-accepted quest.
  description: This method is invoked in the TrinityCore QuestScript system when a
    player acknowledges a quest that was automatically accepted, typically through
    quest gating or automatic quest acceptance mechanics. It allows custom scripts
    to execute logic upon such acknowledgment, such as modifying quest state, triggering
    events, or performing player-specific actions. The method is part of the quest
    lifecycle and is called after the quest has been auto-accepted but before any
    further quest processing occurs.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object who acknowledged the quest. This represents
      the player character who accepted the quest automatically.
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that was auto-accepted. Contains all
      relevant quest data and properties for the acknowledged quest.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic implementation example
    code: "class MyQuestScript : public QuestScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnAcknowledgeAutoAccept(Player*\
      \ player, const Quest* quest) override\n    {\n        // Log the event\n  \
      \      sLog->outString(\"Player %s auto-accepted quest %u\", player->GetName(),\
      \ quest->GetQuestId());\n        \n        // Perform custom logic here\n  \
      \      player->SendNotification(\"You have accepted a new quest!\");\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in custom quest scripts to extend or modify
    the behavior of auto-accepted quests. It's important to note that this method
    is called during the quest acceptance flow, so modifying the player's state or
    quest data should be done carefully to avoid conflicts with core systems.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy operations or database writes within this method
    as it may impact performance. Also, ensure that any modifications made to the
    player or quest state are consistent with the expected behavior of the quest system.
