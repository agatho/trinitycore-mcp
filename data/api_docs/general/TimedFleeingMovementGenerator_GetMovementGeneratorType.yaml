documentation:
  brief: Returns the movement generator type identifier for timed fleeing behavior
  description: The GetMovementGeneratorType method retrieves the unique type identifier
    associated with the TimedFleeingMovementGenerator class. This identifier is used
    by the game's AI system to distinguish different types of movement generators
    and manage their behavior appropriately. The method is typically called during
    movement processing to determine how an NPC or creature should move in response
    to fleeing mechanics. It returns a constant integer value that represents this
    generator's type within the TrinityCore movement system.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the movement generator type identifier for timed
    fleeing behavior. This value is typically a predefined constant that uniquely
    identifies this specific movement generator type within the game's movement system.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Movement Generator Type
    code: "TimedFleeingMovementGenerator fleeGen;\nint type = fleeGen.GetMovementGeneratorType();\n\
      if (type == MOVEMENTGENERATOR_TYPE_TIMED_FLEEING)\n{\n    // Handle timed fleeing\
      \ movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that returns a predefined constant value.
    The actual integer value returned may vary depending on the specific implementation
    in the TrinityCore codebase, but it should consistently identify this movement
    generator type across all instances.
