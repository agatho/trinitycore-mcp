documentation:
  brief: Clears all quest entries from the quest menu, removing any available quests
    for the player to select.
  description: The ClearMenu method removes all quest entries from the current quest
    menu instance. This method is typically invoked when a player interacts with an
    NPC or object that should no longer display any available quests. It effectively
    resets the quest menu state, ensuring that subsequent interactions can populate
    it with new quest data. The method does not take any parameters and performs no
    validation, making it safe to call at any time during quest interaction sequences.
    This is commonly used when transitioning between different quest states or when
    a player has completed all available quests in a particular dialogue context.

  examples:
  - title: Clearing Quest Menu Before Dialogue Change
    code: "void OnGossipHello(Player* player, Creature* creature)\n{\n    // Clear\
      \ any existing quests from the menu\n    player->PlayerTalkClass->ClearMenu();\n\
      \    \n    // Add new quest options based on player's progress\n    if (player->GetQuestStatus(12345)\
      \ == QUEST_STATUS_NONE)\n        player->ADD_QUEST_SLOT(12345);\n    \n    player->SEND_GOSSIP_MENU(DEFAULT_GOSSIP_MESSAGE,\
      \ creature->GetGUID());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly manipulates the internal quest menu state and should
    be used carefully during gossip handling. It's recommended to call ClearMenu()
    before adding new quest options to ensure clean state management. The method is
    thread-safe as it operates on player-specific data structures.
