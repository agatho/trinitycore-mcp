  class: TargetAssistAction
  method: GetAssistPosition
  signature: bool TargetAssistAction::GetAssistPosition(Player * bot, Unit * target,
    float & x, float & y, float & z) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and retrieves the optimal assist position for a bot to engage
    a target unit.
  description: The GetAssistPosition method determines the best spatial coordinates
    (x, y, z) for a bot player to move to in order to effectively assist or engage
    a specified target unit. This method is typically used within AI behavior logic
    to calculate positioning for combat actions, ensuring that the bot maintains an
    appropriate distance and orientation relative to its target. The method evaluates
    factors such as target position, bot's current location, movement capabilities,
    and combat mechanics to compute a suitable assist position. It returns true if
    a valid position was calculated and assigned to the provided x, y, z reference
    parameters; otherwise, it returns false, indicating that no suitable assist position
    could be determined.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that needs to calculate
      an assist position. Must not be null.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target unit the bot intends
      to assist or engage. Must not be null.
  - name: x
    description: Reference to a float value where the calculated X coordinate of the
      assist position will be stored upon successful execution.
  - name: y
    description: Reference to a float value where the calculated Y coordinate of the
      assist position will be stored upon successful execution.
  - name: z
    description: Reference to a float value where the calculated Z coordinate of the
      assist position will be stored upon successful execution.
  returns: True if a valid assist position was successfully computed and assigned
    to the x, y, z parameters; false otherwise, indicating that no suitable assist
    position could be determined based on current conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GetAssistPosition
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nUnit* target = ...;\nfloat x, y, z;\nif (bot->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator()->GetAssistPosition(bot,\
      \ target, x, y, z)) {\n    // Proceed with movement to calculated position\n\
      \    bot->GetMotionMaster()->MovePoint(0, x, y, z);\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ case where no assist position is available\n    bot->Say(\"Cannot determine\
      \ assist position.\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal AI and movement logic of the TrinityCore framework.
    It may consider factors like target's current movement, bot's attack range, terrain,
    and combat state. The coordinates returned are in world space and should be used
    directly with movement commands such as MovePoint or similar.
  warnings: Ensure that both 'bot' and 'target' pointers are valid before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior. Also, note that the assist position may
    not always be reachable due to environmental constraints or movement restrictions.
