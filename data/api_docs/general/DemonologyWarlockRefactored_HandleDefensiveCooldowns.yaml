documentation:
  brief: Manages and applies defensive cooldowns for the demonology warlock during
    combat.
  description: The HandleDefensiveCooldowns method is responsible for executing defensive
    abilities and cooldown management specific to the demonology warlock class. This
    method evaluates the current state of the player's defensive cooldowns, such as
    Soulstone, Dark Pact, or other protective spells, and determines when and how
    to activate them based on combat conditions. It ensures that defensive abilities
    are used optimally to maximize survivability during high-damage encounters. The
    method typically integrates with the warlock's AI decision-making process to prioritize
    defensive actions over offensive ones when necessary. This function is part of
    the core combat logic and is invoked regularly during active combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void DemonologyWarlockAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic\
      \ ...\n    HandleDefensiveCooldowns();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active combat scenarios. The implementation
    assumes that the warlock's current health and threat level are properly evaluated
    before defensive cooldowns are considered. It is recommended to call this method
    at regular intervals (e.g., every 100ms) within the AI update loop for optimal
    performance.
  warnings: Improper invocation of this method outside of combat may lead to incorrect
    behavior or unnecessary resource consumption. Ensure that all defensive cooldowns
    are properly tracked and reset after use to prevent overuse or stacking issues.
