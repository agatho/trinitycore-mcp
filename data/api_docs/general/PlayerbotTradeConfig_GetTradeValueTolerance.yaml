  method: GetTradeValueTolerance
  signature: float PlayerbotTradeConfig::GetTradeValueTolerance()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the tolerance value used for trade evaluations in player bot trading
    logic.
  description: The GetTradeValueTolerance method returns a floating-point value that
    defines the acceptable variance in item values during automated trading decisions
    made by player bots. This tolerance determines how much deviation from the expected
    trade value is allowed before a trade is considered unfavorable or rejected. The
    value is typically used in conjunction with other trade-related configurations
    to ensure that bot players do not engage in trades that are significantly disadvantageous.
    This method does not take any parameters and always returns a positive float representing
    the tolerance level.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the trade value tolerance, which indicates the
    maximum allowable deviation from expected trade values during automated trading
    decisions. Values are typically between 0.0 and 1.0, where higher values allow
    for greater variance in trade evaluations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float tolerance = playerbotTradeConfig->GetTradeValueTolerance();\nif (tolerance\
      \ > 0.1f)\n{\n    // Proceed with trade logic that allows for higher variance\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PlayerbotTradeConfig class which manages configuration
    settings for automated trading behavior in player bots. The returned value directly
    influences how bots evaluate potential trades and should be consistent across
    all trade-related operations within a given bot instance.
