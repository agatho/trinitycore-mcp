api:
  class: World
  method: KickAllLess
  signature: void World::KickAllLess(AccountTypes sec)
documentation:
  brief: Kicks all players from the server with a security level lower than the specified
    value.
  description: The KickAllLess method iterates through all connected players on the
    server and disconnects those whose account security level is strictly less than
    the provided parameter. This function is typically used by administrative commands
    or scripts to enforce security policies or perform server maintenance by removing
    lower-privileged users. The operation affects all active sessions and immediately
    terminates their connections without warning. It's a powerful tool for server
    management but should be used carefully as it can disrupt player experience.
  parameters:
  - name: sec
    description: The minimum security level threshold. All players with an account
      type lower than this value will be disconnected from the server.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Kick all players with security level below GM
    code: World::Instance()->KickAllLess(SEC_GAMEMASTER);
    language: cpp
  - title: Kick all non-administrative users
    code: World::Instance()->KickAllLess(SEC_ADMINISTRATOR);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates synchronously and may block the calling thread during
    execution if there are many connected players. It's recommended to call this function
    from a background task or administrative context rather than during high-traffic
    periods.
  warnings: Using this method with low security levels (e.g., SEC_PLAYER) can kick
    all players, potentially causing mass disconnections and disrupting gameplay.
    Always verify the intended security level before invoking this function in production
    environments.
