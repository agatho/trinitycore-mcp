  class: InterruptManager
  method: IsCurrentlyInterrupting
  signature: bool InterruptManager::IsCurrentlyInterrupting() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if an interrupt is currently in progress.
  description: The IsCurrentlyInterrupting method determines whether the current object
    (typically a unit or spell) is in the process of being interrupted. This is commonly
    used during spell casting or channeling to verify if an interruption has occurred
    and to prevent further actions that would be invalid while an interrupt is active.
    The method returns true if an interrupt is currently taking place, and false otherwise.
    It's typically called before performing operations that could be disrupted by
    interrupts.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the object is currently being interrupted, false if no
    interruption is in progress.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (unit->GetInterruptManager()->IsCurrentlyInterrupting()) {\n    // Handle\
      \ interrupt state\n    return;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often used in conjunction with spell casting logic to ensure
    that actions are not performed during an active interrupt sequence. It's important
    to note that the interrupt state may change between calls, so it should be checked
    at appropriate points in execution flow.
