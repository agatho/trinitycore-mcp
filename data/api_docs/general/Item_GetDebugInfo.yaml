  method: GetDebugInfo
  signature: std::string Item::GetDebugInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns debug information about the item including its GUID, display ID,
    and other relevant properties.
  description: The GetDebugInfo method provides detailed debugging information about
    an Item object, including its unique identifier (GUID), display ID, and various
    internal properties. This method is primarily used for debugging purposes within
    the TrinityCore framework to help developers understand the current state of an
    item. The returned string contains formatted information that can be useful for
    logging or inspecting item characteristics during development and testing phases.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a std::string containing formatted debug information about the
    item, including GUID, display ID, and other relevant properties. The string format
    typically includes key-value pairs describing different aspects of the item's
    state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Information Retrieval
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      std::string debugInfo = item->GetDebugInfo();

      // Output: "GUID: 12345, DisplayID: 67890, ..."'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in debugging scenarios and may include performance
    overhead when called frequently. It should not be used in production code unless
    specifically required for debugging purposes.
  warnings: The returned string format may vary depending on the item's internal state
    and may not always contain consistent information across different item types
    or versions of TrinityCore.
