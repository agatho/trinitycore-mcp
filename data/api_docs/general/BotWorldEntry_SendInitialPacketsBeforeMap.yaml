documentation:
  brief: Sends initial network packets to a bot player before they are added to a
    map.
  description: The SendInitialPacketsBeforeMap method is responsible for transmitting
    essential game data and configuration packets to a bot player instance prior to
    their successful addition to a specific world map. This method ensures that the
    client-side bot is properly initialized with necessary information such as character
    appearance, basic stats, and network state before it becomes visible and interactive
    within the game world. It typically handles protocol initialization, packet sequencing,
    and synchronization of the bot's state with the server's expectations. The method
    should be called during the bot creation or login process, before any map-related
    operations are performed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot initialization
    code: 'BotWorldEntry* botEntry = new BotWorldEntry();

      botEntry->SendInitialPacketsBeforeMap();

      // Proceed with adding the bot to a map after this call'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore bot management
    system and should not be called directly unless implementing custom bot creation
    logic. It may involve sending multiple low-level packets that are specific to
    the World of Warcraft client protocol.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the BotWorldEntry
    instance may result in undefined behavior or network errors. Ensure all required
    fields are set before invoking this method.
