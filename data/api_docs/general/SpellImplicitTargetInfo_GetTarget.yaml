  method: GetTarget
  signature: int SpellImplicitTargetInfo::GetTarget() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the implicit target type identifier for a spell.
  description: The GetTarget method returns the implicit target type associated with
    a spell's target information. In TrinityCore, spells can have implicit targets
    that define how the spell's target is determined without explicit player input.
    This method provides access to that target type value, which is used internally
    by the spell system to determine target validation and processing logic. The returned
    value typically corresponds to predefined target type constants defined in the
    spell system.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the implicit target type identifier. Possible values
    correspond to predefined target types such as TARGET_UNIT_CASTER, TARGET_UNIT_TARGET_ENEMY,
    etc., which define how the spell's target is resolved during execution.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Check Spell Target Type
    code: "SpellImplicitTargetInfo targetInfo;\n// Assume targetInfo has been initialized\
      \ with valid spell target data\nint targetType = targetInfo.GetTarget();\nif\
      \ (targetType == TARGET_UNIT_CASTER)\n{\n    // Handle caster as target\n  \
      \  printf(\"Spell targets the caster\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within spell processing logic to determine
    how targets are resolved. The returned integer value should be compared against
    predefined target constants from the TrinityCore spell system to understand the
    intended targeting behavior.
