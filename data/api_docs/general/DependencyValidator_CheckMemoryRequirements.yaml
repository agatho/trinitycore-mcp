documentation:
  brief: Validates that the system meets minimum memory requirements for TrinityCore
    operation
  description: The CheckMemoryRequirements method performs a comprehensive validation
    of the system's available memory to ensure it meets the minimum thresholds required
    for TrinityCore to function properly. This method typically checks against configured
    memory limits, virtual memory availability, and system resource constraints. It
    is commonly invoked during server startup or configuration validation phases to
    prevent runtime issues caused by insufficient memory allocation. The method returns
    true if all memory requirements are satisfied, or false if any constraint is violated.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the system's memory meets all minimum requirements for
    TrinityCore operation; returns false if any memory constraint is not satisfied
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Server Startup
    code: "if (!sDependencyValidator->CheckMemoryRequirements()) {\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Insufficient memory detected. Server cannot start.\");\n    exit(1);\n}\n//\
      \ Proceed with server initialization"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform system calls to query memory information and could
    have slight performance overhead during execution. It should typically be called
    early in the application lifecycle, preferably before any heavy memory allocation
    occurs.
  warnings: This method does not guarantee that the system will have sufficient memory
    for all possible operations during runtime; it only validates against minimum
    requirements. Applications should implement additional memory monitoring mechanisms
    for production environments.
