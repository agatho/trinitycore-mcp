  class: WorldSession
  method: SendBindPoint
  signature: void WorldSession::SendBindPoint(Creature * npc)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a bind point update packet to the client when a player interacts with
    a binding NPC.
  description: The SendBindPoint method is responsible for transmitting the player's
    current binding location to the client's game engine. This occurs when a player
    interacts with a binding NPC such as an innkeeper or spirit healer, allowing the
    player to set their corpse resurrection point and/or modify their home location.
    The method constructs and sends a specific packet type that updates the client's
    internal state regarding the player's bind location. It is typically invoked during
    quest progression, upon entering certain zones, or when players interact with
    specific NPCs that offer binding services.
  parameters:
  - name: npc
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the NPC that the player
      is interacting with for binding purposes. This parameter determines which bind
      point will be set and how the client's UI should update.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in NPC Greeting
    code: "void Player::OnGreet(Creature* npc)\n{\n    if (npc->GetEntry() == 12345)\
      \ // Innkeeper\n    {\n        SendBindPoint(npc);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the network layer to send packets, so
    it should only be called from within a valid session context. The packet sent
    contains information about the bind location including coordinates and zone ID
    which are used by the client for corpse resurrections.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'npc' parameter is not null before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also note
    that this function does not validate whether the NPC actually supports binding
    - it simply sends the packet regardless of NPC type.
