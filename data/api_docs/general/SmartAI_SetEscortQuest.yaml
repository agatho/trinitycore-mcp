  signature: void SmartAI::SetEscortQuest(uint32 questID)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the quest ID for the current escort AI to track and manage.
  description: The SetEscortQuest method assigns a specific quest ID to the SmartAI
    instance, enabling it to handle quest-related escort behaviors. This method is
    typically used in conjunction with escort quests where an NPC follows the player
    while completing objectives tied to a particular quest. The assigned quest ID
    allows the AI to properly manage quest state changes, track progress, and trigger
    appropriate actions based on the quest's status. This method does not validate
    whether the quest exists or is valid; it simply stores the provided quest ID for
    later use by the AI system.
  parameters:
  - name: questID
    description: The unique identifier of the quest that this escort AI should track
      and manage. Must be a valid quest ID from the game's database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest) override\n{\n  \
      \  if (quest->GetQuestId() == 12345)\n        me->GetAI()->SetEscortQuest(12345);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Escort Quest in Creature AI
    code: "class npc_escort_ai : public SmartAI\n{\npublic:\n    void OnQuestAccept(Player*\
      \ player, Quest const* quest) override\n    {\n        if (quest->GetQuestId()\
      \ == 54321)\n            SetEscortQuest(54321);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only stores the quest ID and does not automatically start or
    initialize the escort behavior. The actual escort logic must be implemented separately
    using other SmartAI methods such as StartEscort or similar quest tracking functions.
    Ensure that the quest ID provided is valid and exists in the database to avoid
    unexpected behavior during quest progression.
  warnings: Using an invalid or non-existent quest ID may lead to undefined behavior
    when the AI attempts to query quest state information. This method should not
    be called repeatedly with different quest IDs without proper cleanup or reinitialization
    of the escort state.
