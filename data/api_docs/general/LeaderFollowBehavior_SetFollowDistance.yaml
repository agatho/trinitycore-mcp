  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: SetFollowDistance
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::SetFollowDistance(float min, float max)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the minimum and maximum follow distances for a leader-follow behavior.
  description: The SetFollowDistance method configures the acceptable range of distances
    that a follower unit will maintain from its leader within the LeaderFollowBehavior
    AI system. This method defines the boundaries of how closely or distantly a creature
    or player can follow their designated leader during group movement. The minimum
    distance determines the closest the follower will approach the leader, while the
    maximum distance sets the furthest acceptable range before the follower begins
    to close in or move away. This functionality is crucial for AI-driven group mechanics
    such as escort quests, scripted encounters, or dynamic group formations where
    maintaining proper spacing is important for gameplay balance and visual presentation.
  parameters:
  - name: min
    description: The minimum distance (in yards) that the follower will maintain from
      the leader. Must be a non-negative value.
  - name: max
    description: The maximum distance (in yards) that the follower will maintain from
      the leader. Must be greater than or equal to the minimum distance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Standard Follow Distance
    code: leaderFollowBehavior->SetFollowDistance(2.0f, 10.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Tight Formation
    code: leaderFollowBehavior->SetFollowDistance(0.5f, 3.0f);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the AI's movement calculations and should be
    called before initiating any follow behavior to ensure proper initialization.
    The values are typically specified in yards as per World of Warcraft's unit measurement
    system.
  warnings: Setting the maximum distance less than the minimum distance will result
    in undefined behavior or potential errors within the AI system. Ensure that both
    parameters are valid positive floating-point numbers.
