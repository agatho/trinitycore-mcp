  class: ShamanAI
  method: HandleEarthquake
  signature: bool ShamanAI::HandleEarthquake()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the Earthquake spell cast for the Shaman AI.
  description: The HandleEarthquake method is responsible for executing the Earthquake
    spell ability within the Shaman AI logic. This method typically checks if the
    spell can be cast, performs necessary validations such as mana requirements and
    cooldowns, and then triggers the actual spell casting process. It integrates with
    the core TrinityCore AI framework to ensure proper behavior during combat scenarios
    where Earthquake is an available spell option for the shaman.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Earthquake spell was successfully initiated or queued
    for casting; returns false if the spell could not be cast due to invalid conditions
    such as insufficient mana, cooldowns, or target restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void ShamanAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (HandleEarthquake())\n\
      \    {\n        // Earthquake spell initiated\n        return;\n    }\n    //\
      \ Handle other AI behaviors\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Shaman's combat behavior logic and should only
    be called when the AI has determined that casting Earthquake is beneficial. The
    method does not directly handle spell effects, but rather manages the initiation
    and validation process.
  warnings: Ensure that the ShamanAI instance has a valid target before calling this
    method to avoid potential errors or unintended behavior. Also, verify that the
    spell is properly registered in the AI's spell list to prevent silent failures.
