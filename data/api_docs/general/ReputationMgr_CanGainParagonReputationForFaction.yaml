  signature: bool ReputationMgr::CanGainParagonReputationForFaction(const FactionEntry
    * factionEntry) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can gain paragon reputation for a specified faction.
  description: This method checks if the player associated with the ReputationMgr
    instance is eligible to earn paragon reputation for the given faction. Paragon
    reputation is a special type of reputation that unlocks unique rewards and cosmetic
    benefits once a faction reaches its maximum standing. The check typically considers
    whether the faction supports paragon reputation, if the player has met prerequisites
    such as having the faction unlocked, and if the player's current standing allows
    for further progression toward paragon status. This method does not modify any
    state but simply evaluates conditions for paragon gain.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player can gain paragon reputation for the specified
    faction; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check Paragon Eligibility
    code: "if (player->GetReputationMgr().CanGainParagonReputationForFaction(factionEntry))\
      \ {\n    // Player is eligible to gain paragon reputation for this faction\n\
      \    // Proceed with paragon logic or notify player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal faction flags and player reputation
    state. It may be called frequently during faction interactions, so performance
    should be considered in high-frequency contexts.
