documentation:
  brief: Handles pathfinding blockage events for enhanced bot AI behavior
  description: The OnPathBlocked method is invoked when an enhanced bot's current
    movement path becomes obstructed or invalid during navigation. This method typically
    triggers alternative pathfinding strategies, such as recalculating the route,
    attempting to find a detour, or switching to a different movement mode. It plays
    a crucial role in maintaining bot mobility and preventing AI lockups when environmental
    obstacles impede normal movement patterns. The method is part of the bot's reactive
    behavior system and may be called during active pathfinding operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot AI logic
    code: "void MyEnhancedBotAI::Update()\n{\n    if (m_bot->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGeneratorType()\
      \ == IDLE_MOTION_TYPE)\n    {\n        OnPathBlocked();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the bot's movement system when
    pathfinding fails. Developers should ensure that custom implementations do not
    cause infinite recursion or excessive CPU usage during path resolution attempts.
  warnings: Improper handling of this event may lead to bots becoming stuck in static
    positions or entering infinite loop states during movement updates. Avoid performing
    heavy operations within this method to prevent performance degradation.
