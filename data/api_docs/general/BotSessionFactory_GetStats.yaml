  class: BotSessionFactory
  method: GetStats
  signature: const FactoryStats & BotSessionFactory::GetStats() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current statistics of the bot factory session.
  description: The GetStats method returns a constant reference to the FactoryStats
    object that contains various metrics and information about the current state of
    the bot factory session. This includes data such as the number of bots created,
    active bots, memory usage, and other relevant performance indicators. The returned
    statistics are updated in real-time as bots are spawned or destroyed within the
    session. This method is typically used for monitoring, debugging, and performance
    analysis purposes within the TrinityCore framework's bot management system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a FactoryStats object containing current session
    statistics including bot counts, memory usage, and operational metrics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Bot Session
    code: 'BotSessionFactory* factory = BotSessionFactory::Instance();

      const FactoryStats& stats = factory->GetStats();

      std::cout << "Active bots: " << stats.activeBots << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Total created: " << stats.totalCreated << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned FactoryStats reference is valid only as long as the BotSessionFactory
    instance exists. The statistics are updated on-demand and may not reflect instantaneous
    values if accessed from multiple threads concurrently. This method does not modify
    any internal state of the factory session.
  warnings: Accessing the returned reference after the BotSessionFactory has been
    destroyed results in undefined behavior. When using this method in multithreaded
    environments, ensure proper synchronization to avoid reading inconsistent statistics
    during updates.
