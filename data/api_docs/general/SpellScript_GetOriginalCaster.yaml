  class: SpellScript
  method: GetOriginalCaster
  signature: Unit * SpellScript::GetOriginalCaster() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the original caster unit that initiated the spell, preserving the
    caster's identity through potential modifications or redirections.
  description: The GetOriginalCaster method retrieves the Unit object that originally
    cast the spell, regardless of any modifications or redirections that may have
    occurred during spell execution. This is particularly useful in scenarios where
    a spell might be redirected, reflected, or modified by effects such as Spell Reflection,
    Divine Shield, or other defensive mechanisms. The returned Unit pointer can be
    used to access properties and methods of the original caster, including their
    GUID, faction, health status, and more. It's important to note that this method
    returns the caster at the time the spell was initially cast, not necessarily the
    current caster if the spell has been redirected or modified by game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Unit object representing the original caster of the spell.
    Returns nullptr if no original caster is available or if the spell was not initiated
    by a Unit (e.g., environment-based spells).
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check original caster's faction
    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleEffectExecute()\
      \ override\n    {\n        Unit* originalCaster = GetOriginalCaster();\n   \
      \     if (originalCaster && originalCaster->IsPlayer())\n        {\n       \
      \     Player* player = originalCaster->ToPlayer();\n            if (player->GetFaction()\
      \ == FACTION_HORDE)\n            {\n                // Apply special effect\
      \ for Horde players\n            }\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using original caster to determine if spell was cast by a pet
    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleAfterHit()\
      \ override\n    {\n        Unit* originalCaster = GetOriginalCaster();\n   \
      \     if (originalCaster && originalCaster->IsPet())\n        {\n          \
      \  // Apply pet-specific logic\n            Pet* pet = originalCaster->ToPet();\n\
      \            if (pet->GetOwner() && pet->GetOwner()->IsPlayer())\n         \
      \   {\n                // Handle pet owner's player logic\n            }\n \
      \       }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in spell scripts to maintain the integrity
    of the original casting context. It's essential for implementing mechanics that
    depend on the true caster identity, such as aura applications, damage calculations,
    or conditional effects that should not be affected by spell redirections.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in combination with spell redirection
    effects like Spell Reflection or Mirror Image, as it will always return the original
    caster and not the current one. Ensure proper null checks since the original caster
    might not always be available depending on how the spell was triggered.
