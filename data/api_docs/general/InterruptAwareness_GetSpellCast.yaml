  class: InterruptAwareness
  method: GetSpellCast
  signature: const DetectedSpellCast * InterruptAwareness::GetSpellCast(int casterGuid,
    uint32 spellId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a detected spell cast instance by caster GUID and spell ID.
  description: The GetSpellCast method retrieves a const pointer to a DetectedSpellCast
    object that matches the specified caster GUID and spell ID. This method is typically
    used within the InterruptAwareness system to track or query ongoing spell casts
    by specific players for interrupt-related logic. The method performs a lookup
    in an internal data structure containing detected spell casts, returning a valid
    pointer if a match is found, or nullptr if no matching spell cast exists. It's
    important to note that this method does not modify any state and is intended for
    read-only access to spell cast information.
  parameters:
  - name: casterGuid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the caster whose spell cast
      is being queried.
  - name: spellId
    description: The numeric ID of the spell being cast, used to identify the specific
      spell in the detected spell cast list.
  returns: A const pointer to a DetectedSpellCast object if a matching spell cast
    is found; otherwise, returns nullptr if no such spell cast exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const DetectedSpellCast* spellCast = interruptAwareness.GetSpellCast(playerGuid,\
      \ 12345);\nif (spellCast != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process the detected spell cast\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Found spell cast: %u\", spellCast->GetSpellId());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Interrupt Check Example
    code: "const DetectedSpellCast* spellCast = interruptAwareness.GetSpellCast(targetGuid,\
      \ 98765);\nif (spellCast && spellCast->IsInterruptible())\n{\n    // Apply interrupt\
      \ logic\n    target->AddAura(12345, target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the internal data structures are properly maintained
    and thread-safe. It's recommended to use this method only when spell cast detection
    has already occurred and the spell cast is known to be active. The returned pointer
    should not be modified directly as it points to a const object.
  warnings: Do not assume the returned pointer will remain valid beyond the scope
    of the current function call unless explicitly managed by the caller. If multiple
    spell casts are possible for the same caster and spell ID, this method may return
    any one of them depending on internal implementation details.
