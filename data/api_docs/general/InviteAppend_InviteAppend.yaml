  class: InviteAppend
  method: InviteAppend
  signature: void InviteAppend::InviteAppend(const int & guid)
documentation:
  brief: Appends an invite to a player's invite list using the provided GUID.
  description: The InviteAppend method is used to add a new invitation to a player's
    pending invites within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically operates
    in the context of group or raid invitations, where a player's GUID is passed to
    associate the invite with that specific user. It is commonly invoked when a player
    sends an invitation to another player to join their group or raid instance. The
    method does not return any value and modifies internal invite tracking structures
    within the game server.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player being invited. This is
      typically a 32-bit integer representing the player's database ID in the World
      of Warcraft database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic InviteAppend Usage
    code: 'Player* inviter = ...; // Get reference to inviting player

      uint32 targetGuid = 12345;

      inviter->GetSession()->SendInviteToGroup(targetGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal group management system in TrinityCore.
    It should only be called when a valid player session exists and the inviting player
    has permission to send invitations. The GUID parameter must correspond to an existing
    player in the database.
  warnings: Incorrectly passing an invalid or non-existent GUID may lead to undefined
    behavior or failed invites. Ensure that the target player is online and the inviter
    has sufficient permissions before calling this method.
