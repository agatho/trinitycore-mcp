documentation:
  brief: Destroys the AchievementMgr instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the AchievementMgr class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated during the lifetime of the achievement manager.
    This includes cleaning up internal data structures, unregistering from game events,
    and ensuring no dangling pointers remain. The destructor is automatically invoked
    when an AchievementMgr object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures
    proper cleanup of player achievements, criteria tracking, and any cached achievement-related
    data to prevent memory leaks and maintain system stability.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of AchievementMgr
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    AchievementMgr* mgr = new AchievementMgr();\n\
      \    // ... use the manager ...\n    delete mgr; // Destructor called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor performs cleanup operations that are essential for preventing
    memory leaks in the TrinityCore server. It is important to ensure that all references
    to the AchievementMgr instance are properly released before deletion to avoid
    accessing freed memory.
