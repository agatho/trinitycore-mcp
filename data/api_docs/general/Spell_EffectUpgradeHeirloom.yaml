  brief: Upgrade a player's heirloom to the next level
  description: This method handles the process of upgrading a player's heirloom to
    the next available level. It typically occurs when a player uses an heirloom upgrade
    item or when certain game mechanics are triggered. The method performs validation
    checks and updates the heirloom's state in the player's inventory, ensuring that
    the upgrade is properly applied according to game rules. This function is part
    of the spell system and is called during spell execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->EffectUpgradeHeirloom();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called only when the player has a valid heirloom in
    their inventory and meets upgrade requirements. The implementation involves checking
    if the heirloom is already at maximum level, and if not, updating its state to
    reflect the next level.
  warnings: Improper handling of this function may lead to incorrect heirloom progression
    or invalid state updates. Care must be taken when calling this method in scenarios
    involving multiple players or during server-side operations.
