documentation:
  brief: Executes the currently active kiting pattern for the AI-controlled unit
  description: The ExecuteCurrentPattern method processes and applies the kiting behavior
    defined in the current kiting pattern. This method is typically invoked during
    AI update cycles to control movement and positioning of units that employ kiting
    tactics, such as ranged attackers maintaining optimal distance from targets. It
    evaluates the current state of the unit's target and environment to determine
    appropriate kiting maneuvers including retreat, advance, or lateral movement.
    The method assumes that a valid kiting pattern has been previously set and initialized
    within the KitingManager instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void ExampleCreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_kitingManager)\n\
      \        m_kitingManager->ExecuteCurrentPattern();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a kiting pattern is active and properly
    initialized. The method modifies the unit's movement state directly through the
    AI system, so it must be called from within an appropriate AI context. Performance-wise,
    this method typically executes quickly but may involve pathfinding calculations
    depending on the complexity of the kiting pattern.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring a valid kiting pattern is set can
    result in undefined behavior or movement anomalies. The method does not perform
    any safety checks for unit state (e.g., if the unit is dead or stunned), so external
    validation may be required before invocation.
