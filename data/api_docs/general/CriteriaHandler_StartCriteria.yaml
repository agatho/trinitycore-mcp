  signature: void CriteriaHandler::StartCriteria(int startEvent, uint32 entry, int
    timeLost)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a criteria event with specified parameters for tracking progress.
  description: The StartCriteria method begins tracking a specific criteria event
    within the TrinityCore framework. It takes an event identifier, entry value, and
    time loss parameter to initialize the tracking process. This method is typically
    used in conjunction with achievement systems and quest progression mechanics where
    certain conditions must be met over time or through specific actions. The method
    does not return any value but modifies internal state to reflect the start of
    a criteria tracking session.
  parameters:
  - name: startEvent
    description: Identifier for the type of criteria event being started. This value
      determines how the criteria will be tracked and what conditions must be met.
  - name: entry
    description: Unique identifier or index for the specific criteria entry being
      initiated. Used to distinguish between different criteria within the same event
      type.
  - name: timeLost
    description: Time value in seconds that represents how much time has been lost
      since the criteria was last active, used for time-based tracking calculations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Criteria Start Example
    code: 'CriteriaHandler handler;

      handler.StartCriteria(1001, 5001, 30);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Quest Progression Criteria Start
    code: 'CriteriaHandler* criteria = player->GetCriteriaHandler();

      criteria->StartCriteria(CRITERIA_EVENT_QUEST_COMPLETE, questId, 0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a player begins performing actions that
    contribute to achieving specific criteria. The implementation may involve updating
    internal timers, incrementing progress counters, or setting flags in the player's
    data structure. It's important to note that this method should only be called
    after proper validation of parameters to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method without valid parameters may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect tracking of criteria progress. Ensure that the startEvent parameter
    corresponds to a known event type within the TrinityCore system, and that entry
    values are properly validated against existing criteria definitions.
