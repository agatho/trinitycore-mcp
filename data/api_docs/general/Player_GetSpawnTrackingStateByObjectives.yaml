  method: GetSpawnTrackingStateByObjectives
  signature: SpawnTrackingState Player::GetSpawnTrackingStateByObjectives(uint32 spawnTrackingId,
    const int & questObjectives) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spawn tracking state for a player based on quest objectives
    and spawn tracking ID.
  description: This method determines the current spawn tracking state of a player
    for a specific spawn tracking identifier, taking into account the progress of
    quest objectives. It is used primarily in the context of tracking dynamic spawns
    such as NPCs or game objects that are tied to quest completion or objective fulfillment.
    The returned SpawnTrackingState indicates whether the tracked object has been
    spawned, despawned, or is in a pending state based on the player's current quest
    progress. This functionality supports the World of Warcraft TrinityCore framework's
    quest and spawn tracking systems.
  parameters:
  - name: spawnTrackingId
    description: Unique identifier for the spawn tracking entry. This ID corresponds
      to a specific tracked object or event in the game world, such as an NPC or game
      object that is tied to a quest.
  - name: questObjectives
    description: Reference to an integer representing the current progress of quest
      objectives. The value typically reflects how many objectives have been completed
      or are in progress for the associated quest.
  returns: 'Returns a SpawnTrackingState enum value indicating the current tracking
    state of the spawn. Possible values may include: SPAWN_TRACKING_STATE_NONE, SPAWN_TRACKING_STATE_SPAWNED,
    SPAWN_TRACKING_STATE_DESPAWNED, or SPAWN_TRACKING_STATE_PENDING, depending on
    whether the tracked object is active, inactive, or awaiting conditions to be met.'
  examples:
  - title: Check spawn tracking state for a quest objective
    code: "uint32 trackingId = 12345;\nint questProgress = player->GetQuestStatus(trackingId);\n\
      SpawnTrackingState state = player->GetSpawnTrackingStateByObjectives(trackingId,\
      \ questProgress);\nif (state == SPAWN_TRACKING_STATE_SPAWNED) {\n    // Object\
      \ is currently spawned\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking systems and may require that the
    player's quest data be properly initialized. The spawn tracking ID must correspond
    to a valid entry in the database or system configuration for accurate results.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided spawnTrackingId is valid and corresponds to an
    actual tracked object; otherwise, the result may be undefined or default to a
    non-expected state. This method should not be called during critical game loop
    operations without considering performance implications.
