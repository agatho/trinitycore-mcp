  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: ScheduleQuestTurnIn
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::ScheduleQuestTurnIn(Player * bot, uint32 questId, uint32
    delayMs)
documentation:
  brief: Schedules a quest turn-in for a bot player with a specified delay.
  description: The ScheduleQuestTurnIn method is used to queue a quest turn-in action
    for a specified bot player, allowing the turn-in to occur after a defined delay
    in milliseconds. This functionality is typically used in automated questing systems
    or AI-driven bots to simulate natural player behavior by introducing delays before
    completing quests. The method does not immediately complete the quest but schedules
    it for execution at a later time. It requires a valid player object and a valid
    quest ID, and the delay must be a positive integer value.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will turn
      in the quest. Must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest to be turned in. Must correspond to
      a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: delayMs
    description: Delay in milliseconds before the quest turn-in is executed. Must
      be a positive integer value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Turn-In Scheduling
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Get bot player

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      uint32 delayMs = 5000;

      QuestTurnIn::ScheduleQuestTurnIn(bot, questId, delayMs);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Scheduling Multiple Quest Turn-Ins with Different Delays
    code: 'Player* bot = ...;

      QuestTurnIn::ScheduleQuestTurnIn(bot, 1001, 2000);

      QuestTurnIn::ScheduleQuestTurnIn(bot, 1002, 4000);

      QuestTurnIn::ScheduleQuestTurnIn(bot, 1003, 6000);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal scheduling mechanisms to defer execution.
    The delay is handled asynchronously and does not block the calling thread. Ensure
    that the player object remains valid throughout the delay period.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'bot' or an invalid quest ID may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. The delay value should be carefully chosen to avoid excessive
    waiting times in automated systems.
