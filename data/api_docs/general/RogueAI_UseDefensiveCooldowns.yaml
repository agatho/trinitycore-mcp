  class: RogueAI
  method: UseDefensiveCooldowns
  signature: void RogueAI::UseDefensiveCooldowns()
documentation:
  brief: Uses defensive cooldowns available to the rogue AI during combat.
  description: The UseDefensiveCooldowns method evaluates and applies defensive abilities
    such as Evasion, Feint, or Cloak of Shadows when the rogue AI detects an imminent
    threat or high damage incoming. This method is typically invoked during combat
    updates to ensure optimal use of cooldowns based on current health status, enemy
    proximity, and tactical conditions. It integrates with the overall AI decision-making
    process to prioritize survival mechanics over offensive actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void RogueAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        UseDefensiveCooldowns();\n        // Other AI logic\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal AI state tracking and should only be called
    when the rogue is in combat. It assumes that cooldown timers are properly managed
    by the core engine and does not handle resetting or managing these timers directly.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat context as it may lead to improper
    ability usage or unexpected behavior. The method does not validate whether abilities
    are actually available for use, relying on the AI's internal logic for such checks.
