  method: CleanDamage
  signature: void CleanDamage::CleanDamage(uint32 mitigated, uint32 absorbed, int
    _attackType, MeleeHitOutcome _hitOutCome)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a CleanDamage object with mitigation, absorption, attack type,
    and hit outcome values.
  description: The CleanDamage constructor is used to set up damage information for
    a combat event in TrinityCore. It takes parameters representing the amount of
    damage mitigated, absorbed, the type of attack, and the outcome of the hit. This
    class is typically used within the combat system to track and process damage calculations,
    ensuring accurate reporting of damage dealt or received during player versus creature
    or player versus player encounters. The constructor prepares internal state for
    further processing by the combat engine.
  parameters:
  - name: mitigated
    description: The amount of damage that was mitigated (reduced) by defensive mechanisms
      such as armor, resistance, or mitigation effects.
  - name: absorbed
    description: The amount of damage that was absorbed by absorption effects like
      spell shields, damage reduction auras, or similar defensive abilities.
  - name: _attackType
    description: An integer representing the type of attack (e.g., melee, ranged,
      spell) which influences how damage is processed and reported.
  - name: _hitOutCome
    description: The outcome of the hit represented as a MeleeHitOutcome enum value
      indicating whether the hit was a hit, miss, dodge, parry, block, or critical
      strike.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic CleanDamage Initialization
    code: 'CleanDamage damage(100, 50, ATTACK_TYPE_MELEE, MELEE_HIT_CRIT);

      // Initializes a clean damage object with 100 mitigated damage,

      // 50 absorbed damage, melee attack type, and critical hit outcome.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This class is part of the combat system's internal handling of damage events.
    It's important to ensure that all parameters are properly validated before passing
    them to this constructor to avoid unexpected behavior in combat calculations.
