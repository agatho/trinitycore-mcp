  signature: void Player::SetSeasonalQuestStatus(uint32 quest_id)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the seasonal quest status for a player.
  description: This method updates the seasonal quest status for the specified player,
    allowing developers to control quest completion state and progression within seasonal
    content. The method modifies internal quest tracking data, enabling players to
    progress through seasonal content without requiring manual quest completion. It
    is particularly useful for managing seasonal quests in custom scripts or when
    implementing seasonal content mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: quest_id
    description: The unique identifier of the seasonal quest to set status for. This
      parameter must be a valid quest ID that exists within the game's seasonal quest
      system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting seasonal quest status
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetSeasonalQuestStatus(12345);

      // This sets the quest with ID 12345 as completed for the player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal quest tracking data and should be
    used carefully in custom scripts. It does not trigger any quest completion events
    or updates, so additional handling may be required to fully implement seasonal
    quest progression.
  warnings: Using this method without proper understanding of seasonal quest mechanics
    can lead to incorrect quest progression or game state issues. Ensure that the
    quest ID corresponds to an actual seasonal quest before calling this method.
