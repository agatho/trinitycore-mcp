documentation:
  brief: Sends quest objective criteria updates to the player's client
  description: The SendCriteriaUpdate method is responsible for transmitting updated
    progress information for quest objectives to the connected player's client. This
    method is typically invoked when a player's quest progress changes, such as when
    they complete a kill, collect an item, or achieve a specific objective. It handles
    the communication of criteria progress values and timing information to ensure
    the client displays accurate quest status. The method operates on a set of criteria
    entries and their corresponding progress values, updating the player's interface
    in real-time to reflect their current quest progress.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: Pointer to an array of criterion entry IDs that have been updated.
      These IDs correspond to specific quest objectives or criteria within the game's
      database.
  - name: progress
    description: Pointer to an array of progress values corresponding to each criterion
      entry. These values represent how much progress has been made toward completing
      each objective.
  - name: timeElapsed
    description: The time elapsed since the criteria update began, measured in milliseconds.
      This is used for timed quest objectives or when tracking completion times.
  - name: timedCompleted
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether a timed objective has been completed.
      When true, this signals to the client that the time-based criteria have reached
      their target.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int entries[] = {12345, 12346};

      int progresses[] = {5, 10};

      questObjectiveCriteriaMgr->SendCriteriaUpdate(entries, progresses, 30000, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Timed Objective Completion
    code: 'int entries[] = {12347};

      int progresses[] = {1};

      questObjectiveCriteriaMgr->SendCriteriaUpdate(entries, progresses, 60000, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest management system in TrinityCore
    and should only be called when actual progress changes occur. The method assumes
    that the provided arrays are properly aligned and contain valid data. It's important
    to note that this method sends data directly to the client, so performance considerations
    apply when updating large numbers of criteria simultaneously.
  warnings: Incorrectly passing null pointers for entry or progress parameters can
    lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Ensure that all criterion IDs referenced
    in the entries array are valid and exist within the game's database. Also, be
    cautious about calling this method too frequently as it may impact network performance
    if used excessively.
