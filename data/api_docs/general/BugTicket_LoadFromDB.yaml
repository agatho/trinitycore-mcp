  class: BugTicket
  method: LoadFromDB
  signature: void BugTicket::LoadFromDB(Field * fields)
documentation:
  brief: Loads bug ticket data from the database into the BugTicket object.
  description: The LoadFromDB method initializes a BugTicket object's member variables
    by extracting data from a database row represented by the Field array parameter.
    This method is typically invoked during the creation or retrieval of bug reports
    submitted by players within the World of Warcraft client. It populates internal
    fields such as ticket ID, player GUID, message content, and submission timestamp
    from the database record. The method assumes that the provided Field array contains
    valid data corresponding to the expected column structure of the bug_ticket table
    in the TrinityCore database.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Ticket Retrieval
    code: "BugTicket* ticket = new BugTicket();\nField* fields = sTicketMgr->GetTicketFields(ticketId);\n\
      if (fields)\n{\n    ticket->LoadFromDB(fields);\n    // Ticket is now populated\
      \ with data from DB\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after ensuring that the Field array contains
    valid data. It directly assigns values from database fields to internal member
    variables without additional validation or transformation, so it's crucial that
    the source data matches expected types and formats.
  warnings: Do not call LoadFromDB with an uninitialized or null Field pointer; doing
    so will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the database
    connection is active and the ticket ID exists before attempting to load.
