documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AdaptiveSpawnThrottler instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the AdaptiveSpawnThrottler class is responsible
    for cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the throttler.
    This method ensures that when an AdaptiveSpawnThrottler object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted, all internal data structures are properly deallocated
    to prevent memory leaks. The throttler may manage internal tracking of spawn rates,
    timing mechanisms, or other adaptive spawning parameters that need cleanup upon
    object destruction. In the context of TrinityCore's world management system, this
    destructor plays a role in maintaining efficient resource usage during dynamic
    spawn point adjustments and server runtime operations.

  - title: Basic Object Destruction
    code: 'AdaptiveSpawnThrottler* throttler = new AdaptiveSpawnThrottler();

      // ... use the throttler ...

      delete throttler; // Triggers ~AdaptiveSpawnThrottler()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope
    or is deleted. It should not be called manually unless explicitly needed for specific
    cleanup scenarios. The implementation likely handles internal resource deallocation
    such as memory pools, timers, or tracking structures used in adaptive spawn rate
    calculations.
