documentation:
  brief: Sends a text emote to a player or group of players
  description: The TextEmote method allows a player to send a text-based emote to
    another player or group of players within the game. It is used for displaying
    textual emotes such as 'Hello' or 'Goodbye' in the chat, and can be used for various
    game mechanics including quest completion, NPC interaction, or general communication.
    The method supports both single target and multiple target scenarios, with the
    ability to specify whether it's a boss emote or not. This functionality is essential
    for player-to-player communication and can be used in conjunction with other methods
    like Emote or TextEmote to enhance gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: textId
    description: The identifier of the text emote to send, typically referencing a
      specific emote or message from the game database
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an array of integers representing target player GUIDs,
      or nullptr if targeting all players in range
  - name: isBossEmote
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether this emote is a boss emote, which
      affects how it's displayed in the game world
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->TextEmote(12345, nullptr, false);

      // Sends a text emote with ID 12345 to all players in range'
    language: cpp
  - title: Targeted emote example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      int targetGUIDs[] = {1, 2, 3};

      player->TextEmote(54321, targetGUIDs, true);

      // Sends a boss emote with ID 54321 to specific players'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include that the method uses the game database to
    determine which text emote to display, and that it can be used in conjunction
    with other methods like Emote or TextEmote for more complex interactions. Performance
    considerations include that this method should not be used excessively as it may
    cause lag in the chat system if used improperly. Thread safety is not an issue
    since the method is typically called from within a player's own context.
  warnings: This method should not be used to send emotes to players outside of the
    game world or without proper validation of target GUIDs, as this could lead to
    invalid data or errors in the chat system. Common mistakes include using incorrect
    text emote IDs or failing to properly handle null pointers when targeting multiple
    players.
