  method: _HasRankRight
  signature: bool Guild::_HasRankRight(const Player * player, uint32 right) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has the specified guild rank right.
  description: The _HasRankRight method determines whether a given player possesses
    a specific guild permission right. This internal method is used by the Guild class
    to enforce access control based on player ranks within the guild structure. It
    evaluates the player's current rank and compares it against the required permission
    right, returning true if the player has sufficient privileges or false otherwise.
    The method relies on the player's rank information stored in the guild membership
    data.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose rank rights are being checked.
      Must not be null.
  - name: right
    description: The guild permission right identifier to check against the player's
      rank. This is typically a predefined constant representing specific guild permissions
      like RANK_RIGHT_GUILD_BANK_VIEW, RANK_RIGHT_GUILD_BANK_DEPOSIT, etc.
  returns: Returns true if the player has the specified guild rank right; otherwise
    returns false. A return value of false indicates either that the player does not
    have sufficient rank privileges or that the player is not a member of any guild.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check guild bank deposit rights
    code: "if (guild->_HasRankRight(player, RANK_RIGHT_GUILD_BANK_DEPOSIT)) {\n  \
      \  // Player can deposit items into guild bank\n    SendGuildBankDepositResult(player,\
      \ SUCCESS);\n} else {\n    // Player cannot deposit items\n    SendGuildBankDepositResult(player,\
      \ FAILED);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking multiple rank rights in sequence
    code: "bool canViewBank = guild->_HasRankRight(player, RANK_RIGHT_GUILD_BANK_VIEW);\n\
      bool canWithdraw = guild->_HasRankRight(player, RANK_RIGHT_GUILD_BANK_WITHDRAW);\n\
      bool canModify = guild->_HasRankRight(player, RANK_RIGHT_GUILD_BANK_MODIFY);\n\
      \nif (canViewBank && canWithdraw && canModify) {\n    // Player has full bank\
      \ access\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is an internal method and should not be called directly from outside
    the Guild class. The method assumes that the player object passed in is valid
    and properly initialized with guild membership data. Performance-wise, this method
    performs a simple lookup operation based on rank ID comparison.
  warnings: Ensure that the player parameter is not null before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. The right parameter should be a valid guild permission
    constant; invalid values may lead to unexpected results or crashes.
