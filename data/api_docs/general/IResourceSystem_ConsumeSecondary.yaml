  class: IResourceSystem
  method: ConsumeSecondary
  signature: void IResourceSystem::ConsumeSecondary(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified amount of secondary resource from the system.
  description: The ConsumeSecondary method reduces the available amount of a secondary
    resource within the IResourceSystem. This method is typically used in World of
    Warcraft TrinityCore to manage player resources such as mana, rage, energy, or
    focus. It directly modifies the internal state of the resource system by decrementing
    the current resource value by the specified amount. The method does not return
    any value and is intended for use during gameplay mechanics where resource consumption
    occurs, such as when casting spells or using abilities that require resource expenditure.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of secondary resource to consume. Must be a non-negative
      integer value representing the amount to deduct from the current resource pool.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Consuming Mana for a Spell
    code: player->GetResourceSystem()->ConsumeSecondary(50); // Deducts 50 mana points
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Resource Consumption
    code: "if (player->GetResourceSystem()->HasSufficientSecondary(100)) {\n    player->GetResourceSystem()->ConsumeSecondary(100);\n\
      \    // Proceed with spell casting\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that sufficient resources exist to be consumed. It does
    not perform bounds checking or validation of the resource amount before consumption.
    The implementation likely updates internal counters and may trigger resource change
    events or callbacks within the TrinityCore framework.
  warnings: Calling this method with an amount greater than the available secondary
    resource may lead to undefined behavior or negative resource values, depending
    on system implementation. Always verify sufficient resources before calling this
    method if resource safety is required.
