documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Fire Mage AI bot with the specified player character.
  description: The FireMageRefactored constructor initializes a Fire Mage AI bot by
    setting up the necessary attributes, spell configurations, and behavior patterns
    for the bot to function within the TrinityCore World of Warcraft emulation environment.
    This method prepares the bot for combat scenarios by configuring its spell selection,
    targeting logic, and tactical decision-making processes specific to the Fire Mage
    class. The initialization process includes setting up the bot's primary and secondary
    spells, managing cooldowns, and establishing the AI's overall fighting strategy
    based on the Fire Mage's elemental specialization.

  - title: Basic Fire Mage Bot Initialization
    code: 'Player* bot = new Player();

      FireMageRefactored fireMageBot(bot);

      // The bot is now initialized and ready for AI-controlled gameplay'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor assumes that the provided Player object has already been
    properly allocated and configured with basic player data. The Fire Mage AI implementation
    relies heavily on TrinityCore's spell system and AI framework, so proper initialization
    of these components is crucial for correct behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player parameter is valid and properly initialized before
    passing it to this constructor. Passing a null pointer or an improperly configured
    Player object will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes within the AI
    system.
