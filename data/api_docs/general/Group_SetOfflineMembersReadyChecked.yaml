  signature: void Group::SetOfflineMembersReadyChecked()
documentation:
  brief: Marks all offline members of the group as ready checked.
  description: The SetOfflineMembersReadyChecked method updates the ready check status
    for all offline members within the group. This function is typically used during
    group ready checks to ensure that all members, whether online or offline, have
    their ready check status properly set. It helps maintain synchronization of group
    readiness state across all players in the group, particularly useful during dungeon
    or raid encounters where player readiness is required. The method does not affect
    online members' ready check status and only processes those who are currently
    offline.

    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->SetOfflineMembersReadyChecked();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    group ready check operations. It's important to note that offline members are
    those who have logged out or disconnected from the game server, and this function
    ensures their ready check status is properly updated without affecting online
    players.
