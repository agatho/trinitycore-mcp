  class: WorldObject
  method: FindNearestGameObjectWithOptions
  signature: GameObject * WorldObject::FindNearestGameObjectWithOptions(float range,
    const FindGameObjectOptions & options) const
documentation:
  brief: Finds the nearest GameObject within range using specified options.
  description: This method searches for the closest GameObject to the current WorldObject
    within a given range, using the provided FindGameObjectOptions. It returns a pointer
    to the GameObject that matches the search criteria and is closest to the object's
    position. The method considers all GameObjects in the surrounding area and applies
    filtering based on the options provided. This functionality is commonly used for
    quest-related interactions or when determining which GameObject should be interacted
    with next.
  parameters:
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance within which to search for GameObjects, measured
      from the current WorldObject's position.
  - name: options
    description: A set of filtering options that determine how the GameObject search
      should be conducted, including specific flags and conditions.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the GameObject found closest within the specified
    range. If no GameObject is found matching the criteria, this method returns nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "GameObject* nearest = this->FindNearestGameObjectWithOptions(5.0f, FindGameObjectOptions());\n\
      if (nearest)\n{\n    // Do something with the found GameObject\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "FindGameObjectOptions options;\noptions.m_searchType = SEARCH_TYPE_NEAREST;\n\
      options.m_searchDistance = 10.0f;\nGameObject* nearest = this->FindNearestGameObjectWithOptions(10.0f,\
      \ options);\nif (nearest)\n{\n    // Handle the nearest GameObject found\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a search within the current map and may be affected
    by the object's position in the world. It is recommended to use this method during
    gameplay when accurate positioning is required, as it can impact performance if
    used excessively.
  warnings: This method does not guarantee that the GameObject returned will be interactable
    or valid for interaction; developers should verify the GameObject's state before
    using it in gameplay.
