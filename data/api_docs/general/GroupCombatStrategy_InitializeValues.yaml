documentation:
  brief: Initializes combat strategy values for group-based AI behavior in World of
    Warcraft.
  description: The InitializeValues method sets up default configuration and state
    variables required for the GroupCombatStrategy class to function properly within
    the TrinityCore AI framework. This method is typically called during object construction
    or when resetting the combat strategy state. It establishes initial parameters
    such as target selection criteria, positioning preferences, and tactical behaviors
    that define how a group of creatures or players will engage in combat. The initialization
    process ensures that all necessary data structures are properly allocated and
    configured before any combat decisions are made.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'GroupCombatStrategy strategy;

      strategy.InitializeValues();

      // Strategy is now ready for use in combat scenarios'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the object's lifecycle, typically
    at construction time or when explicitly resetting the strategy. It performs no
    dynamic allocation but may set up internal state that affects performance during
    active combat operations.
