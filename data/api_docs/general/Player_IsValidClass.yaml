documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the specified class is valid for player characters
  description: The IsValidClass method determines if a given class value is valid
    for use in character creation within the TrinityCore framework. This method validates
    that the class ID falls within the acceptable range of supported classes, typically
    corresponding to the 12 standard classes available in World of Warcraft. It serves
    as a validation mechanism for class selection during player initialization and
    character creation processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified class is valid, false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      uint8 class = CLASS_WARrior;

      bool isValid = player->IsValidClass(class);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal validation tables or constants to check
    against valid class IDs. Implementation may involve checking against predefined
    class enums or using a lookup table.
  warnings: This method should not be used for validating class IDs outside of character
    creation context, as it may not reflect actual game mechanics for class selection
    in gameplay.
