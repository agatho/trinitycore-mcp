  class: Creature
  method: SetHomePosition
  signature: void Creature::SetHomePosition(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the home position of a creature to define its spawn location and movement
    boundaries.
  description: This method establishes the home position for a creature, which determines
    where the creature will return after moving away from its initial spawn point.
    The home position is crucial for defining the creature's behavior in terms of
    movement and patrol patterns. It also affects how the creature interacts with
    its environment and whether it can be controlled by players or AI. This method
    typically should be called during creature initialization or when setting up the
    creature's spawn configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position coordinates that define where the creature should return
      to after moving away from its spawn location. This includes x, y, z coordinates
      and orientation values.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Home Position for a Creature
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetHomePosition({100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f, 45.0f});'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during creature initialization or when configuring
    spawn points for creatures. It should be called before the creature enters the
    world to ensure proper behavior and movement patterns.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may result in creatures not returning to their
    intended spawn location, leading to unexpected behavior or movement issues. Always
    ensure that the position coordinates are valid and match the expected coordinate
    system.
