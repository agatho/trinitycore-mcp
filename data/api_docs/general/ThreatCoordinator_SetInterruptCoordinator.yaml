  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: SetInterruptCoordinator
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::SetInterruptCoordinator(InterruptCoordinator
    * coordinator)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the interrupt coordinator for threat management within the AI system.
  description: The SetInterruptCoordinator method assigns an InterruptCoordinator
    object to the ThreatCoordinator, enabling it to manage and respond to interrupt
    events during combat. This coordination is essential for proper threat handling
    when abilities or spells are interrupted. The method typically gets called during
    initialization or configuration of AI behavior. It's important to note that this
    method does not validate whether the provided coordinator pointer is null, so
    callers should ensure a valid object is passed.
  parameters:
  - name: coordinator
    description: A pointer to an InterruptCoordinator instance that will be used for
      managing interrupt-related events in threat calculations. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator* tc = new ThreatCoordinator();

      InterruptCoordinator* ic = new InterruptCoordinator();

      tc->SetInterruptCoordinator(ic);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI System
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void Initialize() override\
      \ {\n        threatCoord.SetInterruptCoordinator(&interruptCoord);\n    }\n\
      private:\n    ThreatCoordinator threatCoord;\n    InterruptCoordinator interruptCoord;\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct assignment of the coordinator pointer without
    any reference counting or ownership transfer. The caller must ensure that the
    InterruptCoordinator object remains valid for as long as it's referenced by the
    ThreatCoordinator.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method may lead to undefined behavior.
    Always validate the input before calling this method, especially in dynamic AI
    systems where coordinators might be swapped or destroyed.
