  method: hasOverThresholdItem
  signature: bool Loot::hasOverThresholdItem() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the loot contains any item that exceeds the threshold value for
    loot distribution.
  description: The hasOverThresholdItem() method evaluates whether any item within
    the current loot object has a value that surpasses the predefined threshold for
    loot distribution in World of Warcraft. This is typically used during the loot
    rolling process to determine if special handling or notification is required for
    high-value items. The method iterates through all items in the loot and compares
    their individual values against the threshold, returning true as soon as one qualifying
    item is found. This check is crucial for maintaining game balance and ensuring
    that rare or valuable items are handled appropriately during group loot scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if at least one item in the loot has a value exceeding the
    threshold; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for high-value loot
    code: "Loot* loot = player->GetLoot();\nif (loot->hasOverThresholdItem()) {\n\
      \    // Handle special case for high-value items\n    sLog->outString(\"High-value\
      \ item detected in loot!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with loot distribution logic
    code: "void ProcessLoot(Loot* loot) {\n    if (loot->hasOverThresholdItem()) {\n\
      \        // Notify group members about high-value item\n        loot->NotifyGroupOnLoot();\n\
      \    }\n    // Continue with normal loot processing\n    loot->Distribute();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the loot distribution phase of a group
    loot scenario. The threshold value is usually defined by game rules or configuration
    settings and may vary between different loot modes (e.g., round-robin, free-for-all).
    The method performs a simple linear scan through all items in the loot object.
  warnings: The method does not distinguish between different types of items that
    might exceed the threshold; it simply checks if any item meets the criteria. Developers
    should be aware that this check may impact performance if called frequently on
    large loot objects, though this is generally negligible in typical gameplay scenarios.
