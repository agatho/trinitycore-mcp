  class: InterruptAwareness
  method: Update
  signature: SpellScanResult InterruptAwareness::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the interrupt awareness state based on elapsed time and spell scanning
    logic.
  description: The Update method in the InterruptAwareness class processes the internal
    state of spell interruption tracking. It evaluates whether any pending interrupts
    should be resolved or if new interruptions need to be considered based on the
    time delta provided. This method is typically called during game loop iterations
    to maintain up-to-date interrupt states for affected units. The method performs
    spell scanning and updates relevant internal flags or timers that determine when
    a spell can be interrupted by external factors such as damage, movement, or other
    actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a SpellScanResult enum indicating the outcome of the update operation.
    Possible values may include SUCCESS, FAILED, or PENDING depending on how the interruption
    logic was processed and whether any spells were successfully interrupted or require
    further evaluation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    interruptAwareness.Update(diff);\n\
      \    // Other update logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called regularly within the game's main loop
    with accurate timing information. It relies on internal state management and should
    not be invoked concurrently from multiple threads without proper synchronization.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the intended game update cycle as it
    may cause inconsistent spell interruption behavior or race conditions. Ensure
    that the diff parameter accurately reflects the time elapsed since last call.
