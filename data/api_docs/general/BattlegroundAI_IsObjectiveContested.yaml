documentation:
  brief: Checks if a battleground objective is currently contested by opposing forces.
  description: The IsObjectiveContested method determines whether a specific battleground
    objective is under contestation, meaning that players from both teams are actively
    competing for control of the objective. This method is typically used within the
    battleground AI system to make decisions about objective capture, scoring, and
    game state updates. The contested status usually indicates that neither team has
    full control and that the objective may be in transition between control states.
    This check is essential for proper battleground mechanics such as flag captures
    in Warsong Gulch or controlling nodes in Arathi Basin.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the objective is currently contested by opposing forces,
    indicating active competition for control. Returns false if the objective is either
    under sole control of one team or not currently contested.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Objective is Contested Before Capturing
    code: "if (bgAI->IsObjectiveContested(*objective))\n{\n    // Handle contested\
      \ objective logic\n    // e.g., update UI, play sound effects, or modify scoring\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Proceed with normal capture logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely queries internal battleground state tracking to determine
    contestation status. It may be called frequently during battleground updates,
    so performance is important. The method assumes that the objective parameter refers
    to a valid battleground objective instance within the current battleground context.
  warnings: Ensure that the BGObjective reference passed to this method is valid and
    belongs to the current battleground instance. Using an invalid or stale objective
    reference could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect contestation status determination.
