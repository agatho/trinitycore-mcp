  signature: int32 Quest::GetExclusiveGroup() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the exclusive group identifier for the quest
  description: The GetExclusiveGroup method retrieves the unique identifier that defines
    the exclusive group to which this quest belongs. This identifier is used to determine
    whether a quest is part of an exclusive group, meaning only one quest from that
    group can be active at a time. The method returns an integer value representing
    the exclusive group ID, or -1 if no exclusive group is defined. This functionality
    is crucial for managing quest progression and ensuring proper quest exclusivity
    in World of Warcraft's quest system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the exclusive group ID. A value of -1 indicates
    that the quest does not belong to any exclusive group, while positive values indicate
    the group identifier. Negative values may also be used to denote special cases
    or invalid group identifiers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int32 exclusiveGroup = quest->GetExclusiveGroup();\nif (exclusiveGroup\
      \ != -1)\n{\n    // Quest belongs to an exclusive group\n    // Handle accordingly\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to manage quest exclusivity. The returned value should be compared against known
    exclusive group IDs to determine if a quest can be accepted or completed.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method, as incorrect handling of exclusive
    groups can lead to quest progression issues or conflicts with other quests in
    the same group.
