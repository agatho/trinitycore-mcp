  method: IsExpired
  signature: bool SocialEvent::IsExpired() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a social event has expired based on its expiration time.
  description: The IsExpired method checks if the current time has surpassed the expiration
    time of the social event. This method is typically used to manage event lifecycles,
    ensuring that events are properly cleaned up or marked as inactive once their
    designated duration has elapsed. The check is performed using the internal timestamp
    stored within the SocialEvent object. If the event's expiration time is in the
    past relative to the current system time, this method returns true; otherwise,
    it returns false. This functionality is essential for maintaining accurate event
    state in the game world and preventing stale or outdated events from being processed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the social event's expiration time has passed; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Event Status
    code: "SocialEvent* event = player->GetSocialEvent();\nif (event && event->IsExpired())\
      \ {\n    // Handle expired event\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"social\", \"Event {} has expired.\"\
      , event->GetId());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsExpired in Event Management Loop
    code: "void UpdateSocialEvents() {\n    for (auto it = socialEvents.begin(); it\
      \ != socialEvents.end();) {\n        if (it->second->IsExpired()) {\n      \
      \      LOG_DEBUG(\"social\", \"Cleaning up expired event {}\");\n          \
      \  it = socialEvents.erase(it);\n        } else {\n            ++it;\n     \
      \   }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the system's current time to determine expiration.
    It is recommended to use this method in conjunction with proper synchronization
    mechanisms if used in multithreaded contexts. The internal timestamp should be
    set correctly when the event is initialized or modified.
  warnings: Do not assume that an event is valid just because IsExpired() returns
    false. Always verify that the event object itself is valid before calling this
    method to prevent potential null pointer dereferences.
