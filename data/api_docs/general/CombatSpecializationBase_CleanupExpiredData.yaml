  brief: Removes expired combat specialization data from the system
  description: The CleanupExpiredData method is responsible for removing outdated
    or expired combat specialization entries from the internal data structures. This
    method ensures that stale data does not persist in memory, which could otherwise
    lead to performance degradation or incorrect behavior in combat-related systems.
    It typically iterates through stored specialization data and removes entries that
    have exceeded their valid time window or have been marked as inactive. The cleanup
    process is essential for maintaining system efficiency and preventing memory leaks
    in long-running combat scenarios.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CombatSpecializationBase* specBase = new CombatSpecializationBase();

      specBase->CleanupExpiredData();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called periodically by the game's main loop or during
    combat state transitions to ensure data integrity. It may be optimized to only
    run when a certain threshold of expired data exists to avoid unnecessary overhead.
