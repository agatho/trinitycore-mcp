  class: LevelBracket
  method: GetTargetCount
  signature: uint32 LevelBracket::GetTargetCount(uint32 totalBots) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the number of valid targets based on the specified
    total bot count for a level bracket.
  description: The GetTargetCount method determines how many targets are available
    or applicable within a specific level bracket, using the provided total bot count
    as input. This function is typically used in game mechanics involving player vs.
    bot encounters, where target selection or distribution needs to be calculated
    based on predefined rules and level constraints. The method likely adjusts the
    target count according to game balance parameters, ensuring that the number of
    bots or targets remains within acceptable ranges for gameplay fairness and difficulty
    scaling. It may also consider factors such as player level ranges, group sizes,
    or arena configurations when computing the result.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the calculated number of valid targets.
    The exact meaning depends on context but generally indicates how many opponents
    or entities are considered for a given level bracket and bot configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 targetCount = levelBracket.GetTargetCount(10);

      // Returns the number of valid targets when there are 10 total bots.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger matchmaking or encounter system. Developers
    should ensure that the input totalBots value does not exceed internal limits or
    cause overflow issues during calculations. The behavior may vary depending on
    the specific level bracket configuration and game mode settings.
