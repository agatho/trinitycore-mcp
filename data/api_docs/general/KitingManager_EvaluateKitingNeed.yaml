  class: KitingManager
  method: EvaluateKitingNeed
  signature: KitingResult KitingManager::EvaluateKitingNeed(const KitingContext &
    context)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether the current unit needs to engage in kiting behavior based
    on its combat context.
  description: The EvaluateKitingNeed method determines if a unit should initiate
    or continue kiting mechanics during combat. It analyzes various factors such as
    distance from target, health status, threat level, and available abilities to
    decide whether kiting is necessary for survival or optimal damage output. This
    method is typically invoked by AI systems to make tactical decisions about movement
    patterns in combat scenarios. The result indicates whether kiting should be initiated,
    continued, or stopped based on the current game state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A KitingResult enum value indicating the evaluation outcome. Possible values
    include KITING_START, KITING_CONTINUE, KITING_STOP, or KITING_NONE depending on
    whether kiting behavior should be initiated, maintained, halted, or is not required
    at this time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "KitingResult result = kitingManager.EvaluateKitingNeed(context);\nif (result\
      \ == KITING_START)\n{\n    // Initiate kiting behavior\n    unit->SetUnitFlag(UNIT_FLAG_KITING);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies heavily on the provided KitingContext which must contain
    up-to-date information about the unit's current state, target position, health,
    and combat metrics. The evaluation logic may vary depending on the specific implementation
    of the KitingManager class and could be influenced by difficulty settings or AI
    configuration parameters.
  warnings: Ensure that the KitingContext passed to this method is properly updated
    before calling EvaluateKitingNeed, as stale data can lead to incorrect kiting
    decisions. Improper handling of the returned KitingResult may cause units to either
    fail to kite when needed or kite unnecessarily, affecting gameplay balance.
