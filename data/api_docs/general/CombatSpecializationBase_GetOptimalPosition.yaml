  method: GetOptimalPosition
  signature: int CombatSpecializationBase::GetOptimalPosition(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal positioning value for combat specialization
    based on target unit properties.
  description: The GetOptimalPosition method determines the most advantageous position
    for a unit to engage in combat, taking into account various factors such as target
    distance, threat level, and combat specialization rules. This method is typically
    used by AI-controlled units to make tactical decisions about positioning during
    combat encounters. The returned integer value represents a normalized positioning
    score that can be used to evaluate different potential positions or to determine
    if a unit should reposition itself. The method considers the current state of
    both the unit and its target, including health percentages, movement status, and
    any applicable combat mechanics specific to the specialization being used.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the optimal positioning score for
    combat engagement. Higher values typically indicate more favorable positioning,
    while lower values may suggest the unit should adjust its position or consider
    alternative tactics. A return value of zero or negative values may indicate that
    no optimal position exists under current conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "int optimalPos = player->GetCombatSpecialization()->GetOptimalPosition(targetUnit);\n\
      if (optimalPos > 50) {\n    // Proceed with attack\n    player->Attack(targetUnit,\
      \ true);\n} else {\n    // Move to better position\n    player->MoveTo(targetUnit->GetPositionX(),\
      \ targetUnit->GetPositionY(), targetUnit->GetPositionZ());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for use within AI decision-making systems
    and may require the unit to be in combat state to return meaningful values. The
    exact algorithm used to calculate positioning scores can vary based on the specific
    combat specialization type and may be influenced by server configuration settings.
  warnings: Calling this method on a unit that is not currently engaged in combat
    may return unreliable results. Additionally, the returned value should not be
    interpreted as an absolute position coordinate but rather as a relative score
    for tactical positioning decisions.
