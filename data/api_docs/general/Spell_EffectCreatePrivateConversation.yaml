documentation:
  brief: Creates a private conversation between the caster and target player.
  description: The EffectCreatePrivateConversation method is responsible for establishing
    a private conversation channel between the spell's caster and its target player.
    This functionality is typically used in spells that enable whispered communication
    or private messaging between players. The method handles the creation of the conversation
    context, sets up appropriate permissions, and ensures that only the involved parties
    can participate in the dialogue. It is commonly associated with social interaction
    spells and may involve checking for existing conversations, managing conversation
    timeouts, and updating player state information.

    code: "void Spell::EffectCreatePrivateConversation()\n{\n    if (!GetCaster()\
      \ || !GetUnitTarget())\n        return;\n\n    // Create private conversation\
      \ between caster and target\n    GetCaster()->SendPrivateMessage(GetUnitTarget(),\
      \ \"Hello, this is a private message.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's conversation manager system
    and may require proper spell targeting. The implementation should handle edge
    cases such as when either the caster or target is not a valid player object, or
    when a conversation already exists between these players.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell target is a valid player object before calling this
    method to prevent runtime errors. This method may not be suitable for use with
    non-player targets and could potentially cause issues if called without proper
    validation.
