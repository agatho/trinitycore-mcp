documentation:
  brief: Logs a performance report detailing bot lifecycle management metrics and
    statistics.
  description: The PrintPerformanceReport method outputs diagnostic information about
    the performance and behavior of bot lifecycle operations within the TrinityCore
    environment. This includes data such as creation rates, memory usage, processing
    times, and operational efficiency of bots managed by the BotLifecycleManager.
    The method is typically invoked for debugging or monitoring purposes to assess
    how well the bot system performs under various conditions. It does not require
    any specific preconditions but should be called when performance metrics are needed
    for analysis.

  notes: This method is intended for development and debugging purposes. It may produce
    verbose output depending on the internal logging configuration and should not
    be called frequently in production environments due to potential performance overhead.
