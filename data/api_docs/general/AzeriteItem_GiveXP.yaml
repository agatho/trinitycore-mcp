documentation:
  brief: Grants experience points to the Azerite item, increasing its power level.
  description: The GiveXP method is used to add experience points to an Azerite item,
    which in turn increases the item's level and unlocks new abilities or enhancements.
    This method is typically invoked when the player gains experience through gameplay
    activities such as completing dungeons, raids, or other content that rewards Azerite
    items with experience. The method does not return any value and directly modifies
    the internal state of the AzeriteItem object. It is part of the Azerite system
    mechanics in World of Warcraft, where items can be upgraded using Azerite power
    gained from various sources.
  parameters:
  - name: xp
    description: The amount of experience points to grant to the Azerite item. Must
      be a non-negative integer value representing the experience gain.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AzeriteItem* item = player->GetAzeriteItem();

      item->GiveXP(100); // Grants 100 XP to the Azerite item'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Experience Grant
    code: "if (player->IsInRaid()) {\n    AzeriteItem* item = player->GetAzeriteItem();\n\
      \    item->GiveXP(500); // Higher XP for raid content\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal Azerite item state and should
    only be called when appropriate game events occur. It is recommended to validate
    that the item is actually an Azerite item before calling this method to prevent
    unintended behavior.
  warnings: Calling GiveXP with a negative value may result in undefined behavior
    or corruption of the Azerite item's experience tracking. Always ensure XP values
    are positive integers.
