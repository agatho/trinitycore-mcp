documentation:
  brief: Compares two WorldObject pointers to determine their relative ordering based
    on distance.
  description: The ObjectDistanceOrderPred::operator() method is a comparison functor
    used to sort WorldObject pointers based on their distance from a reference point,
    typically the object that owns or uses this predicate. It is commonly employed
    in sorting systems where objects need to be ordered by proximity, such as in target
    selection for spells or AI behavior. The method returns true if the 'left' object
    is closer than the 'right' object, and false otherwise. This comparison is essential
    for maintaining consistent ordering during operations like finding the nearest
    enemy or sorting items in a container by distance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the left WorldObject is closer to the reference point than
    the right WorldObject; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Sorting objects by distance
    code: 'std::vector<WorldObject*> objects;

      // ... populate objects vector ...

      WorldObject* reference = player;

      objects.sort(ObjectDistanceOrderPred(reference));'
    language: cpp
  notes: This functor typically relies on internal distance calculations using the
    WorldObject's position data. It is designed to be used with standard STL algorithms
    like std::sort or std::stable_sort. Performance depends on the number of objects
    being sorted and how efficiently distance is calculated for each object.
