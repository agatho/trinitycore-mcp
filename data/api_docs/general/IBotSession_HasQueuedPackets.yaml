  class: IBotSession
  method: HasQueuedPackets
  signature: bool IBotSession::HasQueuedPackets() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot session has any queued packets waiting to be processed.
  description: The HasQueuedPackets method determines if there are any pending network
    packets in the bot's outgoing queue. This is typically used to check if the session
    is ready to send data or if there are buffered messages that need to be flushed.
    The method returns true when packets exist in the queue and false otherwise. In
    the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this can be important for managing network
    I/O efficiency and ensuring proper message delivery order.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if there are queued packets waiting to be sent, false if the
    packet queue is empty.
  examples:
  - title: Basic packet queue check
    code: "if (botSession->HasQueuedPackets()) {\n    // Process or flush queued packets\n\
      \    botSession->SendQueuedPackets();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Network flow control
    code: "while (botSession->HasQueuedPackets()) {\n    // Ensure all queued packets\
      \ are sent before proceeding\n    botSession->ProcessOutgoingPackets();\n  \
      \  std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(10));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with packet queuing and network
    sending logic. It's important to note that checking this flag does not guarantee
    immediate availability of network resources, as the actual transmission may still
    be pending. The implementation likely uses atomic operations or thread-safe data
    structures for queue state management.
  warnings: Calling this method repeatedly in tight loops without proper delay can
    cause unnecessary CPU overhead. Additionally, relying solely on this check without
    considering other session states (like connection status) may lead to incorrect
    assumptions about the session's readiness to send data.
