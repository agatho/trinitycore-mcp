  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadTavernAreaTriggers()
documentation:
  brief: Loads tavern area triggers from the database into memory for use in World
    of Warcraft game mechanics.
  description: The LoadTavernAreaTriggers method initializes and populates internal
    data structures with tavern area trigger information retrieved from the database.
    These triggers define specific zones in the game world where players can interact
    with tavern keepers, access innkeeper services, or trigger special events related
    to resting and teleportation. The method typically executes during server startup
    or reload operations to ensure that all tavern-related area triggers are properly
    registered and functional. It reads data from the 'areatrigger_tavern' table in
    the database and constructs corresponding internal trigger objects that are used
    by the game engine to detect player presence within these areas.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeServer()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n    sObjectMgr->LoadTavernAreaTriggers();\n\
      \    // Continue with other initialization steps\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or database reload
    operations. It's important to ensure that the database tables containing tavern
    area trigger data are properly populated before calling this method. The method
    performs no error handling for missing or malformed data, so database integrity
    should be maintained.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate entries or memory leaks. This method modifies internal game state and
    should not be called during active gameplay sessions where players might be interacting
    with tavern areas.
