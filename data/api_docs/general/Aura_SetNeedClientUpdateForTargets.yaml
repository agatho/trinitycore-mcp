documentation:
  brief: Sets the aura to require client update for targets.
  description: This method marks an aura as needing client update for target information,
    ensuring that the client will receive updates about the aura's effects on targets.
    It is typically used in scenarios where the aura's target information needs to
    be synchronized with the client, such as when applying or removing auras from
    players or creatures. The method does not return any value and is used primarily
    for internal game mechanics synchronization.

    code: 'Aura* aura = new Aura();

      aura->SetNeedClientUpdateForTargets();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal aura management system and should be
    used carefully in conjunction with other methods that handle aura updates. It
    may affect performance if called frequently without proper synchronization.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to client desynchronization or incorrect
    aura display on the client side, potentially causing gameplay issues.
