documentation:
  brief: Applies diminishing returns to a specified rating value
  description: This method applies diminishing returns to a given rating value, typically
    used in World of Warcraft combat calculations. It modifies the input value based
    on the current player's rating and the applied diminishing return factors. The
    method is commonly used in calculating damage or healing bonuses where diminishing
    returns play a role in reducing the effectiveness of additional rating beyond
    certain thresholds.
  parameters:
  - name: cr
    description: The rating value to apply diminishing returns to, typically representing
      a specific type of rating such as critical strike or haste
  - name: bonusValue
    description: The bonus value to be applied to the rating, which may represent
      additional rating or a modifier that affects the diminishing return calculation
  returns: Returns the modified rating value after applying diminishing returns, representing
    the effective rating after reduction due to diminishing return mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'float finalRating = player->ApplyRatingDiminishing(1000, 50.0f);

      // This would apply diminishing returns to a 1000 rating value with a 50.0 bonus'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'float finalRating = player->ApplyRatingDiminishing(2000, 100.0f);

      // This applies diminishing returns to a 2000 rating value with a 100.0 bonus

      // The result would be less than the original value due to diminishing return
      mechanics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal player state and game mechanics to determine
    the appropriate diminishing return factor based on current rating levels and player
    class. It may involve complex calculations involving multiple factors such as
    level, class-specific modifiers, and game balance parameters.
  warnings: The method may produce unexpected results if used incorrectly or with
    invalid values, particularly when dealing with negative values or non-standard
    rating types. Care should be taken to ensure that the input values are valid before
    calling this method.
