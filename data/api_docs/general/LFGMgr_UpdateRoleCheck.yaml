  method: UpdateRoleCheck
  signature: void LFGMgr::UpdateRoleCheck(int gguid, int guid, uint8 roles)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the role check status for a player in a Looking For Group (LFG) instance.
  description: The UpdateRoleCheck method is responsible for updating the role assignment
    status of a specific player within a Looking For Group (LFG) scenario. This method
    is typically invoked when a player selects or changes their role during the LFG
    role check process, which occurs before joining a group for dungeons or other
    group content. It updates internal tracking structures to reflect the new role
    assignment and may trigger subsequent actions such as notifying other group members
    or adjusting the group's composition based on role requirements. The method operates
    within the LFG manager system and is part of TrinityCore's group finding and management
    infrastructure.
  parameters:
  - name: gguid
    description: The global group identifier (GUID) of the LFG group that the player
      belongs to. This identifies which specific group's role check status should
      be updated.
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose role check status
      is being updated. This identifies the specific player within the group.
  - name: roles
    description: A bitmask representing the roles assigned to the player. Each bit
      corresponds to a specific role such as tank, healer, or damage dealer, and can
      be combined to indicate multiple roles.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Player Role in LFG Group
    code: 'LFGMgr* lfgMgr = sLFGMgr;

      uint64 groupId = 123456;

      uint64 playerId = 789012;

      uint8 playerRoles = LFG_ROLE_TANK | LFG_ROLE_HEALER;

      lfgMgr->UpdateRoleCheck(groupId, playerId, playerRoles);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the LFG system when a player
    makes a role selection during the role check phase. Developers should ensure that
    the provided GUIDs are valid and correspond to existing players and groups within
    the LFG framework. The roles parameter must be a valid bitmask representing one
    or more supported roles.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the roles bitmask can lead to improper group composition
    or failure to meet dungeon requirements. Ensure that all role assignments conform
    to the valid role definitions used by TrinityCore's LFG system.
