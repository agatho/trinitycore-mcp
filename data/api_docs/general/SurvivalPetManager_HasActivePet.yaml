  signature: bool SurvivalPetManager::HasActivePet() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player has an active survival pet summoned.
  description: The HasActivePet method determines if a player currently has a survival
    pet (such as a hunter's pet or a warlock's imp) actively summoned and under their
    control. This check is commonly used in game logic to prevent actions that would
    conflict with an active pet, such as attempting to summon another pet or performing
    certain abilities that require the player to be pet-free. The method evaluates
    the internal state of the SurvivalPetManager to return a boolean result indicating
    the presence of an active pet.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has an active survival pet summoned and under
    their control; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (player->GetSurvivalPetManager()->HasActivePet()) {\n    // Player has\
      \ an active pet\n    // Prevent summoning another pet\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ability Use
    code: "if (!player->GetSurvivalPetManager()->HasActivePet()) {\n    // Allow player\
      \ to cast a spell that requires no pet\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_SUMMON_PET,\
      \ true);\n} else {\n    // Notify player they cannot summon another pet\n  \
      \  player->SendSystemMessage(\"You already have a pet summoned.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state tracking of the SurvivalPetManager,
    which is updated when pets are summoned or dismissed. It does not account for
    temporary pet states such as those caused by spells or effects that might temporarily
    disable a pet.
  warnings: Do not use this method to determine if a player can summon a pet without
    also checking for other conditions like cooldowns or resource requirements. Also,
    be aware that pets may become inactive due to environmental factors (e.g., combat
    state changes) which this method does not reflect directly.
