documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the pet creature name object, resetting its modification
    state.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with a PetCreatureName object. This operation typically indicates that any previously
    tracked modifications to the pet's creature name have been acknowledged or committed.
    In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this method is commonly
    used when synchronizing state between the server and client, ensuring that change
    tracking is properly reset after updates have been processed. The method does
    not take any parameters and performs no return operations, making it a simple
    state-resetting utility.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PetCreatureName petName;

      petName.ClearChangesMask();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during state synchronization processes where
    it's necessary to reset the change tracking mechanism. It should be called after
    applying or acknowledging changes to avoid redundant processing.
