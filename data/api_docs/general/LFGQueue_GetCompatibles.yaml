  signature: LfgCompatibility LFGQueue::GetCompatibles(const std::string & key)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the compatibility information for a specific LFG queue key
  description: The GetCompatibles method retrieves compatibility data associated with
    a given LFG (Looking for Group) queue key. This compatibility information typically
    includes details about which player roles, classes, or group compositions are
    compatible with the current queue state. The method is used internally by the
    TrinityCore LFG system to determine whether players can be matched together based
    on their group composition and requirements. It helps maintain proper grouping
    mechanics in World of Warcraft's LFG system by ensuring that players with incompatible
    specs, roles, or group configurations are not paired together.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an LfgCompatibility object containing the compatibility information
    for the specified queue key. This object typically includes data about allowed
    player roles, class restrictions, and group composition rules that define which
    players can be matched together in the LFG system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check LFG compatibility
    code: "LfgCompatibility compat = lfgQueue->GetCompatibles(\"dungeon_123\");\n\
      if (compat.IsCompatible()) {\n    // Player can join the group\n    printf(\"\
      Player is compatible with this LFG queue\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Player cannot\
      \ join due to compatibility issues\n    printf(\"Player is not compatible with\
      \ this LFG queue\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal LFG queue management system and should
    only be called from within the LFG subsystem. The returned LfgCompatibility object
    may contain cached data that gets updated periodically based on server conditions
    and player availability.
