  class: SpellScript
  method: GetHitCorpse
  signature: Corpse * SpellScript::GetHitCorpse() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the corpse that was hit by the spell.
  description: The GetHitCorpse method retrieves a pointer to the Corpse object that
    was affected by the spell during execution. This method is typically used within
    SpellScript implementations to access information about the target corpse, such
    as its GUID, owner, or death time. The returned pointer may be null if no corpse
    was hit or if the spell did not result in a corpse being created. It's important
    to note that the returned Corpse object is valid only during the execution of
    the spell script and should not be stored for later use.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Corpse object that was hit by the spell, or nullptr if
    no corpse was affected or the spell did not create a corpse.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in SpellScript
    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleHit()\n\
      \    {\n        Corpse* corpse = GetHitCorpse();\n        if (corpse)\n    \
      \    {\n            // Access corpse data\n            uint64 ownerGuid = corpse->GetOwnerGUID();\n\
      \            time_t deathTime = corpse->GetDeathTime();\n            // Process\
      \ the corpse information\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method should only be called during the execution of a spell script.
    The returned Corpse pointer is managed by the game engine and should not be deleted
    or modified directly. If the spell does not result in a corpse (e.g., if the target
    was not killed), this method will return nullptr.
  warnings: Do not store the returned Corpse pointer for later use as it may become
    invalid after the spell execution completes. Always check for null before using
    the returned pointer to avoid dereferencing a null pointer.
