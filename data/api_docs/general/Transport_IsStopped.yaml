  signature: bool Transport::IsStopped() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the transport vehicle is currently stopped or moving.
  description: The IsStopped method determines if a transport vehicle (such as a boat,
    zeppelin, or elevator) is currently halted in place. This method is commonly used
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to manage transport behavior, particularly
    for determining when players can safely disembark from moving transports or when
    to trigger specific events based on the transport's movement state. The method
    evaluates internal transport state flags and returns true if the transport is
    stationary, false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for maintaining game
    mechanics such as preventing player movement during transport transitions and
    ensuring proper interaction with transport-related GameObjects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the transport vehicle is currently stopped (not moving),
    false if it is in motion.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Transport State
    code: "if (transport->IsStopped()) {\n    // Allow players to disembark\n    player->TeleportTo(mapId,\
      \ x, y, z, orientation);\n} else {\n    // Notify player transport is moving\n\
      \    player->SendNotification(\"Transport is currently moving.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsStopped in Transport Update Logic
    code: "void Transport::Update(uint32 diff) {\n    if (IsStopped()) {\n       \
      \ // Perform stop-related actions\n        HandleTransportStop();\n    } else\
      \ {\n        // Continue normal movement\n        MoveTransport(diff);\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal transport state tracking and should be called
    from within the transport's update loop or event handlers. The implementation
    typically checks for movement flags, velocity values, and other transport-specific
    properties to determine if it is stationary.
  warnings: Do not use IsStopped() in performance-critical sections without considering
    that it may involve multiple internal state checks. Also, be aware that a transport
    might be considered stopped even if it's not fully at rest due to minor movement
    or animation states.
