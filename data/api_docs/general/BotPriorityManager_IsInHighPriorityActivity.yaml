  method: IsInHighPriorityActivity
  signature: bool BotPriorityManager::IsInHighPriorityActivity(Player * bot) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot is currently engaged in a high-priority activity.
  description: The IsInHighPriorityActivity method checks if a specified bot player
    is currently involved in an activity that has been classified as high priority
    within the TrinityCore AI system. This typically includes activities such as combat,
    questing, or other time-sensitive actions that require immediate attention. The
    method evaluates the bot's current state and returns true if it is actively performing
    any high-priority task, and false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for
    managing bot behavior and ensuring appropriate resource allocation during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified bot is currently engaged in a high-priority
    activity; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (botPriorityManager.IsInHighPriorityActivity(bot)) {\n    // Bot is\
      \ busy with high priority task\n    bot->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"Bot\
      \ is in high priority activity\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic Based on Activity
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized\nif (botPriorityManager.IsInHighPriorityActivity(myBot))\
      \ {\n    // Handle high priority case\n    bot->SetBotState(BotState::HIGH_PRIORITY);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle low priority case\n    bot->SetBotState(BotState::IDLE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking of the bot's current activity.
    It should be called frequently to ensure accurate status reporting, especially
    in time-sensitive scenarios. The implementation may cache results for performance
    reasons.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as it could lead to undefined behavior if accessed on an invalid
    object. This method does not perform any locking or thread safety checks internally.
