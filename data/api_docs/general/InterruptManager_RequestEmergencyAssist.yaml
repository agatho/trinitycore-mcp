  class: InterruptManager
  method: RequestEmergencyAssist
  signature: void InterruptManager::RequestEmergencyAssist(const InterruptTarget &
    target)
documentation:
  brief: Sends an emergency assistance request to the specified target for interrupting
    ongoing spell casts.
  description: The RequestEmergencyAssist method is used by the InterruptManager to
    signal other AI-controlled units or players that an urgent interruption of a spell
    cast is required. This typically occurs when a high-priority threat or event demands
    immediate attention, such as when a player is casting a dangerous spell and needs
    to be interrupted before it completes. The method does not directly interrupt
    spells but rather communicates the need for assistance from nearby entities. It
    may trigger a chain reaction where multiple units respond to the request depending
    on their AI behavior and proximity to the target.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The InterruptTarget object representing the entity whose spell cast
      should be interrupted. This parameter defines which unit or spell is being targeted
      for interruption.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'InterruptManager manager;

      Unit* targetUnit = ...; // Some unit casting a spell

      InterruptTarget interruptTarget(targetUnit);

      manager.RequestEmergencyAssist(interruptTarget);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers an internal event or message that other AI components
    listen to. It's important to ensure that the target provided is valid and not
    null, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. The actual interruption logic is
    handled by the receiving units' AI systems.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or null targets as it may lead to
    crashes or unexpected behavior in the AI system. Ensure that the InterruptTarget
    contains a valid unit reference before invoking this method.
