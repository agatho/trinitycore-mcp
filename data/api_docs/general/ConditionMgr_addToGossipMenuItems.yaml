    const
documentation:
  brief: Adds a condition to gossip menu items for conditional NPC interactions in
    World of Warcraft.
  description: The addToGossipMenuItems method is used to associate a specific condition
    with gossip menu items within the TrinityCore framework. This allows developers
    to control when certain options appear in an NPC's gossip menu based on game state,
    player requirements, or other dynamic conditions. The method takes a ConditionId
    and an integer representing condition flags, and integrates these into the internal
    gossip menu system. This functionality is essential for creating dynamic and responsive
    NPC interactions that adapt to player progress, quest status, or other game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier for the condition to be added. This typically
      corresponds to a specific condition type or group within the TrinityCore condition
      system.
  - name: conditions
    description: An integer value representing condition flags or types. These flags
      determine how the condition is evaluated and applied to the gossip menu item.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for adding a quest requirement condition
    code: ConditionMgr::getInstance()->addToGossipMenuItems(ConditionId(12345), 1);
      // Adds a condition with ID 12345 and type flag 1
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding multiple conditions to a single gossip menu item
    code: 'ConditionMgr::getInstance()->addToGossipMenuItems(ConditionId(67890), 2);

      ConditionMgr::getInstance()->addToGossipMenuItems(ConditionId(11111), 4); //
      Adds two different conditions with different flags'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during NPC gossip initialization or condition
    setup. The ConditionId should be unique and properly registered within the condition
    system. The 'conditions' parameter value depends on the specific condition type
    being used, and developers should consult the TrinityCore condition documentation
    for valid flag values.
  warnings: Incorrect ConditionId values or invalid condition flags may result in
    conditions not being applied correctly, leading to unexpected gossip menu behavior.
    Ensure that all referenced conditions are properly defined in the database before
    calling this method.
