documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current kiting type configuration from the KitingManager instance.
  description: The GetCurrentType method returns the active kiting type currently
    set within the KitingManager. This kiting type determines how the AI-controlled
    unit will perform kiting behavior, such as maintaining distance from enemies or
    positioning for optimal damage output. The method does not modify any internal
    state and is purely a getter function. It is typically used to query the current
    kiting strategy during AI decision-making processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A KitingType enum value representing the current kiting behavior configuration.
    Possible values may include KITING_TYPE_NONE, KITING_TYPE_MELEE, KITING_TYPE_RANGED,
    or other specific kiting strategies defined by the TrinityCore AI system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "KitingType currentType = kitingManager->GetCurrentType();\nif (currentType\
      \ == KITING_TYPE_RANGED)\n{\n    // Perform ranged kiting logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    returned KitingType value should not be modified directly as it represents a configuration
    state managed by the KitingManager.
