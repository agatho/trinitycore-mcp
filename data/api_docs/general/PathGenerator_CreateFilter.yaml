  method: CreateFilter
  signature: void PathGenerator::CreateFilter()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and sets up the pathfinding filter for navigation calculations.
  description: The CreateFilter method prepares the internal filtering mechanism used
    by the PathGenerator to determine valid movement paths in the game world. This
    method configures the necessary parameters and constraints that will be applied
    during pathfinding operations, such as terrain restrictions, object collisions,
    and NPC avoidance rules. It establishes the baseline filter settings that subsequent
    path calculations will utilize, ensuring consistent behavior across different
    navigation requests. The filter typically includes settings for walkable surfaces,
    height differences, and other movement-related criteria that define what constitutes
    a valid path.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic PathGenerator Filter Initialization
    code: 'PathGenerator* pathGen = new PathGenerator(player);

      pathGen->CreateFilter();

      // Filter is now initialized and ready for pathfinding operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called once during the initialization of
    a PathGenerator instance before any pathfinding calculations are performed. The
    filter created by this method may be reused across multiple pathfinding requests,
    making it an efficient way to set up consistent navigation rules.
  warnings: Calling CreateFilter without proper initialization of the PathGenerator
    object may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all required dependencies
    and context information are properly set before invoking this method.
