  class: MovementInfo
  method: GetExtraMovementFlags
  signature: uint32 MovementInfo::GetExtraMovementFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the extra movement flags from the MovementInfo object.
  description: The GetExtraMovementFlags method returns the extra movement flags stored
    within a MovementInfo object. These flags are used in World of Warcraft's networking
    protocol to communicate additional movement state information for units, such
    as flying, swimming, or other special movement states. The returned value is a
    bitmask that can be checked against specific flag constants to determine the current
    movement state of an entity. This method is typically used during packet processing
    and movement synchronization within the TrinityCore server.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the extra movement flags. Each bit in this
    value corresponds to a specific movement state or condition, such as being on
    ground, flying, swimming, or other special movement states. The caller should
    use bitwise operations to check for specific flag values.
  examples:
  - title: Checking for Flying Movement State
    code: "MovementInfo movementInfo;\n// Assume movementInfo has been populated with\
      \ data\nuint32 flags = movementInfo.GetExtraMovementFlags();\nif (flags & MOVEFLAG_FLYING)\n\
      {\n    // Unit is currently flying\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Debugging Movement Flags
    code: 'uint32 extraFlags = movementInfo.GetExtraMovementFlags();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("movement", "Extra movement flags: 0x%08X", extraFlags);

      // Output might show something like: Extra movement flags: 0x00000020'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that does not modify the MovementInfo object.
    The returned value reflects the state as it was set during the construction or
    update of the MovementInfo object. Developers should be aware that movement flags
    are part of the network protocol and may change based on client-server synchronization.
  warnings: Be cautious when directly comparing the return value against hardcoded
    flag values without proper bit checking. Always use bitwise operations (e.g.,
    & operator) to test for specific flags rather than direct equality comparisons.
    The returned flags might not be meaningful if the MovementInfo object was not
    properly initialized with movement data.
