  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: CheckPerformanceThresholds
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::CheckPerformanceThresholds()
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates current performance metrics against configured thresholds to determine
    if bot behavior adjustments are needed.
  description: The CheckPerformanceThresholds method monitors various performance
    indicators such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and frame rate stability. It
    compares these metrics against predefined threshold values set in the configuration
    to decide whether to adjust bot behavior, reduce resource usage, or trigger alerts.
    This method is typically called periodically by the bot management system to ensure
    optimal performance across all active bots. The evaluation considers both individual
    bot performance and aggregate system load to maintain stable gameplay conditions.

  - title: Basic Performance Monitoring Check
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      monitor.CheckPerformanceThresholds();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and non-blocking, typically running
    in a background thread. It relies on accurate system timing and may require periodic
    calibration of thresholds based on server load conditions.
