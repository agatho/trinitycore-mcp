  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: CanCompleteQuestObjective
  signature: bool DynamicQuestSystem::CanCompleteQuestObjective(Player * bot, uint32
    questId, uint32 objectiveIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a player can complete a specific quest objective within the
    dynamic quest system.
  description: The CanCompleteQuestObjective method evaluates if a given player meets
    all necessary conditions to complete a specified quest objective. This includes
    checking item requirements, kill counts, quest status, and other relevant criteria
    defined by the dynamic quest system. The method is typically used during quest
    progression to validate whether an objective has been fulfilled before allowing
    the quest to advance or be completed. It ensures that players cannot prematurely
    mark objectives as complete, maintaining game balance and integrity.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player whose quest
      progress is being evaluated.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest for which the objective check is performed.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: Zero-based index indicating which specific objective within the quest
      should be validated.
  returns: Returns true if all conditions for completing the specified quest objective
    are met by the player; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check a quest objective
    code: "if (dynamicQuestSystem->CanCompleteQuestObjective(player, 12345, 0)) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with completing the first objective of quest 12345\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a quest completion handler
    code: "void HandleQuestComplete(Player* player, uint32 questId) {\n    for (uint32\
      \ i = 0; i < GetQuestObjectiveCount(questId); ++i) {\n        if (!dynamicQuestSystem->CanCompleteQuestObjective(player,\
      \ questId, i)) {\n            return; // Cannot complete this quest yet\n  \
      \      }\n    }\n    // All objectives can be completed, proceed with quest\
      \ reward\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking within the dynamic quest system
    and should only be called after ensuring that the player's current quest data
    is up-to-date. It may perform database queries or cached lookups depending on
    how the dynamic quest system is implemented.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the player has the quest active
    in their quest log may lead to incorrect results. Additionally, calling it outside
    of a valid game context (e.g., during server shutdown) could cause undefined behavior.
