  class: BotSpawnerOptimized
  method: Initialize
  signature: void BotSpawnerOptimized::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot spawner optimized system, setting up internal data structures
    and configurations for spawning game bots.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the BotSpawnerOptimized class for operation
    by initializing all necessary internal components, loading configuration settings,
    and preparing the spawn queue. This method must be called before any bot spawning
    operations can occur. It typically handles memory allocation, default value assignments,
    and ensures that all required subsystems are ready to manage bot creation and
    placement within the game world. The initialization process may involve reading
    from database tables or configuration files to determine spawn parameters such
    as bot types, spawn rates, and location constraints.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'BotSpawnerOptimized spawner;

      spawner.Initialize();

      // Bot spawner is now ready to spawn bots'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the system's lifecycle. Re-initialization
    may lead to resource leaks or inconsistent states. The method performs no locking
    internally, so if used in a multi-threaded environment, external synchronization
    may be required.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can result in
    undefined behavior. Ensure that all previous bot spawning operations are completed
    before calling Initialize again.
