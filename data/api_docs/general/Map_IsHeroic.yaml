documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current map is a heroic difficulty instance
  description: This method checks if the current map instance is configured for heroic
    difficulty. It returns true when the map is set to heroic mode, indicating that
    players are facing enhanced difficulty challenges with increased rewards and more
    challenging encounters. The method is commonly used in World of Warcraft content
    where maps can have both normal and heroic modes, such as dungeons and raids.
    This functionality is essential for determining player progression and reward
    distribution in game content.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map instance is in heroic difficulty mode, false otherwise.
    This indicates that players are facing enhanced difficulty challenges with increased
    rewards and more challenging encounters.
  examples:
  - title: Checking heroic status in a dungeon
    code: "if (map->IsHeroic()) {\n    // Player is in heroic mode\n    // Apply special\
      \ rewards or mechanics\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method typically checks the map''s difficulty
    settings and may involve checking if the map instance has been configured for
    heroic mode. Performance considerations: The method is lightweight and should
    not cause noticeable performance impact when called frequently.'
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine player progression or reward
    eligibility directly, as it only indicates whether the map itself is in heroic
    mode, not whether players are actually eligible for heroic content.
