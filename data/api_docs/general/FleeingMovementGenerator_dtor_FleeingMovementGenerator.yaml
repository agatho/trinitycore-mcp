documentation:
  brief: Destroys a FleeingMovementGenerator instance and releases its resources.
  description: The destructor for the FleeingMovementGenerator class is responsible
    for cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the movement
    generator. This method is automatically invoked when a FleeingMovementGenerator
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore, this generator is used to control NPC movement when they
    are fleeing from combat, and its destructor ensures proper cleanup of internal
    state and references to avoid memory leaks.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of FleeingMovementGenerator
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    FleeingMovementGenerator* fleeGen = new FleeingMovementGenerator();\n\
      \    // ... use fleeGen ...\n    delete fleeGen; // Destructor is called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor does not need to be called manually in most cases as it's
    invoked automatically during object destruction. It's important to note that this
    class likely inherits from a base movement generator class, so the destructor
    may also trigger cleanup in parent classes.
