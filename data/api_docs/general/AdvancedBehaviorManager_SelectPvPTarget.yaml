  signature: Player * AdvancedBehaviorManager::SelectPvPTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns a suitable PvP target player for the behavior manager.
  description: The SelectPvPTarget method identifies and returns a valid Player object
    that can be used as a target for PvP-related behaviors. This method typically
    evaluates the current environment, including player availability, faction status,
    and proximity to determine an appropriate target. It is commonly used in AI-driven
    behaviors where a player needs to be targeted for combat or interaction in PvP
    scenarios. The selection process may consider factors such as player level, health
    status, and whether they are flagged for PvP.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a Player object representing the selected PvP target, or nullptr
    if no suitable target is found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Behavior
    code: "Player* target = behaviorManager->SelectPvPTarget();\nif (target && target->IsInWorld())\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with PvP targeting logic\n    DoPvPTactics(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AdvancedBehaviorManager's AI system and should
    only be called when the behavior manager is in a PvP context. The returned Player
    pointer must be validated before use to ensure it is not null or invalid.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a PvP scenario may return unexpected results
    or nullptr. Always verify that the returned player object is valid before attempting
    to interact with it.
