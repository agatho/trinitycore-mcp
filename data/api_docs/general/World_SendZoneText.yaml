api:
  class: World
  method: SendZoneText
  signature: void World::SendZoneText(uint32 zone, const char * text, WorldSession
    * self, int team)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a zone-specific text message to players in the specified zone, optionally
    filtered by team.
  description: The SendZoneText method broadcasts a text message to all players within
    a given zone. It allows for optional filtering of the recipients based on their
    team (Alliance or Horde). This functionality is commonly used for in-game announcements,
    quest updates, or zone-specific notifications that should be visible to all players
    in a particular area. The method does not require a specific WorldSession parameter
    to be passed for sending the message; instead, it uses the provided session as
    a reference point for determining the zone context and can optionally send the
    message to a specific player if needed. The text is sent using the standard in-game
    chat system and respects the player's language settings.
  parameters:
  - name: zone
    description: The unique identifier of the zone where the message should be broadcast.
      This corresponds to the ZoneID used internally by TrinityCore.
  - name: text
    description: A null-terminated character string containing the message to be sent.
      This text will be displayed in the chat window of all players in the specified
      zone.
  - name: self
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession of the player who is sending the message.
      This parameter can be used to determine the sender's context or to send a private
      message to a specific player if needed.
  - name: team
    description: An integer value indicating which team should receive the message.
      Valid values are typically 0 for All, 1 for Alliance, and 2 for Horde. A value
      of -1 may indicate no filtering.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Broadcast a general announcement to all players in zone 1234
    code: World::SendZoneText(1234, "Welcome to the new event!", nullptr, 0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Send a team-specific message to Alliance players in zone 5678
    code: World::SendZoneText(5678, "Alliance players, gather at the fountain!", nullptr,
      1);
    language: cpp
  notes: The method internally uses the World's player list and zone management systems
    to determine which players are in the specified zone. It is designed to be efficient
    for broadcasting messages without requiring individual session checks. Performance
    may be affected if a large number of players are in the same zone.
  warnings: Ensure that the zone ID passed is valid, as invalid IDs may cause undefined
    behavior or no message delivery. Be cautious when sending frequent messages to
    avoid spamming players.
