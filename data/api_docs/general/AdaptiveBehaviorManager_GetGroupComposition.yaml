documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current group composition managed by the adaptive behavior
    manager.
  description: The GetGroupComposition method returns a constant reference to the
    GroupComposition object that represents the current state of the group being managed
    by this adaptive behavior manager. This composition includes information about
    the players and their roles within the group, which is used for decision-making
    in adaptive AI behaviors. The returned reference is guaranteed to be valid for
    the lifetime of the AdaptiveBehaviorManager instance, and modifications to the
    group composition should be made through dedicated management methods rather than
    direct access to the returned object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the GroupComposition object representing the current
    group state. This reference remains valid as long as the AdaptiveBehaviorManager
    instance exists, and provides read-only access to group member data including
    roles, levels, and other relevant attributes for AI decision-making.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "AdaptiveBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = ...;\nconst GroupComposition&\
      \ composition = behaviorManager->GetGroupComposition();\nfor (const auto& member\
      \ : composition.GetMembers()) {\n    // Process each group member\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Member: \" << member.GetName() << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned GroupComposition object is intended for read-only access. Modifying
    the composition directly through this reference may lead to undefined behavior
    or inconsistent AI decisions. The composition is updated automatically by the
    manager based on group changes, so calling this method repeatedly will always
    return the most current state.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned GroupComposition object directly as it may
    invalidate internal AI logic. Always use dedicated methods for modifying group
    composition to ensure proper synchronization and behavior updates.
