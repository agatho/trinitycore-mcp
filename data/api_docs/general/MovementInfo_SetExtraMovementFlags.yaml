  class: MovementInfo
  method: SetExtraMovementFlags
  signature: void MovementInfo::SetExtraMovementFlags(uint32 flag)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the extra movement flags for a MovementInfo object, defining additional
    movement behaviors and states.
  description: The SetExtraMovementFlags method assigns a set of extra movement flags
    to a MovementInfo object, which are used to communicate special movement states
    or behaviors between the client and server in World of Warcraft. These flags can
    indicate various conditions such as flying, swimming, rooted status, or other
    movement-related modifiers that affect how a unit moves through the game world.
    The method directly modifies internal state within the MovementInfo structure,
    and these flags are typically serialized and sent during movement updates to ensure
    accurate client-side representation of character actions.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the extra movement flags to
      be set. This value should be a bitmask combining one or more predefined movement
      flag constants such as MOVEFLAG_NONE, MOVEFLAG_FLYING, MOVEFLAG_ROOTED, etc.,
      depending on the desired movement state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Flying Movement Flag
    code: 'MovementInfo moveInfo;

      moveInfo.SetExtraMovementFlags(MOVEFLAG_FLYING);

      // This sets the unit to be in a flying state, affecting its movement behavior.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Combining Multiple Movement Flags
    code: 'MovementInfo moveInfo;

      uint32 flags = MOVEFLAG_FLYING | MOVEFLAG_ROOTED | MOVEFLAG_SWIMMING;

      moveInfo.SetExtraMovementFlags(flags);

      // This sets multiple movement states simultaneously: flying, rooted, and swimming.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal flags member of MovementInfo.
    It is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related methods to build
    complete movement state information for units. The flag values must be valid movement
    flag constants defined within the TrinityCore codebase.
  warnings: Incorrect or invalid flag combinations may result in unexpected client
    behavior or movement glitches. Ensure that movement flags are properly validated
    before setting them, especially when combining multiple flags.
