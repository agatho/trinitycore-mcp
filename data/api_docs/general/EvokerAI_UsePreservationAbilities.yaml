  signature: void EvokerAI::UsePreservationAbilities()
documentation:
  brief: Determines and executes appropriate preservation abilities for the evoker
    AI based on current combat state and resource levels.
  description: The UsePreservationAbilities method is responsible for managing the
    evoker's defensive and utility spell usage within the AI system. It evaluates
    the current health status, mana availability, and combat conditions to decide
    which preservation abilities should be cast. This includes abilities such as 'Emerald
    Blossom' for healing, 'Renewal' for mana restoration, or other defensive spells
    that maintain the evoker's survivability during encounters. The method ensures
    that these abilities are used strategically rather than randomly, taking into
    account cooldowns and priority levels of different spells.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    UsePreservationAbilities();\n\n    // Other AI logic...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI's update cycle and should not
    be invoked directly from external code unless specifically required. The implementation
    considers the evoker's current mana pool, health percentage, and target threat
    level to determine appropriate spell usage.
  warnings: Improper use of this method outside of the intended AI context may result
    in incorrect behavior or unintended spell casting. Ensure that the AI has a valid
    target and sufficient resources before calling this method.
