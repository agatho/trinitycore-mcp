  brief: Resets all statistics and counters for the bot spawner instance.
  description: The ResetStats method clears all accumulated statistics and counters
    within the BotSpawner class. This includes resetting spawn counts, failure rates,
    and any other internal tracking metrics that may have been updated during operation.
    The method ensures a clean state for the spawner, typically called before reinitializing
    or restarting bot spawning operations. It does not affect the configuration settings
    or the core functionality of the spawner, only the statistical data.

  - title: Resetting Statistics Before Reinitialization
    code: 'BotSpawner spawner;

      // ... perform some bot spawning operations ...

      spawner.ResetStats();

      // Statistics are now reset, ready for new operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it permanently clears all statistical
    data. It is recommended to save any necessary statistics before calling this method
    if they need to persist across resets.
