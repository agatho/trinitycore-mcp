documentation:
  brief: Registers a manager with the registry and returns true if successful.
  description: The RegisterManager method attempts to register a manager instance
    with the ManagerRegistry. This method is typically used during system initialization
    or when dynamically adding new managers to the registry. The method takes an integer
    identifier representing the manager type or index and performs validation to ensure
    the manager can be properly registered. It returns true if registration succeeds,
    false otherwise. This functionality is essential for maintaining a centralized
    registry of active managers within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the manager was successfully registered with the registry,
    false if registration failed due to invalid parameters or internal errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Manager Registration
    code: "ManagerRegistry& registry = ManagerRegistry::Instance();\nbool success\
      \ = registry.RegisterManager(1); // Register manager with ID 1\nif (success)\n\
      {\n    // Manager registered successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Manager registered\
      \ successfully.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a singleton pattern implementation where managers
    are registered during server startup or runtime. The integer parameter may represent
    manager type IDs, indices, or unique identifiers within the system.
