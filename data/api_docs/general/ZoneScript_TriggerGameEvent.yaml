  class: ZoneScript
  method: TriggerGameEvent
  signature: void ZoneScript::TriggerGameEvent(uint32 gameEventId, WorldObject * source,
    WorldObject * target)
documentation:
  brief: Triggers a game event with specified source and target objects.
  description: The TriggerGameEvent method initiates a game event identified by the
    provided gameEventId. It allows for the execution of event-specific logic within
    the World of Warcraft environment, potentially affecting NPCs, GameObjects, or
    other world entities based on the event definition. The method accepts optional
    source and target WorldObject parameters which can be used to determine event
    behavior or context, such as triggering an event from a specific NPC or targeting
    a particular GameObject. This functionality is commonly used for quest events,
    seasonal celebrations, or scripted interactions that require dynamic activation.
  parameters:
  - name: gameEventId
    description: The unique identifier of the game event to trigger. This ID corresponds
      to an entry in the game_event table and defines which specific event logic will
      be executed.
  - name: source
    description: Optional pointer to the WorldObject that is initiating the event.
      Can be NULL if no source object is relevant for the event.
  - name: target
    description: Optional pointer to the WorldObject that is being targeted by the
      event. Can be NULL if no target object is relevant for the event.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Trigger a basic game event with source and target
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      GameObject* go = ...;

      zoneScript->TriggerGameEvent(12345, player, go);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Trigger a game event without specifying source or target
    code: zoneScript->TriggerGameEvent(67890, nullptr, nullptr);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within ZoneScript implementations to activate
    events that are defined in the game_event table. It directly calls the game event
    system and does not return any value. The event execution may involve multiple
    steps including spawning creatures, changing object states, or modifying quest
    status.
  warnings: Ensure that the gameEventId corresponds to a valid event in the database;
    otherwise, no action will be taken. Be cautious when passing WorldObject pointers
    as they must remain valid during the event execution. Passing invalid or dangling
    pointers can lead to undefined behavior.
