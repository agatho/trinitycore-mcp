documentation:
  brief: Appends a database table entry for a player dump transaction
  description: The AppendTable method is responsible for adding a structured database
    table entry to an ongoing StringTransaction object when generating a player dump.
    It takes a GUID, table structure definition, and actual table data to construct
    the appropriate SQL INSERT statement. This method is typically used during player
    data export or serialization processes within the TrinityCore framework. The method
    ensures proper formatting of the data according to the provided table structure
    before appending it to the transaction.
  parameters:
  - name: trans
    description: Reference to a StringTransaction object that accumulates SQL statements
      for the player dump
  - name: guid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose data is being dumped,
      used as part of the table entry
  - name: tableStruct
    description: Structure definition describing the layout and field types of the
      database table to be appended
  - name: dumpTable
    description: Actual data content to be inserted into the table, formatted according
      to the table structure specification
  returns: Returns true if the table entry was successfully appended to the transaction,
    false otherwise. Failure may occur due to invalid data, structural mismatches,
    or transaction errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of AppendTable for player inventory dump
    code: "StringTransaction trans;\nint playerId = 12345;\nTableStruct itemTableStruct\
      \ = GetItemTableStructure();\nDumpTable playerItems = GetPlayerInventoryData(playerId);\n\
      bool success = PlayerDumpWriter::AppendTable(trans, playerId, itemTableStruct,\
      \ playerItems);\nif (success) {\n    // Proceed with transaction execution\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided table structure and dump data are compatible.
    It's important to validate data types and ensure proper field mapping before calling
    this function. The method does not perform any validation on the transaction itself,
    so callers should ensure the StringTransaction is properly initialized.
  warnings: The method may fail silently if data formatting issues occur. Ensure all
    parameters are valid before calling to avoid unexpected behavior. This method
    modifies the provided StringTransaction object in-place, so be cautious when reusing
    transactions.
