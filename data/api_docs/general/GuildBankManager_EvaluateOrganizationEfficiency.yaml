  class: GuildBankManager
  method: EvaluateOrganizationEfficiency
  signature: float GuildBankManager::EvaluateOrganizationEfficiency(int * guild)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the efficiency rating of a guild's bank organization
    structure.
  description: The EvaluateOrganizationEfficiency method computes a numerical score
    representing how effectively a guild's bank is organized based on various factors
    such as item distribution, usage patterns, and storage optimization. This metric
    helps guild leaders understand the health and organization level of their guild
    bank. The method internally accesses guild bank data structures and performs calculations
    to determine this efficiency value. It requires that the guild be properly initialized
    and have active bank transactions for meaningful results.
  parameters:
  - name: guild
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the guild identifier. This parameter
      is used to locate and retrieve specific guild data from the game's internal
      systems.
  returns: A floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 indicates poor organization
    efficiency and 1.0 represents optimal organization. Values closer to 1.0 suggest
    better item distribution, more efficient storage usage, and improved overall guild
    bank management.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int guildId = 12345;

      float efficiency = guildBankManager->EvaluateOrganizationEfficiency(&guildId);

      printf("Guild Bank Efficiency: %.2f\n", efficiency);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Guild Management
    code: "int* guildPtr = &player->GetGuildId();\nif (guildPtr != nullptr && *guildPtr\
      \ > 0) {\n    float efficiency = guildBankManager->EvaluateOrganizationEfficiency(guildPtr);\n\
      \    if (efficiency < 0.5f) {\n        // Alert guild leader about poor organization\n\
      \        SendSystemMessageToGuild(\"Warning: Low bank organization efficiency\
      \ detected.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform database queries or access cached guild data structures,
    so frequent calls could impact performance. The calculation logic considers factors
    like item rarity distribution, frequently accessed items placement, and overall
    storage utilization. It's recommended to cache results when used in high-frequency
    scenarios.
  warnings: The method assumes the provided guild pointer is valid and points to an
    existing guild. Passing a null or invalid guild ID may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect calculations. Ensure proper error handling around this call in production
    code.
