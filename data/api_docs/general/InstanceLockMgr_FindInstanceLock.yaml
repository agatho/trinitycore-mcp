  class: InstanceLockMgr
  method: FindInstanceLock
  signature: InstanceLock * InstanceLockMgr::FindInstanceLock(const int & locks, const
    int & playerGuid, const MapDb2Entries & entries)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns an instance lock matching the specified criteria.
  description: The FindInstanceLock method searches for a specific instance lock within
    the InstanceLockMgr based on provided parameters. It evaluates locks, player GUID,
    and map entries to locate a matching instance lock. This method is typically used
    during instance management operations such as checking player access permissions
    or retrieving existing instance lock data for a given player and map combination.
    The method performs internal lookups and returns a pointer to the found InstanceLock
    object or nullptr if no match is found.
  parameters:
  - name: locks
    description: An integer representing the lock identifier or bitmask used to filter
      instance locks. This value typically corresponds to instance difficulty levels
      or lock types.
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player for whom the instance
      lock is being searched. This GUID uniquely identifies the player within the
      game world.
  - name: entries
    description: A reference to MapDb2Entries structure containing map-related database
      entries used to validate or match against the instance lock criteria.
  returns: Returns a pointer to an InstanceLock object if a matching instance lock
    is found; otherwise, returns nullptr if no matching instance lock exists for the
    given parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of FindInstanceLock
    code: "InstanceLock* lock = instanceLockMgr->FindInstanceLock(1, playerGuid, mapEntries);\n\
      if (lock != nullptr) {\n    // Process found instance lock\n    printf(\"Found\
      \ instance lock for player %d\\n\", playerGuid);\n} else {\n    // No matching\
      \ instance lock found\n    printf(\"No instance lock found for player %d\\n\"\
      , playerGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation that may involve internal data structures
    such as maps or containers. The performance of this method depends on the implementation
    of the underlying storage mechanism and the number of existing instance locks.
    It is recommended to cache results when repeatedly querying for the same player
    and map combinations.
