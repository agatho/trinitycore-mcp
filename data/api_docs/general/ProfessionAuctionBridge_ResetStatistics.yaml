  signature: void ProfessionAuctionBridge::ResetStatistics(uint32 playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Resets auction statistics for a specified player in the profession auction
    system.
  description: The ResetStatistics method clears all recorded auction activity and
    performance metrics for a given player within the profession auction bridge system.
    This function is typically invoked when a player's auction data needs to be cleared,
    such as during account cleanup, character deletion, or administrative intervention.
    The method operates on the player's unique identifier (GUID) to locate and reset
    their specific statistics. It ensures that historical auction data does not persist
    beyond its intended use, maintaining data integrity within the auction system.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique global identifier (GUID) of the player whose auction statistics
      will be reset. This value must correspond to a valid player in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset Auction Statistics for Player
    code: 'uint32 playerId = 12345;

      ProfessionAuctionBridge::ResetStatistics(playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal auction data structures and may
    involve database operations. It should be used carefully as it permanently removes
    player-specific auction history.
  warnings: Using this method will irreversibly delete all auction-related statistics
    for the specified player, including completed auctions, bids, and performance
    metrics. Ensure proper validation of the player GUID before calling to prevent
    unintended data loss.
