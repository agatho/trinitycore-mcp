api:
  class: InteractionManager
  method: RepairAll
  signature: InteractionResult InteractionManager::RepairAll(Player * bot, Creature
    * vendor)
documentation:
  brief: Repairs all items in the bot's inventory using the specified vendor.
  description: The RepairAll method iterates through all items currently equipped
    or in the bot's inventory and repairs them using the provided vendor. This function
    handles the interaction with the vendor to perform the repair transaction for
    all eligible items at once, rather than requiring individual repair actions. The
    method respects item types that are eligible for repair (e.g., weapons, armor)
    and skips items that cannot be repaired such as consumables or soulbound items.
    It ensures proper communication with the vendor's repair service and updates the
    bot's inventory accordingly after repairs are completed.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot requesting repairs.
      Must be a valid player instance with an active session.
  - name: vendor
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the vendor offering repair
      services. Must be a valid vendor creature with repair capabilities enabled.
  returns: Returns an InteractionResult enum indicating the success or failure of
    the repair operation. Possible values include SUCCESS, FAILED, INVALID_TARGET,
    or INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS depending on whether all items were repaired successfully.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Repair All Usage
    code: "InteractionResult result = interactionManager.RepairAll(bot, vendor);\n\
      if (result == InteractionResult::SUCCESS) {\n    // All items repaired successfully\n\
      \    bot->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"All items repaired!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Repair Results
    code: "InteractionResult result = interactionManager.RepairAll(bot, vendor);\n\
      switch (result) {\n    case InteractionResult::SUCCESS:\n        bot->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"\
      Repair complete.\");\n        break;\n    case InteractionResult::FAILED:\n\
      \        bot->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"Repair failed.\");\n        break;\n\
      \    case InteractionResult::INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS:\n        bot->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"\
      Not enough gold for repairs.\");\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the vendor is within interaction range and has sufficient
    funds to cover all repair costs. It does not perform any checks on item durability
    before attempting repairs, so items with zero durability will still be processed.
    The method may trigger multiple vendor interactions internally depending on how
    many items need to be repaired.
  warnings: Ensure that both the bot and vendor parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method; otherwise, it may cause a crash or undefined behavior. Be
    cautious when using this in high-frequency scenarios as it can generate multiple
    network packets during repair transactions.
