documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the default spawn group identifier used for object spawning
    in the game world.
  description: The GetDefaultSpawnGroup method retrieves the default spawn group identifier
    that is used by the ObjectMgr to determine which spawn group should be assigned
    to objects that do not explicitly specify one. This value is typically used during
    the initialization of creatures, game objects, or other entities that are spawned
    in the World of Warcraft environment through TrinityCore. The returned pointer
    points to an integer value representing the default spawn group ID, which may
    be zero or a positive integer depending on configuration and database settings.
    It is important to note that this method returns a const pointer, meaning the
    value should not be modified directly.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an integer representing the default spawn group ID.
    If no default spawn group has been configured or initialized, it may return nullptr
    or point to a zero value indicating no specific group is assigned.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use default spawn group
    code: "const int* defaultGroup = sObjectMgr->GetDefaultSpawnGroup();\nif (defaultGroup\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Default Spawn Group ID: \" << *defaultGroup\
      \ << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n    std::cout << \"No default spawn group configured.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or when spawning
    objects to ensure they are assigned to the correct spawn group. The returned value
    should not be modified directly as it's a const pointer. It's recommended to check
    for null before dereferencing the returned pointer.
  warnings: Accessing the returned integer through the pointer must be done carefully
    to avoid undefined behavior if the pointer is null. Also, since this is a const
    pointer, modifying the value pointed to by it will result in compile-time errors.
