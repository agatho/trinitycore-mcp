  class: Totem
  method: UpdateAllStats
  signature: bool Totem::UpdateAllStats()
documentation:
  brief: Updates all statistics and attributes for the totem object.
  description: The UpdateAllStats method recalculates and applies all statistical
    modifiers and attribute values for a Totem instance. This includes updating stats
    such as attack power, spell power, resilience, and other combat-related attributes
    based on the totem's current state, owner's buffs, and any active enchantments
    or effects. The method ensures that the totem reflects the most up-to-date game
    state in terms of its capabilities and performance within the World of Warcraft
    environment. This function is typically invoked when there are changes to the
    totem's properties or when synchronization with the owner's stats is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the statistics were successfully updated, false otherwise.
    A return value of false may indicate an error during stat calculation or application,
    or that no updates were necessary due to unchanged conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (totem->UpdateAllStats()) {\n    // Stats successfully updated\n   \
      \ printf(\"Totem stats updated successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ update failure\n    printf(\"Failed to update totem stats\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may trigger additional internal recalculations and could potentially
    impact performance if called frequently in rapid succession. It is recommended
    to call this function only when necessary, such as after significant changes to
    the totem or its owner's state.
