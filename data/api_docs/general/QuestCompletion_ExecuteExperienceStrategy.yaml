  signature: void QuestCompletion::ExecuteExperienceStrategy(Player * bot, QuestProgressData
    & progress)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the experience strategy for a player completing a quest, applying
    appropriate XP rewards and adjustments based on quest progress.
  description: The ExecuteExperienceStrategy method handles the logic for awarding
    experience points to a player when they complete a quest. It evaluates the current
    quest progress data and applies experience calculations considering factors such
    as quest level, player level, and any applicable modifiers or bonuses. This method
    is typically invoked during quest completion processing within the TrinityCore
    framework to ensure proper reward distribution. The method modifies the player's
    experience state directly without returning any value.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who is completing
      the quest. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: progress
    description: Reference to QuestProgressData structure containing current quest
      progress information including completion status, objective counts, and related
      data for experience calculation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest completion handler
    code: "void OnQuestComplete(Player* player, Quest* quest)\n{\n    QuestProgressData\
      \ progress;\n    // ... populate progress data ...\n    QuestCompletion completion;\n\
      \    completion.ExecuteExperienceStrategy(player, progress);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player object is valid and that quest progress
    data has been properly initialized. It directly modifies player experience state
    and should only be called during appropriate quest completion contexts to avoid
    unintended behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the QuestProgressData
    structure may lead to incorrect experience calculations or runtime errors. Ensure
    that all required quest progress fields are populated before invocation.
