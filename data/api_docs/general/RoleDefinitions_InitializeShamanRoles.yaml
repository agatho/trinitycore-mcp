  class: RoleDefinitions
  method: InitializeShamanRoles
  signature: void RoleDefinitions::InitializeShamanRoles()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the role definitions for shaman class specializations within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The InitializeShamanRoles method sets up and configures all role-related
    definitions specific to the shaman class in World of Warcraft. This includes defining
    the primary roles such as healing, damage dealing, and support functions that
    a shaman can fulfill in various game scenarios like dungeons, raids, or PvP. The
    method ensures that the role system recognizes the unique abilities and playstyles
    associated with each shaman specialization (Elemental, Enhancement, Restoration)
    and prepares them for use in player role assignment, group matching, and AI decision-making
    processes.

  notes: This method should typically be called during server startup or when loading
    class-specific configurations. It is not intended to be called repeatedly during
    runtime as it initializes static role definitions that remain consistent throughout
    the session.
