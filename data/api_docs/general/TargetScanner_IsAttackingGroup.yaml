  signature: bool TargetScanner::IsAttackingGroup(Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the target unit is part of an attacking group.
  description: The IsAttackingGroup method checks if the specified target unit belongs
    to a group that is currently engaged in combat or actively attacking. This function
    evaluates the group status and attack state of the target, returning true if the
    target is part of an active attacking group, and false otherwise. The method is
    commonly used in AI behavior scripts to determine appropriate targeting strategies
    for NPCs or creatures. It considers both the unit's current group membership and
    its combat engagement status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target unit is part of an attacking group; otherwise
    returns false. A return value of true indicates that the unit belongs to a group
    currently involved in combat activities, while false indicates either the unit
    is not in a group or the group is not actively attacking.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Script
    code: "if (scanner.IsAttackingGroup(target)) {\n    // Target is in an attacking\
      \ group, adjust behavior\n    creature->AI()->AttackStart(target);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Target is not in an attacking group\n    creature->AI()->DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Targeting Logic
    code: "Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_RANDOM, 0, 100.0f, true);\nif\
      \ (target && scanner.IsAttackingGroup(target)) {\n    // Prioritize attacking\
      \ units that are part of active groups\n    if (me->GetDistance(target) < 20.0f)\
      \ {\n        DoCast(target, SPELL_ENRAGE);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal group tracking and combat state management
    of TrinityCore's AI system. It may return false for units that are in a group
    but not currently engaged in combat, or for units that are not part of any group
    at all. The implementation considers both direct group membership and the overall
    combat engagement status of the group.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only evaluates the current state of the target
    unit's group. If the group composition changes during execution, the result may
    become outdated. Additionally, this function should not be used in performance-critical
    sections due to potential group state checks and traversal operations.
