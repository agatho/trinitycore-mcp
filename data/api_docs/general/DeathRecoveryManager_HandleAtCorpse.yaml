  brief: Processes corpse-related actions and updates for players who have died.
  description: The HandleAtCorpse method in DeathRecoveryManager is responsible for
    managing player death recovery mechanics, including updating corpse states, handling
    resurrection timers, and processing any pending death-related actions. This method
    is typically called during the game loop to ensure that dead players are properly
    managed according to World of Warcraft's death and resurrection rules. It handles
    cleanup of temporary data associated with player deaths and ensures that players
    can be resurrected or recovered within the appropriate time windows.

    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other updates...\n    sDeathRecoveryManager->HandleAtCorpse(diff);\n\
      \    // Other updates...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game loop with a time delta
    parameter that represents how much time has passed since the last update. It's
    important to ensure this method is called regularly to maintain proper death recovery
    state management.
