documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new EchoController instance with the specified EvokerAI owner.
  description: The EchoController constructor initializes a new EchoController object
    by associating it with an EvokerAI instance. This method sets up the internal
    state of the controller to manage echo-related AI behaviors for the evoker. The
    controller is designed to handle specific mechanics related to the evoker's echo
    abilities within the TrinityCore framework. This initialization typically occurs
    during the creation or setup phase of an evoker's AI system, ensuring that all
    echo-related functionality is properly linked to the owning AI instance.

  - title: Basic EchoController Initialization
    code: 'EvokerAI* evoker = new EvokerAI();

      EchoController controller(evoker);

      // Controller is now initialized with the evoker AI instance'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or memory allocation.
    It primarily stores a reference to the provided EvokerAI instance for later use
    in echo-related AI logic. The controller assumes that the owner parameter is valid
    and properly initialized.
