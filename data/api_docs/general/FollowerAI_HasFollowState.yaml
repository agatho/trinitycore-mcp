  signature: bool FollowerAI::HasFollowState(int uiFollowState) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the follower has a specific follow state set.
  description: The HasFollowState method determines whether a specific follow state
    flag is currently active for the follower AI. This method is used internally by
    the TrinityCore AI system to manage the state of NPC followers, such as whether
    they are following a player, waiting, or engaged in combat. It allows other systems
    to query the current behavioral state of the follower without directly accessing
    internal state variables. The method performs a bitwise check against the stored
    follow state flags.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified follow state flag is set; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if follower is in following state
    code: "if (followerAI->HasFollowState(FOLLOW_STATE_FOLLOW))\n{\n    // Follower\
      \ is currently following the player\n    // Perform follow-related actions\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional behavior based on follow state
    code: "if (!followerAI->HasFollowState(FOLLOW_STATE_MOVING))\n{\n    // Follower\
      \ is not moving, can initiate movement\n    followerAI->SetFollowState(FOLLOW_STATE_MOVING);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on a bitmask of follow states. The actual state flags
    are defined elsewhere in the FollowerAI implementation and typically include states
    like FOLLOW_STATE_FOLLOW, FOLLOW_STATE_MOVING, FOLLOW_STATE_COMBAT, etc. The method
    is const, so it does not modify any internal state.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only checks for a single follow state flag at
    a time. If multiple states need to be checked simultaneously, use bitwise operations
    or combine multiple HasFollowState calls. The method assumes that the follow state
    has been properly initialized and updated by the AI system.
