documentation:
  brief: Processes all active scripts associated with the map instance.
  description: The ScriptsProcess method iterates through and executes all registered
    script callbacks tied to the current map. This includes handling timed events,
    quest updates, and other scripted behaviors that are bound to the map's lifecycle.
    The method ensures that all pending script operations are executed in the correct
    order and at appropriate intervals. It is typically called during the map's update
    cycle to maintain dynamic world state changes.

  - title: Basic Script Processing Call
    code: "void UpdateMap()\n{\n    // Process all scripts for this map\n    map->ScriptsProcess();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within the game loop context where
    map updates occur. It's designed to be thread-safe as it operates on the map's
    own internal script queue.
