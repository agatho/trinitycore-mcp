  class: RBACPermission
  method: RemoveLinkedPermission
  signature: void RBACPermission::RemoveLinkedPermission(uint32 id)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a linked permission from the RBACPermission object by its unique
    identifier.
  description: The RemoveLinkedPermission method removes a specific permission link
    from the RBACPermission object using its unique identifier. This function is typically
    used in the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore authentication and authorization
    system, where permissions are managed through a role-based access control (RBAC)
    framework. The method ensures that the specified permission ID is no longer associated
    with the current permission object, effectively revoking access to that specific
    permission. It is important to note that this operation modifies the internal
    state of the RBACPermission object and should be used carefully in scenarios involving
    active permission checks or role assignments.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier of the permission to be removed from the linked
      permissions list. This ID must correspond to a valid permission registered within
      the RBAC system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a specific permission link
    code: 'RBACPermission* perm = new RBACPermission();

      // Assume some permissions are already linked

      perm->RemoveLinkedPermission(12345);

      // The permission with ID 12345 is now removed from the linked permissions'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal data structures of the RBACPermission object.
    It should be used with caution in multi-threaded environments where concurrent
    access to the same RBACPermission instance may occur. Ensure that proper synchronization
    mechanisms are in place if shared access is required.
  warnings: Removing a linked permission may affect active user roles or access control
    checks. Verify that removing the permission does not inadvertently break existing
    role assignments or cause unexpected access denials for users who rely on this
    permission.
