  class: LearningAnalytics
  method: StartExperiment
  signature: void LearningAnalytics::StartExperiment(const std::string & name, const
    std::string & configuration)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a new learning analytics experiment with the specified name and
    configuration.
  description: The StartExperiment method initializes a learning analytics experiment
    within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically used to begin data
    collection for player behavior analysis, skill acquisition tracking, or other
    educational metrics. The experiment is identified by a unique name and configured
    through a configuration string that may contain settings such as duration, data
    collection scope, or target player groups. The method does not return any value
    but sets up internal tracking mechanisms for the specified experiment. This functionality
    is part of the broader learning analytics system designed to support game-based
    learning research and player engagement studies.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A unique identifier string for the experiment. Must be non-empty
      and should follow naming conventions appropriate for the analytics system.
  - name: configuration
    description: A configuration string containing experiment parameters and settings.
      The format and content of this string depend on the specific implementation
      of the learning analytics framework.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Experiment Start
    code: LearningAnalytics::StartExperiment("player_skill_tracking", "duration=30min,scope=global");
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Experiment Configuration
    code: 'std::string config = "duration=60min,players=100-200,metrics=skill_progression,enabled=true";

      LearningAnalytics::StartExperiment("advanced_learning_analysis", config);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely creates internal data structures to track experiment state
    and may register the experiment with a central analytics manager. It's important
    to ensure that experiment names are unique to avoid conflicts in tracking. The
    configuration string parsing is expected to be handled internally by the framework.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the learning analytics
    system may result in undefined behavior or failed experiment registration. Ensure
    that the experiment name does not contain special characters that might interfere
    with internal tracking systems.
