documentation:
  brief: Removes outdated experience entries from the bot's learning model to maintain
    optimal data freshness.
  description: The CleanupOldExperiences method is responsible for purging stale or
    obsolete experience records from a BotLearningModel instance. This process ensures
    that the bot's learning data remains relevant and does not become bloated with
    outdated information that could negatively impact decision-making. The method
    typically evaluates each experience entry based on age, relevance, or usage frequency,
    and removes those that fall outside defined thresholds. It is commonly invoked
    during periodic maintenance routines or when the model reaches a certain size
    threshold to prevent performance degradation.
  parameters:
  - name: model
    description: Pointer to the BotLearningModel instance containing experience entries
      to be cleaned up. Must not be null; otherwise, the method will likely result
      in undefined behavior or crash.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BehaviorAdaptation adaptation;

      BotLearningModel* learningModel = new BotLearningModel();

      // ... populate learningModel with experience data ...

      adaptation.CleanupOldExperiences(learningModel);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Periodic Cleanup Routine
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateBehavior()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    if\
      \ (m_cleanupTimer <= 0)\n    {\n        m_adaptation.CleanupOldExperiences(m_learningModel);\n\
      \        m_cleanupTimer = CLEANUP_INTERVAL;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      \
      \  m_cleanupTimer--;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and efficient, typically operating
    in O(n) time complexity where n is the number of experience entries. It's recommended
    to call this method periodically rather than after every learning event to avoid
    performance overhead. The exact criteria for determining 'old' experiences may
    vary depending on implementation details such as time-based expiration or usage
    frequency.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the model parameter will likely cause a segmentation
    fault or access violation. Ensure that the BotLearningModel instance is properly
    initialized and valid before invoking this method. Additionally, calling this
    method while other threads are accessing the same model may lead to race conditions
    unless proper synchronization mechanisms are in place.
