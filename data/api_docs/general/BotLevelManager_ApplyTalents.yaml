api:
  class: BotLevelManager
  method: ApplyTalents
  signature: bool BotLevelManager::ApplyTalents(Player * bot, BotCreationTask * task)
documentation:
  brief: Applies talents to a bot character based on its creation task configuration.
  description: The ApplyTalents method is responsible for assigning appropriate talent
    points and selections to a bot player character according to the specified BotCreationTask.
    This method ensures that the bot's talent tree reflects the intended build as
    defined during the bot's creation process. It typically involves iterating through
    the bot's talent data, calculating required talent points, and applying those
    talents to the character's active talent trees. The method may also handle validation
    of talent selections against class restrictions and level requirements. This functionality
    is crucial for maintaining consistent and appropriate bot behavior in automated
    gameplay scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character that
      will receive the talents. Must be a valid player instance with initialized talent
      data.
  - name: task
    description: Pointer to the BotCreationTask object containing the talent configuration
      and build specifications for the bot. This defines which talents should be applied
      and how they should be distributed.
  returns: Returns true if the talents were successfully applied to the bot character,
    false otherwise. Failure may occur due to invalid parameters, insufficient talent
    points, or incompatible talent selections.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Talent Application
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Bot player instance\nBotCreationTask* task = ...;\
      \ // Creation task with talent data\nbool success = botLevelManager.ApplyTalents(bot,\
      \ task);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Talents applied successfully\n    LOG_INFO(\"\
      world\", \"Talents applied to bot {}\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling for Talent Application
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nBotCreationTask* task = ...;\nbool result = botLevelManager.ApplyTalents(bot,\
      \ task);\nif (!result)\n{\n    // Handle failure case\n    LOG_ERROR(\"world\"\
      , \"Failed to apply talents to bot {}\");\n    // Possibly retry or log error\
      \ for debugging\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot character is already created and has sufficient
    level and talent points available. The implementation may perform internal validation
    of talent selections against class restrictions and level requirements. It's recommended
    to ensure that the BotCreationTask contains valid talent data before calling this
    method.
  warnings: Calling this method on a bot without proper initialization or with invalid
    talent configurations may result in undefined behavior or incomplete talent application.
    Ensure that both parameters are valid and that the bot has sufficient resources
    (level, talent points) to accommodate the specified talents.
