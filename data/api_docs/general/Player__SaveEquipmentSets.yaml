documentation:
  brief: Saves the player's equipment sets to the database with optional transaction
    handling.
  description: This method saves the player's current equipment sets to the database,
    ensuring that all equipped items are properly stored and can be retrieved upon
    login. The method handles transaction management internally, allowing for safe
    database operations. It is typically called during player logout or when equipment
    set changes occur, ensuring that the player's equipment configuration is preserved
    across sessions. This method is part of the broader player save mechanism and
    should be invoked as needed to maintain data consistency.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->_SaveEquipmentSets(0);

      // Saves equipment sets without transaction'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method internally manages database transactions, making it thread-safe
    for database operations. It ensures that all equipment set data is properly saved
    and avoids potential data loss during player logout.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly in most cases; it's typically
    invoked by internal system methods during player logout or when equipment sets
    are modified. Improper usage may lead to unnecessary database writes or transaction
    issues.
