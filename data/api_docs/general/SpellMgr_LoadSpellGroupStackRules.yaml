  signature: void SpellMgr::LoadSpellGroupStackRules()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads spell group stack rules from the database into memory
    for spell management.
  description: The LoadSpellGroupStackRules method is responsible for loading spell
    group stack rule definitions from the database into the SpellMgr's internal data
    structures. These rules determine how spells that belong to the same group interact
    with each other in terms of stacking behavior, such as whether they can stack
    or if only the highest rank should remain active. This method is typically called
    during server startup or database reload operations to ensure that all spell group
    configurations are properly initialized and available for spell processing. It
    reads data from the spell_group_stack_rules table and populates internal lookup
    structures used by the spell system when evaluating spell interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeSpellSystem()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->LoadSpellGroupStackRules();\n\
      \    // Other spell initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server startup or database reload
    operations. It should only be called once per server lifecycle to avoid duplicate
    data loading. The method assumes that the database connection is already established
    and that the required tables exist with proper schema.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    memory leaks or duplicate entries in internal spell group structures. Do not invoke
    this method while active spell processing is occurring as it may cause race conditions.
