  class: EvokerAI
  method: IsInRange
  signature: bool EvokerAI::IsInRange(int * target, float range)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a target is within the specified range of the evoker.
  description: The IsInRange method determines whether a given target entity is within
    a defined distance from the evoker AI instance. This utility function is commonly
    used in spell casting and targeting logic to ensure that abilities are only cast
    on targets that are within acceptable range. The method performs a distance calculation
    between the evoker's current position and the target's position, comparing it
    against the provided range parameter. It returns true if the target is within
    range, false otherwise. This functionality is essential for maintaining proper
    gameplay mechanics and preventing invalid spell targeting.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or position
      data. This typically refers to a unit's GUID or position coordinates used for
      range calculations.
  - name: range
    description: Floating-point value specifying the maximum distance allowed between
      the evoker and the target. Values should be positive and represent the range
      in game units (typically yards or meters).
  returns: Boolean value indicating whether the target is within the specified range.
    Returns true if the target is within range, false if it's outside the range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Range Check
    code: "if (evokerAI->IsInRange(&targetGuid, 30.0f)) {\n    // Cast spell on target\n\
      \    evokerAI->CastSpell(targetGuid, SPELL_FIREBALL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Range Validation Before Ability Usage
    code: "Unit* target = evokerAI->GetVictim();\nif (target && evokerAI->IsInRange(&target->GetGUID(),\
      \ 25.0f)) {\n    // Execute ability only if target is in range\n    evokerAI->DoCast(target,\
      \ SPELL_CONE_OF_COLD);\n} else {\n    // Move closer or select another target\n\
      \    evokerAI->DoMoveTo(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely uses the standard TrinityCore distance calculation functions
    for accuracy. Performance is generally efficient as it involves simple mathematical
    operations, but frequent calls should be monitored in high-frequency AI logic.
    The target parameter may require valid GUID or position data to ensure accurate
    range calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid entity; otherwise,
    the behavior may be undefined. Be cautious when using large range values as they
    might impact performance or cause unexpected targeting behavior. The method assumes
    that both the evoker and target have valid positions in the world.
