  method: UpdatePersonalPhasesForPlayer
  signature: void Map::UpdatePersonalPhasesForPlayer(const Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Updates personal phase information for a player on the map.
  description: This method updates the phase tracking for a specific player within
    the map context, ensuring that the player's personal phase information is synchronized
    with the current map state. It typically involves checking and updating the player's
    phase mask based on their current location and the map's active phases. The method
    is crucial for maintaining proper game mechanics related to phase interactions,
    particularly in scenarios where players need to be aware of which phases are active
    for them. This function is often called during player movement or when entering/leaving
    specific areas.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A const pointer to the Player object whose phase information needs
      to be updated. This parameter represents the player whose personal phase tracking
      will be modified based on map conditions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void UpdatePersonalPhasesForPlayer(const Player * player)\n{\n    // Implementation\
      \ details\n}\n\n// Usage in a map context\nMap* map = GetMap();\nPlayer* player\
      \ = GetPlayer();\nmap->UpdatePersonalPhasesForPlayer(player);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during player movement or when entering/leaving
    specific zones. It may involve checking against map phase information and updating
    the player's phase mask accordingly. Performance considerations include avoiding
    unnecessary updates if the player's phase hasn't changed, which could be optimized
    by checking if the phase mask has actually changed before updating.
  warnings: Care should be taken when calling this method during player movement or
    teleportation, as improper handling can lead to incorrect phase tracking and potentially
    cause players to miss important game mechanics or quest events. This method should
    not be called in situations where player movement is already being processed by
    other systems.
