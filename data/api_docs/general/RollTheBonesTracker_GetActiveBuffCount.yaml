  method: GetActiveBuffCount
  signature: uint32 RollTheBonesTracker::GetActiveBuffCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of active buffs on the RollTheBonesTracker instance.
  description: The GetActiveBuffCount method retrieves the number of currently active
    buffs tracked by the RollTheBonesTracker. This tracker is typically used in World
    of Warcraft's Roll the Bones encounter mechanics, where players accumulate various
    buff effects that influence their gameplay performance. The method provides a
    simple way to query how many active buff effects are currently applied to the
    tracked entity. It does not modify any state and is purely informational. The
    return value represents a non-negative integer indicating the number of active
    buffs.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the count of active buffs currently tracked
    by this RollTheBonesTracker instance. Returns zero if no buffs are active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 activeBuffs = tracker->GetActiveBuffCount();\nif (activeBuffs >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Process active buffs\n    printf(\"Currently tracking %u active\
      \ buffs\\n\", activeBuffs);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Buff Management
    code: "RollTheBonesTracker* tracker = player->GetRollTheBonesTracker();\nuint32\
      \ currentCount = tracker->GetActiveBuffCount();\n\n// Example: Trigger special\
      \ behavior when more than 3 buffs are active\nif (currentCount >= 3)\n{\n  \
      \  // Apply additional effects or modify gameplay\n    player->AddAura(SPELL_ID_EXTRA_EFFECT,\
      \ player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other tracker methods to
    manage and query the state of active buffs during gameplay. It's important to
    note that this count may change dynamically as buffs are applied or removed. The
    method is thread-safe and can be called from any context where the tracker instance
    is accessible.
  warnings: While this method itself does not modify state, it should be used carefully
    in performance-critical code paths since frequent calls could impact frame rate
    if the underlying tracking mechanism is complex. Also, ensure that the RollTheBonesTracker
    instance is valid before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
