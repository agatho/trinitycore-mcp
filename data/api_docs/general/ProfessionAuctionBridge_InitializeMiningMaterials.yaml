  brief: Initializes the mining materials data for the profession auction bridge system
  description: The InitializeMiningMaterials method prepares and loads the necessary
    mining material data required for the profession auction system. This method is
    typically called during server initialization or when the auction house system
    is being set up to ensure that all mining-related items are properly registered
    and available for auction. The method likely populates internal data structures
    with information about ore types, their properties, and availability in the game
    world. It may also establish relationships between different mining materials
    and their corresponding crafting requirements or auction categories.

  returns: null

    code: 'ProfessionAuctionBridge bridge;

      bridge.InitializeMiningMaterials();'

  notes: This method should only be called once during system initialization. It's
    likely an internal method that shouldn't be invoked manually by other systems
    unless specifically required for data reloading purposes.
