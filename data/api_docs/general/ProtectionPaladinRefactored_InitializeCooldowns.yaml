documentation:
  brief: Initializes cooldowns for all abilities used by the Protection Paladin class.
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up and resets the cooldown timers
    for all applicable abilities and spells that a Protection Paladin can use. This
    method is typically called during the initialization phase of a Paladin's AI behavior
    or when entering a new combat scenario. It ensures that all cooldowns are properly
    configured to reflect the starting state of the character, preventing any unintended
    ability usage at the beginning of encounters. The method does not take any parameters
    and performs no direct return operations, as it solely manages internal cooldown
    states.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'ProtectionPaladinRefactored paladin;

      paladin.InitializeCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be invoked once during the initialization of a Protection
    Paladin AI instance to ensure accurate cooldown tracking. It is recommended that
    this method be called before any combat-related logic begins, as it directly affects
    spell availability and timing.
