  method: operator()
  signature: bool WorldObjectSpellTargetCheck::operator()(WorldObject * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether a given WorldObject meets the criteria for being a valid
    spell target.
  description: The operator() method of WorldObjectSpellTargetCheck is a predicate
    function used to determine if a specified WorldObject qualifies as a valid target
    for a spell. It performs checks based on various conditions such as target type,
    visibility, faction, and other game-specific rules that govern spell targeting.
    This method is typically invoked during spell casting to filter potential targets
    from a list of eligible objects in the vicinity. The implementation ensures that
    only appropriate targets are considered for spell effects, maintaining game balance
    and preventing invalid targeting scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the provided WorldObject meets all criteria for being a
    valid spell target; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Targeting
    code: "WorldObjectSpellTargetCheck targetCheck;\nWorldObject* target = ...; //\
      \ some object\nif (targetCheck(target)) {\n    // Proceed with spell effect\
      \ on target\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Filtering Targets in Spell Logic
    code: "std::vector<WorldObject*> validTargets;\nfor (auto& obj : nearbyObjects)\
      \ {\n    if (WorldObjectSpellTargetCheck()(obj)) {\n        validTargets.push_back(obj);\n\
      \    }\n}\n// Use validTargets for spell application"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's spell targeting system and integrates
    with the broader framework of spell validation. It may be overridden or specialized
    in derived classes to implement custom targeting logic. The performance of this
    check is critical during spell casting, as it's called frequently for each potential
    target.
  warnings: Ensure that the WorldObject pointer passed to this method is valid and
    not null, as dereferencing an invalid pointer will cause undefined behavior. This
    predicate should only be used in contexts where the object has been properly initialized
    and is within the game world.
