  class: DeathHookIntegration
  method: OnPlayerPostResurrection
  signature: void DeathHookIntegration::OnPlayerPostResurrection(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Executes post-resurrection logic for a player, typically used to perform
    cleanup or adjustments after a player has been resurrected.
  description: The OnPlayerPostResurrection method is invoked after a player character
    has completed the resurrection process in World of Warcraft. This hook allows
    developers to implement custom behavior such as restoring player stats, applying
    buffs, resetting cooldowns, or triggering quest events that should occur upon
    resurrection. The method is called within the context of the TrinityCore server's
    death system and provides access to the Player object immediately after resurrection
    has been processed. It does not interfere with the core resurrection mechanics
    but serves as a notification point for custom modules to react to the event.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object that has just been resurrected. This
      parameter is guaranteed to be valid and fully initialized at the time of the
      call.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resurrection Logic Implementation
    code: "void DeathHookIntegration::OnPlayerPostResurrection(Player* player)\n{\n\
      \    // Restore player's health and mana to full\n    player->SetHealth(player->GetMaxHealth());\n\
      \    player->SetPower(POWER_MANA, player->GetMaxPower(POWER_MANA));\n\n    //\
      \ Remove any resurrection-related debuffs\n    player->RemoveAura(12345); //\
      \ Example aura ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Resurrection Event Handling
    code: "void DeathHookIntegration::OnPlayerPostResurrection(Player* player)\n{\n\
      \    // Check if player was resurrected at a graveyard\n    if (player->GetMap()->IsBattlegroundOrArena())\n\
      \    {\n        // Apply special battleground resurrection effects\n       \
      \ player->CastSpell(player, 32704, true); // Resurrection sickness\n    }\n\
      \    else\n    {\n        // Normal resurrection logic\n        player->RemoveFlag(PLAYER_FLAGS,\
      \ PLAYER_FLAG_UNK_1);\n        player->SendNotification(\"You have been resurrected.\"\
      );\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called after all standard resurrection operations are complete.
    It's important to note that the player may still be in a temporary state (e.g.,
    under resurrection sickness) and should not be assumed to be fully restored to
    normal gameplay conditions. The method executes on the main server thread and
    should avoid long-running operations to prevent blocking other players or game
    updates.
  warnings: Avoid performing operations that modify the player's position or state
    in a way that could conflict with ongoing server processes. Do not attempt to
    re-resurrect a player from within this hook, as it may lead to recursion issues
    or undefined behavior. Be cautious when modifying player stats directly without
    considering existing buffs or debuffs.
