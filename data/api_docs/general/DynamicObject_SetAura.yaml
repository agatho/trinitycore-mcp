  class: DynamicObject
  method: SetAura
  signature: void DynamicObject::SetAura(Aura * aura)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns an aura to this dynamic object, linking it to the object's lifecycle
    and effects.
  description: The SetAura method associates a given Aura object with the DynamicObject
    instance. This allows the dynamic object to manage and apply the aura's effects,
    such as periodic damage, healing, or status modifications, over time. The aura's
    duration and application are tied to the dynamic object's existence, meaning that
    when the dynamic object is removed or expires, the associated aura will also be
    removed. This method is typically used internally by the core engine during spell
    casting and effect application, particularly for area-of-effect spells like fire
    walls, healing streams, or protective barriers.
  parameters:
  - name: aura
    description: A pointer to the Aura object that will be linked to this dynamic
      object. Must not be null. The aura's properties and effects will be applied
      through this dynamic object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting an Aura on a Dynamic Object
    code: 'DynamicObject* dynObj = ...; // Assume initialized

      Aura* aura = ...; // Assume initialized


      dynObj->SetAura(aura);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not validate whether the provided Aura is compatible with
    the DynamicObject's type or context. It is expected that the caller ensures proper
    compatibility before invoking this method. The aura will be automatically removed
    when the dynamic object is destroyed.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method may lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes. Always ensure the aura parameter is valid and properly initialized before
    calling SetAura.
