  class: FollowerAI
  method: UpdateFollowerAI
  signature: void FollowerAI::UpdateFollowerAI(int param0)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the follower AI behavior based on the provided parameter.
  description: The UpdateFollowerAI method is a core function in the FollowerAI class
    that handles the update logic for NPC followers within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method is typically called during each AI update cycle and processes the
    follower's behavior, including movement, combat actions, and interaction with
    the player. The parameter passed to this method usually represents a time delta
    or state identifier that influences how the follower should behave. It integrates
    with the broader AI system to ensure followers respond appropriately to player
    commands, environmental changes, and combat situations.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An integer parameter that typically represents a time delta in milliseconds
      or a state identifier. This value influences how the follower AI processes its
      current behavior and updates its internal state accordingly.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateFollowerAI Call
    code: "void BasicUpdate()\n{\n    // Called every frame or tick\n    m_followerAI->UpdateFollowerAI(100);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Update Loop
    code: "class MyFollowerAI : public FollowerAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override\n    {\n        if (HasFollowState(STATE_FOLLOWING))\n    \
      \    {\n            UpdateFollowerAI(diff);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within the AI update loop, and it's
    crucial that the parameter passed reflects accurate time deltas for smooth behavior.
    The implementation may vary depending on specific follower types (e.g., quest
    givers, combat followers) and their assigned behaviors.
  warnings: Improper handling of the parameter value can lead to erratic follower
    behavior or performance issues. Ensure that the parameter is always a valid positive
    integer representing a meaningful time delta.
