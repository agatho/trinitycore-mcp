documentation:
  brief: Returns the AI name string associated with the GameObject's current AI implementation.
  description: The GetAIName method retrieves the name of the AI script currently
    assigned to a GameObject instance. This method is used to identify which AI system
    is controlling the object, allowing developers to distinguish between different
    AI behaviors and implementations. The returned string typically corresponds to
    the AI script name defined in the database or configuration files, and can be
    used for debugging, logging, or conditional logic based on specific AI types.
    This method does not require any parameters and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a constant reference to a std::string containing the AI name assigned
    to this GameObject instance. The string may be empty if no AI has been assigned
    or if the AI name cannot be retrieved due to internal system limitations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "GameObject* go = ...;\nstd::string aiName = go->GetAIName();\nif (aiName.empty())\
      \ {\n    // No AI assigned\n}\nelse {\n    // AI is assigned, proceed with logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. It
    should not be used for performance-critical operations as it involves string copying,
    though the overhead is minimal. The method is primarily intended for debugging
    purposes or when implementing conditional logic based on AI type.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in performance-sensitive code; although
    the overhead is small, repeated calls can add up in high-frequency scenarios.
    Also note that if the GameObject has no AI assigned, an empty string will be returned,
    which may not be distinguishable from a valid AI name in some contexts.
