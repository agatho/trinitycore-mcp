  class: CombatReference
  method: SuppressFor
  signature: void CombatReference::SuppressFor(Unit * who)
documentation:
  brief: Suppresses combat engagement for the specified unit, preventing further combat
    interactions.
  description: The SuppressFor method is used to temporarily disable combat behavior
    for a given unit within the CombatReference system. This prevents the unit from
    engaging in combat actions or being targeted by other units during the suppression
    period. The method typically modifies internal flags or states that control whether
    a unit can participate in combat mechanics, such as attack targeting, threat generation,
    or damage application. It is commonly used in scenarios where a unit needs to
    be temporarily removed from active combat without fully removing it from the game
    world, such as during spell effects, movement restrictions, or temporary invulnerability
    states.
  parameters:
  - name: who
    description: Pointer to the Unit object for which combat suppression should be
      applied. Must not be null. The unit must be valid and currently in the game
      world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Suppressing Combat for a Target Unit
    code: 'Unit* target = ...; // Get a reference to a unit

      CombatReference* combatRef = ...; // Get a reference to the combat reference

      combatRef->SuppressFor(target); // Suppress combat for that unit'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a Spell Effect Context
    code: "void ApplySilenceEffect(Unit* caster, Unit* target)\n{\n    // Apply silence\
      \ effect logic here\n    CombatReference* combatRef = target->GetCombatReference();\n\
      \    if (combatRef)\n    {\n        combatRef->SuppressFor(target);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal combat state flags rather than directly
    altering the unit's behavior through external systems. It may be used in conjunction
    with other combat management methods to create temporary combat states. The suppression
    is typically not permanent and can be reverted by calling related methods such
    as 'Unsuppress' or similar.
  warnings: Ensure that the Unit pointer passed to this method is valid and not null,
    otherwise undefined behavior may occur. Improper use could lead to units remaining
    in an inconsistent combat state or causing unexpected combat interactions when
    suppression is lifted.
