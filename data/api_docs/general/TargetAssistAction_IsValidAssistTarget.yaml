    bot) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a target unit is valid for assistance in the context of
    AI behavior.
  description: The IsValidAssistTarget method evaluates whether a given Unit target
    is considered a valid candidate for assist behavior within the TrinityCore AI
    framework. This method checks various conditions such as target validity, faction
    alignment, threat status, and other game-specific constraints to determine if
    the bot should consider assisting the target. It is typically used by AI actions
    that involve supporting allies or targeting enemies based on specific criteria.
    The method ensures that bots do not attempt to assist invalid targets such as
    those that are dead, invisible, or outside of valid combat parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is being evaluated for assist validity.
      This represents the potential target that the AI might assist.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the AI-controlled bot performing
      the assist action. Used to determine context such as faction, current state,
      and behavior rules.
  returns: Returns true if the target is valid for assistance; otherwise returns false.
    A valid target must meet criteria such as being alive, within range, not neutral
    or hostile to the bot's faction, and not already under the bot's control.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (action->IsValidAssistTarget(target, bot)) {\n    // Proceed with assist\
      \ behavior\n    bot->SetTarget(target->GetGUID());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with target selection logic
    code: "Unit* bestTarget = nullptr;\nfor (auto& unit : bot->GetNearbyUnits()) {\n\
      \    if (action->IsValidAssistTarget(unit, bot) && (!bestTarget || unit->GetHealth()\
      \ < bestTarget->GetHealth())) {\n        bestTarget = unit;\n    }\n}\nif (bestTarget)\
      \ {\n    bot->Attack(bestTarget);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI action system and is commonly used in conjunction
    with other target selection logic. It may perform checks involving faction, health
    status, visibility, and threat levels. The implementation assumes that both target
    and bot are valid objects and does not perform null checks internally.
  warnings: Do not call this method without ensuring that both the target and bot
    pointers are valid; passing invalid pointers will result in undefined behavior.
    Additionally, this method may be used in performance-critical code paths, so avoid
    unnecessary computations within it.
