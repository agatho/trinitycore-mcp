  method: GetBorderStyle
  signature: uint32 EmblemInfo::GetBorderStyle() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the border style identifier for the emblem
  description: Returns the border style ID associated with the emblem information.
    This value determines how the emblem's border appears in the game interface, such
    as in guild banners or player avatars. The returned value corresponds to predefined
    border styles defined within the TrinityCore framework and is typically used to
    render visual elements correctly in the user interface.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the border style ID for the emblem. Valid values
    are determined by the game's internal border style definitions, typically ranging
    from 0 to several hundred depending on available styles.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'EmblemInfo emblem;

      uint32 borderStyle = emblem.GetBorderStyle();

      // Use borderStyle to determine how to render the emblem''s border'
    language: cpp
  - title: Rendering Emblems with Correct Borders
    code: "void RenderGuildEmblem(Guild* guild)\n{\n    EmblemInfo emblem = guild->GetEmblemInfo();\n\
      \    uint32 styleId = emblem.GetBorderStyle();\n    // Apply the border style\
      \ to render the guild emblem correctly\n    // Example: switch (styleId) { case\
      \ 1: RenderBorderStyle1(); break; ... }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the EmblemInfo class which encapsulates all visual
    properties of an emblem. The returned border style ID should be validated against
    known valid ranges before use to prevent rendering errors or invalid UI states.
  warnings: Ensure that the EmblemInfo object has been properly initialized before
    calling this method, as accessing uninitialized data may result in undefined behavior.
    Also, be aware that border style IDs might change between game versions and should
    not be hardcoded for long-term compatibility.
