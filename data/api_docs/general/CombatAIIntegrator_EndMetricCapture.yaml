  method: EndMetricCapture
  signature: void CombatAIIntegrator::EndMetricCapture(std::chrono::microseconds elapsed)
documentation:
  brief: Ends metric capture for combat AI and records elapsed time
  description: The EndMetricCapture method terminates the collection of performance
    metrics for the CombatAIIntegrator. It is typically called at the end of a combat-related
    operation to record how long the AI processing took. This method likely updates
    internal timing statistics or logs the duration for performance monitoring purposes.
    The method expects a std::chrono::microseconds parameter that represents the elapsed
    time since the start of metric capture, which is used to calculate and store performance
    data.
  parameters:
  - name: elapsed
    description: The amount of time that has passed since the start of metric capture,
      measured in microseconds. This value is used to record timing statistics for
      combat AI performance analysis.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat AI
    code: 'auto startTime = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      // ... perform combat AI logic ...

      auto endTime = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      std::chrono::microseconds elapsed = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(endTime
      - startTime);

      combatAIIntegrator.EndMetricCapture(elapsed);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a performance monitoring system within TrinityCore's
    AI framework. It should be called after starting metric capture with a corresponding
    BeginMetricCapture method to ensure accurate timing data.
