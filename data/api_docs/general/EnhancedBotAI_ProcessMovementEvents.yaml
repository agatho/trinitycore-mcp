  signature: void EnhancedBotAI::ProcessMovementEvents(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Processes movement-related events for enhanced bot AI behavior.
  description: The ProcessMovementEvents method handles all movement-related logic
    and state updates for bots within the EnhancedBotAI system. It evaluates current
    bot positions, target locations, and environmental factors to determine appropriate
    movement actions such as pathfinding, speed adjustments, or stopping conditions.
    This method is typically called during each AI update cycle to ensure bots respond
    dynamically to changes in their environment or assigned tasks. The method operates
    on a time-based delta value (diff) which represents the elapsed milliseconds since
    the last execution, allowing for smooth and consistent movement calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other AI logic\n    m_botAI->ProcessMovementEvents(diff);\n\
      \    // Continue with other updates\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called regularly from the main AI update loop.
    It's important that diff values are accurately passed to ensure proper timing
    of movement calculations. The method may internally handle path recalculation,
    collision avoidance, and speed adjustments based on terrain or combat state.
