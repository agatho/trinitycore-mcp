documentation:
  brief: Initiates a ready check for the group members
  description: The StartReadyCheck method begins a ready check process for all group
    members, typically used to verify that players are prepared for an upcoming event
    such as dungeon entry or raid encounter. It sends a ready check invitation to
    all group members and sets a timer for the specified duration. The method is usually
    invoked by a group leader or raid officer when they want to confirm that all players
    in the group are ready to proceed with an action. This mechanism helps coordinate
    group activities and ensures that no player starts an activity before others are
    prepared.
  parameters:
  - name: starterGuid
    description: The GUID of the player who initiated the ready check. This identifies
      which player started the check and is used to track the initiator.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in seconds for which the ready check will remain active.
      Players must respond within this time frame for the check to be valid.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Ready Check Initiation
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->StartReadyCheck(player->GetGUID().GetCounter(),\
      \ 30);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Ready Check with Leader Permission
    code: "Player* leader = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(group->GetLeaderGUID());\n\
      if (leader && leader == player)\n{\n    group->StartReadyCheck(player->GetGUID().GetCounter(),\
      \ 45);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method triggers a network message to all group members, so it should
    be used judiciously to avoid unnecessary network traffic. The ready check duration
    is typically set between 30-60 seconds depending on the context. The method does
    not validate whether the starter is actually in the group or has permission to
    start checks.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper group validation may result in invalid
    ready checks being sent to players who are not part of the group. It's important
    to ensure that only authorized players (such as group leaders) can initiate ready
    checks, otherwise it could lead to confusion or abuse.
