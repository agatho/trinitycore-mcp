  class: Player
  method: GetSkillStepByPos
  signature: uint16 Player::GetSkillStepByPos(uint32 pos) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the skill step value at the specified position in the player's skill
    list.
  description: This method retrieves the skill step value associated with a specific
    position in the player's skill list. The skill step represents the current level
    of a skill, typically used for tracking progression and advancement in various
    skills such as professions or abilities. It is commonly used in conjunction with
    other skill-related methods to manage player skill data within the TrinityCore
    framework. The method operates on the player's internal skill list structure,
    which may include multiple skill entries at different positions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the skill step value as a uint16, representing the current skill
    level at the specified position. This value can be zero or higher, with zero indicating
    no skill progression or an unlearned skill.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint16 skillStep = player->GetSkillStepByPos(0);

      // Returns the skill step of the first skill in the player''s skill list'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other skill-related methods
    like GetSkillValue or GetSkillRank to fully understand a player's skill progression.
    It should be noted that the position parameter refers to an index within the internal
    skill list, not necessarily the actual skill ID.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it may return zero if no
    skill exists at the specified position, which could lead to incorrect assumptions
    about skill levels or progression.
