  class: OutdoorPvP
  method: HandlePlayerEnterZone
  signature: void OutdoorPvP::HandlePlayerEnterZone(Player * player, int zone)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a player enters a specific zone in an OutdoorPvP area.
  description: The HandlePlayerEnterZone method is invoked when a Player object enters
    a designated zone that is part of an OutdoorPvP (Outdoor Player vs Player) system.
    This method typically performs actions such as updating the player's PvP state,
    triggering zone-specific events, applying buffs or debuffs, and managing the player's
    relationship with the surrounding OutdoorPvP territory. It ensures that the player's
    presence in the zone aligns with the current PvP mechanics of the area, including
    potential faction changes, quest updates, or territorial control modifications.
    The method is usually called by the core game loop or zone change handlers.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object who has entered the zone. Must not be
      null.
  - name: zone
    description: The zone ID that the player has entered. This value corresponds to
      a specific OutdoorPvP zone defined in the game's configuration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in custom OutdoorPvP handler
    code: "void MyOutdoorPvP::HandlePlayerEnterZone(Player* player, uint32 zone)\n\
      {\n    // Update player's PvP status\n    player->SetPvP(true);\n    // Apply\
      \ faction-specific buffs\n    if (player->GetTeamId() == TEAM_ALLIANCE)\n  \
      \      player->AddAura(SPELL_ALLIANCE_BUFF, player);\n    else\n        player->AddAura(SPELL_HORDE_BUFF,\
      \ player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during zone transition events and should
    not be used to perform heavy computations or database operations. It's recommended
    to defer complex logic to a separate task queue if needed.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before using it; passing a null
    pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also, avoid modifying the player's
    state directly without checking for existing conditions to prevent conflicts with
    other systems.
