documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current map is a Mythic+ dungeon.
  description: This method checks if the current map instance is a Mythic+ dungeon,
    which is a special type of dungeon in World of Warcraft that features heroic difficulty
    with additional challenges and rewards. The method returns true if the map is
    a Mythic+ dungeon and false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for determining
    whether players are entering a dungeon with special difficulty settings that offer
    enhanced rewards and challenges compared to normal dungeons. The method can be
    used to filter or identify specific content types within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map is a Mythic+ dungeon, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the current map instance has the special difficulty settings associated
    with Mythic+ content.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (map->IsMythicPlus()) {\n    // Handle Mythic+ dungeon logic\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely checks the map''s difficulty
    type or uses internal flags to determine if it''s a Mythic+ instance. Performance
    considerations: The method should be lightweight and fast as it''s used in many
    game logic scenarios, particularly when checking player eligibility for content.
    Thread safety: This method is thread-safe as it only reads from existing map data
    without modifying it.'
  warnings: 'This method may not return true for all instances of Mythic+ content,
    as some maps might be classified differently based on their specific implementation
    or game version. Common mistake: Using this method to determine if a player can
    enter a dungeon without checking other conditions like level requirements or group
    composition.'
