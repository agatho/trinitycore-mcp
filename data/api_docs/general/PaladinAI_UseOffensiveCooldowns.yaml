documentation:
  brief: Executes offensive cooldown abilities for the paladin AI.
  description: The UseOffensiveCooldowns method is responsible for managing and executing
    offensive cooldown abilities within the PaladinAI class. This method evaluates
    the current state of the paladin's cooldowns and determines which offensive abilities
    should be used based on game mechanics, target conditions, and strategic considerations.
    It typically integrates with the AI's decision-making process to optimize damage
    output or threat generation during combat encounters. The method does not take
    any parameters and performs its actions directly on the AI-controlled paladin
    unit.

    code: "void PaladinAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (UpdateVictim())\n   \
      \ {\n        UseOffensiveCooldowns();\n        // Other combat logic\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI's update cycle, often in conjunction
    with other combat-related methods like UpdateVictim() or DoMeleeAttackIfReady().
    The implementation likely checks for cooldown readiness and target validity before
    executing any offensive abilities. Developers should be aware that this method
    may have specific conditions under which it will not execute, such as when the
    paladin is stunned or silenced.
