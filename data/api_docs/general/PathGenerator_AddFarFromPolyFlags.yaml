  class: PathGenerator
  method: AddFarFromPolyFlags
  signature: void PathGenerator::AddFarFromPolyFlags(bool startFarFromPoly, bool endFarFromPoly)
documentation:
  brief: Sets flags indicating whether the start and end points of a path are far
    from polygons.
  description: The AddFarFromPolyFlags method configures internal flags within the
    PathGenerator class to indicate whether the starting or ending point of a generated
    path is located far from any polygon in the navigation mesh. This information
    can be used by the pathfinding algorithm to adjust its behavior, such as applying
    different cost calculations or avoidance strategies when dealing with points that
    are distant from navigable geometry. The method does not perform any immediate
    path calculation but prepares state for subsequent path generation operations.
  parameters:
  - name: startFarFromPoly
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the start point of the path is
      considered far from polygons in the navigation mesh.
  - name: endFarFromPoly
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the end point of the path is considered
      far from polygons in the navigation mesh.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Start and End Flags
    code: 'PathGenerator pathGen;

      pathGen.AddFarFromPolyFlags(true, false); // Start is far from poly, end is
      not'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Both Points as Far From Polygons
    code: 'PathGenerator pathGen;

      pathGen.AddFarFromPolyFlags(true, true); // Both start and end are far from
      polygons'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other pathfinding configuration
    methods to fine-tune behavior for specific navigation scenarios. It's important
    to understand that setting these flags does not directly affect the path generation
    itself, but rather provides context for how the pathfinder should interpret the
    start and end positions.
  warnings: Ensure that the flags are set appropriately before calling path generation
    functions. Incorrect flag settings may lead to unexpected pathfinding behavior
    or performance degradation when the pathfinder tries to navigate around distant
    points.
