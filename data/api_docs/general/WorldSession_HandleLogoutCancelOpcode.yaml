  brief: Handles the client's request to cancel a pending logout sequence
  description: The HandleLogoutCancelOpcode method processes the LogoutCancel packet
    sent by the client when a player wishes to abort an ongoing logout process. This
    typically occurs after a player has initiated a logout but then decides to remain
    logged in. The method cancels the logout timer and ensures the player's session
    remains active, preventing the character from being removed from the world. It
    is part of the core session management system that handles various player state
    transitions including login, logout, and session interruptions.

  - title: Basic Logout Cancel Handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleLogoutCancelOpcode(WorldPackets::Character::LogoutCancel&\
      \ logoutCancel)\n{\n    // Cancel the pending logout\n    if (Player* player\
      \ = GetPlayer())\n    {\n        player->GetSession()->CancelLogout();\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the logout sequence when a player
    clicks 'Cancel' on the logout confirmation screen. The implementation should ensure
    that no further logout-related actions are performed after this point, and the
    player's state is properly restored to an active session.
