  class: Pet
  method: SetSpecialization
  signature: void Pet::SetSpecialization(uint16 spec)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the specialization ID for the pet, updating its abilities and stats
    accordingly.
  description: The SetSpecialization method assigns a specific specialization ID to
    a Pet object, which determines the pet's abilities, talents, and stat modifiers.
    This method is typically used when a player changes their pet's specialization
    or when initializing a pet with a predefined specialization. The specialization
    ID corresponds to the pet's role within the game such as Beast Mastery, Marksmanship,
    or Survival for hunter pets. This update affects the pet's behavior in combat
    and its available skill set. The method does not validate the spec ID against
    valid specializations; it directly applies the provided value.
  parameters:
  - name: spec
    description: The specialization ID to assign to the pet. Valid values are typically
      defined by the game's specialization system and correspond to specific pet roles
      or builds.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Assigning a Beast Mastery Specialization
    code: 'Pet* myPet = player->GetPet();

      myPet->SetSpecialization(57); // Beast Mastery specialization ID'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Pet Specialization Based on Player Choice
    code: "uint16 chosenSpec = GetPlayerSpecFromUI();\nPet* pet = player->GetPet();\n\
      if (pet)\n{\n    pet->SetSpecialization(chosenSpec);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the pet's specialization without performing
    validation. It is recommended to validate the spec ID against known valid values
    before calling this method. The change takes effect immediately, but may require
    UI updates or reinitialization of pet abilities depending on how the game handles
    specialization changes.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or unsupported specialization ID may
    result in undefined behavior or visual inconsistencies in the pet's abilities.
    Ensure that the spec parameter corresponds to a valid specialization before calling
    this function.
