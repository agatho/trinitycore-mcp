documentation:
  brief: Updates the position of a game object model in the collision system
  description: The UpdatePosition method synchronizes the current world position and
    orientation of a GameObjectModel with the collision detection system. This ensures
    that the model's bounding volume accurately represents its current location in
    the game world, which is essential for proper collision detection and navigation.
    The method typically gets called whenever a game object moves or rotates to maintain
    up-to-date spatial data for the collision system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the position update was successful and the model's collision
    data was properly updated; returns false if the update failed, which may occur
    if the model is not properly initialized or if there are issues with the collision
    system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Position Update
    code: "GameObjectModel* model = ...;\nif (model->UpdatePosition()) {\n    // Position\
      \ successfully updated\n} else {\n    // Handle update failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Position Update with Error Handling
    code: "GameObjectModel* model = GetGameObjectModel();\nif (!model) {\n    return;\n\
      }\n\nbool success = model->UpdatePosition();\nif (success) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with collision checks or other operations\n} else {\n    // Log error or attempt\
      \ reinitialization\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to update GameObjectModel position\
      \ for object ID: %u\", model->GetOwner()->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the game engine when GameObject
    positions change, but may also be invoked manually in special cases. The method
    performs a full update of the model's spatial data including bounding box calculations
    and potentially updates internal collision tree structures.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or destroyed GameObjectModel can
    lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the model is valid before calling this
    method, especially in multithreaded environments where concurrent access to game
    object data might occur.
