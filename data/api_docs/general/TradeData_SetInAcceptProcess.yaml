documentation:
  brief: Sets the trade acceptance processing state for the player's trade data.
  description: The SetInAcceptProcess method updates the internal state flag that
    indicates whether a player is currently in the process of accepting a trade offer.
    This flag is used internally by the TrinityCore trading system to manage trade
    states and prevent invalid operations during trade negotiations. When set to true,
    it typically signifies that the player has initiated or is in the process of confirming
    a trade agreement, while false indicates normal trade state or completion of the
    acceptance process.

  examples:
  - title: Setting Trade Acceptance State
    code: 'TradeData* tradeData = player->GetTradeData();

      tradeData->SetInAcceptProcess(true);

      // Indicates that the player is now accepting a trade offer'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the trading system and should
    not typically be called directly by external code. The state change affects internal
    trade validation logic and may influence how subsequent trade operations are processed.
