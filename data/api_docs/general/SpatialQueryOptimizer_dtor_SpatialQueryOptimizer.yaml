documentation:
  brief: Destroys the SpatialQueryOptimizer instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the SpatialQueryOptimizer class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the object's lifetime. This method ensures proper resource deallocation when the
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft server implementation, this class likely manages spatial data
    structures for efficient query operations such as finding nearby game objects
    or players within a certain radius. The destructor typically handles cleanup of
    internal containers, caches, or temporary data structures that may have been built
    during the object's usage.

  - title: Basic destruction of SpatialQueryOptimizer instance
    code: 'SpatialQueryOptimizer* optimizer = new SpatialQueryOptimizer();

      // ... use the optimizer ...

      delete optimizer; // This calls the destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should be called automatically when the object is destroyed.
    Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless performing explicit
    memory management. The implementation likely includes cleanup of internal data
    structures such as spatial partitioning trees or hash tables used for optimizing
    spatial queries.
