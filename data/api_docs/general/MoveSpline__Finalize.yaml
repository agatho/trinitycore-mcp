documentation:
  brief: Finalizes the movement spline, completing any pending operations and cleaning
    up internal state.
  description: The MoveSpline::_Finalize method is responsible for concluding the
    execution of a movement spline by performing necessary cleanup operations. It
    ensures that all pending spline-related tasks are completed, internal state is
    properly reset, and resources are released. This method is typically invoked when
    a character's movement needs to be terminated or when transitioning between different
    movement states. The operation is crucial for maintaining synchronization between
    the client and server regarding character positions and movement animations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Finalization Call
    code: 'MoveSpline* spline = player->GetMoveSpline();

      spline->_Finalize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the movement spline is no longer needed
    or when explicitly required to finalize ongoing movement operations. It's typically
    used internally by the TrinityCore movement system and shouldn't generally be
    invoked directly unless implementing custom movement logic.
  warnings: Calling _Finalize on an already finalized spline may lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure that all references to the spline are properly managed before
    calling this method.
