documentation:
  brief: Returns the last rank spell in the spell chain for a given spell.
  description: This method retrieves the final spell in a spell's hierarchical chain,
    which typically represents the highest-level spell that can be learned from a
    given spell. The returned spell is usually the last rank in a sequence of spells
    that share the same base name but differ in level or effect. This functionality
    is essential for determining spell progression and understanding spell mechanics
    within the TrinityCore framework. It helps identify when a player has reached
    the maximum rank of a spell, which is crucial for gameplay balance and progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the SpellInfo structure representing the last rank
    spell in the spell chain. If no such spell exists or if the spell does not belong
    to a chain, this method may return nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "const SpellInfo* lastRankSpell = spellInfo->GetLastRankSpell();\nif (lastRankSpell\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process the last rank spell\n    std::cout << \"Last\
      \ rank spell ID: \" << lastRankSpell->Id << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during spell processing and validation within
    TrinityCore's spell system. It relies on internal spell data structures to determine
    the chain hierarchy, making it important for developers to understand how spells
    are organized in the database. Performance-wise, this method should be relatively
    fast as it only involves pointer dereferencing and basic comparisons.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method because not all spells have
    a defined chain structure. Some spells might return nullptr if they are not part
    of a spell progression or if their last rank has not been properly defined in
    the database. Additionally, developers should ensure that the spell being queried
    actually exists before calling this method.
