  method: ActivateVoidform
  signature: void VoidformTracker::ActivateVoidform()
documentation:
  brief: Activates the voidform state for the player, enabling void-based abilities
    and mechanics.
  description: The ActivateVoidform method transitions the player into the voidform
    state, which is typically used by Shadow Priests to enable powerful void-based
    spells and abilities. This method likely modifies the player's aura state, updates
    their spell cooldowns, and adjusts their combat behavior to reflect the voidform
    transformation. The activation may also trigger visual effects and sound cues
    to indicate the change in form. This method should only be called when the player
    is eligible to enter voidform, typically requiring specific prerequisites such
    as having the appropriate talent or being in a valid combat state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "VoidformTracker* tracker = player->GetVoidformTracker();\nif (tracker)\n\
      {\n    tracker->ActivateVoidform();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the game engine when a player's
    voidform ability is triggered, but may also be called directly for special circumstances
    or testing. The implementation likely involves setting internal flags and updating
    the player's state machine.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper preconditions may result in undefined
    behavior or client-server desynchronization. Ensure that the player meets all
    requirements before activation.
