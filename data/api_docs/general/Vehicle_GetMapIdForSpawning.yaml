  method: GetMapIdForSpawning
  signature: int32 Vehicle::GetMapIdForSpawning() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the map identifier where the vehicle should be spawned.
  description: The GetMapIdForSpawning method returns the map ID associated with the
    current vehicle's spawning location. This value is used by the game engine to
    determine which map instance the vehicle should be loaded into during initialization
    or respawn events. The returned map ID typically corresponds to a valid map entry
    in the game's map database, ensuring that vehicles are correctly placed within
    the appropriate world environment. This method is commonly invoked when vehicles
    are created, summoned, or respawned to ensure proper spatial context and world
    state management.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int32 value representing the map identifier where the vehicle should
    be spawned. A valid map ID corresponds to an existing map in the game world; a
    negative value or zero may indicate an invalid or uninitialized spawn map.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Vehicle* vehicle = player->GetVehicle();\nint32 mapId = vehicle->GetMapIdForSpawning();\n\
      if (mapId > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with spawning logic using the retrieved map\
      \ ID\n    sLog->outString(\"Vehicle will spawn on map: %d\", mapId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal vehicle state tracking and should only be
    called after the vehicle has been properly initialized. The returned map ID may
    vary depending on the vehicle's current location, faction, or other contextual
    factors.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or invalid vehicle instance may
    result in undefined behavior or incorrect map IDs. Ensure that the vehicle object
    is valid before invoking this method.
