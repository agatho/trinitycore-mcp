  method: LoadRaidSpells
  signature: void InterruptDatabase::LoadRaidSpells()
documentation:
  brief: Loads raid spell interrupt data from the database into memory for use during
    gameplay.
  description: The LoadRaidSpells method initializes and populates internal data structures
    with spell interrupt information retrieved from the TrinityCore database. This
    method is typically called during server startup or database reload operations
    to ensure that raid-related spell interruption mechanics are properly configured.
    It processes entries from the 'raid_spells' table (or similar) which define which
    spells can interrupt others in raid environments, including cooldowns, mana costs,
    and required conditions for successful interruption. The loaded data is used by
    the core combat system to validate and process spell interrupts during player
    and NPC actions.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'InterruptDatabase interruptDB;

      interruptDB.LoadRaidSpells(); // Called once during server startup'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the database connection is established
    and valid. It's typically invoked by the core server initialization sequence or
    through database reload commands. The method assumes that the underlying database
    tables contain properly formatted raid spell data.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate entries or memory leaks. Ensure that any existing raid spell data is
    cleared before reloading to prevent inconsistent behavior during combat.
