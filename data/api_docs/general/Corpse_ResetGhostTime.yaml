documentation:
  brief: Resets the ghost time for a corpse, clearing its ghost state and making it
    eligible for normal corpse decay.
  description: The ResetGhostTime method clears the ghost state of a Corpse object,
    effectively removing any time-based restrictions or flags that prevent the corpse
    from decaying normally. This method is typically invoked when a player's spirit
    returns to their body or when a ghost is revived, ensuring that the corpse can
    proceed through its normal decay process without being stuck in a ghostly state.
    The method does not alter the corpse's physical appearance or data but resets
    internal timers and flags related to the ghost state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset ghost time for a corpse after player resurrection
    code: "Corpse* corpse = player->GetCorpse();\nif (corpse)\n{\n    corpse->ResetGhostTime();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the core when a ghost is revived
    or when a player's spirit returns to their body. It does not directly affect the
    corpse's visual appearance but modifies internal flags that control its behavior
    during decay.
