  brief: Moves an AuctionHouseObject instance to another, transferring ownership of
    its resources
  description: The move assignment operator for AuctionHouseObject transfers all resources
    from the source object to the current object, leaving the source in a valid but
    unspecified state. This operation is typically used to efficiently transfer ownership
    of auction house data without performing deep copies. In the context of TrinityCore's
    auction house system, this method allows for efficient resource management when
    handling auction listings, bids, and related data structures during gameplay operations
    such as listing items, processing auctions, or cleaning up expired auctions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current AuctionHouseObject instance after the move assignment
    has completed, enabling chained assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'AuctionHouseObject auction1;

      AuctionHouseObject auction2 = std::move(auction1); // Move assignment

      // auction1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Moving Auction Objects in Container
    code: 'std::vector<AuctionHouseObject> auctions;

      AuctionHouseObject newAuction;

      auctions.push_back(std::move(newAuction)); // Move into container

      // newAuction is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator performs a move operation rather than a copy, making it much
    more efficient for large objects. The source object after move assignment should
    not be used until assigned again, as its state becomes undefined but still valid
    for destruction.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after move assignment can lead to undefined
    behavior. Always ensure that the source object is not accessed or used in any
    way after a move operation unless it's reassigned.
