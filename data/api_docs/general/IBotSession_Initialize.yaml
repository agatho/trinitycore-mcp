  class: IBotSession
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool IBotSession::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot session, setting up required resources and configurations
    for bot operation.
  description: The Initialize method prepares an IBotSession instance for use by performing
    essential setup operations such as allocating memory, initializing internal data
    structures, and configuring session parameters. This method must be called before
    any other session operations can be performed. It ensures that the bot is in a
    valid state to interact with the game world and execute commands. The initialization
    process may involve connecting to necessary systems, loading configuration files,
    or preparing communication channels with the TrinityCore server.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initialization was successful and all required resources
    were properly allocated; returns false if any error occurred during setup, such
    as resource allocation failure or invalid configuration data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: "IBotSession* session = new BotSession();\nif (session->Initialize()) {\n\
      \    // Session initialized successfully\n    std::cout << \"Bot session initialized\
      \ successfully.\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n\
      \    std::cerr << \"Failed to initialize bot session.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per session instance. Subsequent calls
    may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks. The method is typically non-blocking
    but may perform I/O operations during initialization.
  warnings: Do not call other session methods before Initialize() has completed successfully.
    Failure to initialize properly can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior when
    attempting to use the bot.
