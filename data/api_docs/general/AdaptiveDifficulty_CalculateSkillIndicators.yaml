  signature: SkillIndicators AdaptiveDifficulty::CalculateSkillIndicators(Player *
    player) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns skill indicators for a player based on their current
    progression and difficulty settings.
  description: The CalculateSkillIndicators method computes a set of skill-related
    metrics for a given player within the AdaptiveDifficulty system. These indicators
    are used to dynamically adjust the challenge level of content such as dungeons
    or raids based on the player's performance and capabilities. The method takes
    into account various factors including player level, gear score, achievement progress,
    and previous encounter performance to determine an appropriate difficulty scaling
    factor. This calculation is essential for maintaining balanced gameplay experiences
    across different player skill levels in TrinityCore's adaptive difficulty framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a SkillIndicators structure containing calculated metrics such
    as player proficiency, gear effectiveness, and performance baseline that inform
    the adaptive difficulty system about the player's current capabilities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      AdaptiveDifficulty diffSystem;

      SkillIndicators indicators = diffSystem.CalculateSkillIndicators(player);

      // Use indicators to adjust difficulty settings'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during encounter initialization or when recalculating
    difficulty modifiers. The calculation may involve multiple subsystems including
    player stats, item database lookups, and achievement tracking. Performance impact
    should be minimal as calculations are cached internally.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. The returned SkillIndicators structure
    should not be modified directly as it's managed by the AdaptiveDifficulty system.
