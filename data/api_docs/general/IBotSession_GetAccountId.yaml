  class: IBotSession
  method: GetAccountId
  signature: uint32 IBotSession::GetAccountId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique account identifier associated with the bot session.
  description: The GetAccountId method returns the numeric identifier (uint32) that
    uniquely identifies the account to which the bot session is linked. This identifier
    is typically used for database lookups, authentication checks, and managing player-specific
    data within the TrinityCore framework. The method does not perform any validation
    or additional operations; it simply retrieves and returns the stored account ID
    value. It is commonly used in bot management systems where session-based account
    tracking is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the unique account identifier (GUID)
    for the bot session's associated account. This value corresponds to the 'id' field
    in the 'account' table of the TrinityCore database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 accountId = botSession->GetAccountId();\nif (accountId > 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Proceed with account-specific operations\n    std::cout << \"Account\
      \ ID: \" << accountId << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Account ID for Database Query
    code: "uint32 accountId = botSession->GetAccountId();\nPlayer* player = sObjectAccessor->FindPlayerByLowGUID(accountId);\n\
      if (player)\n{\n    // Perform operations on the player object\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      Bot session active for account %u\", accountId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter and should not have performance implications.
    It is thread-safe as long as the IBotSession instance itself is accessed in a
    thread-safe manner. The returned value is typically set during session initialization
    and should remain constant throughout the session's lifetime.
  warnings: Ensure that the IBotSession pointer is valid before calling this method,
    as calling it on a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also note that
    account IDs of zero may indicate an uninitialized or invalid session state.
