  class: BattlegroundScript
  method: UpdateWorldState
  signature: void BattlegroundScript::UpdateWorldState(int worldStateId, int value,
    bool hidden) const
documentation:
  brief: Updates a world state value for all players in the battleground, optionally
    hiding it from the UI.
  description: The UpdateWorldState method is used to modify a specific world state
    variable within a battleground. World states are client-side variables that control
    various visual elements such as score displays, timers, or objective indicators.
    This method sends an update packet to all players currently in the battleground,
    allowing real-time changes to be reflected in the UI. The hidden parameter determines
    whether the world state is displayed to players (false) or hidden from view (true).
    This functionality is commonly used for updating scores, capturing objectives,
    or displaying countdown timers during battleground events.
  parameters:
  - name: worldStateId
    description: The unique identifier of the world state variable to update. This
      ID corresponds to predefined world state constants used in the game client and
      must be a valid registered world state identifier.
  - name: value
    description: The new integer value to assign to the specified world state. This
      value is typically used to represent scores, counts, or other numeric indicators
      displayed in the UI.
  - name: hidden
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the world state should be hidden
      from player view (true) or visible (false). When true, the world state will
      not be displayed in the UI but can still be accessed programmatically.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update Score Display
    code: UpdateWorldState(WORLD_STATE_ALLIANCE_SCORE, 5, false); // Updates alliance
      score to 5 and shows it
    language: cpp
  - title: Hide Objective Timer
    code: UpdateWorldState(WORLD_STATE_TIMER, 0, true); // Hides the timer by setting
      it to 0 and hiding it
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on a per-battleground basis and only affects players
    currently participating in that battleground. It's important to ensure that world
    state IDs are properly defined and registered before calling this function, otherwise
    the update may not be reflected correctly in the client. The method is typically
    called from battleground event handlers or periodic update functions.
  warnings: Calling UpdateWorldState with invalid worldStateId values can cause undefined
    behavior or client-side errors. Always validate world state identifiers against
    known constants. Additionally, frequent updates to world states can impact performance
    if done excessively during high-frequency events.
