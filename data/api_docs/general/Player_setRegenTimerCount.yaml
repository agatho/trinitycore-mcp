  class: Player
  method: setRegenTimerCount
  signature: void Player::setRegenTimerCount(uint32 time)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's regen timer count to the specified time value.
  description: This method configures the player's regen timer count, which controls
    how long the player will wait before regenerating mana or health. The timer count
    is typically used in conjunction with the player's regen state to determine when
    regeneration occurs. This method affects the internal timer state of the player
    and can be used to control regeneration timing for various game mechanics such
    as mana regeneration, health regeneration, or other resource-based regeneration
    systems.
  parameters:
  - name: time
    description: The time value in milliseconds to set the regen timer count to. This
      represents how long the player will wait before regenerating resources.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Regen Timer Count Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->setRegenTimerCount(5000);

      // Sets the regen timer to 5 seconds'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects internal player state management and should
    be used carefully as it may influence regeneration timing. The timer count is
    typically managed by the game engine and can be modified through this method for
    specific gameplay effects.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause unexpected behavior in resource
    regeneration, especially if not properly synchronized with other regen-related
    methods or game mechanics.
