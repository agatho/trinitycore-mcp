  method: HandleAoEHealing
  signature: bool HolyPriestRefactored::HandleAoEHealing(const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Performs area-of-effect healing on a specified group of allies
  description: The HandleAoEHealing method executes an area-of-effect healing spell
    for the Holy Priest class, targeting a designated group of friendly units within
    range. This method calculates and applies healing over time or instantaneous healing
    based on the priest's current mana and spell power. It ensures that only valid
    targets are healed, respecting the game's targeting rules and maintaining proper
    spell cooldowns. The method returns true if the healing was successfully applied
    to at least one target, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The identifier of the group or set of allies to be healed. This value
      typically corresponds to a group index or a specific target group ID used by
      the TrinityCore AI system.
  returns: Returns true if at least one valid target was healed successfully, false
    otherwise. The method may return false if no targets are found within range, if
    the priest lacks sufficient mana, or if the spell is on cooldown.
  examples:
  - title: Basic AOE Healing Usage
    code: "if (priest->HandleAoEHealing(1)) {\n    // Successfully healed group 1\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Holy Priest healed group 1 successfully\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Healing failed\n    sLog->outString(\"Holy Priest healing failed for\
      \ group 1\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: AOE Healing with Error Handling
    code: "int targetGroup = GetTargetGroup();\nif (targetGroup >= 0 && targetGroup\
      \ < MAX_GROUPS) {\n    if (priest->HandleAoEHealing(targetGroup)) {\n      \
      \  // Healing successful\n        SendHealMessage(\"AOE Heal applied to group\"\
      , targetGroup);\n    } else {\n        // Healing failed due to no targets or\
      \ resource constraints\n        SendErrorMessage(\"AOE Heal failed for group\"\
      , targetGroup);\n    }\n} else {\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid target group\
      \ specified\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI's decision-making cycle in
    TrinityCore. It assumes that the priest has already validated the spell's readiness
    and that the group parameter refers to a valid set of targets within the spell's
    range. The healing effect may be influenced by factors such as target proximity,
    spell modifiers, and current priest stats.
  warnings: Ensure that the group identifier passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an actual group in the game world. Passing invalid or uninitialized group IDs
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also, be aware that this method does
    not perform any mana checks internally; it's expected that the calling code handles
    resource management.
