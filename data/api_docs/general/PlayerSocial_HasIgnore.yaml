documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has another player ignored by GUID
  description: The HasIgnore method determines whether a specific player is on the
    calling player's ignore list. It takes two GUID parameters representing the ignored
    player and their account, and returns true if the player is currently ignored,
    false otherwise. This functionality is part of the social system in TrinityCore
    that manages player relationships and communication restrictions. The method performs
    a lookup in the player's social list to verify the ignore status.
  parameters:
  - name: ignoreGuid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player being checked for
      ignore status
  - name: ignoreAccountGuid
    description: The account global unique identifier (GUID) associated with the ignored
      player
  returns: Returns true if the specified player is on the current player's ignore
    list, false otherwise. The method will return false if either GUID is invalid
    or if no ignore relationship exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a player is ignored
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player instance\nuint32 targetGuid = 12345;\n\
      uint32 targetAccountGuid = 67890;\nbool isIgnored = player->GetSocial()->HasIgnore(targetGuid,\
      \ targetAccountGuid);\nif (isIgnored)\n{\n    // Player is ignored\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player is currently ignored\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using HasIgnore in a social command implementation
    code: "void HandleIgnoreCheckCommand(ChatHandler* handler, const char* args)\n\
      {\n    Player* target = handler->getSelectedPlayer();\n    if (!target)\n  \
      \      return;\n\n    PlayerSocial* social = handler->GetSession()->GetPlayer()->GetSocial();\n\
      \    if (social->HasIgnore(target->GetGUID().GetCounter(), target->GetSession()->GetAccountId()))\n\
      \    {\n        handler->PSendSysMessage(\"Player %s is currently ignored.\"\
      , target->GetName().c_str());\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        handler->PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Player %s is not ignored.\", target->GetName().c_str());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the player's social list data structure which is
    typically loaded from the database at login. The implementation uses efficient
    lookup mechanisms to quickly determine ignore status without requiring additional
    database queries for each check.
  warnings: Ensure that both GUID parameters are valid before calling this method,
    as invalid GUIDs may cause undefined behavior or incorrect results. This method
    should not be used in performance-critical code paths where multiple checks are
    performed frequently.
