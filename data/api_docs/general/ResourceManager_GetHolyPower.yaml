  class: ResourceManager
  method: GetHolyPower
  signature: uint32 ResourceManager::GetHolyPower()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current holy power amount for the resource manager instance.
  description: The GetHolyPower method returns the accumulated holy power value associated
    with the ResourceManager instance. In World of Warcraft context, holy power is
    a resource typically used by paladin classes for generating special abilities
    and spells. This method provides access to the internal holy power counter that
    tracks how much holy power has been gained through various gameplay actions such
    as casting spells, taking damage, or using specific abilities. The returned value
    represents the total holy power available for use by the player's character.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current amount of holy power available.
    This value typically ranges from 0 to a maximum defined by the game mechanics,
    with 0 indicating no holy power and higher values indicating increasing amounts
    of available holy power for spell casting or ability usage.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 holyPower = resourceManager->GetHolyPower();\nif (holyPower > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Use holy power for a spell\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_HOLY_SHOCK);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Holy Power Before Casting
    code: "ResourceManager* rm = player->GetResourceManager();\nuint32 hp = rm->GetHolyPower();\n\
      if (hp >= 3)\n{\n    // Cast a high-cost holy power spell\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_HOLY_WRATH);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Alternative action when insufficient\
      \ holy power\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_FLASH_OF_LIGHT);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other resource management
    functions to determine if a paladin has sufficient holy power to cast specific
    spells. The holy power system in TrinityCore follows Blizzard's original mechanics
    where holy power is gained through various actions and consumed when casting holy
    power-based abilities.
  warnings: Ensure that the ResourceManager instance is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as accessing an uninitialized resource manager could lead
    to undefined behavior or incorrect values being returned.
