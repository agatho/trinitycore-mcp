documentation:
  brief: Stops the channeling of the Soothing Mist ability for a Mistweaver monk.
  description: The StopChannel method terminates the ongoing channeling state of the
    Soothing Mist spell, which is a key ability for Mistweaver monks in World of Warcraft.
    This method is typically invoked when the player cancels the channel, when the
    spell's duration expires, or when switching to a different ability. It ensures
    proper cleanup of the channeling effect, updates the spell's state, and may trigger
    additional effects such as healing or resource management. The method does not
    take any parameters and performs no return operations, making it a simple state
    transition function within the Mistweaver's spell system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Logic
    code: "void MyMistweaverSpell::HandleChannelStop()\n{\n    tracker->StopChannel();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Action Handling
    code: "void Player::OnSpellChannelEnd(SpellInfo const* spellInfo)\n{\n    if (spellInfo->Id\
      \ == 115175) // Soothing Mist\n        mistweaverTracker->StopChannel();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal spell channeling system and should only
    be called when a channeling spell is explicitly interrupted or completed. It's
    important to ensure that this function is not invoked multiple times during the
    same channeling session, as it may lead to inconsistent state handling.
  warnings: Calling StopChannel without verifying that a channel is actually active
    can result in undefined behavior or crashes within the TrinityCore framework.
    Always confirm the channeling state before invoking this method.
