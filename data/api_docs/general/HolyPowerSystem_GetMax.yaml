  signature: uint32 HolyPowerSystem::GetMax() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum amount of holy power that can be stored by the system
  description: The GetMax method retrieves the upper limit of holy power units that
    the HolyPowerSystem can hold. This value typically represents the maximum capacity
    of the holy power resource, which is used in various paladin abilities and mechanics
    within the TrinityCore framework. The returned value is constant for a given system
    instance and does not change during runtime unless explicitly modified through
    other system methods. This method is commonly used to validate current holy power
    values against the maximum allowed, or to display resource limits to players.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum holy power capacity of the system.
    This value typically corresponds to the maximum number of holy power charges that
    can be accumulated, often 5 for standard paladin setups in World of Warcraft.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 maxHolyPower = holyPowerSystem->GetMax();

      printf("Maximum holy power: %u\n", maxHolyPower);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation Against Current Value
    code: "uint32 current = holyPowerSystem->GetCurrent();\nuint32 max = holyPowerSystem->GetMax();\n\
      if (current >= max)\n{\n    // Handle overflow or full resource state\n    printf(\"\
      Holy power is at maximum capacity\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with GetCurrent() to determine
    resource utilization. The maximum value returned by GetMax is usually fixed for
    a given class or system configuration and does not vary based on player level
    or gear. It's important to note that while this method returns a constant value,
    the actual holy power accumulation mechanics may be influenced by talents, buffs,
    and other game effects.
  warnings: This method should not be used to modify the system state directly. The
    returned maximum value is read-only and represents the theoretical limit, not
    necessarily the effective limit under all circumstances (e.g., certain talents
    or effects might alter actual behavior).
