documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an item can be traded based on its current state and restrictions.
  description: The CanBeTraded method evaluates whether an item is eligible for trading
    within the World of Warcraft client, considering both its current state and any
    applicable restrictions. This method checks if the item has been bound to a player
    or if it's a soulbound item, which would prevent trading. It also considers whether
    the item is in a tradeable state, such as being unbound or having no restrictions
    preventing it from being traded. The method returns true if the item can be traded
    and false otherwise, making it useful for determining item eligibility in trade
    scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item can be traded, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the item is eligible for trading based on its binding status and restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Item* item = new Item();\nbool canTrade = item->CanBeTraded(false, true);\n\
      if (canTrade)\n{\n    // Item can be traded\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other item-related methods
    to determine trading eligibility. It's important to note that the method does
    not consider whether an item is already in a trade state or if it has been placed
    in a trade window; it only evaluates whether it can be traded at all.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a sole indicator for determining trade
    eligibility, as it does not account for item restrictions that may prevent trading
    even when the item is technically tradable. Additionally, this method does not
    consider the item's current state in the player's inventory or its binding status.
