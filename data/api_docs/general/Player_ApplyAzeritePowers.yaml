  signature: void Player::ApplyAzeritePowers(Item * item, bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Applies Azerite powers to an item, enhancing its properties based on the
    player's Azerite level.
  description: This method applies Azerite powers to a specified item, modifying its
    stats and abilities according to the player's current Azerite level. It is used
    primarily during item upgrade processes or when the player's Azerite progression
    changes. The method ensures that all applicable Azerite power effects are correctly
    applied to the item, enhancing its performance in combat. This function typically
    operates within the context of World of Warcraft's Azerite system where items
    gain additional benefits as players progress through their Azerite level.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: A pointer to the Item object that will receive the Azerite powers.
      This item must be valid and contain Azerite data for the method to function
      properly.
  - name: apply
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to apply or remove Azerite powers
      from the item. True applies the powers, false removes them.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      Item* item = new Item();

      player->ApplyAzeritePowers(item, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nItem* item = GetItem();\nif (item->GetTemplate()->HasAzeritePower())\
      \ {\n    player->ApplyAzeritePowers(item, true);\n}\nelse {\n    player->ApplyAzeritePowers(item,\
      \ false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method should be called only when the item is valid and has Azerite data.
    It may trigger updates to item stats and abilities depending on the Azerite level
    of the player. Performance considerations include potential for multiple calls
    during item upgrades or when Azerite levels change.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect item stats, especially
    if applied to items without Azerite data. Care must be taken to ensure that the
    item is valid before applying Azerite powers.
