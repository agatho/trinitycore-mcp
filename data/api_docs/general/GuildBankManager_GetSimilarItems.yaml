  class: GuildBankManager
  method: GetSimilarItems
  signature: int GuildBankManager::GetSimilarItems(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of similar items in the guild bank.
  description: The GetSimilarItems method calculates and returns the number of items
    in the guild bank that are considered 'similar' to a specified item. This similarity
    is typically determined by comparing item templates, such as item type, quality,
    and other relevant properties. The method is used primarily for inventory management
    and item tracking within the guild bank system. It does not modify any data but
    provides a read-only count of matching items.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the total count of items in the guild bank
    that are similar to the specified item. A return value of zero indicates no similar
    items were found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int similarItemCount = guildBankManager->GetSimilarItems(12345); // Returns
      count of items similar to item ID 12345
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a lookup in the guild bank's internal item database
    and may involve iterating through all stored items to compare their properties.
    It is recommended to cache results if this method is called frequently to avoid
    performance degradation.
  warnings: Ensure that the itemId parameter corresponds to a valid item in the game's
    database; invalid IDs might lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect counts. This
    method should not be used for modifying guild bank contents, only for querying.
