  class: SpatialGridScheduler
  method: SetEnabled
  signature: void SpatialGridScheduler::SetEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the spatial grid scheduler for managing game object updates.
  description: The SetEnabled method controls whether the SpatialGridScheduler is
    active and processing scheduled events. When enabled, the scheduler handles periodic
    updates for objects within its grid system; when disabled, it pauses all scheduled
    operations. This functionality is crucial for performance management in large-scale
    world environments where certain systems may need to be temporarily suspended
    during high-load scenarios such as instance loading or server maintenance.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      the spatial grid scheduler
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Disable scheduler during instance loading
    code: 'SpatialGridScheduler* scheduler = sObjectMgr->GetSpatialGridScheduler();

      scheduler->SetEnabled(false);

      // Perform instance loading operations

      scheduler->SetEnabled(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional scheduler control based on server load
    code: "if (sWorld->GetActiveSessionCount() > 1000)\n{\n    sObjectMgr->GetSpatialGridScheduler()->SetEnabled(false);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    sObjectMgr->GetSpatialGridScheduler()->SetEnabled(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the execution of scheduled events in the spatial
    grid system. The scheduler's state change is immediate and impacts all objects
    currently managed by the grid. Consider that disabling the scheduler may cause
    temporary inconsistencies in object behavior until it is re-enabled.
  warnings: Disabling the scheduler can lead to delayed or missed updates for objects
    in the grid, potentially causing visual glitches or incorrect game state if not
    properly managed. Always ensure proper re-enabling after temporary suspension.
