  method: HandleEmergencySituation
  signature: void GroupCoordination::HandleEmergencySituation(ThreatLevel level)
documentation:
  brief: Handles emergency situations within the group coordination system based on
    threat level.
  description: The HandleEmergencySituation method is responsible for managing and
    responding to critical in-game events or threats that require immediate group
    action. It evaluates the provided ThreatLevel parameter to determine appropriate
    emergency protocols, such as initiating evacuation procedures, alerting nearby
    players, or adjusting group behavior to mitigate danger. This method integrates
    with the broader group coordination framework to ensure synchronized responses
    during high-risk scenarios. The method does not return any value but may trigger
    various internal state changes or external events depending on the threat level.
  parameters:
  - name: level
    description: The severity level of the emergency situation, determining how the
      system responds. Valid values typically include LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, and CRITICAL,
      each triggering different emergency protocols.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Emergency Response
    code: 'GroupCoordination coordination;

      coordination.HandleEmergencySituation(ThreatLevel::HIGH);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Critical Situation Handling
    code: "GroupCoordination* group = GetGroupCoordination();\nif (group)\n{\n   \
      \ group->HandleEmergencySituation(ThreatLevel::CRITICAL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from within the game's main thread and
    should not be invoked recursively. It may modify internal group state variables
    and could potentially trigger network messages to other players in the group.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid ThreatLevel value may result in undefined
    behavior or system instability. Ensure that all threat levels are properly validated
    before invocation.
