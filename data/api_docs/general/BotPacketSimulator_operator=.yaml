documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one BotPacketSimulator object to another
  description: The assignment operator for the BotPacketSimulator class performs a
    deep copy of all member data from the source object to the target object. This
    operator ensures that both objects maintain independent copies of their internal
    state, preventing shared references that could lead to unexpected behavior. In
    the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this operation is typically used when
    duplicating packet simulation configurations or transferring state between different
    bot instances. The assignment preserves all packet data, timing information, and
    simulation parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotPacketSimulator object to copy from
  returns: A reference to the current BotPacketSimulator object after assignment has
    completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Usage
    code: 'BotPacketSimulator simulator1;

      BotPacketSimulator simulator2 = simulator1; // Uses assignment operator

      // simulator2 now contains a complete copy of simulator1''s state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment
    code: 'BotPacketSimulator sim1, sim2, sim3;

      // ... populate sim1 with packet data ...

      sim2 = sim1; // Assign sim1 to sim2

      sim3 = sim2; // Assign sim2 to sim3 (both now independent copies)

      // sim1, sim2, and sim3 are all independent objects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements a deep copy strategy to ensure that internal
    packet buffers and simulation data are properly duplicated. The implementation
    should handle any dynamically allocated memory or complex data structures within
    the BotPacketSimulator class. Performance considerations may apply when dealing
    with large packet simulations containing many entries.
  warnings: Ensure that the source object is in a valid state before assignment, as
    invalid data could lead to corrupted simulation results. Be cautious of potential
    memory issues if the BotPacketSimulator contains large amounts of packet data
    that need to be copied.
