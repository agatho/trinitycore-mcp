  class: GameObjectAI
  method: Permissible
  signature: int32 GameObjectAI::Permissible(const GameObject * go)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether this GameObjectAI instance is permissible to be used for
    a given game object.
  description: The Permissible method is a virtual function in the GameObjectAI class
    that determines if a specific GameObjectAI implementation should be assigned to
    a particular game object. It's part of TrinityCore's AI system where different
    AI types can be registered and matched to game objects based on their return values.
    The method returns an integer indicating how permissible the AI is for the given
    game object, with higher values indicating stronger preference or match. This
    allows for flexible AI assignment and ensures that only appropriate AIs are used
    for specific GameObject types.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int32 value where positive values indicate preference (higher
    means more permissible), zero indicates not permissible, and negative values may
    indicate strong disapproval or incompatibility. Typically, values of 100 or higher
    are used to indicate a strong match, while 0 means the AI should not be used for
    this object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Permissible Implementation
    code: "class MyGameObjectAI : public GameObjectAI\n{\npublic:\n    int32 Permissible(const\
      \ GameObject* go) override\n    {\n        // Only allow this AI for specific\
      \ game object types\n        if (go->GetGOInfo()->type == GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_DOOR)\n\
      \            return 100; // Strong preference\n        \n        return 0; //\
      \ Not permissible\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during AI initialization and assignment. It's important
    to note that the return value affects which AI will be assigned to a GameObject,
    so it should be implemented carefully to avoid conflicts or incorrect assignments.
    The method is typically used in conjunction with GameObject::AI() to determine
    which AI class should be instantiated for a given game object.
  warnings: Improper implementation of this method can lead to incorrect AI assignment
    or performance issues. Returning negative values may prevent any AI from being
    assigned, while returning very high positive values might cause conflicts with
    other AI types that also return high values. Always ensure your logic properly
    distinguishes between different GameObject types.
