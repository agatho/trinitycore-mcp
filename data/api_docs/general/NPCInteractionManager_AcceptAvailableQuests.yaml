  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: AcceptAvailableQuests
  signature: bool NPCInteractionManager::AcceptAvailableQuests(Creature * questGiver)
documentation:
  brief: Accepts all available quests from a specified quest giver creature.
  description: The AcceptAvailableQuests method processes and accepts all quests that
    are currently available for acceptance from the provided Creature quest giver.
    This method typically handles the logic of iterating through the quest list, validating
    prerequisites such as quest level requirements and player state, and applying
    the quest acceptance to the player's active quest log. It ensures that only valid
    and eligible quests are accepted, and it may trigger related quest events or updates
    in the game world. The method is commonly used during NPC interaction when a player
    selects an option to accept available quests.
  parameters:
  - name: questGiver
    description: Pointer to the Creature object acting as the quest giver. This must
      be a valid creature instance with active quests available for acceptance.
  returns: Returns true if at least one quest was successfully accepted, false otherwise.
    If no quests are available or all quests fail validation, the method returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (player->GetNPCInteractionManager()->AcceptAvailableQuests(questGiver))\
      \ {\n    // Quests were accepted successfully\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      Quests accepted!\");\n} else {\n    // No quests available or all failed\n \
      \   player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"No quests to accept.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: With Error Handling
    code: "Creature* questGiver = player->GetNPCInteractionManager()->GetQuestGiver();\n\
      if (!questGiver) {\n    return;\n}\n\nbool accepted = player->GetNPCInteractionManager()->AcceptAvailableQuests(questGiver);\n\
      if (accepted) {\n    player->SendNotification(\"Quests accepted successfully.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    player->SendNotification(\"No quests available to accept.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the quest giver has been properly initialized and
    contains valid quest data. It is recommended to verify the validity of the questGiver
    pointer before calling this method. The method may internally call other subsystems
    such as quest validation, player state checks, and quest log updates.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring that the questGiver is a valid creature
    with active quests can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate
    the input parameter before invoking this method.
