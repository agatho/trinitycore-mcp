  class: WorldObject
  method: GetTransOffsetZ
  signature: float WorldObject::GetTransOffsetZ() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the Z-axis offset for the object's transport transformation.
  description: The GetTransOffsetZ method retrieves the Z-coordinate offset applied
    to a WorldObject when it is mounted on a transport, such as a boat or elevator.
    This offset represents the vertical displacement of the object relative to the
    transport's coordinate system. The value is typically used during movement calculations
    and positioning updates to ensure objects remain correctly positioned on moving
    transports. This method is particularly relevant for objects that are part of
    vehicle or transport systems within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the Z-axis offset in world coordinates. This
    value indicates how far vertically the object is displaced from its base transport
    position.
  examples:
  - title: Get Z-offset for transport positioning
    code: "float zOffset = player->GetTransOffsetZ();\nif (zOffset != 0.0f)\n{\n \
      \   // Object is positioned above or below the transport base\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player Z offset: %f\", zOffset);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the TrinityCore movement system
    when handling objects that are part of transport systems. The returned value may
    be zero for objects not mounted on transports, or it may reflect the vertical
    positioning of the object relative to its transport's base plane.
