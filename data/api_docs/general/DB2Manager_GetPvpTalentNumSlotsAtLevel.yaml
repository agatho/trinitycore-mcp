  class: DB2Manager
  method: GetPvpTalentNumSlotsAtLevel
  signature: int32 DB2Manager::GetPvpTalentNumSlotsAtLevel(uint32 level, int class_)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of PvP talent slots available for a specified player
    level and class.
  description: The GetPvpTalentNumSlotsAtLevel method returns the number of PvP talent
    points that a player can allocate at a given level for a specific class. This
    value is typically used to determine how many talent nodes a player can unlock
    in the PvP talent tree. The method takes into account both the player's current
    level and their class to return the appropriate slot count. It is commonly used
    in the context of character progression, PvP talent management, and UI display
    logic within TrinityCore's PvP systems.
  parameters:
  - name: level
    description: The player's current level (1-100). Determines the base number of
      available PvP talent slots.
  - name: class_
    description: The player's class ID (e.g., 1 for Warrior, 2 for Paladin, etc.).
      Used to determine class-specific slot adjustments.
  returns: Returns an int32 representing the number of available PvP talent slots
    at the specified level and class. A negative value may indicate an error or invalid
    input.
  examples:
  - title: Get PvP Talent Slots for Level 60 Warrior
    code: 'int32 slots = sDB2Manager->GetPvpTalentNumSlotsAtLevel(60, CLASS_WARRIOR);

      // Returns the number of PvP talent slots available for a level 60 warrior.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Slot Calculation Based on Player Level
    code: "uint32 playerLevel = player->GetLevel();\nint32 slotCount = sDB2Manager->GetPvpTalentNumSlotsAtLevel(playerLevel,\
      \ player->getClass());\nif (slotCount > 0)\n{\n    // Update UI or allocate\
      \ talent points\n    player->SetPvpTalentSlots(slotCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely queries internal DB2 data tables that define PvP talent
    progression rules. The implementation may cache results for performance, especially
    when called frequently during gameplay. Ensure that the level and class parameters
    are valid to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Passing invalid level or class values may result in incorrect return values
    or undefined behavior. Always validate inputs before calling this method in critical
    systems such as talent point allocation.
