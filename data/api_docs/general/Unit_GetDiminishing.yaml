documentation:
  brief: Returns the diminishing group value for a specified group
  description: The GetDiminishing method retrieves the diminishing group identifier
    associated with a specific group in the TrinityCore framework. This method is
    used to determine how different effects interact with each other in terms of diminishing
    returns, which is a crucial game mechanic in World of Warcraft. The method allows
    developers to access the diminishing group value for a given group, enabling them
    to implement proper handling of diminishing returns mechanics in their code.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the diminishing group value. This value
    corresponds to a specific group identifier that can be used to determine how effects
    interact with each other in terms of diminishing returns.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int group = unit->GetDiminishing(1); // Returns the diminishing group value
      for group 1
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other methods that handle
    diminishing returns mechanics. The implementation may vary depending on how the
    group is defined within the TrinityCore framework, and developers should be aware
    of the specific group identifiers being used.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as incorrect usage can lead
    to improper handling of diminishing returns mechanics, which may affect gameplay
    balance and player experience. Ensure that the group parameter corresponds to
    valid group identifiers defined in the TrinityCore framework.
