  class: BattlePetManager
  method: AwardPetXP
  signature: void BattlePetManager::AwardPetXP(int * player, uint32 speciesId, uint32
    xp)
documentation:
  brief: Awards experience points to a battle pet based on the provided species ID
    and XP amount.
  description: The AwardPetXP method is used to grant experience points to a specific
    battle pet within the player's collection. This method updates the pet's experience
    level, potentially causing it to level up if the accumulated experience reaches
    the required threshold for the next level. The method takes into account the species
    ID of the pet to ensure proper XP application and progression mechanics. It is
    typically invoked during gameplay events such as battles or training sessions
    where pets earn experience.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object that owns the battle pet. This parameter
      specifies which player's pet collection will receive the XP.
  - name: speciesId
    description: Unique identifier for the battle pet species. Used to determine the
      correct pet within the player's collection and apply appropriate XP scaling
      or mechanics based on the pet type.
  - name: xp
    description: Amount of experience points to be awarded to the specified battle
      pet. This value is added to the pet's current experience total.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Award XP to a Player's Battle Pet
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player object is initialized

      uint32 speciesId = 12345;

      uint32 xpAmount = 100;

      BattlePetManager::AwardPetXP(player, speciesId, xpAmount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player object and pet data are valid and properly
    initialized. The actual XP application may involve internal checks for pet level
    limits or other game balance rules.
  warnings: Ensure that the speciesId corresponds to a valid battle pet in the player's
    collection; otherwise, the method might not apply XP correctly or could cause
    unexpected behavior.
