  class: Quest
  method: RoundXPValue
  signature: uint32 Quest::RoundXPValue(uint32 xp)
documentation:
  brief: Rounds the experience points value for a quest based on game rules and player
    level.
  description: The RoundXPValue method adjusts the raw experience points awarded for
    completing a quest according to World of Warcraft's leveling and scaling mechanics.
    This ensures that experience rewards are appropriately balanced across different
    player levels and quest difficulties. The method applies internal rounding logic
    that considers factors such as player level relative to quest level, quest difficulty
    tier, and server-specific XP modifiers. It is typically called during quest completion
    processing to determine the final XP amount a player will receive.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the rounded experience points that
    should be awarded to the player upon completing the quest. This value may differ
    from the raw XP provided by the quest definition due to rounding and scaling adjustments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Quest Completion
    code: "void Player::OnQuestComplete(Quest const* quest)\n{\n    uint32 xp = quest->GetRewXP();\n\
      \    uint32 roundedXP = quest->RoundXPValue(xp);\n    AddExperience(roundedXP);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest reward calculation system and should
    not be called directly by external code. The rounding behavior may vary depending
    on server configuration settings such as XP rate multipliers or expansion-specific
    scaling rules.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned value will match the input exactly; the
    method applies game-defined rounding logic that can modify the original XP amount.
    This method should only be used within the context of quest reward processing.
