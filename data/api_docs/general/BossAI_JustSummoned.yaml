  brief: Handles the event when a creature summoned by the boss is added to the world
  description: The JustSummoned method is a virtual callback function in the BossAI
    class that is invoked whenever a creature summoned by the boss is successfully
    added to the game world. This method allows the boss AI to react to newly summoned
    creatures, such as initializing their behavior, setting up combat states, or triggering
    additional events. It serves as an important hook for managing summoned minions
    and ensuring proper integration with the overall boss encounter logic. The method
    is typically called during the execution of summoning spells or abilities that
    create NPC companions or adds for the boss.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Implementation
    code: "void BossAI::JustSummoned(Creature* summon)\n{\n    if (summon)\n    {\n\
      \        // Set the summoned creature to attack the boss's current target\n\
      \        summon->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n        summon->AI()->AttackStart(me->GetVictim());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Event Triggering
    code: "void BossAI::JustSummoned(Creature* summon)\n{\n    if (summon && summon->GetEntry()\
      \ == NPC_SUMMONED_MINION)\n    {\n        // Trigger a special event when a\
      \ specific minion is summoned\n        DoCast(summon, SPELL_MINION_BUFF);\n\
      \        \n        // Add the minion to a list for later management\n      \
      \  summons.push_back(summon->GetGUID());\n        \n        // Notify other\
      \ parts of the encounter logic\n        if (summons.size() >= 3)\n         \
      \   DoCast(SPELL_SUMMON_COMPLETE);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the BossAI framework and should be overridden in derived
    boss classes. It's important to note that the summoned creature may not yet have
    a valid target or full initialization when this method is called, so additional
    setup might be required. The method is typically called from within the core AI
    update loop after the summoning process completes.
  warnings: Ensure proper null checking of the summoned creature pointer before accessing
    its members. Be cautious about modifying the summoned creature's state in a way
    that could interfere with the boss's main AI logic or cause infinite loops. Avoid
    performing heavy operations in this method as it may be called frequently during
    encounters.
