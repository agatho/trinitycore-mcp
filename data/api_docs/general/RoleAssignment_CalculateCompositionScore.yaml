  signature: float RoleAssignment::CalculateCompositionScore(const GroupComposition
    & composition)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates a composite score representing the optimal role distribution for
    a group composition in World of Warcraft.
  description: The CalculateCompositionScore method evaluates a given GroupComposition
    to determine how well its role distribution aligns with an ideal balance. This
    score is used internally by TrinityCore's group management system to assist in
    assigning roles such as tank, healer, and damage dealer within player groups.
    The method considers the number of players fulfilling each role type and weights
    them according to game mechanics and balancing requirements. It returns a floating-point
    value that represents the quality of the composition, where higher scores indicate
    better role balance. This method does not modify any internal state and is purely
    analytical in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated composition score. Higher values
    indicate a more balanced group composition according to predefined game rules.
    The exact scale and interpretation depend on internal weighting algorithms used
    by TrinityCore's role assignment system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "RoleAssignment roleAssign;\nGroupComposition comp;\n// Assume comp is populated\
      \ with player roles\nfloat score = roleAssign.CalculateCompositionScore(comp);\n\
      // Use score to determine if group composition is acceptable\nif (score > 0.8f)\n\
      {\n    // Group has good role balance\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal constants and balancing parameters that may
    vary between different World of Warcraft expansions or TrinityCore configurations.
    The scoring algorithm is designed to promote optimal gameplay experiences by encouraging
    balanced group compositions.
