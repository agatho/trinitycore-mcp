  class: HunterAI
  method: MaintainRange
  signature: void HunterAI::MaintainRange(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Maintains optimal ranged distance between the hunter and its target.
  description: The MaintainRange method is responsible for managing the hunter's positioning
    relative to its target during combat. It ensures that the hunter maintains an
    appropriate distance to effectively use ranged attacks while avoiding melee range.
    This method typically evaluates the current distance to the target, compares it
    against the hunter's weapon range and optimal attack distance, and may adjust
    the hunter's movement or stance accordingly. The implementation likely considers
    factors such as the hunter's current weapon type, target mobility, and combat
    situation to determine when to move closer, farther, or remain stationary.

  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void HunterAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->GetVictim())\n\
      \    {\n        MaintainRange(&me->GetVictim()->GetGUID());\n        // Other\
      \ combat logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the AI update loop and may influence
    the hunter's movement behavior. The actual distance calculations are likely based
    on the hunter's current weapon range, target size, and combat stance. Implementation
    details may vary depending on specific hunter class specialization or gear configuration.
