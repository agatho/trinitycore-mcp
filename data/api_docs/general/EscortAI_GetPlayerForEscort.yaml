  class: EscortAI
  method: GetPlayerForEscort
  signature: int * EscortAI::GetPlayerForEscort()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the player being escorted by this EscortAI instance
  description: The GetPlayerForEscort method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID)
    of the player currently being escorted by the EscortAI object. This method is
    typically used within the context of quest escort mechanics in TrinityCore, where
    NPCs are programmed to follow and protect specific players during quest events.
    The returned GUID can be used to verify the identity of the escorted player or
    to perform operations that require player-specific data. The method assumes that
    an escort has been initiated and that a valid player is currently being escorted;
    otherwise, it may return a null or invalid GUID value.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the escorted player. Returns
    NULL if no player is currently being escorted or if the escort state is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check escorted player
    code: "void CheckEscortPlayer()\n{\n    int* playerId = escortAI->GetPlayerForEscort();\n\
      \    if (playerId != nullptr)\n    {\n        // Player is being escorted\n\
      \        uint32 guid = *playerId;\n        // Use guid for further operations\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // No player is currently escorted\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the EscortAI system which handles quest escort behaviors
    in TrinityCore. The returned GUID should be used carefully as it represents a
    player's unique identifier within the game world. Ensure that the EscortAI instance
    has been properly initialized and that an escort has been started before calling
    this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without an active escort may return invalid data or
    NULL. Always verify the return value is not null before dereferencing it to prevent
    runtime errors. The GUID returned should only be used for identification purposes
    and not directly manipulated as it's managed by the core game systems.
