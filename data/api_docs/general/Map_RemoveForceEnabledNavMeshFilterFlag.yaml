  method: RemoveForceEnabledNavMeshFilterFlag
  signature: void Map::RemoveForceEnabledNavMeshFilterFlag(uint16 flag)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified force-enabled navigation mesh filter flag from the map.
  description: This method removes a specific force-enabled navigation mesh filter
    flag from the map's internal flag set. It is used to control which navigation
    mesh filters are forcibly enabled for pathfinding calculations on this map. The
    method operates on a bitmask representing various navigation mesh filtering options
    that can be forced during pathfinding operations. This functionality is typically
    used in custom AI behaviors or when modifying default navigation behavior for
    specific areas of the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: The uint16 flag value to remove from the force-enabled navigation
      mesh filter set. This represents a specific navigation mesh filtering option
      that was previously added via AddForceEnabledNavMeshFilterFlag.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a specific navigation mesh filter flag
    code: 'Map* map = ...; // Get a reference to a map

      uint16 navFlag = 0x0001; // Example flag value

      map->RemoveForceEnabledNavMeshFilterFlag(navFlag);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the Map object's navigation mesh
    filter settings. It is important to ensure that the flag being removed was previously
    added using AddForceEnabledNavMeshFilterFlag, otherwise the operation may have
    no effect. The method does not validate whether the flag is currently active in
    any pathfinding calculations.
  warnings: Removing a flag that is actively being used by pathfinding operations
    may cause unexpected behavior in AI movement or player navigation. Ensure proper
    synchronization if this method is called from multiple threads, as it modifies
    shared state.
