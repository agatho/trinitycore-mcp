  class: SceneObject
  method: Create
  signature: bool SceneObject::Create(int lowGuid, SceneType type, int sceneId, int
    scriptPackageId, int * map, int * creator, const int & pos, int privateObjectOwner)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a scene object with specified parameters and returns true on
    success.
  description: The Create method initializes a SceneObject instance with the provided
    parameters, setting up its internal state for use within the World of Warcraft
    TrinityCore environment. It assigns a low GUID, scene type, scene ID, script package
    ID, map and creator information, position data, and private owner details. The
    method returns true if all initialization steps complete successfully, otherwise
    false. This method is typically used during object creation in dynamic scenes
    such as quest events or cinematic sequences.
  parameters:
  - name: lowGuid
    description: The low GUID identifier for the scene object, uniquely identifying
      it within its map context.
  - name: type
    description: The SceneType enum value indicating the type of scene this object
      represents (e.g., quest, cinematic).
  - name: sceneId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific scene this object belongs to.
  - name: scriptPackageId
    description: Identifier for the script package that controls behavior and events
      of this scene object.
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the map ID where this scene object
      exists.
  - name: creator
    description: Pointer to an integer identifying the creator of this scene object
      (typically a player GUID).
  - name: pos
    description: Reference to a position data structure containing x, y, z coordinates
      and orientation.
  - name: privateObjectOwner
    description: Identifier for the private owner of this object (used for ownership
      checks in scene events).
  returns: True if the scene object was successfully initialized with all provided
    parameters; false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Scene Object Creation
    code: "SceneObject* sceneObj = new SceneObject();\nint mapId = 1414;\nint creatorGuid\
      \ = 12345;\nfloat position[3] = {100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f};\nint lowGuid = 98765;\n\
      int sceneId = 54321;\nint scriptPackageId = 1001;\nint privateOwner = 54321;\n\
      \nif (sceneObj->Create(lowGuid, SCENE_TYPE_QUEST, sceneId, scriptPackageId,\
      \ &mapId, &creatorGuid, position, privateOwner)) {\n    // Scene object created\
      \ successfully\n} else {\n    // Handle creation failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per SceneObject instance as it performs
    initialization. The parameters map and creator are pointers to integers, so they
    must point to valid memory locations with appropriate values before calling this
    method.
  warnings: Calling Create on an already initialized SceneObject may lead to undefined
    behavior or resource leaks. Ensure that all pointer parameters point to valid
    data before invoking this method.
