  signature: uint32 World::GetShutDownTimeLeft() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the time remaining until server shutdown in seconds
  description: The GetShutDownTimeLeft method retrieves the number of seconds remaining
    before the World server will shut down. This value is typically set when a shutdown
    timer is initiated via the game master commands or administrative functions. The
    returned value represents a countdown that decreases as time passes, and it can
    be used by various subsystems to prepare for server closure, such as notifying
    players, saving data, or cleaning up resources. The method does not modify any
    internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of seconds remaining until the server
    shutdown occurs. If the server is not scheduled to shut down, this value will
    typically be zero.
  examples:
  - title: Check shutdown time before notifying players
    code: "if (World::instance()->GetShutDownTimeLeft() > 0)\n{\n    sWorld->SendServerMessage(SERVER_MSG_STRING,\
      \ \"Server will shut down in %u seconds.\", sWorld->GetShutDownTimeLeft());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with shutdown-related game master
    commands like .server shutdown. It's important to note that the returned value
    may be zero if no shutdown has been scheduled, and it's updated periodically by
    the server's shutdown handler logic.
