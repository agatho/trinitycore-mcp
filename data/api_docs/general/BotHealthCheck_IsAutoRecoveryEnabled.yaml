documentation:
  brief: Determines whether automatic health recovery is enabled for the bot.
  description: The IsAutoRecoveryEnabled method checks if the bot's automatic health
    recovery feature is currently active. This functionality allows the bot to automatically
    restore its health without manual intervention, typically triggered by in-game
    conditions such as being out of combat or meeting specific health thresholds.
    The method returns a boolean value indicating the current state of this feature.
    This check is essential for managing bot behavior and ensuring proper resource
    usage during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if automatic health recovery is enabled for the bot, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check Auto Recovery Status
    code: "if (botHealthCheck.IsAutoRecoveryEnabled()) {\n    // Bot will automatically\
      \ recover health\n    sLog->outString(\"Auto recovery is enabled for the bot.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Manual health management required\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Auto recovery is disabled for the bot.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically interacts with internal bot configuration flags and
    may be influenced by player settings or game state. It's recommended to cache
    this value if it's checked frequently during gameplay loops.
