  method: Finalize
  signature: void RotateMovementGenerator::Finalize(int * param0, bool param1, bool
    param2)
documentation:
  brief: Completes the rotation movement generation process by finalizing the movement
    data and updating the associated unit's orientation.
  description: The Finalize method in RotateMovementGenerator is responsible for completing
    the rotation movement process. It handles the cleanup and finalization of movement
    data, ensuring that any pending rotations are properly applied to the target unit.
    This method typically gets called when a rotation movement generator needs to
    be terminated or when the movement sequence is complete. The method updates the
    unit's orientation based on the rotation parameters and ensures proper state management
    for the movement generator. It may also handle cleanup of internal resources or
    reset flags associated with the rotation process.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer parameter that likely represents a rotation
      angle or duration value. This parameter controls the final rotation state and
      may be used to determine how much rotation should be applied.
  - name: param1
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the rotation should be immediate
      or gradual. When true, the rotation is applied instantly; when false, it may
      be interpolated over time.
  - name: param2
    description: Boolean flag that determines if the movement generator should reset
      its internal state after finalization. If true, internal counters and flags
      are cleared to prepare for potential reuse.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Finalize Usage
    code: 'int rotationAngle = 90;

      bool immediate = true;

      bool resetState = false;

      rotationGenerator.Finalize(&rotationAngle, immediate, resetState);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Finalize with Full Reset
    code: 'int angle = 180;

      bool instant = false;

      bool shouldReset = true;

      rotationGenerator.Finalize(&angle, instant, shouldReset);

      // Rotation is applied gradually and generator state is reset'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the movement system when a
    rotation movement generator completes its task. Developers should not call this
    method directly unless implementing custom movement logic. The method assumes
    that the unit's current position and orientation are valid before finalization.
  warnings: Calling Finalize with invalid parameters may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect orientation updates. Ensure that param0 points to a valid integer
    value representing rotation degrees, and that all boolean flags are properly initialized
    before calling this method.
