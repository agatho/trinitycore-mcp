documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current status of a specified quest for the player
  description: The GetQuestStatus method retrieves the current state of a specific
    quest for the player. It returns a QuestStatus enum value that indicates whether
    the quest is incomplete, complete, rewarded, or otherwise in progress. This method
    is commonly used in quest-related scripts and quest log management to determine
    what actions a player can take with respect to a particular quest. The method
    does not modify any quest data but simply reads the current state from the player's
    quest log.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a QuestStatus enum value indicating the current state of the quest.
    Possible values typically include QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE, QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE,
    QUEST_STATUS_REWARDED, and others depending on the implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a quest is complete
    code: "if (player->GetQuestStatus(12345) == QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE)\n{\n    //\
      \ Quest is complete, can reward player\n    player->CompleteQuest(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine quest state for quest log display
    code: "uint32 questId = 67890;\nQuestStatus status = player->GetQuestStatus(questId);\n\
      switch (status)\n{\n    case QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE:\n        // Display incomplete\
      \ quest\n        break;\n    case QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE:\n        // Display\
      \ complete quest\n        break;\n    case QUEST_STATUS_REWARDED:\n        //\
      \ Display rewarded quest\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses the player's local quest log data and should only be
    called on active player objects. The returned QuestStatus value is cached and
    may not reflect real-time changes unless the quest log has been recently updated.
    Performance is generally good as it's a simple lookup operation.
  warnings: Do not call this method on non-player objects or objects without quest
    data. The method assumes the quest ID exists in the player's quest log, so calling
    with an invalid quest ID may return unexpected values or cause undefined behavior.
