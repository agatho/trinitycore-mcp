  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: CanSafelyProceed
  signature: bool ObstacleAvoidanceManager::CanSafelyProceed(const int & nextPosition)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a unit can safely proceed to the next position without
    colliding with obstacles.
  description: The CanSafelyProceed method evaluates if movement to a specified next
    position is safe for an AI-controlled unit. It checks for potential collisions
    with static or dynamic obstacles in the path, considering the unit's size and
    movement constraints. This method is typically used during pathfinding and obstacle
    avoidance routines to ensure units do not get stuck or move into invalid terrain.
    The method performs collision detection based on the current state of the environment
    and the unit's configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: nextPosition
    description: The target position (as an integer identifier) that the unit intends
      to move to. This value represents a specific location in the game world grid,
      typically derived from pathfinding algorithms or movement calculations.
  returns: Returns true if the unit can safely proceed to the specified next position
    without encountering obstacles; otherwise returns false. A return value of false
    indicates that either an obstacle is blocking the path, or the destination is
    not navigable for the unit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI movement logic
    code: "if (obstacleManager.CanSafelyProceed(nextPosition)) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ movement\n    unit->MoveTo(nextPosition);\n} else {\n    // Find alternative\
      \ path or wait\n    unit->SetMovementStatus(MovementStatus::WAITING);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with pathfinding system
    code: "class UnitAI {\npublic:\n    bool UpdateMovement() {\n        if (!obstacleManager.CanSafelyProceed(targetPosition))\
      \ {\n            // Replan path\n            auto newPath = pathfinder->FindPath(currentPosition,\
      \ targetPosition);\n            if (newPath.empty()) return false;\n       \
      \     \n            // Set new path\n            movementQueue = newPath;\n\
      \            return true;\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI obstacle avoidance system and should be called
    frequently during unit movement updates. It relies on accurate positioning data
    and may involve performance considerations when used in high-frequency scenarios.
    The method does not modify any internal state but rather evaluates current conditions.
  warnings: Do not assume that a positive return value guarantees complete safety,
    as dynamic obstacles might appear between the time of check and actual movement.
    Also, ensure that nextPosition is valid before calling this method to avoid undefined
    behavior.
