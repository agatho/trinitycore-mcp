  class: DemonHunterAI
  method: HandleInterrupts
  signature: void DemonHunterAI::HandleInterrupts(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles interrupting spell casts by enemies for the Demon Hunter AI.
  description: The HandleInterrupts method is responsible for detecting and responding
    to enemy spell interrupts within the Demon Hunter's AI behavior. This method evaluates
    whether an enemy's casting spell can be interrupted, typically based on game mechanics
    such as spell type, cast time, and interruptibility. It may trigger appropriate
    actions like using abilities to interrupt or repositioning to avoid being interrupted.
    The method is crucial for maintaining effective combat strategy during encounters
    where spell interruption plays a key role in gameplay balance.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's current interrupt
      status or spell cast state. This parameter allows the method to determine if
      the target is casting a spell that can be interrupted.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupt Handling
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        int interruptStatus = target->GetSpellCastTime();\n        HandleInterrupts(&interruptStatus);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during AI updates to ensure timely
    response to potential spell interrupts. The implementation may vary depending
    on the specific Demon Hunter class specialization and available interrupt abilities.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter accurately reflects the enemy's casting
    state, as incorrect values can lead to improper interrupt handling or missed opportunities
    for interruption.
