  method: Announce
  signature: void Channel::Announce(const Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Sends an announcement message to all players in the channel.
  description: The Announce method broadcasts a predefined message to every player
    currently subscribed to the channel. This method is typically used by channel
    moderators or administrators to communicate important information to the entire
    channel membership. The announcement is sent as a system message and appears in
    the chat window of all connected players. The method does not require any specific
    parameters beyond the player who initiated the announcement, which is used for
    permission checking and logging purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Channel Announcement
    code: "Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"General\", player->GetTeam());\n\
      if (channel)\n{\n    channel->Announce(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the calling player has sufficient permissions to announce
    in the channel. It internally checks for moderator status and may perform additional
    validation before sending the message. The actual message content is determined
    by the channel's internal announcement template or system message.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying player permissions may result in
    unauthorized announcements. Ensure that proper access controls are in place before
    invoking this function, especially in public channels where spamming could disrupt
    gameplay.
