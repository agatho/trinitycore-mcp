  class: ConversationAI
  method: DoAction
  signature: void ConversationAI::DoAction(int32 param)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a specific action based on the provided parameter value within the
    conversation AI context.
  description: The DoAction method in the ConversationAI class is used to trigger
    various behaviors or responses during a conversation sequence. It accepts an integer
    parameter that determines which action to execute, allowing for dynamic interaction
    logic within NPC conversations. This method is typically invoked by the game engine
    when specific conditions are met during dialogue progression, such as player choices
    or quest events. The implementation likely maps the parameter value to predefined
    actions like advancing dialogue, triggering quest updates, or modifying NPC behavior
    states.
  parameters:
  - name: param
    description: An integer identifier that specifies which action to perform within
      the conversation AI system. Valid values are determined by internal mappings
      within the ConversationAI implementation and typically correspond to specific
      dialogue branches, quest events, or behavior modifications.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Advancing Dialogue with Action Parameter
    code: "void MyNPC::OnGossipHello(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->GetQuestStatus(12345)\
      \ == QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE)\n    {\n        // Trigger next conversation node\n\
      \        me->AI()->DoAction(1);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Quest Completion Actions
    code: "void ConversationAI::DoAction(int32 param)\n{\n    switch (param)\n   \
      \ {\n        case 1:\n            // Complete quest\n            if (Player*\
      \ player = ObjectAccessor::FindConnectedPlayer(GetCurrentPlayerGuid()))\n  \
      \              player->CompleteQuest(12345);\n            break;\n        case\
      \ 2:\n            // Start next quest\n            if (Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindConnectedPlayer(GetCurrentPlayerGuid()))\n\
      \                player->AddQuest(12346, me);\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI framework and should only be called during
    active conversation states. The parameter values are typically defined by the
    conversation script or quest system and may vary between different NPC types or
    dialogue trees.
  warnings: Calling DoAction with an invalid parameter value may result in undefined
    behavior or skipped actions within the conversation flow. Ensure that parameter
    values are properly validated against expected ranges before invocation.
