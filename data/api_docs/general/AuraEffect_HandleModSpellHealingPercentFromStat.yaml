  method: HandleModSpellHealingPercentFromStat
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleModSpellHealingPercentFromStat(const AuraApplication
    * aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Modifies spell healing percentage based on a stat value.
  description: The HandleModSpellHealingPercentFromStat method adjusts the percentage
    of spell healing effects applied to a unit based on a specified stat. This aura
    effect is commonly used in World of Warcraft to implement abilities that scale
    healing output with attributes such as Intellect or Spirit. The method is invoked
    during aura application or removal, and modifies the healing calculations for
    affected spells. It takes into account whether the aura is being applied or removed,
    and updates relevant spell modifiers accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. Contains context about which unit is affected and the aura's
      properties.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation for the aura effect, typically indicating whether
      it's being applied (1) or removed (0). Used to determine how to adjust spell
      healing modifiers.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the aura is being applied (true) or removed
      (false). Controls the direction of the stat-based healing modification.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying a Healing Stat Modifier Aura
    code: "void ApplyHealingStatAura(Unit* target, uint8 mode, bool apply) {\n   \
      \ AuraEffect* aura = new AuraEffect();\n    AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication(target,\
      \ target, 0);\n    aura->HandleModSpellHealingPercentFromStat(app, mode, apply);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's aura system and interacts with spell
    healing calculations. It should only be called during aura application or removal
    events to ensure proper stat-based healing modifications.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of the mode or apply parameters can lead to unexpected
    behavior in spell healing scaling. Ensure that this method is not called outside
    of aura application/removal contexts to avoid unintended modifier stacking.
