  brief: Moves an AuctionBotConfig object to another AuctionBotConfig object, transferring
    all configuration data and resources.
  description: The AuctionBotConfig move constructor transfers ownership of resources
    from a source AuctionBotConfig object to a destination AuctionBotConfig object.
    This operation is typically used when creating new instances of AuctionBotConfig
    by moving existing ones, avoiding expensive deep copies. The source object is
    left in a valid but unspecified state after the move operation. In the context
    of TrinityCore's Auction House system, this constructor allows efficient management
    of configuration data for auction bots, which may need to be reconfigured or relocated
    during runtime without duplicating potentially large amounts of configuration
    data.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing an AuctionBotConfig
    code: 'AuctionBotConfig config1;

      // ... configure config1 ...

      AuctionBotConfig config2 = std::move(config1); // Move constructor invoked

      // config1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Move Constructor in Container
    code: 'std::vector<AuctionBotConfig> configs;

      configs.emplace_back();

      AuctionBotConfig movedConfig = std::move(configs.front());

      // The original config is moved into movedConfig, container now empty'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the C++ move semantics implementation. It's important
    to note that after a move operation, the source object should not be used in any
    way that might access its data, as it's left in a valid but unspecified state.
    The move constructor is typically called implicitly when assigning an rvalue to
    an lvalue of the same type.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after a move operation results in undefined
    behavior. Developers should ensure that no further operations are performed on
    the source object after a move constructor has been invoked.
