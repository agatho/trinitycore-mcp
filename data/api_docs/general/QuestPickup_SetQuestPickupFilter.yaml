  class: QuestPickup
  method: SetQuestPickupFilter
  signature: void QuestPickup::SetQuestPickupFilter(uint32 botGuid, const QuestPickupFilter
    & filter)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the quest pickup filter for a specified bot GUID.
  description: The SetQuestPickupFilter method configures the filtering criteria used
    by a bot to determine which quests should be picked up based on specific conditions.
    This method allows for fine-grained control over quest selection behavior in automated
    gameplay scenarios, such as those implemented by AI bots or addon scripts. The
    filter parameter defines what criteria must be met for a quest to be considered
    eligible for pickup, including requirements like quest level, faction, and other
    conditional factors. This functionality is particularly useful in custom bot implementations
    within the TrinityCore framework where automated quest progression is desired.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which the quest pickup
      filter is being set. This value must correspond to a valid bot entity within
      the game world.
  - name: filter
    description: A QuestPickupFilter object containing the criteria that define which
      quests should be eligible for pickup by the specified bot. The filter includes
      conditions such as quest level ranges, faction requirements, and other configurable
      parameters.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'QuestPickupFilter filter;

      filter.minLevel = 10;

      filter.maxLevel = 30;

      filter.requiredFaction = 469; // Alliance

      QuestPickup::SetQuestPickupFilter(12345, filter);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple Conditions
    code: 'QuestPickupFilter filter;

      filter.minLevel = 20;

      filter.maxLevel = 50;

      filter.requiredFaction = 67;

      filter.allowRepeatable = true;

      filter.allowDaily = false;

      QuestPickup::SetQuestPickupFilter(98765, filter);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the QuestPickup system for a specific
    bot. It's important to note that changes made through this method will only affect
    future quest pickup decisions and won't retroactively influence already accepted
    quests. The filter object should be properly initialized before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid provided corresponds to an active bot instance;
    otherwise, the filter may not be applied correctly. Also, be cautious when setting
    overly restrictive filters as they might prevent the bot from accepting any quests,
    leading to inactivity.
