  brief: Initiates the process for a player to leave a dungeon instance
  description: The LeaveDungeon method handles the logic required to safely remove
    a player from a dungeon environment. It manages the transition of the player out
    of the current dungeon instance, ensuring proper cleanup of any active dungeon-related
    events or quests. This method typically checks if the player is currently inside
    a dungeon and performs necessary actions such as updating the player's position,
    removing dungeon-specific buffs or debuffs, and triggering any relevant quest
    completion events. The method returns true if the player was successfully removed
    from the dungeon, or false if the operation failed due to invalid state or other
    conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player was successfully removed from the dungeon instance,
    false otherwise. Failure may occur if the player is not currently in a dungeon
    or if the leave process encounters an error during execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of LeaveDungeon
    code: "if (player->GetAdvancedBehaviorManager()->LeaveDungeon()) {\n    // Player\
      \ successfully left the dungeon\n    player->SendNotification(\"You have left\
      \ the dungeon.\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to leave the dungeon\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Failed to leave the dungeon.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a player is confirmed to be inside
    a dungeon instance. It is recommended to check the current instance state before
    calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior. The implementation may involve
    asynchronous operations that could delay the actual removal from the dungeon.
  warnings: Calling LeaveDungeon outside of a dungeon context may result in undefined
    behavior or errors. Ensure proper validation of player state before invoking this
    method. This method does not handle all possible dungeon exit conditions, such
    as forced teleports or instance resets.
