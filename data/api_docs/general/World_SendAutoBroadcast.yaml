  brief: Sends auto broadcasts to all connected players in the world.
  description: The SendAutoBroadcast method is responsible for distributing automated
    broadcast messages to all currently connected players across the entire game world.
    This method typically handles the logic for sending system-wide announcements,
    server maintenance notices, or other important information that should be visible
    to every player. The implementation likely retrieves pre-configured broadcast
    messages from the database or configuration files and sends them using the appropriate
    network protocols. This method is usually invoked periodically by the server's
    main loop or triggered by specific events such as server start-up or scheduled
    maintenance windows.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: World::instance()->SendAutoBroadcast();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main server loop or scheduled tasks.
    It may involve database queries to fetch broadcast messages and network operations
    to send them to all players, which could impact performance during high player
    count periods.
