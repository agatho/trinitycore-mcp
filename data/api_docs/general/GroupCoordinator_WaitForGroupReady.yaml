  method: WaitForGroupReady
  signature: void GroupCoordinator::WaitForGroupReady()
documentation:
  brief: Waits for all group members to be ready before proceeding with group operations.
  description: The WaitForGroupReady method blocks execution until all players in
    the current group have signaled their readiness. This synchronization point is
    commonly used during dungeon or raid encounters to ensure all participants are
    prepared before initiating combat or other group activities. The method typically
    checks each group member's status and will not return until all members have acknowledged
    their readiness state. This mechanism helps prevent desync issues and ensures
    coordinated group actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Group Encounter
    code: "void MyGroupScript::OnEncounterStart()\n{\n    // Wait for all group members\
      \ to be ready\n    groupCoordinator.WaitForGroupReady();\n    \n    // Proceed\
      \ with encounter once all are ready\n    StartEncounter();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with group readiness tracking
    systems. It may block the calling thread until all members respond, so it should
    be used carefully in performance-critical code paths. The implementation likely
    uses internal synchronization primitives to coordinate between multiple threads.
  warnings: Using this method in a tight loop or without proper timeout handling can
    cause deadlocks or performance degradation. Ensure that all group members are
    properly registered and will eventually signal readiness, otherwise the method
    may block indefinitely.
