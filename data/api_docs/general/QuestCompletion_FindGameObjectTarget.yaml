  class: QuestCompletion
  method: FindGameObjectTarget
  signature: bool QuestCompletion::FindGameObjectTarget(Player * bot, QuestObjectiveData
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the GameObject target associated with a quest objective
    for the specified player bot.
  description: The FindGameObjectTarget method is used within the QuestCompletion
    class to locate and retrieve the GameObject that serves as the target for a given
    quest objective. This method takes a Player pointer representing the bot and a
    reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing the details of the objective.
    It attempts to identify the appropriate GameObject in the game world based on
    the objective's requirements, such as type, entry ID, or other criteria. The method
    is typically invoked during automated quest completion processes where bots need
    to interact with specific game objects to progress through quests. The function
    returns true if a valid GameObject target was successfully located and assigned
    to the objective, otherwise it returns false.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is attempting
      to complete the quest objective. This player must be in the same world instance
      as the target GameObject.
  - name: objective
    description: A reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing information
      about the quest objective, including its type, required items, NPCs, or GameObjects.
      The method modifies this structure to store the found GameObject target.
  returns: Returns true if a valid GameObject target was successfully located and
    assigned to the objective; otherwise returns false. This indicates whether the
    quest completion logic can proceed with the identified target.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest completion
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nQuestObjectiveData objective = ...;\nif (questCompletion.FindGameObjectTarget(bot,\
      \ objective)) {\n    // Proceed with interaction logic\n    // e.g., move to\
      \ target and interact\n} else {\n    // Handle case where no GameObject was\
      \ found\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with automated quest bot
    code: "void QuestBot::CompleteObjective(Player* player, QuestObjectiveData& obj)\
      \ {\n    QuestCompletion questCompletion;\n    if (questCompletion.FindGameObjectTarget(player,\
      \ obj)) {\n        // Use the found GameObject to complete objective\n     \
      \   GameObject* target = obj.GetGameObject();\n        // Perform interaction\
      \ with target\n        player->GetMotionMaster()->MovePoint(0, target->GetPosition());\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Log error or attempt alternative approach\n      \
      \  sLog->outError(\"Failed to find GameObject target for quest objective\");\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal caching mechanisms and world object
    lookup tables. It may perform checks against the bot's current zone, map, and
    instance to ensure the GameObject is accessible. The implementation might also
    consider quest state, player level, and other contextual factors when determining
    if a target is valid.
  warnings: The method assumes that the provided Player object is valid and in an
    active game session. If the bot is not in the same world or instance as the target
    GameObject, this function may fail to locate it. Additionally, if the objective
    data does not contain sufficient information about the required GameObject (e.g.,
    missing entry ID), the method will likely return false.
