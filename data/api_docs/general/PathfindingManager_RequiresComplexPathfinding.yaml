  class: PathfindingManager
  method: RequiresComplexPathfinding
  signature: bool PathfindingManager::RequiresComplexPathfinding(const int & start,
    const int & goal, const PathRequest & request)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a complex pathfinding algorithm is required for the given
    path request.
  description: The RequiresComplexPathfinding method evaluates whether the specified
    start and goal positions, along with the provided path request parameters, necessitate
    the use of advanced pathfinding logic instead of a simple direct path. This decision
    is typically based on factors such as terrain complexity, obstacles, height differences,
    or specific navigation requirements defined in the request. The method acts as
    a predicate to determine which pathfinding strategy should be employed for optimal
    performance and accuracy. It is commonly used internally by the PathfindingManager
    to route path requests to appropriate algorithms.
  parameters:
  - name: start
    description: The starting position identifier or index for the path request.
  - name: goal
    description: The destination position identifier or index for the path request.
  - name: request
    description: A PathRequest object containing additional parameters that influence
      pathfinding decisions, such as movement type, collision settings, and other
      navigation constraints.
  returns: Returns true if complex pathfinding logic is required for the specified
    start and goal positions under the given request conditions; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if complex pathfinding is needed
    code: "PathRequest req;\nreq.movementType = MovementType::GROUND;\nreq.requiresCollision\
      \ = true;\nbool needsComplex = pathfinder.RequiresComplexPathfinding(100, 200,\
      \ req);\nif (needsComplex)\n{\n    // Use advanced pathfinding\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before initiating expensive pathfinding computations
    to determine if a simplified or more complex algorithm should be used. It helps
    optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary computation when a direct path suffices.
