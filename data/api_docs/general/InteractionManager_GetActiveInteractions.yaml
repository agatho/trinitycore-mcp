  class: InteractionManager
  method: GetActiveInteractions
  signature: uint32 InteractionManager::GetActiveInteractions() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of currently active interactions managed by the InteractionManager.
  description: The GetActiveInteractions method returns a uint32 value representing
    the total number of active interactions currently being tracked by the InteractionManager
    instance. This count typically includes all ongoing player interactions with game
    objects, NPCs, or other interactive elements within the World of Warcraft environment.
    The method is read-only and does not modify any internal state. It's commonly
    used for debugging, performance monitoring, or to determine if interaction processing
    is active. The returned value reflects the current state at the time of the call
    and may change dynamically as interactions are added or removed.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value indicating the number of active interactions currently managed
    by this InteractionManager instance. Returns zero if no interactions are active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Active Interactions
    code: "uint32 activeCount = interactionManager->GetActiveInteractions();\nif (activeCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"interactions\", \"Currently {} active interactions\"\
      , activeCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Interaction Load for Performance
    code: "uint32 currentActive = interactionManager->GetActiveInteractions();\nif\
      \ (currentActive > 1000)\n{\n    TC_LOG_WARN(\"interactions\", \"High interaction\
      \ load detected: {} active interactions\", currentActive);\n}\nelse if (currentActive\
      \ == 0)\n{\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"interactions\", \"No active interactions, cleanup\
      \ may be needed\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple count operation on an internal collection or
    list of active interactions. It's designed to be lightweight and fast, typically
    implemented using a counter variable that is incremented when interactions are
    added and decremented when they're removed. The method is thread-safe in most
    TrinityCore implementations as it only reads from a shared data structure without
    modifying it.
  warnings: The returned value may become outdated immediately after the call since
    interactions can be added or removed concurrently. If precise real-time interaction
    counts are required, consider using a lock or atomic operation around the call.
    Additionally, this method does not distinguish between different types of interactions;
    it returns a total count regardless of interaction type.
