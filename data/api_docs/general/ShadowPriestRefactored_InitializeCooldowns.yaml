  brief: Initializes cooldowns for shadow priest abilities.
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up and configures all ability cooldowns
    for the Shadow Priest class. This method is typically called during character
    initialization or when switching to the shadow priest specialization. It ensures
    that all relevant spells and abilities have their cooldown timers properly initialized,
    preventing unexpected behavior during gameplay. The method handles internal state
    management for cooldown tracking and may reset any existing cooldown data to default
    values.
