  signature: int GroupMgr::GenerateNewGroupDbStoreId()
documentation:
  brief: Generates and returns a new unique database identifier for a group object
    within the TrinityCore world.
  description: The GenerateNewGroupDbStoreId method is responsible for creating a
    new unique identifier that will be used to store group data in the database. This
    identifier is typically used as the primary key for group-related entries in the
    database tables, ensuring each group has a distinct and persistent identity across
    server sessions. The method likely maintains an internal counter or retrieves
    from a global sequence to guarantee uniqueness. It's commonly invoked when creating
    new groups to assign them their database ID before persisting to storage. This
    method does not perform any database operations itself but simply provides the
    next available ID for use in subsequent save operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the newly generated unique database identifier
    for a group. This ID should be used immediately when creating or updating group
    records in the database to ensure proper association and persistence of group
    data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage When Creating a New Group
    code: 'Group* newGroup = new Group();

      int groupId = sGroupMgr->GenerateNewGroupDbStoreId();

      newGroup->SetId(groupId);

      // Proceed with group initialization and database save

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically thread-safe as it likely uses atomic operations
    or mutex locking internally to prevent ID collisions in multi-threaded environments.
    The generated IDs are usually sequential and may be cached or pre-allocated for
    performance reasons.
  warnings: Do not call this method without intending to immediately use the returned
    ID for database storage. Repeated calls without proper usage can lead to unused
    ID gaps in the sequence, though this is generally harmless for database integrity.
