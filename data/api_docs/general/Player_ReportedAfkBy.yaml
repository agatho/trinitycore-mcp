  class: Player
  method: ReportedAfkBy
  signature: void Player::ReportedAfkBy(Player * reporter)
documentation:
  brief: Records the player's AFK status when reported by another player.
  description: This method is called when a player is reported as AFK by another player,
    typically in a PvP scenario or during battleground activity. It updates the player's
    AFK status and records the reporting player's GUID, which helps track AFK behavior
    for game mechanics such as PvP ranking and reward distribution. The method does
    not directly affect the player's AFK state but rather logs the report for future
    reference.
  parameters:
  - name: reporter
    description: Pointer to the Player object who reported this player as AFK. This
      parameter must be a valid player object with a valid GUID.
  returns: null
  examples:

    code: "void Player::ReportedAfkBy(Player * reporter)\n{\n    // Implementation\
      \ details\n}\n\n// Usage example:\nPlayer* reportedPlayer = GetPlayer();\nPlayer*\
      \ reporter = GetPlayer();\nreportedPlayer->ReportedAfkBy(reporter);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked when a player's AFK status is detected by
    another player during gameplay, particularly in PvP scenarios. It may be called
    from the core's AFK detection logic or during battleground activities where players
    are monitored for AFK behavior.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly unless you have a valid reason
    to do so; it is typically invoked through game mechanics or internal system calls.
    Improper use could lead to incorrect AFK tracking or player behavior.
