  method: Execute
  signature: bool PlayerbotDatabaseConnection::Execute(const std::string & sql)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a SQL statement on the playerbot database connection
  description: The Execute method performs a SQL command against the connected playerbot
    database. It is used to run INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or other non-query SQL statements
    that modify data in the database. The method returns true if the execution was
    successful, and false if an error occurred during execution. This method is typically
    used by playerbot AI logic to persist configuration changes, update player behavior
    settings, or manage bot-related data within the TrinityCore database system.
  parameters:
  - name: sql
    description: The complete SQL statement to execute as a string. This should be
      a valid SQL command such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or similar data modification
      statements. The statement must be properly formatted and escaped to prevent
      SQL injection attacks.
  returns: Returns true if the SQL statement executed successfully without errors,
    false otherwise. If the database connection is not established or the SQL statement
    fails for any reason (syntax error, constraint violation, etc.), the method will
    return false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Statement
    code: "PlayerbotDatabaseConnection* db = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetPlayerbotDatabase();\n\
      bool success = db->Execute(\"UPDATE playerbots SET enabled = 1 WHERE bot_id\
      \ = 12345\");\nif (success) {\n    // Update successful\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Insert New Bot Configuration
    code: "std::string sql = \"INSERT INTO playerbot_config (bot_id, config_name,\
      \ config_value) VALUES (12345, 'aggression', 'high')\";\nbool result = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetPlayerbotDatabase()->Execute(sql);\n\
      if (!result) {\n    // Handle error - log or retry\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed for executing data modification statements only.
    For SELECT queries, use the appropriate query methods instead. The database connection
    must be properly initialized before calling this method. All SQL strings should
    be properly escaped to prevent injection attacks. This method may block until
    the database operation completes, so it should not be called from time-critical
    sections of code.
  warnings: Do not pass untrusted user input directly into this method without proper
    sanitization or parameterization. This can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    The method does not provide transaction support - each execution is a standalone
    operation. If you need atomic operations across multiple statements, consider
    using explicit transaction handling.
