  signature: bool WarriorAI::IsInMeleeRange(::Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a target unit is within melee attack range for the warrior
    AI.
  description: The IsInMeleeRange method evaluates whether a specified target unit
    is within the melee combat range of the warrior AI. This method is typically used
    by AI logic to decide when to initiate or maintain melee attacks. It considers
    the AI's current position, the target's position, and the warrior's melee attack
    range parameters. The method returns true if the target is within range, false
    otherwise. This functionality is crucial for proper combat behavior in WoW AI
    systems, ensuring that warriors do not attempt to attack targets that are out
    of reach.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target to check for melee
      range eligibility. Must be a valid Unit pointer; passing nullptr may result
      in undefined behavior or assertion failures.
  returns: Returns true if the target unit is within the warrior's melee attack range,
    false otherwise. This boolean value determines whether the AI should proceed with
    melee combat actions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine if target is in melee range
    code: "if (warriorAI->IsInMeleeRange(targetUnit)) {\n    // Proceed with melee\
      \ attack\n    warriorAI->AttackStart(targetUnit);\n} else {\n    // Move closer\
      \ or use ranged attack\n    warriorAI->DoMoveTo(targetUnit);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsInMeleeRange in a combat decision loop
    code: "void WarriorCombatAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    Unit* victim = GetVictim();\n    if (IsInMeleeRange(victim))\
      \ {\n        // In melee range - perform melee attack\n        DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Out of melee range - move closer or use ability\n\
      \        DoMoveTo(victim);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal AI range calculations based on the warrior's
    model size, weapon reach, and current positioning. It may account for movement
    speed and target avoidance mechanics in some implementations. The method is generally
    expected to be fast and efficient as it's called frequently during combat updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is a valid Unit pointer before calling
    this method. Passing nullptr or an invalid pointer can lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior. Additionally, this method might not account for all possible environmental
    factors like terrain or obstacles in some implementations.
