  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: RequiresImmediateAvoidance
  signature: bool ObstacleAvoidanceManager::RequiresImmediateAvoidance()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether immediate obstacle avoidance behavior is required for
    the current movement context.
  description: The RequiresImmediateAvoidance method evaluates the current state of
    an AI-controlled unit's movement path and determines if urgent avoidance maneuvers
    are necessary to prevent collisions with obstacles. This method is typically invoked
    during pathfinding and movement updates to ensure units do not get stuck or collide
    with environmental hazards, other units, or terrain features. It considers factors
    such as proximity to obstacles, movement direction, and the urgency of the avoidance
    action. The result directly influences whether the unit will initiate immediate
    evasive actions rather than continuing along its planned path.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if immediate obstacle avoidance is required based on current
    movement state and environmental conditions; otherwise returns false if normal
    movement can continue without urgent intervention.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void EnemyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_obstacleAvoidanceManager.RequiresImmediateAvoidance())\n\
      \    {\n        // Initiate immediate avoidance behavior\n        m_creature->GetMotionMaster()->MoveIdle();\n\
      \        // Perform evasive maneuver\n        m_creature->GetMotionMaster()->MoveRandom(10.0f);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Continue normal movement\n        m_creature->GetMotionMaster()->MoveChase(m_target);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is performance-critical and should be called sparingly during
    high-frequency AI updates. It relies on internal obstacle detection systems that
    may cache previous results for efficiency. The method does not directly modify
    movement state but serves as a decision point for higher-level avoidance logic.
  warnings: Do not call this method in tight loops without proper caching or throttling,
    as it may trigger expensive pathfinding computations. The return value should
    be interpreted within the context of the current movement behavior to avoid conflicting
    actions.
