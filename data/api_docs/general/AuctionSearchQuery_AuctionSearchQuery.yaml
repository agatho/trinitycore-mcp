documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the AuctionSearchQuery class for querying auction
    house items.
  description: The AuctionSearchQuery constructor initializes a new instance of the
    AuctionSearchQuery class, which is used to build and execute queries for searching
    items in the auction house. This class encapsulates the parameters and filters
    needed to search through auction listings, including item quality, level ranges,
    and other criteria. The constructor sets up default values for all internal query
    parameters, allowing developers to easily modify specific aspects of the search
    without having to manually initialize each field. This is a fundamental component
    in the auction house system's API, enabling dynamic searches based on various
    user-defined filters.

  - title: Basic Auction Search Query Initialization
    code: 'AuctionSearchQuery query;

      // The query object is now initialized with default parameters

      // and can be modified before executing a search'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any database operations or network calls.
    It simply initializes the internal state of the AuctionSearchQuery object. All
    actual searching occurs when calling methods like 'ExecuteSearch()' on the query
    object.
