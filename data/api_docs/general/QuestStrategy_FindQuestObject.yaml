  signature: int * QuestStrategy::FindQuestObject(BotAI * ai, const int & objective)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns a pointer to the quest object associated with the given
    objective for the specified bot AI.
  description: The FindQuestObject method is used within the TrinityCore AI framework
    to locate a specific quest object based on an objective identifier. This method
    is typically invoked by bot AI logic to determine which quest object (such as
    a quest item, NPC, or game object) corresponds to a given quest objective. It
    acts as a lookup mechanism that allows the AI to track and interact with relevant
    quest elements in the game world. The method takes a BotAI instance and an objective
    identifier, then returns a pointer to an integer representing the quest object's
    identifier. This functionality is crucial for quest completion logic in automated
    bot behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: A pointer to the BotAI instance that represents the AI controlling
      the bot. This parameter is used to access the bot's current quest state and
      context.
  - name: objective
    description: An integer reference representing the quest objective identifier.
      This value typically corresponds to a specific task or goal within a quest,
      such as collecting items or interacting with NPCs.
  returns: A pointer to an integer that represents the unique identifier (GUID) of
    the quest object associated with the given objective. Returns NULL if no matching
    quest object is found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot AI logic
    code: "int* questObj = strategy->FindQuestObject(ai, 12345);\nif (questObj !=\
      \ nullptr) {\n    // Use the quest object identifier for further processing\n\
      \    uint32 objGuid = *questObj;\n    // Perform actions related to this quest\
      \ object\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using FindQuestObject in a quest completion check
    code: "void CheckQuestCompletion(BotAI* ai, QuestStrategy* strategy) {\n    int\
      \ objective = ai->GetQuestObjective();\n    int* objPtr = strategy->FindQuestObject(ai,\
      \ objective);\n    if (objPtr != nullptr && *objPtr > 0) {\n        // Proceed\
      \ with quest interaction\n        ai->InteractWithObject(*objPtr);\n    } else\
      \ {\n        // Objective not found or invalid\n        ai->Log(\"Quest object\
      \ not found for objective: %d\", objective);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest handling system in TrinityCore's
    AI framework. It assumes that the BotAI instance has valid quest data loaded and
    that the objective identifier corresponds to a known quest task. The returned
    pointer should not be modified directly as it points to internal data structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI instance passed is properly initialized and contains
    valid quest information before calling this method. Returning NULL indicates either
    an invalid objective or missing quest data, which may lead to unexpected behavior
    if not handled correctly.
