documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the account data element value associated with the specified data
    element ID.
  description: This method retrieves the account-level data element value for a given
    data element ID from the player's account data. The data element can represent
    various account-specific information such as achievements, statistics, or other
    account-related data. The method returns either an int64 or float depending on
    the data element type, allowing for flexible handling of different account data
    types. This functionality is commonly used in World of Warcraft client-side data
    retrieval and account management operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a std::variant containing either an int64 or float value representing
    the account data element value. The specific type depends on the data element
    ID provided, with int64 typically used for integer-based account data elements
    and float for floating-point values.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int64 value = player->GetDataElementAccount(12345);\nif (value != 0) {\n\
      \    // Handle the integer value\n}\nfloat value = player->GetDataElementAccount(12346);\n\
      if (value != 0.0f) {\n    // Handle the float value\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is thread-safe and can be used in both single-threaded and multi-threaded
    contexts. Performance considerations include potential overhead from data element
    lookup, especially for large account data sets. Implementation details suggest
    that this method likely uses internal account data caching mechanisms to optimize
    retrieval.
  warnings: This method may return a null value if the specified data element ID does
    not exist or is not initialized. Developers should always check for valid values
    before using the returned data element. Additionally, the method might throw exceptions
    in certain edge cases where data element IDs are invalid or not properly initialized.
