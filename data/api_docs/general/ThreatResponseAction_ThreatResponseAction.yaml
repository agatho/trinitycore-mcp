  signature: void ThreatResponseAction::ThreatResponseAction()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new threat response action for AI behavior in the game.
  description: The ThreatResponseAction constructor initializes a new instance of
    the ThreatResponseAction class, which is used in TrinityCore's AI system to manage
    how creatures respond to threat changes. This method sets up internal state variables
    and prepares the action for execution within the creature's AI context. The class
    typically handles threat management logic such as targeting adjustments, aggro
    switching, or behavior modifications based on threat levels. It is part of the
    broader AI framework that governs NPC combat behavior in World of Warcraft emulators.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new ThreatResponseAction instance
    code: 'ThreatResponseAction* action = new ThreatResponseAction();

      // The action is now initialized and ready for use in AI logic'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the AI system when creating
    behavior actions. Developers should not directly instantiate this class unless
    implementing custom AI behaviors. The class likely inherits from a base AI action
    class and may require specific context to function properly.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of this class without proper AI context may lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. This is an internal API component that should
    be used carefully within the established AI framework.
