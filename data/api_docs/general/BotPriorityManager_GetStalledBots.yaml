  signature: int BotPriorityManager::GetStalledBots() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of bots that are currently stalled in the bot priority
    manager.
  description: The GetStalledBots method retrieves the number of bots that are currently
    marked as stalled within the BotPriorityManager system. In the context of TrinityCore's
    bot framework, a stalled bot typically refers to a bot that has become unresponsive
    or is unable to progress through its assigned tasks due to various conditions
    such as pathfinding failures, target acquisition issues, or other runtime errors.
    This count is used by the system to monitor bot health and potentially trigger
    recovery mechanisms or logging for debugging purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of bots currently marked as stalled
    in the BotPriorityManager. Returns zero if no bots are stalled or if the manager
    contains no bots at all.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int stalledCount = botPriorityManager.GetStalledBots();\nif (stalledCount\
      \ > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Warning: \" << stalledCount << \" bots are currently\
      \ stalled.\"\n              << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during periodic maintenance or status checks
    of the bot system. The implementation likely involves iterating through internal
    bot data structures and counting those that meet specific stall criteria, such
    as having a timeout flag set or being in a suspended state.
