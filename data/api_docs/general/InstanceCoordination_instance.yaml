documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the InstanceCoordination class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the InstanceCoordination
    class, providing global access to a single shared instance. This method ensures
    that only one InstanceCoordination object exists throughout the application lifecycle.
    The returned pointer is guaranteed to be valid and should not be deleted by the
    caller. This pattern is commonly used in TrinityCore for managing instance-related
    coordination logic such as player entry/exit handling, instance locking, and synchronization
    across multiple threads.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton InstanceCoordination instance. The method never
    returns NULL as it creates the instance on first call if it doesn't exist yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InstanceCoordination* coord = InstanceCoordination::instance();

      // Use the coordination instance for managing instance-related operations'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Instance Coordination Features
    code: "InstanceCoordination* coord = InstanceCoordination::instance();\nif (coord)\n\
      {\n    // Perform instance coordination operations\n    coord->HandlePlayerEnter(instanceId,\
      \ playerGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it uses a static local variable approach for
    singleton creation. The first call to this method may have slight overhead due
    to initialization, but subsequent calls return immediately. The instance is automatically
    destroyed at program termination.
  warnings: While the singleton pattern provides convenient global access, excessive
    use can make unit testing difficult and introduce hidden dependencies. Avoid creating
    multiple instances or relying on global state in unit tests.
