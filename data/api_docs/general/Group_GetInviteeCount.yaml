documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of players currently invited to join the group
  description: The GetInviteeCount method retrieves the count of players who have
    been invited to join the group but have not yet accepted or declined the invitation.
    This method is used primarily in group management and invitation handling logic
    within the TrinityCore framework. The returned value represents the size of the
    internal invite list for the group, which includes all pending invitations. This
    count does not include players who are already members of the group or those who
    have been invited but have since left the game.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of players currently invited to join
    this group. Returns 0 if no players are invited or if the group is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Check pending invitations before creating a new group
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    int inviteeCount\
      \ = group->GetInviteeCount();\n    if (inviteeCount > 0)\n    {\n        //\
      \ Handle case where there are pending invitations\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Group has %d pending invitations\", inviteeCount);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses the internal invite list of the group and should be
    used carefully in performance-critical sections. The count returned is updated
    immediately when players are invited or removed from the invitation list.
