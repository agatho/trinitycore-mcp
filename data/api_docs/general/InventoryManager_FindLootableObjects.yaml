  signature: int InventoryManager::FindLootableObjects(float range) const
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the number of lootable objects within a specified range.
  description: The FindLootableObjects method searches for all lootable game objects
    (such as corpses, chests, or containers) within the given range around the player.
    It iterates through nearby world entities and identifies those that are eligible
    for looting based on game rules and visibility. This method is commonly used in
    loot-related systems to determine what items can be interacted with or collected
    by a player. The method does not modify any state but provides a count of qualifying
    objects, which can then be used to display loot options or trigger loot collection
    logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of lootable objects found within
    the specified range. A value of zero indicates no lootable objects were detected
    in the area.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int lootCount = inventoryManager.FindLootableObjects(10.0f);\nif (lootCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process or display available loot\n    std::cout << \"Found\
      \ \" << lootCount << \" lootable objects.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Loot Processing
    code: "float searchRange = 25.0f;\nint numLootables = inventoryManager.FindLootableObjects(searchRange);\n\
      if (numLootables > 0)\n{\n    // Iterate through found lootable objects\n  \
      \  for (int i = 0; i < numLootables; ++i)\n    {\n        // Retrieve and process\
      \ each lootable object\n        LootableObject* lootObj = GetLootableObject(i);\n\
      \        if (lootObj && lootObj->IsLootable())\n        {\n            // Trigger\
      \ loot collection or UI update\n            ProcessLoot(lootObj);\n        }\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other inventory or player
    interaction systems to provide dynamic loot discovery. It may perform spatial
    queries against the world object manager and could be optimized using spatial
    partitioning techniques. The range parameter defines a spherical area around the
    player's current position.
  warnings: Ensure that the range value passed is reasonable to avoid performance
    degradation from excessive world object checks. This method should not be called
    too frequently in tight loops without considering its computational cost.
