  class: ClassAI
  method: ClassAI
  signature: void ClassAI::ClassAI(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the ClassAI instance with a bot reference.
  description: The ClassAI constructor initializes the artificial intelligence behavior
    for a bot character. This method sets up internal state and references needed
    for the AI to function properly within the TrinityCore framework. It typically
    assigns the provided bot pointer to internal member variables, allowing the AI
    system to interact with and control the associated bot entity. The initialization
    process may include setting default behaviors, registering event handlers, or
    preparing data structures required for decision-making logic.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot instance that this ClassAI will manage. Must be
      a valid pointer to a bot object; passing null may result in undefined behavior
      or crashes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: ClassAI* ai = new ClassAI(&bot);
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Bot Creation Context
    code: 'Bot* myBot = new Bot();

      ClassAI* botAI = new ClassAI(&myBot);

      // AI is now initialized and ready to control the bot'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during bot creation or when assigning
    AI behavior to an existing bot. The bot parameter must be a valid, initialized
    object; otherwise, subsequent operations may lead to segmentation faults or other
    undefined behaviors.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer as the bot parameter will likely cause crashes
    or memory corruption. Ensure that the bot object is fully constructed and valid
    before calling this constructor.
