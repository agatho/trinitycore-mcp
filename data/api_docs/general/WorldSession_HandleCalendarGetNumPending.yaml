  brief: Sends the number of pending calendar invitations to the player's client
  description: This method handles the client request to retrieve the count of pending
    calendar invitations. It is part of the World of Warcraft calendar system functionality
    within TrinityCore. The method processes the incoming packet from the client and
    responds by sending back the number of pending calendar events that require the
    player's attention. This allows the client UI to display the appropriate notification
    count for calendar invitations without having to fetch each individual invitation.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleCalendarGetNumPending(WorldPackets::Calendar::CalendarGetNumPending\
      \ & calendarGetNumPending)\n{\n    // Process the packet and send pending count\n\
      \    SendCalendarNumPending();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when the client UI needs to refresh the calendar
    notification badge. The implementation likely involves querying the database for
    pending calendar invitations associated with the player's account and counting
    them before sending the result back to the client.
