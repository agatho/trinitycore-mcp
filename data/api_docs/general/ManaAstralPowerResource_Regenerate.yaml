  class: ManaAstralPowerResource
  method: Regenerate
  signature: void ManaAstralPowerResource::Regenerate(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Regenerates astral power resource over time based on elapsed game ticks.
  description: The Regenerate method updates the astral power resource for a player
    or unit by incrementing its value according to predefined regeneration rates and
    game mechanics. This method is typically called during each update cycle in the
    game loop, using the provided time delta (diff) to determine how much resource
    should be regenerated. It ensures that players or units gradually recover their
    astral power, which is essential for casting certain spells or abilities in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time delta (in milliseconds) since the last regeneration tick.
      Used to calculate proportional resource gain based on regeneration rate.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Regeneration Call
    code: 'ManaAstralPowerResource resource;

      uint32 deltaTime = 1000; // One second

      resource.Regenerate(deltaTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Update Loop
    code: "void Update(uint32 diff) {\n    if (Player* player = GetPlayer()) {\n \
      \       if (ManaAstralPowerResource* resource = player->GetManaAstralPowerResource())\
      \ {\n            resource->Regenerate(diff);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the resource management system and should be invoked
    regularly during game updates. The regeneration rate may vary depending on player
    class, buffs, debuffs, or other gameplay modifiers.
