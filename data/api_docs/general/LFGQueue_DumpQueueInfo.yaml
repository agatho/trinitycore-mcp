  class: LFGQueue
  method: DumpQueueInfo
  signature: std::string LFGQueue::DumpQueueInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Generates and returns a formatted string containing detailed information
    about the current state of the LFG queue.
  description: The DumpQueueInfo method provides a comprehensive overview of the current
    LFG (Looking for Group) queue by collecting and formatting data from all active
    groups and players within the queue. This includes details such as player names,
    roles, dungeon IDs, queue times, and group compositions. The returned string is
    primarily used for debugging and administrative purposes to monitor queue behavior
    and identify potential issues or bottlenecks in group matching. The method does
    not modify any internal state and is safe to call from any thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing formatted queue information including player details,
    group data, dungeon information, and timing statistics for each queued entity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Admin Command
    code: "void HandleLfgQueueInfo(ChatHandler* handler)\n{\n    std::string queueInfo\
      \ = sLFGQueue->DumpQueueInfo();\n    handler->SendSysMessage(queueInfo.c_str());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Queue State for Debugging
    code: "void LogCurrentLfgState()\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"LFG Queue State:\\\
      n%s\", sLFGQueue->DumpQueueInfo().c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs string formatting operations and should not be called
    excessively in performance-critical code paths. The output format may change between
    TrinityCore versions as LFG mechanics evolve. The returned string is intended
    for human-readable debugging rather than programmatic parsing.
  warnings: The method does not perform any locking internally, so calling it while
    the queue is being modified by other threads may result in inconsistent data.
    Avoid using this in high-frequency loops or performance-sensitive sections of
    code.
