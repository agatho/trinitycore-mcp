  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: OfferResurrection
  signature: bool GroupCoordinator::OfferResurrection(Player * target)
documentation:
  brief: Offers a resurrection to a target player within the group coordinator's scope.
  description: The OfferResurrection method attempts to initiate a resurrection offer
    for a specified target player. This method is typically used in group coordination
    scenarios, such as when a player dies and the group coordinator (often the group
    leader or a designated healer) offers to resurrect the fallen player. The method
    checks if the target player is eligible for resurrection and whether the coordinator
    has the necessary permissions or resources to perform the action. It returns true
    if the resurrection offer was successfully initiated, and false otherwise. This
    functionality is integral to group-based gameplay mechanics in World of Warcraft,
    particularly in scenarios involving raid encounters or group dungeons where coordinated
    resurrection is required.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Player object that will receive the resurrection
      offer. The target must be a valid player within the group coordinator's scope
      and must be in a state where resurrection can be offered (e.g., dead or spirit-bound).
  returns: Returns true if the resurrection offer was successfully initiated for the
    target player, false otherwise. This could fail due to invalid target state, insufficient
    permissions, or lack of available resurrection resources.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resurrection Offer
    code: "Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Assume this is a valid dead player\nGroupCoordinator*\
      \ coordinator = ...; // Assume this is a valid group coordinator\nbool result\
      \ = coordinator->OfferResurrection(targetPlayer);\nif (result) {\n    // Resurrection\
      \ offer sent successfully\n} else {\n    // Failed to send resurrection offer\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the group's resurrection mechanics and
    may involve checking for cooldowns, available resurrection spells, or player states.
    It is assumed that the GroupCoordinator instance has proper context about the
    group and its members.
  warnings: Ensure that the target player is valid and in a state where a resurrection
    can be offered. Passing an invalid or null pointer could lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. The method may also fail silently if the coordinator lacks necessary
    permissions or resources.
