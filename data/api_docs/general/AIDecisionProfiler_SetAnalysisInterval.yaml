  class: AIDecisionProfiler
  method: SetAnalysisInterval
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::SetAnalysisInterval(uint64_t intervalMicroseconds)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the analysis interval for AI decision profiling in microseconds.
  description: Configures the time interval at which AI decision profiling data is
    analyzed and recorded. This method controls how frequently the profiler samples
    and processes AI decision-making behavior within the TrinityCore framework. The
    interval is specified in microseconds, allowing for precise timing control over
    profiling operations. Setting this value affects how often performance metrics
    are collected for AI systems, particularly useful for debugging and optimizing
    NPC behavior. This setting does not affect real-time gameplay but influences the
    granularity of profiling data generated during development and testing phases.
  parameters:
  - name: intervalMicroseconds
    description: The time interval between successive AI decision analysis operations,
      specified in microseconds. Valid values are positive integers representing time
      duration. Lower values increase profiling frequency and data granularity but
      may impact performance. Higher values reduce overhead but provide less detailed
      timing information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set profiling interval to 10 milliseconds
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      profiler.SetAnalysisInterval(10000); // 10 milliseconds in microseconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configure high-frequency AI profiling for debugging
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler* profiler = AIGlobal::GetProfiler();

      profiler->SetAnalysisInterval(1000); // 1 millisecond interval for detailed
      analysis'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for development and debugging purposes.
    The profiler may not be active in production builds. Setting very small intervals
    (less than 100 microseconds) could potentially impact server performance due to
    frequent sampling overhead.
  warnings: Modifying the analysis interval during active profiling sessions may cause
    inconsistent data collection. Ensure that profiling is disabled or paused before
    changing this value if precise timing is required.
