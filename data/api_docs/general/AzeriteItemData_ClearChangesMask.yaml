documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the Azerite item data, resetting its modified
    state.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with an AzeriteItemData object. This operation effectively marks the item as no
    longer having any pending modifications or unsaved changes. It is typically used
    after synchronizing the item's state with the server or when discarding temporary
    modifications. The method does not affect the actual Azerite properties or data,
    only the tracking mechanism that indicates whether changes have been made since
    the last reset.

  - title: Resetting Changes Mask After Synchronization
    code: 'AzeriteItemData* azeriteItem = player->GetAzeriteItem();

      // ... perform some modifications ...

      azeriteItem->ClearChangesMask(); // Reset the mask after saving changes'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Azerite system in TrinityCore, which handles the
    tracking of item modifications for Azerite-equipped gear. The changes mask is
    crucial for determining what data needs to be sent to the client or saved to the
    database.
