documentation:
  brief: Destroys an OnlyOnceAreaTriggerScript instance, cleaning up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the OnlyOnceAreaTriggerScript class is responsible
    for properly cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were
    used during the lifetime of the script instance. This method ensures that no memory
    leaks occur when the area trigger script object is removed from memory. In the
    context of TrinityCore's scripting system, this typically involves releasing references
    to game objects, clearing internal state, and performing any necessary cleanup
    operations before the object is fully destroyed. The destructor is automatically
    invoked by the engine when the script instance is no longer needed.

  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of area trigger script
    code: "class MyAreaTriggerScript : public OnlyOnceAreaTriggerScript\n{\npublic:\n\
      \    MyAreaTriggerScript() : OnlyOnceAreaTriggerScript(\"MyAreaTrigger\") {}\n\
      \    ~MyAreaTriggerScript() override {}\n};\n\n// The destructor is automatically\
      \ called when the script instance is destroyed"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called manually unless implementing custom memory
    management. It's important to ensure that any virtual methods or overridden functions
    in derived classes are properly handled during destruction to prevent undefined
    behavior.
