  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadSkillTiers()
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes skill tier data for all skills from the database into
    memory.
  description: The LoadSkillTiers method retrieves skill tier information from the
    database tables and populates internal data structures used by the ObjectMgr class.
    This method is typically called during server startup or reload operations to
    ensure that all skill tiers are properly loaded and available for use in game
    mechanics such as skill progression, talent trees, and profession requirements.
    The method iterates through the skill tier definitions stored in the database
    and constructs in-memory representations that can be quickly accessed during gameplay.
    It ensures that skill tiers are correctly mapped to their respective skills and
    that all required data integrity checks are performed before making the skill
    tiers available to the game engine.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeServer()\n{\n    ObjectMgr::instance()->LoadSkillTiers();\n\
      \    // Skill tiers are now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    reloading skill data. It's typically invoked by the main ObjectMgr initialization
    process and is not intended to be called repeatedly during normal gameplay operations.
    The method performs database queries and may cause a temporary performance impact
    during server startup.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times during runtime can lead to duplicate
    entries in internal data structures and potential memory leaks. It should never
    be invoked from within high-frequency game loops or concurrent threads without
    proper synchronization.
