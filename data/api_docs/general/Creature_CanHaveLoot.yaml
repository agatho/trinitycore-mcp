  signature: bool Creature::CanHaveLoot() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a creature can have loot items.
  description: This method checks if a creature is eligible to drop loot items based
    on its type and status. It evaluates whether the creature has been killed and
    can potentially yield loot, which is essential for determining loot distribution
    behavior in World of Warcraft. The method considers various game mechanics including
    creature kill status, lootable state, and potential loot generation conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature can have loot, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the creature's loot status allows for loot item distribution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (creature->CanHaveLoot()) {\n    // Creature can have loot\n    // Proceed\
      \ with loot logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "bool hasLoot = creature->CanHaveLoot();\nif (hasLoot && creature->GetLootStatus()\
      \ == LOOT_STATUS_NOT_READY) {\n    // Creature can have loot but hasn't been\
      \ ready for loot yet\n}\nelse if (hasLoot && creature->GetLootStatus() == LOOT_STATUS_READY)\
      \ {\n    // Creature is ready for loot\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method typically checks the creature's kill status and whether it has
    been killed by a player. It may also consider if the creature is flagged for PvP
    or has been killed by a non-player character. Implementation details include checking
    against various creature types and loot-related flags.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a creature can drop loot
    items in all cases, as some creatures may have specific loot conditions that override
    this method's behavior. Always verify with the actual creature's loot status before
    proceeding with loot distribution logic.
