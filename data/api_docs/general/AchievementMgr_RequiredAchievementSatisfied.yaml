documentation:
  brief: Checks whether all required achievements for a given achievement are satisfied
    by the player.
  description: The RequiredAchievementSatisfied method determines if a player has
    met all prerequisite achievements necessary to earn a specific achievement. This
    method is typically used during achievement evaluation to ensure that dependencies
    are properly fulfilled before an achievement can be awarded. The check involves
    verifying that all achievements listed as prerequisites in the achievement's data
    have been completed by the player. If any required achievement is missing, the
    method returns false; otherwise, it returns true. This functionality supports
    the hierarchical structure of achievements in World of Warcraft where some achievements
    require others to be completed first.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all required achievements for the specified achievement
    are satisfied by the player, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (player->GetAchievementMgr()->RequiredAchievementSatisfied(12345)) {\n\
      \    // Player has all required achievements\n    // Proceed with achievement\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Achievement Awarding
    code: "uint32 achievementId = 67890;\nif (achievementMgr->RequiredAchievementSatisfied(achievementId))\
      \ {\n    // Check if player already has this achievement\n    if (!player->HasAchievement(achievementId))\
      \ {\n        // Award the achievement\n        player->CompletedAchievement(achievementId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal achievement tracking and prerequisite validation
    logic. It should only be called when the player's achievement data is fully loaded
    and synchronized. The method does not perform any database operations itself but
    depends on cached achievement data within the AchievementMgr instance.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called during achievement evaluation cycles
    where prerequisite relationships might be temporarily inconsistent. Avoid calling
    this method in performance-critical sections without verifying that the player's
    achievement data is up-to-date.
