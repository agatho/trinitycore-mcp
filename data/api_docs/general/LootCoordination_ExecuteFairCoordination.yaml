  class: LootCoordination
  method: ExecuteFairCoordination
  signature: void LootCoordination::ExecuteFairCoordination(Group * group, const LootItem
    & item)
documentation:
  brief: Executes fair loot coordination for a group and item, ensuring equitable
    distribution among group members.
  description: The ExecuteFairCoordination method handles the process of fairly distributing
    loot items to group members within the TrinityCore framework. It evaluates the
    group's loot settings, player eligibility, and distribution rules to ensure that
    items are awarded in a manner consistent with the configured loot system (e.g.,
    round-robin, free-for-all, or master loot). This method is typically invoked when
    a loot item is ready to be assigned to a group member, and it respects the group's
    loot master, loot threshold, and other relevant settings. The method does not
    return any value but modifies internal state related to loot assignment and group
    coordination.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group that will receive
      the loot item. Must be a valid group with at least one member.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing information about
      the item being distributed, including item ID, stack size, and other loot properties.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a loot handler
    code: "void HandleLootDrop(Player* player, Group* group, LootItem& item)\n{\n\
      \    if (group && item.is_looted == false)\n    {\n        LootCoordination::ExecuteFairCoordination(group,\
      \ item);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal loot coordination system and should only
    be called when a group is ready to distribute a loot item. It assumes that the
    group's loot settings are properly initialized and that the item has not yet been
    assigned to a player. The method may trigger additional events or updates in the
    game state depending on the loot rules.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid group pointer or uninitialized item
    data can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the group is valid
    and the item's properties are correctly set before invoking this method.
