documentation:
  brief: Initializes end grid information for flight path movement generation.
  description: The InitEndGridInfo method prepares internal data structures required
    for managing flight path movements within the game world. It sets up necessary
    grid-related metadata that allows the movement generator to properly handle transitions
    between different grid boundaries during flight path execution. This method is
    typically invoked during the initialization phase of a flight path movement generator
    to ensure accurate positioning and navigation across the game world's grid system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'FlightPathMovementGenerator* generator = new FlightPathMovementGenerator();

      generator->InitEndGridInfo();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal movement system and should not be called
    directly by external code. It's typically invoked automatically during the construction
    or activation of a flight path movement generator within the TrinityCore framework.
