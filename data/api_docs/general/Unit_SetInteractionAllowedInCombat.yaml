  class: Unit
  method: SetInteractionAllowedInCombat
  signature: void Unit::SetInteractionAllowedInCombat(bool interactionAllowed)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the unit allows interaction during combat.
  description: This method controls whether a unit can be interacted with while in
    combat. When set to true, the unit will allow other players or NPCs to interact
    with it even while engaged in combat. When set to false, the unit will not permit
    any interaction during combat. This is particularly useful for managing NPC behavior
    and player interactions during combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: interactionAllowed
    description: A boolean value indicating whether interaction should be allowed
      during combat. True allows interaction, false prevents it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* target = GetTarget();\n target->SetInteractionAllowedInCombat(true);\n\
      \ // Now the target can be interacted with even while in combat"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the unit's ability to be interacted with during combat,
    which is crucial for managing NPC behavior and player interactions. The setting
    will persist until explicitly changed or until the unit leaves combat.
