  class: MotionMaster
  method: MoveSeekAssistanceDistract
  signature: void MotionMaster::MoveSeekAssistanceDistract(uint32 timer)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a movement behavior that seeks assistance while distracted, typically
    used for NPC combat AI.
  description: The MoveSeekAssistanceDistract method instructs the motion master to
    begin a specific movement pattern where the unit will seek assistance from nearby
    allies while being distracted. This behavior is commonly employed in World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore AI system for NPCs that are engaged in combat but need
    to draw attention or call for help. The timer parameter controls how long this
    distracted state persists before the unit resumes normal behavior. This method
    modifies the motion master's current movement state and may interrupt any ongoing
    movement sequences.
  parameters:
  - name: timer
    description: The duration in milliseconds that the unit will remain in the distracted
      state, seeking assistance from nearby allies.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n \
      \       return;\n\n    if (me->HealthBelowPct(30))\n    {\n        // Trigger\
      \ distraction and seek assistance when health drops below 30%\n        me->GetMotionMaster()->MoveSeekAssistanceDistract(5000);\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n\n    // Continue normal combat behavior\n    DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other motion commands and
    should be called only when the unit is in a valid state for movement. The timer
    value determines how long the NPC remains distracted before potentially resuming
    normal behavior or seeking further assistance.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper checks may cause unexpected behavior
    if the unit is already performing another movement action. Ensure that the unit
    is not in an invalid state (e.g., dead, rooted) before invoking this motion command.
