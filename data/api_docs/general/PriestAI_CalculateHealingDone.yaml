  class: PriestAI
  method: CalculateHealingDone
  signature: int PriestAI::CalculateHealingDone() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total healing amount that the priest AI unit can
    perform based on current stats and spell configurations.
  description: The CalculateHealingDone method computes the estimated healing output
    for a priest AI unit. This calculation takes into account various factors such
    as the priest's base healing capabilities, spell power, critical strike chance,
    and any active buffs or debuffs that may affect healing performance. The method
    is typically used during AI decision-making processes to determine optimal healing
    targets and actions. It serves as a core component in evaluating the effectiveness
    of different healing spells and strategies within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated total healing amount
    that the priest AI unit can potentially deliver. This value is used internally
    by the AI system to make decisions about spell selection and target prioritization
    during combat situations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "int healingAmount = priestAI->CalculateHealingDone();\nif (healingAmount\
      \ > 1000)\n{\n    // Prioritize healing over damage\n    priestAI->SelectBestHealTarget();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called frequently during AI update cycles, so performance
    considerations are important. The calculation may involve multiple internal functions
    and could be affected by temporary modifiers such as buffs or debuffs. The returned
    value should be treated as an estimate rather than a precise measurement.
  warnings: Do not rely on this method for real-time healing calculations in combat
    scenarios where precision is critical, as it provides estimates only. The result
    may vary depending on the current state of the AI unit and its environment.
