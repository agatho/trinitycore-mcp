  class: BotTalentManager
  method: EnableDualSpec
  signature: bool BotTalentManager::EnableDualSpec(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Enables dual specialization for a bot player, allowing them to switch between
    two different talent builds.
  description: The EnableDualSpec method configures a bot player to utilize dual specialization
    mechanics, which is a World of Warcraft feature that allows players to maintain
    two separate sets of talents and switch between them. This functionality is particularly
    useful in TrinityCore-based private servers where bot management systems are implemented.
    The method likely modifies internal player flags or talent data structures to
    enable this capability. It may require the bot to meet certain prerequisites such
    as being at an appropriate level or having sufficient talent points available.
    The operation typically involves updating the player's specialization state and
    ensuring that the dual spec system is properly initialized within the game's talent
    management framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the dual specialization was successfully enabled for the
    bot player, false otherwise. A return value of false could indicate that the bot
    does not meet prerequisites, the method failed to apply necessary changes, or
    the player is not in a valid state to enable dual spec.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is already initialized\nif (BotTalentManager::EnableDualSpec(bot))\
      \ {\n    // Dual spec enabled successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Dual specialization\
      \ enabled for bot %s\", bot->GetName().c_str());\n} else {\n    // Failed to\
      \ enable dual spec\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to enable dual specialization\
      \ for bot %s\", bot->GetName().c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with TrinityCore's internal talent and specialization
    systems. It may require the player to be in a valid state (not in combat, not
    in a taxi flight, etc.) for successful execution. The implementation might involve
    updating database entries or in-memory structures related to player specialization
    data.
  warnings: Calling this method on a bot that is already in combat or during active
    gameplay may result in undefined behavior. Ensure the bot is in a safe state before
    attempting to enable dual specialization. This method should not be called repeatedly
    without checking the current state, as it might cause performance issues or conflicts
    with existing talent management systems.
