  class: MailDraft
  method: GetSubject
  signature: const std::string & MailDraft::GetSubject() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the subject line of the mail draft.
  description: The GetSubject method returns a constant reference to the string containing
    the subject line of the mail draft. This method allows access to the subject that
    has been set for a mail message before it is sent. The returned reference provides
    direct access to the internal subject string, so modifications to the returned
    string will affect the mail draft's subject. This functionality is commonly used
    when preparing or retrieving mail content within the TrinityCore server environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string representing the subject line of
    the mail draft. The string is empty if no subject has been set yet.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Mail Subject
    code: 'MailDraft draft;

      draft.SetSubject("Important Update");

      const std::string& subject = draft.GetSubject();

      // subject now contains "Important Update"'
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Mail Subject Before Sending
    code: "MailDraft draft;\ndraft.SetSubject(\"Weekly Report\");\nif (!draft.GetSubject().empty())\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with sending the mail\n    draft.SendMailTo(...);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to internal memory managed by the MailDraft
    object. Modifying the string through this reference directly changes the subject
    of the mail draft. This method is thread-safe as long as no other threads are
    modifying the same MailDraft instance concurrently.
  warnings: Be cautious when modifying the returned string, as it directly affects
    the mail draft's subject. If multiple threads access and modify the same MailDraft
    object, synchronization must be implemented to prevent race conditions.
