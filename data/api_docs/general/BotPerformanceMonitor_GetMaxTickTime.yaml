  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: GetMaxTickTime
  signature: uint32 BotPerformanceMonitor::GetMaxTickTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the maximum tick time recorded by the bot performance monitor.
  description: The GetMaxTickTime method returns the highest recorded tick time value
    from the BotPerformanceMonitor instance. This value represents the longest duration
    a single tick (update cycle) took to complete, which is useful for monitoring
    performance bottlenecks in bot behavior. The method provides insight into how
    efficiently bots are processing their AI updates and can help identify when performance
    degradation occurs. This metric is typically updated during each tick cycle as
    part of the monitoring process.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the maximum tick time in milliseconds.
    A higher value indicates longer processing times for bot AI updates, which may
    suggest performance issues or complex bot behaviors that require optimization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      uint32 maxTickTime = monitor.GetMaxTickTime();

      TC_LOG_INFO("bot", "Maximum tick time: {} ms", maxTickTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring
    code: "void CheckBotPerformance()\n{\n    static BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;\n\
      \    uint32 maxTime = monitor.GetMaxTickTime();\n    if (maxTime > 100) // Threshold\
      \ for performance warning\n    {\n        TC_LOG_WARN(\"bot\", \"High bot tick\
      \ time detected: {} ms\", maxTime);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other performance monitoring
    functions to provide a complete picture of bot behavior. The returned value should
    be interpreted in context of the overall system load and expected bot complexity.
    This function is thread-safe as it only reads stored values without modifying
    internal state.
  warnings: The maximum tick time may not reflect real-time performance if the monitor
    has not been actively recording ticks recently. Values may also be misleading
    if the monitoring period is too short to capture peak performance scenarios.
