documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player is currently at the auction house.
  description: The IsAtAuctionHouse method determines if the player character is currently
    located within the auction house area. This method is typically used to control
    access to auction-related functionality and ensure that players can only interact
    with the auction system when they are physically present in the auction house.
    The check may involve verifying the player's current map, zone, or specific position
    within the auction house building. This is a read-only query that does not modify
    any state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently at the auction house, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the player's character is located in the auction house
    area and can interact with auction services.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check auction house access
    code: "if (player->GetAuctionHouse()->IsAtAuctionHouse()) {\n    // Allow auction\
      \ interactions\n    player->SendAuctionHello();\n} else {\n    // Deny access\
      \ or show error message\n    player->SendNotification(\"You must be at the auction\
      \ house to use this service.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a quick location check using the player's current
    map ID and possibly zone ID. It may also verify that the player is not in a combat
    state or other restricted condition. The implementation might cache the result
    for performance reasons if called frequently.
  warnings: Be aware that this check only verifies physical presence at the auction
    house, not whether the player has proper permissions or items to perform specific
    auction actions. Additionally, players may be teleported out of the auction house
    during certain events, so this check should be performed before each auction interaction.
