documentation:
  brief: Destroys a Group object and cleans up all associated resources.
  description: The Group destructor is automatically called when a Group object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures proper cleanup of group members,
    removes the group from any active systems, and releases all memory allocated for
    the group's data structures. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft
    emulation, this method handles the finalization of group-related game state, including
    updating player references and notifying subsystems that the group is no longer
    valid. The destructor does not take any parameters and performs no return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of a Group object
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    Group* group = new Group();\n    // ...\
      \ perform group operations ...\n    delete group; // Triggers ~Group destructor\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Group destruction in a scope
    code: "void AnotherExample()\n{\n    {\n        Group group;\n        // ... use\
      \ group ...\n    } // ~Group called automatically here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when a Group object
    is destroyed. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless explicitly
    managing memory through raw pointers. The cleanup process includes removing all
    players from the group, updating their group references to nullptr, and ensuring
    no dangling pointers remain in the system.
  warnings: Do not call this destructor directly on stack-allocated objects as it
    will be invoked automatically. Avoid manual deletion of Group objects unless you
    are certain about ownership semantics, as improper handling may lead to memory
    leaks or double-free errors.
