documentation:
  brief: Switches the hunter's current aspect to the movement aspect, enabling increased
    mobility and speed.
  description: The SwitchToMovementAspect method is used in the HunterAI class to
    transition the hunter character from their current aspect to the Movement Aspect.
    This aspect typically provides benefits such as increased movement speed, reduced
    casting time, or other mobility-related enhancements. The method likely modifies
    the hunter's current aspect state and applies relevant buffs or adjustments to
    their gameplay behavior. It is commonly invoked during combat situations where
    the hunter needs to reposition quickly or when switching between different tactical
    approaches.

    code: "void MyHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_shouldSwitchToMovement)\n\
      \    {\n        SwitchToMovementAspect();\n        m_shouldSwitchToMovement\
      \ = false;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI logic for hunter characters in TrinityCore.
    It likely interacts with the hunter's aspect system, which is a core gameplay
    mechanic in World of Warcraft. The implementation may involve updating internal
    state variables and applying temporary buffs or debuffs to the hunter character.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called when appropriate for the hunter's
    current situation to avoid unintended gameplay consequences. Calling this method
    outside of combat or inappropriate contexts might cause unexpected behavior or
    violate game balance mechanics.
