  class: Battleground
  method: UpdatePlayerScore
  signature: bool Battleground::UpdatePlayerScore(Player * player, int type, int value,
    bool doAddHonor, int source)
documentation:
  brief: Updates a player's score in a battleground, optionally awarding honor.
  description: The UpdatePlayerScore method is used to modify a player's score within
    a battleground instance. It allows for incrementing or decrementing a player's
    score based on the provided type and value parameters. The method can also optionally
    award honor points to the player depending on the doAddHonor flag. This functionality
    is crucial for tracking player performance and determining rewards during battleground
    events such as capture the flag or arena matches. The method returns true if the
    update was successful, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose score needs to be updated. Must
      not be null.
  - name: type
    description: Integer representing the type of score update. Common values include
      points for captures, kills, or objectives completed. The exact meaning depends
      on the battleground type and implementation.
  - name: value
    description: Integer value to add or subtract from the player's score. Positive
      values increase the score, negative values decrease it.
  - name: doAddHonor
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether honor points should be awarded to
      the player based on this score update. If true, honor is added; if false, no
      honor is granted.
  - name: source
    description: Integer identifier representing the source or context of the score
      update. Used for tracking where the score change originated from within the
      battleground logic.
  returns: Returns true if the player's score was successfully updated and honored
    (if applicable), false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Awarding points for capturing a flag
    code: "Battleground* bg = player->GetBattleground();\nif (bg)\n{\n    bg->UpdatePlayerScore(player,\
      \ SCORE_FLAG_CAPTURES, 1, true, 0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding points for a kill in an arena
    code: "Battleground* bg = player->GetBattleground();\nif (bg)\n{\n    bg->UpdatePlayerScore(player,\
      \ SCORE_KILLING_BLOW, 1, false, 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by battleground systems when certain
    events occur. Developers should ensure that the player is actually part of a battleground
    before calling this method. The source parameter can be used for debugging or
    tracking purposes to identify where score changes originated.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null player pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the player is valid and currently participating in a battleground
    before invoking this function. Incorrect use of the type parameter may lead to
    unexpected score modifications.
