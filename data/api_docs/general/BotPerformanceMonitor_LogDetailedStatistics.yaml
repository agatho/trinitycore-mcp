documentation:
  brief: Logs detailed performance statistics for bot operations to the system log
  description: The LogDetailedStatistics method outputs comprehensive performance
    metrics related to bot behavior and resource usage. This includes timing data,
    memory consumption, and operational efficiency indicators. The method is typically
    invoked during periodic monitoring or when performance issues are suspected. It
    aggregates data from various subsystems within the bot framework and writes structured
    information to the TrinityCore logging system for analysis by developers and administrators.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Performance Monitoring
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      monitor.LogDetailedStatistics();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from within the game's main thread and
    may include blocking operations during log writing. It should not be invoked excessively
    in performance-critical sections of code due to potential logging overhead.
