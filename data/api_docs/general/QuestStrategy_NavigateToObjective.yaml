  class: QuestStrategy
  method: NavigateToObjective
  signature: void QuestStrategy::NavigateToObjective(BotAI * ai, const int & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates navigation to a quest objective for the bot AI.
  description: The NavigateToObjective method is responsible for guiding a bot AI
    character toward a specific quest objective identified by its index. This method
    typically involves pathfinding and movement logic to ensure the bot moves efficiently
    towards the required location or target. It integrates with the broader QuestStrategy
    framework to manage quest progression and objective completion. The method assumes
    that the bot has already been assigned a quest and that the objective index is
    valid within the current quest context.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that will perform the navigation. This
      parameter provides access to the AI's state, movement capabilities, and quest
      data.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to an integer representing the index of the quest objective
      to navigate toward. The value should correspond to a valid objective within
      the current quest's objective list.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Navigation Example
    code: "void example() {\n    BotAI* botAI = GetBotAI();\n    int questObjectiveIndex\
      \ = 0;\n    QuestStrategy strategy;\n    strategy.NavigateToObjective(botAI,\
      \ questObjectiveIndex);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying AI's pathfinding system and may require
    the bot to be in a valid state for movement. It is typically called during quest
    progression logic when the bot needs to move toward a specific objective.
  warnings: Ensure that the objective index passed is valid and corresponds to an
    existing quest objective, otherwise behavior is undefined. The method does not
    validate the AI's current state before initiating navigation.
