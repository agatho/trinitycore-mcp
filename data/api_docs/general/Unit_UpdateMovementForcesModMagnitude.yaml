  method: UpdateMovementForcesModMagnitude
  signature: void Unit::UpdateMovementForcesModMagnitude()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the magnitude of movement forces applied to the unit.
  description: The UpdateMovementForcesModMagnitude method recalculates and applies
    any modifications to the unit's movement forces, such as those caused by buffs,
    debuffs, or environmental effects. This method is typically invoked during the
    update cycle to ensure that the unit's movement speed and direction are accurately
    reflected based on current modifiers. It handles internal state updates for movement-related
    auras and effects, ensuring consistency between the game logic and visual representation
    of the unit's motion.

  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void GameUpdate()\n{\n    // ...\n    player->UpdateMovementForcesModMagnitude();\n\
      \    // ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the core update loop and should
    not typically be invoked manually unless implementing custom movement logic or
    debugging. It may trigger recalculations for speed, acceleration, and movement
    direction modifiers.
