documentation:
  brief: Returns the current number of available mana soul shards for the player
  description: The GetAvailable method retrieves the count of mana soul shards that
    are currently available for use by the player. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    implementation, mana soul shards are a resource type used primarily by certain
    classes or abilities that consume mana soul shards as part of their mechanics.
    This method provides access to the current quantity of these shards in the player's
    possession, which can be used to determine whether an ability requiring mana soul
    shards can be cast or if additional shards need to be acquired. The returned value
    represents a non-negative integer indicating how many usable shards are available
    at the time of the call.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of available mana soul shards. Returns
    zero if no shards are currently available or if the resource is not applicable
    to the player's class/ability.
  examples:
  - title: Check Available Mana Soul Shards Before Casting
    code: "uint32 shards = player->GetPlayer()->GetManaSoulShardResourceDestro()->GetAvailable();\n\
      if (shards > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with ability that consumes mana soul shards\n\
      \    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_CONSUME_MANA_SOUL_SHARD, true);\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Notify player that they don't have enough shards\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Not enough Mana Soul Shards.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with resource management systems
    for classes like Warlocks or other specializations that utilize mana soul shards.
    The value returned may change dynamically as the player gains or spends shards
    during gameplay.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called on valid instances of ManaSoulShardResourceDestro
    to avoid undefined behavior. Also, be aware that calling this method frequently
    in tight loops might impact performance if not cached appropriately.
