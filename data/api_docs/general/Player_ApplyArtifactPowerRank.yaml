  class: Player
  method: ApplyArtifactPowerRank
  signature: void Player::ApplyArtifactPowerRank(Item * artifact, const ArtifactPowerRankEntry
    * artifactPowerRank, bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Applies an artifact power rank to the player's artifact item.
  description: This method applies a specific artifact power rank to the player's
    artifact item, modifying the artifact's power progression and potentially unlocking
    new abilities or bonuses. The method handles both the application and removal
    of artifact power ranks, allowing for dynamic artifact progression within the
    game mechanics. It is typically used during artifact advancement or when changing
    artifact power configurations.
  parameters:
  - name: artifact
    description: The artifact item to which the power rank will be applied. Must be
      a valid artifact item with proper artifact properties.
  - name: artifactPowerRank
    description: The artifact power rank entry that defines the specific power to
      apply. This must be a valid ArtifactPowerRankEntry structure containing power
      information.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the artifact power rank from the artifact.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Artifact Power Rank Application
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      Item* artifact = player->GetItemBySlot(ITEM_SLOT_ARTIFACT);

      ArtifactPowerRankEntry* powerRank = sArtifactPowerRankStore.LookupEntry(12345);

      player->ApplyArtifactPowerRank(artifact, powerRank, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method requires that the artifact item be valid and have proper artifact
    properties. It modifies the artifact's internal state and may trigger updates
    to the player's artifact progression. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with other artifact-related methods for complete artifact management.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect artifact progression
    or missing power ranks. Care must be taken when applying or removing artifact
    power ranks to ensure proper game balance and progression.
