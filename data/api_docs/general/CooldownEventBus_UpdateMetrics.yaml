  signature: void CooldownEventBus::UpdateMetrics(std::chrono::microseconds processingTime)
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal metrics with the given processing time for cooldown events
  description: The UpdateMetrics method is responsible for recording and updating
    performance metrics related to cooldown event processing within the CooldownEventBus.
    It accepts a std::chrono::microseconds parameter representing the time taken to
    process a cooldown event, which is then used to maintain statistics about system
    performance. This method likely contributes to monitoring and debugging capabilities
    by tracking how long cooldown operations take to complete. The method is typically
    called internally by the system when cooldown events are processed, ensuring that
    performance data remains up-to-date for analysis or logging purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: processingTime
    description: The time taken to process a cooldown event, measured in microseconds.
      This value represents the duration from start to completion of the cooldown
      processing operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'CooldownEventBus bus;

      std::chrono::microseconds time(1500);

      bus.UpdateMetrics(time);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with timing measurement
    code: '#include <chrono>

      CooldownEventBus bus;

      auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      // ... perform cooldown processing ...

      auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      std::chrono::microseconds processingTime = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end
      - start);

      bus.UpdateMetrics(processingTime);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the CooldownEventBus system when
    cooldown events are processed. It's important to note that this method does not
    directly affect gameplay mechanics but rather provides performance monitoring
    capabilities. The processing time parameter should be measured accurately using
    high-resolution timing functions to ensure meaningful metrics.
