documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total count of all bot GUIDs managed by the optimized world
    session manager.
  description: The GetAllBotGuids method returns an integer representing the number
    of bot GUIDs currently stored or tracked within the BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized
    instance. This method is typically used to determine how many bots are active
    or registered in the system, which can be useful for debugging, performance monitoring,
    or managing bot-related operations. The method does not modify any internal state
    and is read-only in nature. It assumes that the session manager has been properly
    initialized with bot data and that the GUIDs are accessible through an internal
    collection or container.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value indicating the total number of bot GUIDs managed by this
    instance. A return value of zero suggests no bots are currently tracked, while
    a positive integer reflects the actual count of registered bots.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int botCount = sessionMgr.GetAllBotGuids();\nif (botCount > 0) {\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Found \" << botCount << \" bots.\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"No bots found.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely iterates over an internal container holding bot GUIDs
    and returns its size. It's important to note that the returned count may not reflect
    live bot status if the session manager supports dynamic addition/removal of bots.
