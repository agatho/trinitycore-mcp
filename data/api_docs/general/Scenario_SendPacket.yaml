  method: SendPacket
  signature: void Scenario::SendPacket(const int * data) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a packet containing scenario data to the client.
  description: The SendPacket method is used to transmit scenario-related data from
    the server to connected clients. This method takes an integer array as input,
    which typically represents structured scenario information such as objectives,
    progress, or rewards. The packet is sent using the underlying TrinityCore networking
    system and is specifically designed for scenario-based content within World of
    Warcraft. It's commonly used during scenario start, update, and completion events
    to synchronize client-side UI elements with server state.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array containing scenario data. The array structure
      is defined by the specific scenario type and typically includes objective states,
      progress values, and reward information. Must not be null.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Sending Scenario Progress Update
    code: 'int scenarioData[] = {1001, 50, 25, 75};

      scenario->SendPacket(scenarioData);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending Scenario Completion Packet
    code: 'int completionData[] = {1001, 100, 100, 100, 1};

      scenario->SendPacket(completionData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the context of TrinityCore's scenario system
    and requires that the scenario object is properly initialized. The data array
    must be carefully structured to match expected packet formats for the specific
    scenario type. The method does not perform any validation on the input data, so
    developers must ensure proper formatting before calling.
  warnings: Calling SendPacket with an invalid or improperly formatted data pointer
    can cause undefined behavior or client-side crashes. Always verify that the scenario
    object is valid and that the data array contains correct values for the expected
    scenario type. Avoid calling this method from within critical sections of code
    where packet sending might interfere with other operations.
