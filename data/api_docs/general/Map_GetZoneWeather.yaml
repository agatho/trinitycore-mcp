  method: GetZoneWeather
  signature: WeatherState Map::GetZoneWeather(uint32 zoneId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current weather state for a specified zone.
  description: This method returns the weather state of a specific zone within the
    game world. It provides information about the current atmospheric conditions in
    that zone, including whether it's clear, stormy, or snowy. The weather state is
    determined by the zone's ID and reflects the actual game mechanics that affect
    player experience, such as visibility, movement restrictions, and environmental
    effects. This method is commonly used to determine zone-specific weather conditions
    for gameplay purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a WeatherState enum value representing the current weather condition
    in the specified zone. Possible values include Clear, Rain, Snow, and Storm, indicating
    the type of weather present in that zone.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "WeatherState weather = map->GetZoneWeather(1234);\nif (weather == WeatherState::Clear)\n\
      {\n    // Handle clear weather\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with zone ID mapping and may
    not always return accurate results if the zone has not been properly initialized
    or if weather systems are not active. Performance considerations include potential
    overhead when calling this method frequently, especially in areas with many zones.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it may not reflect real-time
    weather changes. Weather conditions can change dynamically based on game events
    and time of day, so results may be outdated if used without proper synchronization.
