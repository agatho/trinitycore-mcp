  class: BotChatCommandHandler
  method: SendResponse
  signature: void BotChatCommandHandler::SendResponse(const CommandContext & context,
    const CommandResponse & response)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a command response back to the chat context.
  description: The SendResponse method is responsible for delivering a CommandResponse
    object back to the originating chat context. It handles the logic of formatting
    and transmitting the response message to the appropriate player or channel. This
    method is typically invoked by command handlers within the BotChatCommandHandler
    class to communicate results, errors, or informational messages back to users
    who issued commands. The method ensures proper handling of different response
    types including success messages, error notifications, and detailed command outputs.
  parameters:
  - name: context
    description: The CommandContext object containing information about the originating
      command request, including player, channel, and command details.
  - name: response
    description: The CommandResponse object containing the response data to be sent
      back to the chat context, including message content, type, and formatting information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Response Sending
    code: "void MyCommandHandler(BotChatCommandHandler* handler, const CommandContext&\
      \ context, const CommandResponse& response) {\n    handler->SendResponse(context,\
      \ response);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending Success Message
    code: 'CommandContext ctx;

      CommandResponse resp;

      resp.type = CommandResponseType::SUCCESS;

      resp.message = "Command executed successfully";

      handler->SendResponse(ctx, resp);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely handles different response types and formats messages
    according to the context's requirements. It may perform additional processing
    such as permission checks or message filtering before sending. The implementation
    should be thread-safe if used in concurrent environments.
  warnings: Ensure that the CommandContext and CommandResponse objects are properly
    initialized before calling this method, as invalid data could lead to communication
    failures or unexpected behavior.
