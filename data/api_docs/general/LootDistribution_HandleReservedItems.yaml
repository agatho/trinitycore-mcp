  class: LootDistribution
  method: HandleReservedItems
  signature: void LootDistribution::HandleReservedItems(Group * group, const int &
    reservedItems, Player * reserver)
documentation:
  brief: Processes reserved loot items for a group, assigning them to the designated
    reserver.
  description: The HandleReservedItems method manages the distribution of loot items
    that have been marked as reserved for a specific player within a group context.
    This method ensures that reserved items are properly allocated to the intended
    recipient, typically used during group loot distribution scenarios where certain
    items are designated for particular players. The method takes into account the
    group's current loot distribution state and updates the item ownership accordingly.
    It is commonly invoked during group loot rolling or when a group leader assigns
    specific items to members.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group for which reserved
      items are being handled. Must not be null.
  - name: reservedItems
    description: Integer reference indicating the number of reserved items in the
      group's loot pool. This value determines how many items should be processed
      as reserved.
  - name: reserver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who is designated as the recipient of
      the reserved items. Must not be null and must be a member of the provided group.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group loot handling
    code: 'Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      Player* reserver = group->GetLeader();

      int reservedItems = 3;

      lootDistribution->HandleReservedItems(group, reservedItems, reserver);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling reserved items with error checking
    code: "if (group && reserver) {\n    int reservedItems = group->GetReservedItemCount();\n\
      \    lootDistribution->HandleReservedItems(group, reservedItems, reserver);\n\
      } else {\n    // Log error or handle invalid state\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group and reserver parameters are valid and
    properly initialized. It does not perform any validation on these inputs beyond
    null checks. The reserved items count should reflect the actual number of reserved
    items in the group's loot context.
  warnings: Ensure that the reserver player is actually a member of the provided group,
    otherwise behavior may be undefined. This method modifies internal loot state
    and should only be called during appropriate loot distribution phases to avoid
    conflicts with ongoing loot rolls.
