  class: DispelableAura
  method: DecrementCharge
  signature: bool DispelableAura::DecrementCharge(uint8 charges)
documentation:
  brief: Decrements the charge count of a dispelable aura by the specified number
    of charges.
  description: The DecrementCharge method reduces the current charge count of a DispelableAura
    object by the provided value. This is typically used in World of Warcraft mechanics
    where abilities or effects have limited uses before expiring. The method performs
    bounds checking to ensure the charge count does not go below zero. It returns
    true if the decrement was successful and false if the operation would result in
    an invalid state, such as attempting to remove more charges than are currently
    available.
  parameters:
  - name: charges
    description: The number of charges to decrement from the aura's current charge
      count. Must be a non-negative integer value.
  returns: Returns true if the charge count was successfully decremented by the specified
    amount, or false if the operation would result in an invalid state (e.g., attempting
    to remove more charges than exist).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Charge Decrement
    code: "DispelableAura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    bool\
      \ success = aura->DecrementCharge(1);\n    if (success)\n        // Charge decremented\
      \ successfully\n    else\n        // Could not decrement charges\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Charge Usage
    code: "DispelableAura* aura = player->GetAura(67890);\nif (aura)\n{\n    uint8\
      \ currentCharges = aura->GetCharges();\n    if (currentCharges > 0)\n    {\n\
      \        bool success = aura->DecrementCharge(currentCharges);\n        if (success)\n\
      \            // All charges consumed\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with aura application and removal
    logic. The internal charge tracking mechanism ensures that an aura cannot have
    negative charges, and the decrement operation may trigger aura expiration when
    charges reach zero.
  warnings: Be cautious when calling this method with a charge value greater than
    the current charge count, as it will return false and leave the aura in its original
    state. This can be used for validation purposes to prevent over-decrementing charges.
