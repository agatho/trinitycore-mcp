documentation:
  brief: Returns the bonus honor amount awarded to a player for their performance
    in a battleground.
  description: The GetBonusHonor method retrieves the additional honor points that
    a player has earned beyond their base victory or participation rewards in a battleground.
    This value is typically calculated based on various factors such as the player's
    contribution, kills, assists, and other battlefield achievements. The bonus honor
    is applied in addition to the standard honor distribution and contributes to the
    player's overall honor total. This method is commonly used during battleground
    scoring calculations and reward distribution processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the bonus honor points awarded to the player for
    their performance in the battleground. A value of zero indicates no bonus honor
    was earned.
  examples:

      Player earned %d bonus honor points.\", bonusHonor);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the battleground end sequence when
    scoring information is being processed. The bonus honor value may be zero if the
    player did not perform actions that qualify for additional rewards.
