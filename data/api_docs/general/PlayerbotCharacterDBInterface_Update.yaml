  method: Update
  signature: void PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the player bot character database interface with elapsed time differences.
  description: The Update method in PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface is responsible for
    processing and applying any pending updates or operations within the database
    interface for player bot characters. It typically handles time-based events, synchronization
    tasks, and internal state management by utilizing the provided time difference
    parameter. This method is commonly called from the game loop to ensure that all
    player bot character data remains consistent with current game conditions and
    user interactions. The implementation may involve flushing pending writes, updating
    timers, or performing periodic maintenance operations on the underlying database.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = getMSTime();\n    playerbotCharacterDBInterface.Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to maintain synchronization
    between in-game state and database records. It's typically invoked with time differences
    measured in milliseconds since the last update call.
