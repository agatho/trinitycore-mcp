  signature: bool GroupCoordinator::ShouldAcceptInvite(Player * inviter) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the group coordinator should accept an invite from a player.
  description: The ShouldAcceptInvite method evaluates whether a given player's invitation
    to join a group should be accepted by the group coordinator. This method is typically
    used during group invitation processing to determine if the inviter meets certain
    criteria for group membership, such as being in the same map, having appropriate
    permissions, or satisfying factional restrictions. The decision may also consider
    the current state of the group and the inviter's relationship with existing members.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the invite from the specified player should be accepted;
    otherwise returns false. A return value of false typically indicates that the
    invitation is rejected due to criteria such as invalid faction, distance, or group
    capacity limits.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Group Invitation Logic
    code: "if (groupCoordinator->ShouldAcceptInvite(inviter)) {\n    // Accept the\
      \ invite and add player to group\n    group->AddMember(inviter);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Reject the invite\n    inviter->SendGroupInviteResult(GROUP_INVITE_FAILED);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called during group invitation processing and may involve
    checks such as map proximity, faction alignment, or existing group membership.
    It's important to note that this method does not perform the actual invitation
    acceptance or rejection; it only determines whether an invitation should be processed
    further.
  warnings: Ensure that the inviter parameter is valid before calling this method.
    Passing a null pointer may lead to undefined behavior. Also, be aware that this
    method might have performance implications if used in frequent checks during group
    operations.
