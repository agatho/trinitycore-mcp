  class: WorldObject
  method: IsVisibilityOverridden
  signature: bool WorldObject::IsVisibilityOverridden() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the object's visibility state has been overridden by external
    factors.
  description: The IsVisibilityOverridden method checks if an object's visibility
    status has been explicitly modified or forced to a specific state, typically used
    in scenarios where normal visibility rules are bypassed. This can occur during
    stealth, invisibility effects, or other game mechanics that alter how objects
    appear to players or creatures. The method returns true if the visibility override
    is active and false otherwise. It is commonly used in visibility calculations
    and network updates to ensure correct object rendering and awareness.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the object's visibility has been overridden by an external
    mechanism, such as stealth or invisibility effects; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Player is Visibility Overridden
    code: "if (player->IsVisibilityOverridden())\n{\n    // Handle special visibility\
      \ logic\n    sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_UNITS, \"Player visibility is overridden.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in Visibility Update Logic
    code: "void UpdateVisibilityForPlayer(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->IsVisibilityOverridden())\n\
      \    {\n        // Skip normal visibility checks\n        return;\n    }\n \
      \   // Proceed with standard visibility logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore engine for managing
    object visibility in the game world. It may be called frequently during visibility
    updates, so performance should be considered when implementing custom logic that
    relies on this check.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in conjunction with visibility-related
    events, as it might interfere with normal visibility state management and could
    lead to unexpected behavior if not properly synchronized with other visibility
    systems.
