  class: BotSpawner
  method: SpawnBot
  signature: bool BotSpawner::SpawnBot(const int & request)
documentation:
  brief: Spawns a bot instance using the specified request identifier.
  description: The SpawnBot method is responsible for creating and initializing a
    new bot instance within the TrinityCore environment. It takes a request identifier
    as input which determines the configuration and behavior of the spawned bot. The
    method performs validation checks on the request, allocates necessary resources,
    and integrates the bot into the game world. This function is typically used in
    conjunction with bot management systems to dynamically create bots for testing,
    automation, or gameplay enhancement purposes. The method ensures proper initialization
    of bot attributes, AI behavior, and player-like functionality within the game
    environment.
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: An integer identifier that specifies the bot configuration request
      to be processed. This value typically corresponds to a predefined bot template
      or profile in the system, determining the bot's class, level, equipment, and
      behavior patterns.
  returns: Returns true if the bot was successfully spawned and initialized; returns
    false if the spawning process failed due to invalid request parameters, insufficient
    resources, or other initialization errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Spawning
    code: "BotSpawner spawner;\nint requestId = 12345;\nbool success = spawner.SpawnBot(requestId);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Bot successfully spawned\n    printf(\"Bot spawned successfully\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to spawn bot\n    printf(\"Failed to spawn bot\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Bot Spawning with Error Handling
    code: "BotSpawner spawner;\nint requestId = 98765;\ntry {\n    bool result = spawner.SpawnBot(requestId);\n\
      \    if (!result) {\n        // Handle specific error cases\n        std::cout\
      \ << \"Bot spawning failed for request: \" << requestId << std::endl;\n    }\n\
      } catch (const std::exception& e) {\n    std::cerr << \"Exception during bot\
      \ spawning: \" << e.what() << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may have performance implications when called frequently, as
    it involves resource allocation and game world integration. The request parameter
    should be validated before calling to ensure proper bot configuration. The method
    assumes that the bot system is properly initialized and that sufficient resources
    are available for spawning new instances.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or unregistered request ID will likely
    result in a failed spawn attempt. Ensure that all bot configurations are properly
    registered in the system before attempting to spawn bots using those configurations.
    Repeated calls without proper cleanup may lead to resource leaks.
