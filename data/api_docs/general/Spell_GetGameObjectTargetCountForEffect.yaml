  signature: int64 Spell::GetGameObjectTargetCountForEffect(int effect) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of game objects targeted by a specific spell effect.
  description: This method retrieves the number of game objects that are targeted
    by a particular spell effect within the current spell. It is commonly used in
    spell handling to determine how many game objects are affected by a given effect,
    such as those involving area-of-effect spells or targeting mechanics. The method
    provides information about the target count for a specific effect index, which
    can be useful for determining spell behavior and ensuring proper execution of
    game object interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the count of game objects targeted
    by the specified spell effect. A value of 0 indicates no game objects are targeted
    by that effect, while positive values indicate the number of game objects affected.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int64 count = spell->GetGameObjectTargetCountForEffect(0);\nif (count >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Process game object targets\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    to determine the number of game objects affected by a specific effect. It may
    be called during spell processing or when evaluating spell targets, and should
    be used carefully to avoid incorrect assumptions about target counts.
  warnings: The method may return 0 if no game objects are targeted by the effect,
    which could lead to misinterpretation in certain spell mechanics. Care should
    be taken when relying on this value for determining spell behavior or target validation.
