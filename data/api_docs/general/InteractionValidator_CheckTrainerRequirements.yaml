  signature: bool InteractionValidator::CheckTrainerRequirements(::Player * bot, ::Creature
    * trainer) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player meets the requirements to interact with a trainer creature.
  description: The CheckTrainerRequirements method validates whether a given player
    character has the necessary conditions met to access and interact with a trainer
    NPC. This includes checking for proper level requirements, faction alignment,
    quest prerequisites, and other in-game constraints that govern who can learn from
    trainers. The method ensures game balance by preventing unauthorized access to
    training services. It is typically invoked before allowing a player to open a
    trainer's service menu or purchase skills.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character attempting
      to interact with the trainer.
  - name: trainer
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the NPC trainer being
      accessed by the player.
  returns: Returns true if the player meets all requirements to interact with the
    trainer; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a custom AI behavior
    code: "if (validator.CheckTrainerRequirements(player, npc)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with opening trainer interface\n    player->GetSession()->SendTrainerList(npc);\n\
      } else {\n    // Send error message or prevent interaction\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      You do not meet the requirements to train here.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against internal trainer data tables and
    player state. It may be part of a larger validation system within TrinityCore's
    AI or interaction framework. Performance is generally low since it involves multiple
    condition evaluations.
  warnings: Ensure that both the player and trainer pointers are valid before calling
    this method to avoid crashes. The method does not handle null pointer exceptions
    internally, so callers must validate inputs.
