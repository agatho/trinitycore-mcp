  method: VehicleJoinEvent
  signature: void VehicleJoinEvent::VehicleJoinEvent(Vehicle * v, Unit * u)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a vehicle join event for a unit entering a vehicle
  description: The VehicleJoinEvent constructor initializes a vehicle join event,
    associating a Unit with a Vehicle when the unit enters the vehicle. This method
    is typically invoked during vehicle boarding mechanics to handle the transition
    of a passenger into a vehicle's passenger seat. The event manages the necessary
    state changes and updates for both the vehicle and the unit involved in the boarding
    process.
  parameters:
  - name: v
    description: Pointer to the Vehicle object that the unit is joining
  - name: u
    description: Pointer to the Unit (player or creature) that is entering the vehicle
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vehicle Join Event Initialization
    code: 'VehicleJoinEvent event(vehicle, player);

      // This initializes a vehicle join event for player boarding vehicle'
    language: cpp
  - title: Vehicle Join Event in Boarding Handler
    code: "void OnPlayerBoardVehicle(Player* player, Vehicle* vehicle)\n{\n    if\
      \ (player && vehicle)\n    {\n        VehicleJoinEvent event(vehicle, player);\n\
      \        // Handles the boarding logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal vehicle system and should only be called
    during valid vehicle boarding scenarios. The constructor likely sets up internal
    references and may trigger related callbacks or events in the vehicle system.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly unless you are implementing custom
    vehicle boarding logic. Improper usage can lead to invalid vehicle states or crashes.
    Ensure both parameters are valid non-null pointers before calling.
