  brief: Resets the weekly currency cap for all players in the world.

    all players currently online in the World of Warcraft server. This function is
    typically invoked during weekly reset events to ensure that players can once again
    earn and spend their weekly currency allowances. The method iterates through all
    connected sessions and updates their currency data accordingly, clearing any accumulated
    weekly limits that were previously enforced. It's an essential part of maintaining
    game balance and ensuring fair play across all realms.

    avoid disrupting player progress. It's typically invoked by the server's internal
    reset system and not meant for direct use in custom scripts or modules.
  warnings: Improper invocation of this method can cause currency data inconsistencies
    for players, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in currency transactions
    or achievements. Avoid calling this outside of designated reset windows.
