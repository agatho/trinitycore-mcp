  brief: Initializes primary professions for the player, setting up their initial
    skill levels and profession capabilities.
  description: This method initializes the player's primary professions by setting
    up their initial skill levels and profession capabilities. It is typically called
    during player creation or when a character first logs in to establish the baseline
    for all primary professions. The method ensures that players have proper starting
    skills for their chosen professions, including the ability to use profession-specific
    items and perform basic crafting activities. This method also handles the setup
    of profession-related abilities and skill points allocation.

  notes: This method should only be called once during player initialization. It is
    typically invoked automatically during character creation or login process. The
    method may involve complex skill calculation and setup procedures that could impact
    performance if called multiple times.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times can cause issues with skill point allocation
    and profession setup. It should not be called outside of normal player initialization
    procedures.
