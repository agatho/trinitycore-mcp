documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the FarmingCoordinator class.
  description: The FarmingCoordinator constructor initializes a new instance of the
    FarmingCoordinator class. This method sets up the internal state and data structures
    required for managing farming-related operations within the TrinityCore framework.
    It typically configures default values, initializes member variables, and prepares
    the coordinator to handle farming mechanics such as crop growth, harvesting, and
    resource management. The constructor is called automatically when a new FarmingCoordinator
    object is created, ensuring that all necessary components are properly initialized
    before any farming operations begin.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new FarmingCoordinator instance
    code: 'FarmingCoordinator* coordinator = new FarmingCoordinator();

      // The constructor is automatically called here

      // coordinator is now ready to manage farming operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: The FarmingCoordinator constructor should not be called directly in most
    cases. Instead, instances are typically created through factory methods or by
    the game engine's internal systems when farming mechanics are required. Developers
    should ensure that any initialization logic within the constructor does not perform
    heavy operations that could block the main thread.
  warnings: Avoid calling the FarmingCoordinator constructor manually unless explicitly
    required by the game architecture. The constructor may rely on other subsystems
    that are not yet initialized, potentially leading to undefined behavior or crashes
    if called at inappropriate times during server startup or runtime.
