documentation:
  brief: Handles the logic when a warrior's rage is depleted during combat.
  description: The HandleRageStarvation method manages the behavior of a warrior AI
    when its rage resource falls to zero. This typically occurs during combat when
    the warrior has exhausted all available rage, which can affect ability usage and
    AI decision-making. The method may trigger specific actions such as switching
    to alternative combat strategies, entering a defensive stance, or waiting for
    rage regeneration before continuing offensive actions. It is part of the core
    warrior AI logic that ensures proper resource management and tactical response
    during battles.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n  \
      \      return;\n\n    if (me->GetPower(POWER_RAGE) <= 0)\n    {\n        HandleRageStarvation();\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n\n    // Normal combat logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the AI system when rage depletion
    is detected. It's important to note that rage starvation can occur during active
    combat and may lead to temporary incapacitation of certain abilities requiring
    rage. The implementation should consider the warrior's current stance, available
    abilities, and overall combat state.
  warnings: Improper handling of rage starvation could result in AI behavior that
    appears frozen or unresponsive. Ensure this method is called only when appropriate
    and not during critical combat sequences where immediate action is required.
