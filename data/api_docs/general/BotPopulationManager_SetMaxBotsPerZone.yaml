api:
  class: BotPopulationManager
  method: SetMaxBotsPerZone
  signature: void BotPopulationManager::SetMaxBotsPerZone(uint32 maxBots)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum number of bots allowed per zone in the bot population manager.
  description: The SetMaxBotsPerZone method configures the upper limit of bot characters
    that can exist within a single zone at any given time. This setting is crucial
    for managing server performance and ensuring balanced gameplay environments. The
    method updates an internal configuration value that controls bot spawning behavior
    across all zones. When this limit is reached, no additional bots will be spawned
    in that specific zone until existing bots are removed or the limit is increased.
    This mechanism helps prevent excessive resource consumption and maintains game
    stability.
  parameters:
  - name: maxBots
    description: The maximum number of bots allowed per zone. Valid values are positive
      integers representing the cap on bot population in each zone. Values of zero
      or negative numbers may disable bot spawning for that zone.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Bots Per Zone
    code: 'BotPopulationManager::instance()->SetMaxBotsPerZone(50);

      // This sets the maximum number of bots allowed per zone to 50.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disabling Bot Spawning in Zones
    code: 'BotPopulationManager::instance()->SetMaxBotsPerZone(0);

      // This disables bot spawning in all zones by setting the limit to zero.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies a global configuration value that affects all zones.
    Changes take immediate effect on subsequent bot spawn operations. The implementation
    likely caches this value for performance reasons and may be overridden by zone-specific
    settings if present. This method should typically be called during server initialization
    or configuration updates rather than dynamically during gameplay.
  warnings: Setting this value too high can lead to performance degradation due to
    excessive bot processing. Setting it to zero effectively disables all bot spawning
    in zones, which might impact certain game mechanics that rely on bots. Changes
    to this setting may not affect already spawned bots but will prevent new ones
    from being created in affected zones.
