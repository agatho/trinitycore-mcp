  class: CriteriaData
  method: CriteriaData
  signature: void CriteriaData::CriteriaData(uint32 _dataType, uint32 _value1, uint32
    _value2, uint32 _scriptId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a CriteriaData object with specified data type, values, and script
    ID for achievement or criterion tracking.
  description: The CriteriaData constructor initializes a criteria entry used in World
    of Warcraft's achievement system. It sets up internal data fields including the
    data type identifier, two value parameters, and a script identifier that can be
    used to trigger or evaluate specific conditions. This method is typically called
    when creating new criterion entries for achievements, quests, or other game mechanics
    that require tracking player progress against specific criteria. The initialized
    object becomes part of the larger achievement or criterion framework within TrinityCore's
    database and runtime systems.
  parameters:
  - name: _dataType
    description: The type identifier for this criterion data. Defines how the values
      should be interpreted (e.g., kill count, item count, etc.). Valid values are
      typically defined in game constants or database schema.
  - name: _value1
    description: First value parameter associated with the criterion. Meaning depends
      on _dataType and may represent counts, IDs, thresholds, or other numeric criteria
      values.
  - name: _value2
    description: Second value parameter associated with the criterion. Often used
      in combination with _value1 for more complex criteria (e.g., item type and count,
      or min/max range).
  - name: _scriptId
    description: Identifier of the script or function that should be executed when
      this criterion is met. Can be 0 if no script is associated with this criterion.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a basic kill count criterion
    code: 'CriteriaData killCriteria(1, 5, 0, 12345);

      // Creates a criterion for killing 5 creatures of type 1 with script ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing an item collection criterion
    code: 'CriteriaData itemCriteria(3, 1001, 10, 0);

      // Creates a criterion for collecting 10 of item ID 1001 (no script)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal achievement system and should not be
    called directly from game scripts or modules unless implementing new criteria
    types. The parameters are stored in a structure that gets serialized to the database
    for persistent storage across server sessions.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values can lead to invalid criteria entries that may
    cause achievement tracking failures or unexpected behavior in the achievement
    system. Ensure _dataType matches expected values defined in the game's criteria
    type definitions.
