documentation:
  brief: Returns the primary resource type associated with the resource manager instance.
  description: The GetPrimaryResourceType method retrieves the ResourceType that represents
    the main or default resource type managed by this ResourceManager instance. This
    is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to determine what
    kind of resource (such as mana, rage, energy, or focus) a specific object or system
    primarily utilizes. The returned value indicates the fundamental resource type
    for operations like resource regeneration, cost calculation, and display logic
    within the game engine. This method does not require any parameters and always
    returns a valid ResourceType enum value.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ResourceType enum value representing the primary resource type managed
    by this ResourceManager instance. Possible values include but are not limited
    to RESOURCE_MANA, RESOURCE_RAGE, RESOURCE_ENERGY, and RESOURCE_FOCUS, depending
    on the context of the object using this resource manager.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "ResourceType primaryType = resourceManager.GetPrimaryResourceType();\n\
      if (primaryType == RESOURCE_MANA)\n{\n    // Handle mana-specific logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during initialization or when determining
    how to process resource-related operations. It's important to note that the returned
    ResourceType may vary depending on the specific ResourceManager instance, such
    as for different player classes or creature types.
