  method: GetCacheStats
  signature: CacheStats BotNpcLocationService::GetCacheStats() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves cache statistics for NPC location data.
  description: The GetCacheStats method returns a CacheStats object containing detailed
    information about the internal cache used by the BotNpcLocationService. This includes
    metrics such as hit rate, miss count, and total entries in the cache. The returned
    statistics help monitor performance and efficiency of NPC location caching within
    the bot system. This method is typically used for debugging, performance tuning,
    or monitoring cache behavior during bot operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A CacheStats object containing cache metrics including hit count, miss
    count, total entries, and cache hit rate percentage. The object provides insights
    into how effectively the NPC location cache is being utilized by the bot system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Cache Performance
    code: 'BotNpcLocationService* service = BotNpcLocationService::instance();

      CacheStats stats = service->GetCacheStats();

      std::cout << "Cache Hits: " << stats.hitCount << ", Misses: " << stats.missCount
      << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Hit Rate: " << stats.hitRate << "%" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. The returned
    CacheStats object is a snapshot of the cache state at the time of the call, so
    values may change between multiple calls to GetCacheStats(). The cache statistics
    are updated in real-time as NPC locations are accessed.
