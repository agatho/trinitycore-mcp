documentation:
  brief: Initializes visibility distances for the battleground map.
  description: The InitVisibilityDistance method sets up the initial visibility parameters
    for a battleground map, determining how far players can see objects and other
    players within the arena. This method is typically called during the initialization
    phase of a battleground to configure the visibility settings based on the specific
    battleground type and its requirements. It ensures that all players in the battleground
    have appropriate visibility distances for gameplay mechanics such as line of sight,
    combat interactions, and objective detection.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'BattlegroundMap* bgMap = ...;

      bgMap->InitVisibilityDistance();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically during battleground creation
    and setup. Developers should not typically call this method manually unless implementing
    custom battleground logic or modifying visibility behavior.
