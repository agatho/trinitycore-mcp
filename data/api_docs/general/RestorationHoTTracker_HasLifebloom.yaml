documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has an active Lifebloom HoT effect.
  description: The HasLifebloom method determines whether a specific player currently
    has an active Lifebloom spell effect applied to them. Lifebloom is a healing spell
    in World of Warcraft that applies a heal-over-time (HoT) effect which periodically
    heals the target. This method is typically used by restoration druids and other
    classes that can apply or track this effect. The method takes a GUID parameter
    identifying the player and returns true if the player has an active Lifebloom
    HoT, false otherwise. It's commonly used in combat logic to prevent stacking effects
    or to determine eligibility for certain abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to check for active Lifebloom
      effect. This should be a valid player GUID from the TrinityCore database.
  returns: Returns true if the specified player has an active Lifebloom HoT effect;
    returns false if no such effect is currently active on the player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (restorationHoTTracker.HasLifebloom(playerGuid)) {\n    // Player already\
      \ has Lifebloom, handle accordingly\n    SendChatMessage(\"You already have\
      \ Lifebloom active!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Druid Spell Logic
    code: "void DruidSpellHandler::CastLifebloom(Unit* target) {\n    if (!HasLifebloom(target->GetGUID().GetCounter()))\
      \ {\n        // Apply Lifebloom effect\n        ApplyLifebloomEffect(target);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Prevent stacking\n        SendChatMessage(\"Lifebloom\
      \ is already active on this target.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely maintains an internal tracking system for all active HoT
    effects. The GUID parameter should be validated before calling to ensure it represents
    a valid player entity. Performance considerations are minimal as this is typically
    a lookup operation in an internal map or set.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed corresponds to a valid player object, otherwise
    behavior may be undefined. This method should not be called on non-player entities
    unless the internal tracking system specifically supports it.
