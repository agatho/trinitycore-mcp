  method: ResurrectPlayer
  signature: void Player::ResurrectPlayer(float restore_percent, bool applySickness)
documentation:
  brief: Resurrects the player with specified health percentage and sickness application.
  description: The ResurrectPlayer method performs the resurrection of a player character,
    restoring them to life after death. It allows for control over how much health
    is restored upon resurrection and whether sickness effects are applied. This method
    is typically used in game master commands or scripted events where players need
    to be brought back to life with specific conditions. The method handles both the
    visual and mechanical aspects of resurrection, including the restoration of health
    and mana, and applying or skipping sickness effects based on the parameters provided.
  parameters:
  - name: restore_percent
    description: The percentage of health to restore upon resurrection, typically
      ranging from 0.0f to 100.0f. Values less than 100% will result in partial restoration
      of health, while values of 100% will restore full health.
  - name: applySickness
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether sickness effects should be applied
      upon resurrection. If true, the player will experience sickness effects; if
      false, no sickness effects are applied.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resurrection Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->ResurrectPlayer(100.0f, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Partial Health Resurrection Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->ResurrectPlayer(50.0f, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during player resurrection events and may
    be subject to game mechanics such as cooldowns or resource requirements. It should
    be used carefully in scripting contexts where player state changes are expected.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior in player
    health restoration, especially when combined with incorrect sickness application
    flags. Ensure that restore_percent values are within valid ranges (0.0f to 100.0f)
    and applySickness is properly set.
