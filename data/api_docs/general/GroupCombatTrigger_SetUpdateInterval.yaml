  class: GroupCombatTrigger
  method: SetUpdateInterval
  signature: void GroupCombatTrigger::SetUpdateInterval(uint32 intervalMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the update interval for the group combat trigger in milliseconds.
  description: The SetUpdateInterval method configures how frequently the GroupCombatTrigger
    checks for combat-related events or updates its internal state. This interval
    determines the frequency at which the trigger evaluates whether group members
    are engaged in combat, and can affect performance and responsiveness of combat
    detection logic. The interval is specified in milliseconds and should be set based
    on desired sensitivity and system resource usage. A smaller interval provides
    more responsive detection but may increase CPU overhead, while a larger interval
    reduces resource consumption but may delay reaction times.
  parameters:
  - name: intervalMs
    description: The update interval in milliseconds. Valid values are positive integers.
      Lower values (e.g., 100-500ms) provide more frequent updates and better responsiveness,
      while higher values (e.g., 1000ms or more) reduce CPU usage but may delay event
      detection.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GroupCombatTrigger* trigger = new GroupCombatTrigger();

      trigger->SetUpdateInterval(500); // Set to update every 500 milliseconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Tuning Example
    code: "GroupCombatTrigger* combatTrigger = GetGroupCombatTrigger();\nif (IsHighLoadServer())\
      \ {\n    combatTrigger->SetUpdateInterval(1000); // Reduce frequency for performance\n\
      } else {\n    combatTrigger->SetUpdateInterval(250);  // More frequent updates\
      \ for responsiveness\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the internal timer used by the GroupCombatTrigger.
    Changes to the interval will take effect immediately on the next update cycle.
    The default interval is typically set during object initialization and may vary
    based on implementation details.
  warnings: Setting the interval too low (e.g., below 50ms) may cause excessive CPU
    usage and potential performance degradation in high-traffic environments. Ensure
    that the chosen interval balances responsiveness with system resource constraints.
