  signature: void AreaTrigger::AI_Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the AI behavior for the area trigger, setting up internal state
    and preparing it for execution.
  description: The AI_Initialize method is responsible for initializing the artificial
    intelligence system associated with an AreaTrigger instance. This method typically
    sets up internal data structures, registers necessary callbacks, and prepares
    the trigger's behavior logic for activation. It is called during the area trigger's
    creation or loading phase to ensure that all required systems are properly configured
    before the trigger begins executing its defined actions. The method does not take
    any parameters and performs no direct game mechanics operations itself, but rather
    prepares the environment for subsequent AI-driven behaviors such as target detection,
    spell casting, or event triggering.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AI Initialization Call
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = new AreaTrigger();

      trigger->AI_Initialize();

      // The area trigger is now ready for AI-driven behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of an AreaTrigger
    instance. It is typically invoked automatically by the core engine when loading
    or spawning area triggers, but may also be manually called in custom implementations.
    The initialization process includes setting up internal state machines and ensuring
    all required subsystems are ready for AI execution.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times on the same AreaTrigger instance can
    lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks. Ensure that AI_Initialize is only
    invoked once per trigger object, preferably during construction or loading phases.
