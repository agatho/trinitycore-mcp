  class: MovementValidator
  method: HandleStuck
  signature: bool MovementValidator::HandleStuck(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player bot is stuck and attempts to resolve the situation.
  description: The HandleStuck method evaluates whether a player bot is trapped or
    unable to move properly within the game world. It performs checks to detect stuck
    conditions such as being stuck in terrain, objects, or other environmental obstacles.
    When a stuck condition is detected, the method attempts to resolve it by adjusting
    the bot's position or triggering corrective actions. This functionality is crucial
    for maintaining smooth AI behavior and preventing bots from becoming permanently
    blocked in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot was successfully unstuck or if no stuck condition
    was detected; returns false if the bot remains stuck after attempting resolution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (!validator.HandleStuck(bot)) {\n    // Bot is still stuck, log warning\
      \ or take alternative action\n    LOG_ERROR(\"ai\", \"Bot {} is still stuck\
      \ after attempt to resolve.\", bot->GetName());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely integrates with TrinityCore's movement system and collision
    detection. It may use internal pathfinding or teleportation logic to resolve stuck
    situations. The implementation should be called periodically during AI updates
    to prevent long-term blocking.
  warnings: The method might cause unexpected behavior if used inappropriately, such
    as repeatedly calling it without proper cooldowns. It's important to ensure that
    bots don't get stuck in loops where they continuously attempt to resolve their
    stuck state.
