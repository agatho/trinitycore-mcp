  signature: void PointMovementGenerator::UnitSpeedChanged()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the movement generator's internal state when a unit's speed changes.
  description: The UnitSpeedChanged method is invoked to notify the PointMovementGenerator
    that the speed of the unit it is controlling has been modified. This method ensures
    that any cached or calculated movement parameters, such as travel time or distance,
    are updated accordingly to reflect the new speed. It typically recalculates movement-related
    values like duration and waypoints to maintain accurate path following behavior.
    The method does not directly modify the unit's speed but responds to external
    changes in speed to keep movement logic synchronized.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PointMovementGenerator* movementGen = new PointMovementGenerator();

      movementGen->UnitSpeedChanged(); // Called when unit speed changes externally'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI or movement system when
    a unit's speed is altered, such as through spell effects or status changes. It
    may trigger recalculation of movement duration and path interpolation values to
    ensure accurate behavior.
