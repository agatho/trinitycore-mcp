documentation:
  brief: Processes acknowledgment of a movement force removal for a player
  description: Handles the client's acknowledgment that a movement force has been
    removed from a unit. This method is typically invoked when a player's movement
    is interrupted or modified by external forces such as knockbacks, pulls, or other
    movement-altering effects. The server validates the acknowledgment and updates
    the affected unit's movement state accordingly. It ensures synchronization between
    client and server regarding movement modifications.

  - title: Basic Usage in WorldSession Handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleMoveRemoveMovementForceAck(WorldPackets::Movement::MoveRemoveMovementForceAck&\
      \ moveRemoveMovementForceAck)\n{\n    // Process the acknowledgment\n    if\
      \ (Player* player = GetPlayer())\n    {\n        // Validate and process movement\
      \ force removal\n        player->GetMotionMaster()->Clear(false);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the movement synchronization system in TrinityCore.
    It's crucial for maintaining accurate client-server state when movement modifications
    occur. The method assumes that the player exists and has a valid motion master.
  warnings: Improper handling of this acknowledgment may lead to desynchronization
    between client and server, causing incorrect movement behavior or visual glitches
    for players.
