  method: UpdateBuffs
  signature: void MistweaverMonkRefactored::UpdateBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Updates all active buffs and auras for the Mistweaver Monk character.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing the
    state of all active buffs and auras on a Mistweaver Monk class instance. This
    includes checking for buff expiration, applying new buff effects, recalculating
    stat modifiers, and ensuring that the monk's healing and damage-over-time effects
    remain properly applied based on current game mechanics. The method typically
    runs during each update cycle or when specific conditions are met, such as entering
    combat or casting a spell. It ensures that the character maintains proper synergy
    with their chosen talents and abilities, particularly those related to healing,
    mana efficiency, and spirit-based enhancements.

  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void Update()\n{\n    // Called every frame or update cycle\n    _mistweaver.UpdateBuffs();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Casting
    code: "void CastHealingSpell()\n{\n    // Perform spell logic\n    DoHeal();\n\
      \    \n    // Ensure buffs are refreshed after casting\n    _mistweaver.UpdateBuffs();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the core game loop or during
    specific events like spell casts. It may involve complex calculations related
    to aura stacking, duration adjustments, and stat modifications that are unique
    to the Mistweaver Monk class. Developers should be aware that this method can
    have performance implications if it performs heavy computations on every call.
  warnings: Avoid calling UpdateBuffs manually unless necessary, as it might interfere
    with the natural flow of the game's event system. Also, ensure that all buffs
    and auras are properly initialized before calling this method to prevent undefined
    behavior or crashes.
