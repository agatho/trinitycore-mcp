documentation:
  brief: Returns the cost in copper for the barber shop customization options.
  description: This method calculates and returns the total cost in copper for applying
    new customizations to a player's character through the barber shop system. The
    method takes into account the current state of the player's character and any
    existing customizations, providing a precise calculation of the monetary value
    required to perform these changes. It is used primarily within the context of
    World of Warcraft's Barber Shop mechanics, where players can modify their character
    appearance using various customization options.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int64 value representing the total copper cost required for
    the specified number of new customizations. The value may be zero if no customizations
    are needed or if the player has sufficient currency to cover the cost without
    additional payment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'int64 cost = player->GetBarberShopCost(1);

      std::cout << "Cost: " << cost << " copper" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other barber shop-related
    functions to determine the total cost of customizations. It may involve calculations
    based on current player currency, existing customization states, and potential
    discounts or promotions that apply to the barber shop system.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly without proper context of the
    player's current currency and customization state. Improper usage could lead to
    incorrect cost calculations or unexpected behavior in the game mechanics.
