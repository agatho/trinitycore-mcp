  method: IsNeedClientUpdate
  signature: bool AuraApplication::IsNeedClientUpdate() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the aura application requires an update to be sent to
    the client.
  description: The IsNeedClientUpdate method checks if the aura application has changes
    that need to be communicated to the client. This is typically used during the
    aura update cycle to determine if a packet needs to be sent to inform the player's
    client about modifications to their auras, such as changes in duration, stacks,
    or visual effects. The method evaluates internal state flags and determines if
    synchronization with the client is necessary. It is commonly called within the
    aura management system before sending updates to ensure only relevant changes
    are transmitted.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the aura application has pending updates that must be sent
    to the client, false otherwise. This indicates whether a client-side update packet
    should be generated and sent for this specific aura application.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if Aura Update is Needed
    code: "AuraApplication* app = player->GetAuraApplication(12345);\nif (app && app->IsNeedClientUpdate())\n\
      {\n    // Send aura update packet to client\n    player->SendAuraUpdate(app);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is performance-critical and should be called sparingly during
    aura updates. It typically checks internal dirty flags rather than recalculating
    aura state, making it efficient for frequent calls during update cycles.
