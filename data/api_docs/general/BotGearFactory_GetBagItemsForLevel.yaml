  signature: int BotGearFactory::GetBagItemsForLevel(uint32 level)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the number of bag items appropriate for a specified
    player level
  description: The GetBagItemsForLevel method determines how many bag items (such
    as bags, backpacks, or other container-type equipment) should be available to
    a bot character at a given level. This method is typically used in bot gear generation
    logic to ensure that bots have appropriate inventory capacity based on their level
    progression. The calculation may consider factors such as level thresholds, item
    rarity, and game balance mechanics specific to the TrinityCore framework. This
    method does not modify any state but rather computes and returns a count value.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of bag items that should be assigned
    to a bot at the specified level. Returns 0 if no bag items are appropriate for
    the given level or if an error occurs during calculation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: int bagItemCount = botGearFactory.GetBagItemsForLevel(10);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Bot Initialization
    code: "uint32 level = 25;\nint bags = botGearFactory.GetBagItemsForLevel(level);\n\
      // Use 'bags' to determine how many bag items to equip the bot with\nif (bags\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Equip the bot with the calculated number of bags\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger gear generation system and may be
    called during bot creation or level-up events. It's important to note that the
    actual implementation details are not provided, so assumptions about how bag items
    are calculated should be verified against the core codebase.
  warnings: Ensure that the input level parameter is within expected bounds (typically
    1-80 for standard WoW content) to avoid unexpected behavior or invalid calculations.
    The method may return 0 if no appropriate bag items exist for a specific level,
    which could affect bot inventory capacity.
