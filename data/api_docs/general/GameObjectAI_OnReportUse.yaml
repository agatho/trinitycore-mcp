  class: GameObjectAI
  method: OnReportUse
  signature: bool GameObjectAI::OnReportUse(Player * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Called when a player uses a game object, allowing AI to respond to the interaction.
  description: The OnReportUse method is invoked by the TrinityCore framework when
    a player interacts with a game object, typically through a use action such as
    clicking or activating it. This method provides an opportunity for custom GameObjectAI
    implementations to define specific behaviors in response to player interactions.
    The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the use event was handled
    successfully or if further processing should occur. It is part of the GameObject's
    AI system and allows developers to extend default game object behavior without
    modifying core engine code.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Player object that initiated the use interaction with
      this game object.
  returns: True if the use event was handled and no further processing is required;
    false if the default behavior should proceed or if an error occurred during handling.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "class MyGameObjectAI : public GameObjectAI {\npublic:\n    bool OnReportUse(Player*\
      \ player) override {\n        // Custom logic when player uses the object\n\
      \        player->SendNotifyMessage(\"You have used this object!\");\n      \
      \  return true; // Indicate event was handled\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Use Handling
    code: "class QuestGiverGameObjectAI : public GameObjectAI {\npublic:\n    bool\
      \ OnReportUse(Player* player) override {\n        if (player->HasQuest(12345))\
      \ {\n            // Player can use the object\n            player->PlayerTalkClass->SendQuestGiverOfferReward(this->GetGameObject(),\
      \ player);\n            return true;\n        }\n        return false; // Let\
      \ default behavior handle it\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called from the game object's interaction handling system
    and should not perform heavy operations that could block the main thread. The
    GameObjectAI instance must be properly initialized before this method can be invoked.
  warnings: Returning false does not necessarily mean an error occurred; it simply
    indicates that default handling should proceed. Be cautious about modifying player
    state or game object state directly within this method without proper checks to
    avoid unexpected behavior.
