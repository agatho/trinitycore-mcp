documentation:
  brief: Saves the player's tutorial data to the database.
  description: The SaveTutorialsData method persists the current state of a player's
    tutorial progress to the database. This ensures that tutorial-related flags, timestamps,
    and completion statuses are maintained across server restarts and player sessions.
    The method is typically invoked when a player logs out or when tutorial data needs
    to be explicitly saved during gameplay. It handles the serialization and storage
    of tutorial-related information in the character_tutorials table within the TrinityCore
    database.

    code: "WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();\nif (session)\n{\n    session->SaveTutorialsData();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player's session is valid and
    the player is logged in. The actual database transaction may be deferred or batched
    depending on server configuration settings.
