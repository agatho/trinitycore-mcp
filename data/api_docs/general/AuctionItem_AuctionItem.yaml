documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new auction item instance with default values.
  description: The AuctionItem constructor initializes a new auction item object,
    setting up internal data structures and default property values. This method is
    typically called when creating a new auction item entry in the auction house system.
    It ensures that all required fields are properly initialized before the item can
    be used in auction transactions. The constructor may also perform initial validation
    of the auction item's properties to maintain data integrity within the TrinityCore
    auction system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new AuctionItem instance
    code: 'AuctionItem* auctionItem = new AuctionItem();

      // The auction item is now initialized with default values

      // and ready to be populated with auction data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is automatically called when creating new AuctionItem objects.
    Developers should not directly invoke this constructor unless specifically required
    for object creation patterns. The initialization process includes setting up internal
    pointers and default values that are essential for proper auction house functionality.
