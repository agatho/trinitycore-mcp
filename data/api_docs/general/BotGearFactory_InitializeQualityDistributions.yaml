documentation:
  brief: Initializes quality distribution tables for bot gear generation
  description: Configures and sets up internal quality distribution mappings used
    by the BotGearFactory to determine item qualities when generating equipment for
    AI-controlled characters. This method establishes the probability weights for
    different item quality levels (poor, common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary)
    that will be applied during bot gear creation processes. The initialization typically
    occurs once during system startup or when the factory is first instantiated, ensuring
    consistent and balanced loot generation for all bot characters within the game
    environment.

  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'BotGearFactory factory;

      factory.InitializeQualityDistributions();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of a BotGearFactory
    instance. Subsequent calls may result in undefined behavior or data corruption.
    The quality distributions are typically loaded from configuration files or hardcoded
    values based on game balance requirements.
