  class: AllCreaturesOfEntryInRange
  method: AllCreaturesOfEntryInRange
  signature: void AllCreaturesOfEntryInRange::AllCreaturesOfEntryInRange(const int
    * object, int entry, float maxRange)
documentation:
  brief: Finds all creatures of a specified entry within a given range of an object.
  description: The AllCreaturesOfEntryInRange method searches for all creature entries
    within a maximum range from a provided object. It is typically used in AI scripts
    or game logic to locate nearby targets or entities matching a specific creature
    type. The method operates on the principle of spatial awareness, allowing NPCs
    or game systems to react based on proximity to other creatures. This functionality
    is essential for behaviors such as aggro detection, group targeting, and area-of-effect
    mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: object
    description: A pointer to the object from which the range search originates. This
      can be a player, creature, or any game entity with spatial coordinates.
  - name: entry
    description: The creature entry ID to match against. This corresponds to the 'entry'
      field in the creature_template table and uniquely identifies a creature type.
  - name: maxRange
    description: The maximum distance (in yards) from the object within which creatures
      will be considered. Creatures beyond this range are ignored.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find nearby wolves
    code: AllCreaturesOfEntryInRange(&player, 12345, 30.0f); // Find all wolves (entry
      12345) within 30 yards of player
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in an AI script to detect nearby enemies
    code: 'Creature* target = nullptr;

      AllCreaturesOfEntryInRange(&me, 12345, 25.0f);

      // Process found creatures to determine if any are hostile'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's AI system for creature behavior
    logic. It performs a spatial query using the game world's internal data structures,
    so performance can be impacted by the number of creatures in the area. The object
    parameter must be valid and have a valid position; otherwise, the behavior is
    undefined.
  warnings: Using this method with large maxRange values or in frequently called functions
    may lead to performance degradation. Ensure that the entry ID corresponds to an
    existing creature template to avoid invalid lookups.
