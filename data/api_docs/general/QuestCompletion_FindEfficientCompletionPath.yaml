  class: QuestCompletion
  method: FindEfficientCompletionPath
  signature: void QuestCompletion::FindEfficientCompletionPath(Player * bot, const
    int & questIds)
documentation:
  brief: Finds the most efficient path for completing a set of quests for a given
    player bot.
  description: The FindEfficientCompletionPath method determines the optimal sequence
    of quest objectives and locations for a specified player bot to complete a list
    of quests. It analyzes quest dependencies, NPC locations, and item requirements
    to calculate an efficient traversal route that minimizes travel time and resource
    expenditure. This method is typically used in automated quest completion systems
    or AI-driven bots within the TrinityCore framework. The method modifies internal
    state related to the bot's quest progress and pathfinding logic but does not directly
    interact with the game world objects themselves.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will complete
      the quests. Must be a valid player instance with active quest tracking capabilities.
  - name: questIds
    description: Reference to an integer containing the quest identifier(s) to be
      completed. In practice, this parameter likely represents a list or collection
      of quest IDs, though the signature suggests a single integer value.
  returns: None. The method performs internal computations and updates the bot's state
    without returning any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Completion Path Finding
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume valid player instance

      int questId = 12345;

      QuestCompletion completionSystem;

      completionSystem.FindEfficientCompletionPath(myBot, questId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided bot has access to all necessary quest
    data and that the quest IDs are valid within the current game context. It may
    rely on internal pathfinding algorithms and quest dependency graphs which are
    not exposed through standard API calls.
  warnings: Using this method without proper initialization of the bot's quest state
    or invalid quest IDs could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect path calculations.
    Ensure that the player instance is fully loaded and has active quests before calling
    this method.
