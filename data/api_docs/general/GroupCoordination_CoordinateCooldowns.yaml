  class: GroupCoordination
  method: CoordinateCooldowns
  signature: void GroupCoordination::CoordinateCooldowns(const int & spellIds)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates and applies cooldowns for specified spell IDs within the group
    context.
  description: The CoordinateCooldowns method manages the synchronization of spell
    cooldowns across group members in a World of Warcraft environment using TrinityCore.
    This function ensures that when a spell is cast by any member of the group, the
    cooldown timers are properly updated and shared among all group participants to
    maintain consistent gameplay mechanics. It handles the distribution of cooldown
    information to prevent players from exploiting timing differences between group
    members. The method operates within the GroupCoordination class which is responsible
    for maintaining group synchronization states including cooldowns, buffs, and other
    time-sensitive effects.
  parameters:
  - name: spellIds
    description: A reference to an integer containing the spell identifier(s) that
      need their cooldowns coordinated. In TrinityCore, this typically represents
      a single spell ID or a bitmask of multiple spell IDs when handling group-wide
      cooldowns.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Single Spell Cooldown
    code: "GroupCoordination* groupCoord = sObjectAccessor->GetGroupCoordination();\n\
      int spellId = 12345; // Example spell ID\nif (groupCoord)\n{\n    groupCoord->CoordinateCooldowns(spellId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Multiple Spell Cooldowns
    code: "GroupCoordination* groupCoord = sObjectAccessor->GetGroupCoordination();\n\
      int spellIds[] = {12345, 67890, 54321}; // Array of spell IDs\nfor (int i =\
      \ 0; i < 3; ++i)\n{\n    if (groupCoord)\n    {\n        groupCoord->CoordinateCooldowns(spellIds[i]);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked when a spell is cast or when cooldown information
    needs to be synchronized across group members. The implementation may involve
    sending network packets to all group members to update their local cooldown timers.
    It's important to note that this function operates in the context of group coordination
    and should only be called when within a valid group context.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without proper group context can lead to synchronization
    issues or incorrect cooldown behavior. The spell ID parameter must represent valid
    spell identifiers known to the TrinityCore server to ensure correct functionality.
    Calling this method outside of a group context may result in undefined behavior.
