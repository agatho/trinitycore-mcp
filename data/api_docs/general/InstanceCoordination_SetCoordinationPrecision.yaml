  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: SetCoordinationPrecision
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::SetCoordinationPrecision(uint32 groupId, float
    precision)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the coordination precision for a specified group within the instance.
  description: The SetCoordinationPrecision method configures the level of positional
    accuracy required for group members to be considered synchronized during instance
    coordination. This is typically used in scenarios where precise positioning is
    critical, such as raid encounters or scripted events that depend on player placement.
    The precision value determines how closely players must remain within each other's
    proximity to maintain group synchronization. This method does not validate the
    groupId parameter and assumes it refers to a valid group within the instance context.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: The unique identifier of the group for which to set coordination
      precision. Must correspond to an existing group in the current instance.
  - name: precision
    description: The desired precision level (in yards) for group member positioning.
      Higher values allow more leeway in positioning, while lower values require tighter
      synchronization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting High Precision for Raid Group
    code: 'InstanceCoordination* coordination = sObjectMgr->GetInstanceCoordination();

      coordination->SetCoordinationPrecision(12345, 0.5f); // Require 0.5 yard precision'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Low Precision for Large Group
    code: 'InstanceCoordination* coordination = sObjectMgr->GetInstanceCoordination();

      coordination->SetCoordinationPrecision(67890, 5.0f); // Allow 5 yard tolerance'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects only the specified group's coordination behavior and
    does not impact other groups in the same instance. The precision value should
    be a positive floating-point number; values of zero or negative may cause undefined
    behavior. Changes take effect immediately for new coordination checks.
  warnings: Setting very low precision values (e.g., less than 0.1 yards) may cause
    group members to be frequently marked as out-of-sync, especially in crowded instances
    or during fast movement. This could lead to unexpected behavior in encounter mechanics
    that rely on group synchronization.
