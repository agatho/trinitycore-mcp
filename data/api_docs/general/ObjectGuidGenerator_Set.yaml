  class: ObjectGuidGenerator
  method: Set
  signature: void ObjectGuidGenerator::Set(ObjectGuid::LowType val)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the low GUID value for the ObjectGuidGenerator instance.
  description: The Set method initializes or updates the internal low GUID value of
    an ObjectGuidGenerator object. This method is typically used to configure the
    starting point or reset the generator's state to a specific value. In TrinityCore's
    context, GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers) are used to uniquely identify game
    objects such as players, creatures, items, and game objects within the world.
    The ObjectGuidGenerator manages the generation of these low GUID values, which
    are combined with a high GUID prefix to form complete ObjectGuids. This method
    allows developers to explicitly set the low value, potentially for synchronization
    purposes or when reserving specific GUID ranges.
  parameters:
  - name: val
    description: The ObjectGuid::LowType value to set as the current low GUID. This
      represents the lower portion of a 64-bit GUID and must be a valid unsigned 32-bit
      integer.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Setting a specific low GUID value
    code: 'ObjectGuidGenerator guidGen;

      guidGen.Set(1000);

      // The generator is now configured to start from low GUID 1000'
    language: cpp
  - title: Resetting the generator for a new sequence
    code: 'ObjectGuidGenerator guidGen;

      guidGen.Set(0); // Reset to beginning of sequence

      // Subsequent calls to Generate() will start from 0'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the ObjectGuidGenerator.
    It should be used carefully in multi-threaded environments where GUID generation
    is accessed concurrently. The ObjectGuid::LowType is typically an unsigned 32-bit
    integer, so values beyond the maximum representable value may cause overflow or
    undefined behavior.
  warnings: Modifying the low GUID directly without proper synchronization can lead
    to duplicate GUIDs if not handled carefully. Ensure that setting a new value does
    not conflict with existing objects in the game world. Also, be aware that this
    method does not validate whether the provided value is within a reserved range
    or already used by other entities.
