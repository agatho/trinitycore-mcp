documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new SafeCorpseManager instance as a copy of an existing one.
  description: The SafeCorpseManager constructor is used to create a new instance
    of the SafeCorpseManager class by copying the state from another SafeCorpseManager
    object. This constructor performs a deep copy of the internal data structures,
    ensuring that the new instance maintains the same corpse management state as the
    source object. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, this functionality
    is essential for maintaining consistent corpse handling across different game
    contexts or when duplicating player-related systems. The method ensures proper
    initialization of all internal member variables and data containers associated
    with safe corpse management.

  examples:
  - title: Copying a SafeCorpseManager Instance
    code: 'SafeCorpseManager originalManager;

      // ... populate originalManager with data ...

      SafeCorpseManager newManager(originalManager); // Copy constructor usage'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used when creating temporary or duplicate instances
    of corpse management systems. It's important to note that this is a copy constructor,
    not a regular constructor, so it requires an existing SafeCorpseManager object
    to initialize from.
