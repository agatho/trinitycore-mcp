  method: GetCreatureIdVisibleToSummoner
  signature: int TempSummon::GetCreatureIdVisibleToSummoner() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the creature entry ID that is visible to the summoner of this temporary
    summon.
  description: This method retrieves the creature template identifier (entry ID) of
    the creature that is currently visible to the player who summoned this temporary
    summon. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, summons can have different
    visual representations depending on the summoner's perspective or game state.
    This method ensures that the correct creature entry is returned for the summoner's
    view, which may differ from the actual creature type in some cases. The returned
    ID corresponds to a valid entry in the creature_template table and is used primarily
    for display purposes and client-side rendering of summoned creatures.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the creature template entry ID that should be displayed
    to the summoner. This value corresponds to an entry in the creature_template database
    table, or 0 if no valid creature ID is available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "TempSummon* summon = player->GetFirstControlledUnit();\nif (summon && summon->IsTemporarySummon())\
      \ {\n    int visibleCreatureId = summon->GetCreatureIdVisibleToSummoner();\n\
      \    if (visibleCreatureId > 0) {\n        // Use the visible creature ID for\
      \ display or logic\n        sLog->outString(\"Visible creature ID: %d\", visibleCreatureId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with temporary summons such
    as those created by spells like Summon Pet, Summon Guardian, or other summoning
    mechanics. The returned value may be different from the actual creature's entry
    ID if the summoner has certain buffs, debuffs, or if the creature is disguised
    or polymorphed.
  warnings: Be aware that this method might return 0 if the summon has not yet been
    properly initialized or if there are issues with the summoning process. Always
    validate the returned value before using it in critical gameplay logic.
