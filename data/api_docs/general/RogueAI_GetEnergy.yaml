  class: RogueAI
  method: GetEnergy
  signature: uint32 RogueAI::GetEnergy()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current energy level of the rogue AI unit.
  description: The GetEnergy method returns the current energy value of a RogueAI
    instance, which represents the amount of energy available for performing actions
    such as casting abilities or applying combo points. In the context of World of
    Warcraft's mechanics, rogue characters accumulate energy through various means
    including auto-attacks, certain abilities, and passive effects. This energy is
    typically used to fuel special abilities like Eviscerate, Backstab, or other combo-based
    attacks that require a specific energy cost. The returned value is an unsigned
    32-bit integer representing the current energy pool of the rogue unit.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value indicating the current energy level of the rogue AI unit.
    This represents how much energy is currently available for spending on abilities
    or actions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 energy = rogueAI->GetEnergy();\nif (energy >= 40)\n{\n    // Perform\
      \ an ability that costs 40 energy\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Energy-Based Decision Making
    code: "uint32 energy = rogueAI->GetEnergy();\nswitch (energy)\n{\n    case 0:\n\
      \        // No energy, consider waiting or using low-cost abilities\n      \
      \  break;\n    case 40 ... 79:\n        // Mid-range energy, good for medium-cost\
      \ abilities\n        break;\n    default:\n        // Full energy, can use high-cost\
      \ abilities\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within the AI decision-making loop to determine
    what actions a rogue unit can perform based on its current energy state. The energy
    value may be updated by internal game mechanics or external calls to methods that
    modify the rogue's energy pool.
  warnings: Ensure that the RogueAI instance is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as calling it on an uninitialized or invalid instance may result
    in undefined behavior. Also note that energy values can change rapidly during
    combat, so caching results from this method might lead to stale data if not handled
    carefully.
