documentation:
  brief: Sends a game object despawn packet to all nearby players.
  description: The SendGameObjectDespawn method is responsible for notifying all players
    within the object's current map area that the game object should be removed from
    their client-side world. This method typically gets invoked when a game object
    is being destroyed, deactivated, or otherwise made invisible to players. It ensures
    proper synchronization between server state and client visualization by sending
    a despawn packet through the network layer. The method does not directly destroy
    the object in memory but rather signals clients to remove it from their view.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GameObject* go = ...; // Get a reference to a game object\nif (go)\n{\n\
      \    go->SendGameObjectDespawn();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on game objects that are currently spawned
    and visible to players. It's typically invoked during destruction or deactivation
    of the object, before calling any cleanup routines. The method uses the GameObject's
    current map and visibility settings to determine which players receive the despawn
    packet.
  warnings: Calling this method on a GameObject that has already been despawned or
    is not properly initialized may result in undefined behavior or network errors.
    Ensure the object is valid and currently visible to players before invoking this
    method.
