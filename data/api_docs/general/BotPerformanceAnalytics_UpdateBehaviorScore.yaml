  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: UpdateBehaviorScore
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::UpdateBehaviorScore(uint32_t botGuid, BotBehaviorCategory
    category, double score)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the behavior score for a specified bot within a given category.
  description: The UpdateBehaviorScore method is used to record or modify the performance
    score of a specific bot in a defined behavior category. This method likely plays
    a role in the analytics and decision-making systems for AI-controlled bots in
    TrinityCore. It accepts the unique identifier of the bot, the category of behavior
    being evaluated, and a numerical score representing the bot's performance in that
    category. The method does not return any value, indicating it performs an action
    rather than retrieving data. This functionality is essential for tracking bot
    performance over time and potentially influencing future AI behaviors or decisions.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose behavior score needs
      to be updated. This value uniquely identifies a specific bot instance within
      the game world.
  - name: category
    description: The behavior category for which the score is being updated. This
      parameter likely represents a predefined set of behaviors or actions that bots
      can perform, such as combat, questing, or movement.
  - name: score
    description: A double-precision floating-point value representing the performance
      score of the bot in the specified behavior category. The score could be a normalized
      value between 0 and 1, or it might represent a raw metric depending on the implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update a bot's combat behavior score
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      BotBehaviorCategory category = BOT_BEHAVIOR_COMBAT;

      double score = 0.85;

      analytics.UpdateBehaviorScore(botGuid, category, score);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal data structures that store performance
    metrics for bots. It may be called frequently during gameplay to continuously
    update bot analytics. The implementation might involve thread-safe operations
    if multiple threads are updating scores simultaneously.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid corresponds to an existing bot in the system,
    as invalid GUIDs could lead to undefined behavior or data corruption. Also, verify
    that the category parameter is a valid enum value to prevent unexpected errors.
