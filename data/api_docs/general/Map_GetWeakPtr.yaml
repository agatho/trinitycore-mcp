  class: Map
  method: GetWeakPtr
  signature: int Map::GetWeakPtr() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the weak pointer value of the map instance for tracking purposes.
  description: The GetWeakPtr method retrieves the weak pointer identifier associated
    with the Map instance, which is used for tracking and referencing the map object
    within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically employed in scenarios
    where object references need to be maintained without creating strong dependencies,
    allowing for proper memory management and preventing circular reference issues.
    The returned value represents a unique identifier that can be used to locate or
    verify the existence of a specific map instance in memory.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the weak pointer identifier of the map
    instance, which is used for tracking purposes within the TrinityCore framework.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Map* map = new Map();

      int weakPtr = map->GetWeakPtr();

      // weakPtr now contains the weak pointer value'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other memory management
    functions to prevent memory leaks and ensure proper object lifecycle handling.
    It's important to note that the returned value may vary depending on how the map
    instance was created and managed.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it may not always return
    a meaningful value if the map instance is not properly initialized or tracked
    within the framework.
