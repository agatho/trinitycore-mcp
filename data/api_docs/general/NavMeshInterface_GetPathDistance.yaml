  class: NavMeshInterface
  method: GetPathDistance
  signature: float NavMeshInterface::GetPathDistance(Map * map, const int & start,
    const int & end) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the straight-line distance between two navigation
    mesh points on a specified map.
  description: The GetPathDistance method computes the Euclidean distance between
    two points defined by their indices within the navigation mesh of a given map.
    This method is typically used in pathfinding calculations to determine the direct
    distance between waypoints or positions, which can be useful for AI decision-making,
    movement optimization, and distance-based logic. The method requires valid map
    and point indices; invalid inputs may result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    results. It operates on the navigation mesh data structure that represents walkable
    areas of the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object containing the navigation mesh data. Must
      be a valid map instance with loaded navmesh data.
  - name: start
    description: Integer index representing the starting point in the navigation mesh.
      Index must correspond to a valid node or waypoint within the map's navmesh.
  - name: end
    description: Integer index representing the ending point in the navigation mesh.
      Index must correspond to a valid node or waypoint within the map's navmesh.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the straight-line distance between the
    start and end points in world units. If either point index is invalid, the result
    may be undefined or represent an incorrect distance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: float distance = navMeshInterface->GetPathDistance(map, 10, 25);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with AI Pathfinding
    code: "if (navMeshInterface->GetPathDistance(currentMap, playerNode, targetNode)\
      \ < 50.0f)\n{\n    // Player is close enough to target for direct action\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not account for obstacles or actual path traversal; it only
    calculates the geometric distance between two points. The indices passed must
    be valid within the context of the provided map's navigation mesh. Performance
    is generally fast as it performs simple geometric calculations, but repeated calls
    may impact performance if used excessively in tight loops.
  warnings: Passing invalid map pointers or out-of-bounds node indices can lead to
    crashes or undefined behavior. Ensure that the map has loaded navmesh data before
    calling this method. The returned distance is a straight-line measurement and
    does not reflect actual movement distance through the game world's terrain.
