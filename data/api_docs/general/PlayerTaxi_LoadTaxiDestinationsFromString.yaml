  class: PlayerTaxi
  method: LoadTaxiDestinationsFromString
  signature: bool PlayerTaxi::LoadTaxiDestinationsFromString(const std::string & values,
    uint32 team)
documentation:
  brief: Loads taxi destination data from a string for the specified player team
  description: The LoadTaxiDestinationsFromString method parses a string containing
    serialized taxi destination data and initializes the player's taxi route information
    for the given team. This method is typically used during player loading or when
    restoring taxi path data from persistent storage. The method processes the input
    string to extract taxi node information, validates the data integrity, and updates
    the internal taxi destination tracking for the specified team. It ensures that
    players can access their previously learned taxi routes and destinations after
    server restarts or character loading operations.
  parameters:
  - name: values
    description: A string containing serialized taxi destination data in a format
      compatible with the TrinityCore taxi system. This typically includes node IDs,
      route information, and any relevant metadata for taxi paths.
  - name: team
    description: The team identifier for which to load taxi destinations. Valid values
      are 0 for Alliance (TEAM_ALLIANCE) or 1 for Horde (TEAM_HORDE). This determines
      which set of taxi routes is loaded and applied to the player.
  returns: Returns true if the taxi destination data was successfully parsed and loaded,
    false otherwise. A return value of false indicates either invalid input data format,
    parsing errors, or that the operation could not be completed due to system constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for loading taxi destinations
    code: "std::string taxiData = \"12345 67890 23456\"; // Example serialized data\n\
      bool success = player->GetTaxi().LoadTaxiDestinationsFromString(taxiData, TEAM_ALLIANCE);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Taxi destinations loaded successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Taxi destinations loaded for Alliance\");\n} else {\n    // Handle loading failure\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Failed to load taxi destinations for Alliance\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during player login or character data restoration.
    The input string format should match the expected serialization format used by
    TrinityCore's taxi system. The method performs validation on the parsed data to
    ensure integrity before applying changes to the player's taxi route information.
  warnings: Improperly formatted input strings may cause parsing failures and return
    false. Ensure that the values parameter contains valid taxi node identifiers and
    follows the expected format for the specific TrinityCore version in use. This
    method should not be called with invalid team parameters as it may lead to undefined
    behavior.
