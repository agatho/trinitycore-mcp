  signature: void BattlePetMgr::ChangeBattlePetQuality(int guid, BattlePetBreedQuality
    quality)
documentation:
  brief: Changes the quality level of a battle pet identified by its GUID.
  description: The ChangeBattlePetQuality method modifies the breed quality of a specific
    battle pet within the BattlePetMgr system. This function is typically used to
    upgrade or downgrade a pet's rarity, which affects its stats and performance in
    battles. The method takes a unique identifier (GUID) for the pet and a new quality
    value from the BattlePetBreedQuality enum. It updates the internal data structure
    of the battle pet manager to reflect the new quality level. This operation is
    usually performed during pet training, evolution, or when applying quality-enhancing
    items.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the battle pet whose quality will
      be changed. This value must correspond to an existing pet in the manager's collection.
  - name: quality
    description: The new quality level to assign to the battle pet. Must be a valid
      value from the BattlePetBreedQuality enum representing rarity levels such as
      Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, etc.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Upgrade Pet Quality
    code: 'BattlePetMgr* petMgr = ...;

      petMgr->ChangeBattlePetQuality(12345, BattlePetBreedQuality::Rare);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Set Epic Quality for Pet
    code: 'BattlePetMgr* mgr = Player->GetBattlePetMgr();

      mgr->ChangeBattlePetQuality(98765, BattlePetBreedQuality::Epic);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the pet with the given GUID exists in the manager's
    collection. The implementation likely triggers internal updates to the pet's data
    and may notify clients of changes. It is recommended to validate the GUID before
    calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid GUID may result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the pet exists in the BattlePetMgr before attempting to
    modify its quality. Also, be aware that changing a pet's quality might affect
    gameplay balance and should only be used in appropriate contexts like testing
    or game mechanics adjustments.
