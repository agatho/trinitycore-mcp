  method: LoadQuestTemplateLocale
  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadQuestTemplateLocale()
documentation:
  brief: Loads localized quest template data from the database into memory for use
    in the game world.
  description: The LoadQuestTemplateLocale method retrieves localized strings and
    text associated with quest templates from the database and stores them in memory.
    This allows the game to display quest-related text in the player's preferred language.
    The method is typically called during server startup or when locale changes occur,
    ensuring that all quest-related UI elements display correctly according to the
    configured locale settings. It processes data from the quest_template_locale table
    and populates internal lookup structures for efficient access during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during server initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize() {\n    // Other initialization code...\n\
      \    sObjectMgr->LoadQuestTemplateLocale();\n    // Continue with other startup\
      \ tasks\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectMgr's localization system and should only
    be called after the database connection is established. It modifies internal data
    structures that are used throughout the game for quest display and interaction.
    The method does not return any error codes; failures during database loading will
    typically result in silent failures or default values being used.
  warnings: This method should not be called while players are actively engaged in
    quests, as it may cause temporary inconsistencies in quest text display. It's
    recommended to call this method only during server startup or maintenance windows
    when no players are connected.
