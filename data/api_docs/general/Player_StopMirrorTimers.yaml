documentation:
  brief: Stops all active mirror timers for the player, preventing further health
    and mana regeneration.
  description: The StopMirrorTimers method halts all active mirror timer effects that
    are currently running on the player. These timers typically represent health and
    mana regeneration from various sources such as food, water, or other game mechanics.
    This method is commonly used when a player enters combat or when certain game
    events occur to prevent conflicting regeneration effects. The method does not
    return any value but directly modifies the player's state by stopping these timers.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->StopMirrorTimers();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during combat situations or when the player's
    regeneration timers need to be suspended. It should be used carefully as it may
    interfere with game mechanics that rely on timed regeneration.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior in health/mana
    regeneration, especially if timers are not properly restarted after combat ends.
