  brief: Initializes a Restoration Druid AI bot with the specified player context.
  description: The RestorationDruidRefactored constructor initializes a new instance
    of the Restoration Druid AI class, setting up internal state and configuration
    based on the provided Player object. This method prepares the bot for gameplay
    by configuring its behavior, abilities, and decision-making logic according to
    the restoration druid specialization. The initialization process includes setting
    up spell caches, target selection criteria, and resource management strategies
    specific to healing-oriented druid gameplay. This constructor is typically called
    when creating or respawning a Restoration Druid AI character within the TrinityCore
    framework.

    code: 'Player* bot = new Player();

      RestorationDruidRefactored druidBot(bot);

      // Bot is now initialized with restoration druid AI behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor assumes the Player object is properly allocated and configured.
    The AI logic will automatically handle spell selection, target prioritization,
    and healing decision-making based on combat state and resource availability.
