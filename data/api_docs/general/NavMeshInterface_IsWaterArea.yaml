  class: NavMeshInterface
  method: IsWaterArea
  signature: bool NavMeshInterface::IsWaterArea(uint32 areaFlags) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified area flags represent a water-based zone.
  description: The IsWaterArea method checks if the provided area flags indicate that
    the given area is classified as a water zone. This functionality is crucial for
    pathfinding and movement logic in World of Warcraft, particularly when determining
    whether a character can traverse certain areas or if special swimming mechanics
    should be applied. The method evaluates the area flags against predefined constants
    to identify water-related zones such as lakes, oceans, or rivers. It's commonly
    used by navigation systems to avoid invalid paths through water bodies unless
    the character has appropriate movement capabilities.
  parameters:
  - name: areaFlags
    description: A bitmask representing the area flags for a specific zone. These
      flags determine various properties of the area including terrain type, water
      status, and environmental characteristics.
  returns: Returns true if the area flags indicate that the zone is a water-based
    area (e.g., lake, ocean, river), otherwise returns false. This boolean value helps
    pathfinding algorithms make decisions about character movement and navigation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if an area is water
    code: "uint32 areaFlags = GetAreaFlags();\nif (NavMeshInterface::IsWaterArea(areaFlags))\
      \ {\n    // Handle water-based logic\n    printf(\"This area is a water zone\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using within pathfinding decision making
    code: "bool CanMoveThroughArea(uint32 areaFlags) {\n    if (NavMeshInterface::IsWaterArea(areaFlags))\
      \ {\n        // Check if player has swimming ability\n        return player->HasSwimAbility();\n\
      \    }\n    return true; // Allow movement through non-water areas\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on predefined area flag constants that are defined within
    the TrinityCore codebase. The implementation likely uses bit-masking operations
    to efficiently check for water-related flags without iterating through multiple
    conditions. Developers should be aware that this function may need to be updated
    if new area flags are added or modified in future versions of the game data.
  warnings: Ensure that the input areaFlags parameter is valid and properly initialized
    before calling this method, as invalid flag values could lead to incorrect behavior.
    Additionally, since this is a const method, it does not modify any internal state
    but depends on accurate flag definitions for correct results.
