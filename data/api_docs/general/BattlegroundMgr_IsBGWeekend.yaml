  class: BattlegroundMgr
  method: IsBGWeekend
  signature: bool BattlegroundMgr::IsBGWeekend(int bgTypeId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a battleground type is available during weekend hours.
  description: The IsBGWeekend method checks if a specified battleground type is configured
    to be active only during weekend periods. This method is typically used to enforce
    game rules where certain battlegrounds are restricted to weekends, such as specific
    PvP events or holiday-themed arenas. The method evaluates the battleground type
    ID against internal weekend configuration settings and returns true if the battleground
    is designated for weekend play only, false otherwise. This functionality supports
    the game's scheduling system for special events and ensures proper restriction
    of battleground access based on time-based rules.
  parameters:
  - name: bgTypeId
    description: The unique identifier of the battleground type to check. This value
      corresponds to predefined battleground type IDs used internally by TrinityCore.
  returns: Returns true if the specified battleground type is restricted to weekend
    hours only, false if it's available during all days of the week.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a battleground is weekend-only
    code: "if (BattlegroundMgr::instance()->IsBGWeekend(BATTLEGROUND_AV)) {\n    //\
      \ Handle weekend-only battleground logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Alterac Valley\
      \ is weekend only\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional battleground access based on weekend status
    code: "uint32 bgTypeId = 12; // Example battleground type ID\nif (BattlegroundMgr::instance()->IsBGWeekend(bgTypeId))\
      \ {\n    Player* player = ...;\n    if (!player->GetSession()->GetPlayer()->IsInGroup())\
      \ {\n        player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"This battleground is only available\
      \ during weekends.\");\n        return false;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal configuration data that defines which battleground
    types are weekend-only. The implementation likely uses a lookup table or bitmask
    to determine weekend status, making it efficient for frequent calls during player
    matchmaking operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the bgTypeId parameter is valid and corresponds to an existing
    battleground type, as invalid IDs may result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    return values.
