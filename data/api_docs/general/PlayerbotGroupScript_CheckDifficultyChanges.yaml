  brief: Updates group state based on changes in player difficulty settings
  description: The CheckDifficultyChanges method evaluates and updates the current
    group state when there are modifications to player difficulty preferences or group
    composition. This method is typically invoked during group synchronization events
    to ensure that all players within the group have consistent difficulty settings
    and that the group's overall state reflects any recent changes in player configurations.
    It handles logic related to difficulty level adjustments, player availability,
    and group coordination for instance encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group whose difficulty
      settings are being checked
  - name: state
    description: Reference to the GroupState object that holds and updates the current
      state information for the group
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group update context

      \ script;\n    script.CheckDifficultyChanges(group, state);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player bot system in TrinityCore and is typically
    called during group synchronization or when player difficulty settings change.
    It may affect instance entry permissions and encounter difficulty levels for the
    entire group.
