  class: CombatStateAnalyzer
  method: Update
  signature: void CombatStateAnalyzer::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the combat state analyzer with the specified time difference to process
    combat-related events and maintain accurate combat tracking.
  description: The Update method in CombatStateAnalyzer is responsible for processing
    and maintaining up-to-date combat information based on the elapsed time since
    the last update. This method typically handles combat log processing, damage tracking,
    threat calculations, and other combat-related state updates. It is designed to
    be called regularly by the game loop with a time delta (diff) parameter that represents
    milliseconds elapsed since the last call. The method ensures that combat events
    are properly tracked and that player and creature combat states remain synchronized
    with the current game state. This is essential for maintaining accurate combat
    mechanics, including threat generation, damage application, and combat log integrity.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      parameter determines how much time has passed and influences the processing
      of combat events, cooldowns, and state transitions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'CombatStateAnalyzer analyzer;

      analyzer.Update(50); // Process 50ms worth of combat events'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other world updates...\n\
      \    combatAnalyzer.Update(diff);\n    // Continue with other updates...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently, typically every game tick or at
    regular intervals. The diff parameter is crucial for accurate time-based processing
    of combat events. Performance considerations include avoiding heavy computations
    within this method as it may be called very frequently during active combat situations.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid time values (e.g., negative numbers)
    as it may cause unexpected behavior in combat tracking. Ensure that the method
    is called consistently from the main game loop to maintain accurate combat state
    synchronization.
