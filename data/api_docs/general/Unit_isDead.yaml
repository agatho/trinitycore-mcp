documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit is in a dead state
  description: The isDead method determines whether a Unit object is currently in
    a dead state, which occurs when the unit's health has dropped to zero or below.
    This method is commonly used in game logic to evaluate whether a unit has been
    defeated or is no longer capable of performing actions. The function returns true
    when the unit's health is at or below zero, indicating that the unit is considered
    dead and cannot perform any further actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is dead (health <= 0), false otherwise. This indicates
    the unit has been defeated and is no longer capable of performing actions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (unit->isDead())\n{\n    // Unit is dead, perform appropriate actions\n\
      \    // e.g., drop loot or remove from world\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = GetTarget();\nif (target->isDead())\n{\n    // Handle dead\
      \ unit\n    // e.g., check if player is still alive before continuing\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Unit is still alive, continue normal gameplay\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically checks the current health value of the unit and returns
    true when health reaches zero or below. It is often used in conjunction with other
    methods like GetHealth() or GetMaxHealth() to determine if a unit has been defeated.
  warnings: Be aware that this method may return false even when a unit is in a state
    where it cannot perform actions, such as when the unit is in an uncontrolled state
    or has been stunned. Also note that some units may have special states like 'dead'
    but still be able to perform certain actions.
