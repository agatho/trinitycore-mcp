  brief: Initializes a new QuestPickup object with default values.
  description: The QuestPickup constructor initializes a new instance of the QuestPickup
    class. This method sets up the internal state of the object, preparing it for
    use in handling quest pickup events within the TrinityCore framework. The constructor
    typically initializes member variables to their default states and may perform
    basic setup required for quest-related interactions. This is a fundamental part
    of the quest system architecture where players can pick up quests from NPCs or
    quest givers.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a new QuestPickup instance
    code: 'QuestPickup pickup;

      // Initializes a new QuestPickup object with default settings'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore quest
    system when processing quest pickup events. Developers should not need to manually
    instantiate this class unless implementing custom quest handling logic. The object's
    behavior depends on proper initialization of its parent classes and associated
    quest data structures.
