  method: EvaluatePositionSafety
  signature: float MechanicAwareness::EvaluatePositionSafety(const int & pos, const
    int & threats)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates the safety of a given position based on threat levels and returns
    a safety score.
  description: The EvaluatePositionSafety method calculates a safety rating for a
    specified position within the game world by analyzing the threat level present
    at that location. This function is typically used by AI-controlled entities to
    determine whether moving to or staying at a particular coordinate is safe. The
    method takes into account various factors such as proximity to enemies, environmental
    hazards, and other threat indicators. It returns a floating-point value representing
    the safety level, where higher values indicate safer positions. The evaluation
    considers both immediate and potential threats in the vicinity of the specified
    position.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer identifier or coordinate representing the position to
      evaluate for safety. This could be a unique map coordinate, object ID, or index
      within a threat grid.
  - name: threats
    description: An integer representing the current threat level at the specified
      position. This value typically indicates how dangerous the area is, with higher
      values suggesting greater risk.
  returns: A float value indicating the safety of the evaluated position. Higher values
    represent safer positions, while lower values indicate more dangerous areas. The
    exact scale and interpretation may depend on internal game mechanics or threat
    calculation algorithms.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: float safety = awareness.EvaluatePositionSafety(12345, 75);
    language: cpp
  - title: AI Decision Making Based on Safety
    code: "if (awareness.EvaluatePositionSafety(playerPos, currentThreat) > 0.7f)\n\
      {\n    // Move to this position as it's considered safe\n    player->MoveTo(position);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Avoid this position due to high threat level\n    player->FindAlternativePath();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI system designed to assess environmental
    safety for NPC or player movement decisions. It may use internal data structures
    like threat maps or danger zones to compute its results. The implementation might
    involve complex calculations including distance-based threat decay, line-of-sight
    checks, and dynamic obstacle detection.
  warnings: The method assumes valid inputs for both parameters; invalid position
    or threat values could lead to undefined behavior. Since this is an AI-related
    function, performance may be critical in real-time applications where frequent
    evaluations occur.
