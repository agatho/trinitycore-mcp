  class: ClassAI
  method: ConsumeResource
  signature: void ClassAI::ConsumeResource(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes the specified resource for a spell cast by the AI-controlled unit.
  description: The ConsumeResource method is used by ClassAI to deduct the required
    resources (such as mana, rage, or energy) from the AI-controlled unit when a spell
    is cast. This method ensures that the unit has sufficient resources before proceeding
    with the spell execution and handles resource depletion accordingly. It typically
    integrates with the game's resource management system to enforce spell casting
    requirements and maintain balance in combat mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell for which resources should be
      consumed. This ID corresponds to entries in the spell database and determines
      the specific resource costs associated with the spell.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Consumption
    code: "void MyClass::OnSpellCast(int spellId)\n{\n    // Consume resources for\
      \ the spell\n    m_ai->ConsumeResource(spellId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Resource Consumption
    code: "void MyClass::ExecuteSpell(int spellId)\n{\n    if (m_ai->HasRequiredResources(spellId))\n\
      \    {\n        m_ai->ConsumeResource(spellId);\n        // Proceed with spell\
      \ execution\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after verifying that the AI unit has sufficient
    resources. The actual resource deduction logic may vary depending on the spell's
    properties and the AI unit's current state. It is typically invoked internally
    by the AI system during spell processing.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without checking resource availability can
    lead to invalid resource states or unexpected behavior in combat. Ensure that
    all calls to ConsumeResource are preceded by appropriate validation checks.
