  class: GameObject
  method: GetFishLootJunk
  signature: Loot * GameObject::GetFishLootJunk(int * lootOwner)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the loot table for fishing junk items associated with this game object.
  description: This method retrieves the loot table containing fishing junk items
    that can be obtained from the GameObject. It is used to determine what loot can
    be generated when a player successfully fishes in the vicinity of this object.
    The method returns a pointer to a Loot object which contains the loot entries
    for fishing junk items, allowing developers to access and manipulate the loot
    data for this specific game object.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to a Loot object containing the fishing junk loot entries
    for this GameObject. If no loot exists or the object has no fishing junk entries,
    the method may return nullptr or an empty Loot object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Loot *loot = gameobject->GetFishLootJunk();\nif (loot)\n{\n    for (auto&\
      \ entry : loot->GetLootList())\n    {\n        // Process each loot entry\n\
      \        std::cout << \"Item ID: \" << entry.itemid << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with fishing mechanics and may
    be called during a player's fishing action when they successfully fish near this
    GameObject. The returned Loot object should not be modified directly, as it is
    managed by the game object's internal system.
  warnings: The method may return nullptr if no loot entries exist for the specified
    GameObject or if the object does not support fishing junk items. Care must be
    taken to ensure that the returned pointer is valid before accessing its contents.
