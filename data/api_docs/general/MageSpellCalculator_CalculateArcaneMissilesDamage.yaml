  class: MageSpellCalculator
  method: CalculateArcaneMissilesDamage
  signature: uint32 MageSpellCalculator::CalculateArcaneMissilesDamage(Player * caster,
    ::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the damage output of the Arcane Missiles spell for a given caster
    and target.
  description: The CalculateArcaneMissilesDamage method computes the total damage
    dealt by the Arcane Missiles spell, taking into account various factors such as
    the caster's spell power, the target's resistance, and any applicable buffs or
    debuffs. This method is typically invoked during the execution of the Arcane Missiles
    spell to determine how much damage should be applied to the target. It adheres
    to the game's damage calculation mechanics, including critical strike chances,
    spell penetration, and damage multipliers. The result represents the final damage
    value that will be inflicted on the target.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the caster of the Arcane
      Missiles spell. Must not be null.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target of the spell.
      Must not be null.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the calculated damage dealt by the
    Arcane Missiles spell. The value is zero if the spell fails to hit or if damage
    calculation results in no damage.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player instance

      Unit* target = ...; // Get target unit

      uint32 damage = MageSpellCalculator::CalculateArcaneMissilesDamage(player, target);

      // Apply damage to target

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: With Damage Application
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nUnit* target = ...;\nuint32 damage = MageSpellCalculator::CalculateArcaneMissilesDamage(player,\
      \ target);\nif (damage > 0)\n{\n    target->DealDamage(player, damage, NULL,\
      \ SPELL_DIRECT_DAMAGE, SPELL_SCHOOL_MASK_NORMAL, NULL, false);\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the spell has already been validated for casting
    conditions. It does not perform any checks on whether the spell can be cast or
    if the target is valid. The calculation includes standard damage modifiers but
    excludes effects like spell haste or additional proc-based damage.
  warnings: Ensure both caster and target pointers are valid before calling this method
    to prevent segmentation faults. This function should only be called during active
    spell execution, not during initialization or cleanup phases.
