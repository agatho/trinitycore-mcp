documentation:
  brief: Updates the MageAI's specialization state based on current spell availability
    and combat conditions.
  description: The UpdateSpecialization method in the MageAI class dynamically adjusts
    the AI's magical specialization by evaluating the player's current spell knowledge,
    available mana, and combat situation. This method ensures that the mage AI selects
    the most appropriate arcane, fire, or frost specialization for optimal performance
    during encounters. It typically runs during each AI update cycle to maintain up-to-date
    specialization decisions based on real-time game state changes such as buff/debuff
    status, target health, and resource levels.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MageAI::Update()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    UpdateSpecialization();\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI update loop and should
    not be invoked manually unless implementing custom AI behavior. The specialization
    decision-making process considers spell cooldowns, mana efficiency, and encounter-specific
    tactics.
