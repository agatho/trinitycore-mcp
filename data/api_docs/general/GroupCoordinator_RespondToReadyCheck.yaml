  signature: bool GroupCoordinator::RespondToReadyCheck(bool ready)
documentation:
  brief: Responds to a group ready check by indicating whether the player is ready
  description: The RespondToReadyCheck method allows a player in a group to respond
    to a ready check initiated by the group leader. This method updates the group's
    ready status tracking and communicates the player's readiness state to other group
    members. The method typically gets called when a player clicks the 'Ready' or
    'Not Ready' button during a group encounter or dungeon start. It ensures that
    the group coordinator can accurately track which players are prepared to proceed
    with the activity.
  parameters:
  - name: ready
    description: Boolean value indicating whether the player is ready (true) or not
      ready (false) for the group activity
  returns: Returns true if the response was successfully processed and recorded, false
    if there was an error in processing the response
  examples:
  - title: Basic Ready Check Response
    code: "GroupCoordinator* coordinator = player->GetGroup()->GetGroupCoordinator();\n\
      bool result = coordinator->RespondToReadyCheck(true);\nif (result)\n{\n    //\
      \ Player's ready status was successfully updated\n    sLog->outString(\"Player\
      \ responded as ready to group ready check\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ready Check Response
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && group->IsLeader(player))\n\
      {\n    GroupCoordinator* coordinator = group->GetGroupCoordinator();\n    bool\
      \ isPlayerReady = player->HasAura(SPELL_ID_READY_CHECK_AURA);\n    bool result\
      \ = coordinator->RespondToReadyCheck(isPlayerReady);\n    // Handle the response\
      \ result\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a group ready check is active. The
    method internally handles synchronization with other group members and updates
    the internal ready status tracking. It's typically invoked from UI interactions
    or game event handlers.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of an active ready check context may result
    in unexpected behavior or ignored responses. Ensure that the player is actually
    in a group and that the ready check has been initiated before calling this method.
