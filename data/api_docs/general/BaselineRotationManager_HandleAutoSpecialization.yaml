  signature: bool BaselineRotationManager::HandleAutoSpecialization(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates a bot's specialization based on current combat state and class capabilities
  description: The HandleAutoSpecialization method automatically determines and applies
    the most appropriate specialization for a bot character during gameplay. This
    method evaluates the bot's current class, available talents, equipped gear, and
    combat situation to select an optimal specialization that maximizes effectiveness
    in the given context. It typically runs during bot decision-making cycles and
    may modify the bot's specialization state to improve performance in combat scenarios.
    The method returns true if a specialization change was successfully applied, or
    false if no changes were necessary or possible.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot's identifier or index
      within the system. This parameter is used to locate and modify the specific
      bot instance being processed.
  returns: Returns true if a specialization change was successfully applied to the
    bot, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that no changes were
    needed, the bot was not found, or the specialization update failed for some reason.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int botId = 123;\nbool result = rotationManager->HandleAutoSpecialization(&botId);\n\
      if (result) {\n    // Specialization updated successfully\n    printf(\"Bot\
      \ specialization updated\\n\");\n} else {\n    // No changes made\n    printf(\"\
      No specialization change needed\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Management System
    code: "void UpdateBotSpecialization(BaselineRotationManager* manager, int botIndex)\
      \ {\n    if (manager && botIndex >= 0) {\n        bool changed = manager->HandleAutoSpecialization(&botIndex);\n\
      \        if (changed) {\n            // Notify system of specialization change\n\
      \            SendSpecializationUpdate(botIndex);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI decision-making loops and should
    not be invoked too frequently to avoid performance degradation. The method relies
    on internal bot state tracking and may require the bot to be in a valid combat-ready
    state for optimal results.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter points to a valid bot instance before calling
    this method, as passing an invalid pointer may lead to undefined behavior. This
    method modifies the bot's specialization state directly, so it should only be
    called when appropriate for the current gameplay context.
