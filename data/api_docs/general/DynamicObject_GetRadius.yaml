  class: DynamicObject
  method: GetRadius
  signature: float DynamicObject::GetRadius() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the radius of the dynamic object in yards.
  description: The GetRadius method retrieves the radius value associated with a DynamicObject
    instance, which defines the spatial extent or influence area of the object. This
    radius is typically used for collision detection, spell targeting, and determining
    the effective area of effects such as area-of-effect spells or environmental triggers.
    The returned value represents the distance from the object's center to its outer
    boundary in world coordinates. This method is commonly called during game logic
    processing when evaluating spatial relationships between dynamic objects and other
    entities in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the radius of the dynamic object in yards. This
    value defines the distance from the object's center point to its outer edge, used
    for spatial calculations and collision detection.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve radius for spell effect area
    code: "DynamicObject* dynObj = player->GetDynObjectByType(SPELL_EFFECT_DYNAMICOBJECT);\n\
      if (dynObj)\n{\n    float radius = dynObj->GetRadius();\n    // Use radius to\
      \ determine affected targets\n    sLog->outString(\"Dynamic object radius: %.2f\
      \ yards\", radius);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The radius value is typically set when the DynamicObject is created and may
    be influenced by spell properties or effects that modify the object's size. This
    method performs a simple getter operation with no side effects and should be safe
    to call from any thread context where the object is valid.
