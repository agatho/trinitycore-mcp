documentation:
  brief: Loads reputation rewards for creatures killed by players.
  description: The LoadReputationOnKill method initializes and loads the reputation
    reward data for creatures that grant reputation when killed by players. This method
    is typically called during server startup or database reload operations to populate
    internal data structures with reputation gain information from the database. It
    processes entries in the reputation_on_kill table, which defines how much reputation
    a player gains with specific factions when killing particular creature entries.
    The loaded data is used during player kill events to determine and apply appropriate
    faction reputation changes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadDatabase()\n{\n    // ... other initialization code ...\n\
      \    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadReputationOnKill();\n    // ... more initialization\
      \ code ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked during server startup or database reloads.
    It's important to note that this method doesn't validate the loaded data against
    existing creature or faction definitions, so invalid entries may cause runtime
    issues. The method assumes that the database connection is already established
    and valid.
  warnings: Improperly configured reputation_on_kill entries in the database can lead
    to incorrect faction reputation changes for players. Ensure all faction IDs and
    creature IDs referenced in the database exist in their respective tables before
    calling this method.
