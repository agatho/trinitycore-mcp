  class: AuraEffect
  method: GetPeriodicTimer
  signature: int32 AuraEffect::GetPeriodicTimer() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the time remaining until the next periodic effect tick of the aura.
  description: The GetPeriodicTimer method retrieves the number of milliseconds remaining
    before the next periodic tick occurs for this aura effect. This timer is used
    internally by the game engine to manage the timing of recurring effects such as
    damage over time (DoT) or healing over time (HoT) spells. The returned value represents
    the countdown from the last tick, and when it reaches zero, the next periodic
    effect will be applied. This method is commonly used in custom scripts or modules
    that need to monitor or modify aura behavior dynamically.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int32 value representing the number of milliseconds until the next periodic
    tick occurs. A value of 0 or less indicates that the next tick is due or has already
    occurred.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Time Until Next Tick
    code: "AuraEffect* auraEffect = unit->GetAuraEffect(12345, 0);\nif (auraEffect)\n\
      {\n    int32 timeRemaining = auraEffect->GetPeriodicTimer();\n    if (timeRemaining\
      \ <= 0)\n        // Next tick is due\n    else\n        // Wait for timeRemaining\
      \ milliseconds before next tick\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a value that updates dynamically as the aura progresses.
    The timer reflects the actual time remaining based on server timing and may be
    affected by factors such as spell haste or other game mechanics that modify effect
    timing.
