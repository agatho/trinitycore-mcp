  signature: bool SpellInfo::IsStackableWithRanks() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell can be stacked with its rank variants.
  description: This method checks if a spell is eligible to be stacked with other
    instances of the same spell that are at different ranks. It evaluates the spell's
    stacking properties, which are crucial for determining how spell effects interact
    when multiple players cast the same spell at different levels. This functionality
    is essential for managing spell mechanics in World of Warcraft, particularly when
    dealing with spell rank progression and stacking behavior. The method returns
    true if the spell can be stacked with its rank variants, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell can be stacked with its rank variants, false
    otherwise. This indicates whether the spell supports multiple instances of the
    same spell at different ranks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spellInfo->IsStackableWithRanks()) {\n    // Spell can be stacked with\
      \ rank variants\n    // Perform stacking logic here\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during spell initialization and validation
    processes. It's important to note that this method does not directly determine
    if a spell can stack with other spells, but rather whether the spell can be stacked
    with its own rank variants. Implementation details involve checking internal spell
    properties and comparing against known stacking rules.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with other spell stacking methods.
    It specifically checks for rank stacking compatibility, not general stacking behavior.
    Incorrect use of this method may lead to improper spell stacking logic in game
    mechanics.
