  class: BlackMarketMgr

  signature: void BlackMarketMgr::SendAuctionOutbidMail(BlackMarketEntry * entry,
    int trans)
documentation:
  brief: Sends an outbid notification email to the previous bidder when a Black Market
    auction is successfully outbid.
  description: The SendAuctionOutbidMail method is responsible for notifying the former
    highest bidder via in-game mail when their bid on a Black Market auction has been
    exceeded by another player's bid. This method ensures that players are kept informed
    of auction dynamics and can adjust their bidding strategy accordingly. The function
    likely retrieves relevant auction data from the provided BlackMarketEntry parameter
    and constructs an appropriate email message with details such as the item being
    auctioned, the new bid amount, and the previous bidder's information. It is typically
    invoked during the processing of a new bid that surpasses the current highest
    bid in a Black Market auction.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: Pointer to the BlackMarketEntry structure containing details about
      the auction that was outbid, including item information and current bid data.
  - name: trans
    description: Transaction identifier or context value used to track the specific
      auction event; may be used for logging or correlation purposes within the auction
      system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in auction processing
    code: "void ProcessNewBid(BlackMarketEntry* entry, int transactionId) {\n    //\
      \ ... validate new bid ...\n    if (newBid > entry->currentBid) {\n        //\
      \ Update the bid\n        entry->currentBid = newBid;\n        entry->bidderGuid\
      \ = newBidderGuid;\n        \n        // Notify previous bidder\n        sBlackMarketMgr->SendAuctionOutbidMail(entry,\
      \ transactionId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Black Market auction system and likely interacts
    with the mail system to deliver notifications. It should only be called when a
    valid outbid condition occurs to avoid unnecessary mail generation.
  warnings: Ensure that the BlackMarketEntry pointer is valid and not null before
    calling this method, as passing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes.
