  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: GetActiveProfile
  signature: const BehaviorProfile * AdaptiveBehaviorManager::GetActiveProfile() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the currently active behavior profile from the adaptive behavior
    manager.
  description: The GetActiveProfile method returns a pointer to the BehaviorProfile
    object that is currently being used by the AdaptiveBehaviorManager. This profile
    defines the active set of behaviors and rules that govern how an AI-controlled
    unit or system should act in the game world. The returned pointer is const, meaning
    it should not be modified directly. The method does not perform any validation
    or switching of profiles; it simply returns a reference to the currently assigned
    profile. This method is typically used by other systems within the AI framework
    to query the current behavior configuration without altering it.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the BehaviorProfile object that represents the active
    behavior configuration. Returns nullptr if no profile is currently set or if the
    manager has not been initialized with a valid profile.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const BehaviorProfile* activeProfile = behaviorManager.GetActiveProfile();\n\
      if (activeProfile != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the active profile\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      ai\", \"Active profile: {}\", activeProfile->GetName());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Profile Validity Before Usage
    code: "AdaptiveBehaviorManager behaviorManager;\n// ... initialization code ...\n\
      const BehaviorProfile* profile = behaviorManager.GetActiveProfile();\nif (profile\
      \ && profile->IsValid())\n{\n    // Safe to use the profile\n    auto behaviors\
      \ = profile->GetBehaviors();\n    for (const auto& behavior : behaviors)\n \
      \   {\n        LOG_DEBUG(\"ai\", \"Behavior: {}\", behavior->GetName());\n \
      \   }\n}\nelse\n{\n    LOG_ERROR(\"ai\", \"No valid active profile found\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned BehaviorProfile pointer is only valid as long as the AdaptiveBehaviorManager
    instance remains alive and the profile hasn't been changed. This method is thread-safe
    if the underlying manager implementation supports concurrent access, but it's
    recommended to synchronize access in multi-threaded environments where profile
    changes might occur.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the returned BehaviorProfile object directly
    through this pointer, as it's const. Modifications should be made through dedicated
    setter methods or profile management functions. Be cautious when using this method
    in performance-critical code paths, as accessing the active profile may involve
    internal locking mechanisms depending on implementation.
