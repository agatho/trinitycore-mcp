  brief: Initializes the priority order for priest equipment slots based on class-specific
    requirements and item statistics.
  description: The InitializePriestPriorities method sets up the default priority
    rankings for various equipment slots specific to the Priest class in TrinityCore.
    This function determines which items should be equipped first when a Priest character
    is auto-equipping gear, considering factors such as spell power, critical strike
    rating, haste, and other relevant stats that benefit the Priest's gameplay style.
    It typically runs during character initialization or when loading equipment configurations
    for Priest characters.
