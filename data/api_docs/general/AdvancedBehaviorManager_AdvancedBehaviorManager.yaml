  method: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::AdvancedBehaviorManager(Player * bot, BotAI
    * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new AdvancedBehaviorManager instance with the specified player
    and AI context.
  description: The AdvancedBehaviorManager constructor initializes a new behavior
    manager instance for a given player bot and associated AI system. This method
    sets up internal state management for advanced AI behaviors, including initializing
    behavior trees, configuring decision-making logic, and establishing communication
    channels between the bot's player object and its AI subsystem. The constructor
    is typically called during bot creation or initialization phases when a new AI-controlled
    player character needs to be configured with advanced behavioral capabilities.
    It ensures that all necessary resources are allocated and that the manager is
    ready to handle complex AI operations such as pathfinding, combat decision-making,
    and quest behavior execution.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character that
      this manager will control. Must not be null and should represent a valid player
      instance in the game world.
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI object containing the AI logic and decision-making
      framework for the bot. Must not be null and should be properly initialized before
      calling this constructor.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AdvancedBehaviorManager Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get or create a player bot

      BotAI* myAI = ...;     // Get or create the AI instance

      AdvancedBehaviorManager behaviorManager(myBot, myAI);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing with Bot Creation Context
    code: "void CreateBotWithAdvancedAI(Player* player)\n{\n    BotAI* ai = new BotAI(player);\n\
      \    AdvancedBehaviorManager* manager = new AdvancedBehaviorManager(player,\
      \ ai);\n    // Manager is now ready to handle complex bot behaviors\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs essential initialization of the behavior management
    system. It should only be called once per instance during object construction.
    The manager assumes ownership of the provided AI pointer and will manage its lifecycle.
    Ensure that both parameters are valid before calling this constructor to prevent
    undefined behavior.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor with null pointers as it may lead to crashes
    or undefined behavior. The bot and AI objects must be properly initialized and
    registered in the game world before this constructor is invoked. Calling this
    constructor multiple times on the same instance will result in resource leaks
    or corrupted state.
