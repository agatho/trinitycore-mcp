  brief: Dumps the contents of the social event queue to the console for debugging
    purposes.
  description: The DumpEventQueue method outputs all pending social events currently
    stored in the SocialEventBus queue to the console or log system. This utility
    function is primarily used for debugging and development to inspect the state
    of queued social interactions such as friend requests, guild invitations, or other
    player-to-player communications. The method does not modify any data but provides
    a snapshot of events awaiting processing. It's typically called during development
    or debugging sessions when developers need to understand the flow of social events
    in the game system.

  notes: This method is intended for development and debugging only. It may produce
    verbose output in production environments and should not be called frequently
    in performance-critical code paths. The output format depends on the underlying
    logging system used by TrinityCore.
