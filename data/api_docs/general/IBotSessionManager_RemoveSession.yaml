  class: IBotSessionManager
  method: RemoveSession
  signature: bool IBotSessionManager::RemoveSession(int characterGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a bot session associated with the specified character GUID from the
    session manager.
  description: 'The RemoveSession method is responsible for removing a bot session
    from the IBotSessionManager''s internal collection. It takes a character GUID
    as input and attempts to locate and remove the corresponding session. This method
    is typically used when a bot character is deleted, disconnected, or needs to be
    explicitly removed from active management. The operation ensures that resources
    associated with the bot session are properly cleaned up and that the session manager
    maintains consistency. Precondition: The character GUID must correspond to an
    existing bot session in the manager. Postcondition: If successful, the session
    is removed and subsequent calls to retrieve that session will fail.'
  parameters:
  - name: characterGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the character whose bot session needs
      to be removed. This value must correspond to a valid bot character in the system.
  returns: Returns true if the session was successfully found and removed, false otherwise.
    A return value of false may indicate that no session exists for the provided character
    GUID or that the removal operation failed due to internal errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Session Removal
    code: "int botGuid = 12345;\nbool success = sessionManager->RemoveSession(botGuid);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Session successfully removed\n    printf(\"Bot session\
      \ removed successfully.\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Session not found or removal\
      \ failed\n    printf(\"Failed to remove bot session.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during bot lifecycle management, such as
    when a bot character is deleted from the game world or when a session needs to
    be forcefully terminated. The implementation likely involves internal data structure
    manipulation (e.g., hash map or list) to locate and remove the session entry.
