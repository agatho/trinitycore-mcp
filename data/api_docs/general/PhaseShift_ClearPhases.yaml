  method: ClearPhases
  signature: void PhaseShift::ClearPhases()
documentation:
  brief: Clears all active phase shifts from the PhaseShift object, removing all associated
    phase masks and reseting the phase state.
  description: The ClearPhases method removes all currently active phase shifts from
    a PhaseShift object, effectively resetting its internal phase mask to an empty
    state. This operation is commonly used when transitioning between different game
    environments or when explicitly clearing phase restrictions that may have been
    applied to a player or object. The method ensures that no phase-related restrictions
    remain active after execution, allowing the entity to interact with all areas
    and objects in the world as if no phases were previously set. This is particularly
    important for maintaining proper game state during zone changes, instance resets,
    or when applying new phase configurations.

  examples:
  - title: Clearing Phases on a Player
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      PhaseShift& phaseShift = player->GetPhaseShift();

      phaseShift.ClearPhases();

      // All previous phase restrictions are now removed'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing Phases Before Applying New Ones
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      PhaseShift& phaseShift = player->GetPhaseShift();

      phaseShift.ClearPhases();

      phaseShift.AddPhase(1234);

      phaseShift.AddPhase(5678);

      // Ensures clean slate before applying new phases'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal phase mask state and should be
    used carefully during state transitions. It's typically called internally by the
    core systems when a player leaves an instance or zone, but can also be invoked
    manually when custom phase management is required.
  warnings: Calling ClearPhases() may cause unexpected behavior if other systems are
    relying on existing phase restrictions. Ensure that all dependent systems are
    properly notified of the phase change before calling this method.
