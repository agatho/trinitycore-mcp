  class: Quest
  method: GetRewMailTemplateId
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetRewMailTemplateId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the mail template ID associated with the quest's reward.
  description: The GetRewMailTemplateId method retrieves the unique identifier of
    the mail template that is used when a player completes the quest. This template
    defines the structure and content of the reward mail sent to the player, including
    items, gold, and experience. The method is commonly used in quest completion logic
    to determine what mail should be sent to the player upon finishing a quest. It
    typically returns 0 if no mail template is associated with the quest or if the
    quest does not have a reward mail component.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the mail template ID as a uint32 value, which represents the unique
    identifier of the mail template used for quest rewards. If no mail template is
    defined for the quest, this method returns 0. The returned value can be used to
    look up the mail template in the game database or to determine what reward content
    should be sent to the player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 mailTemplateId = quest->GetRewMailTemplateId();\nif (mailTemplateId\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process the mail template\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Quest class and is typically used during quest
    completion handling. It should be used in conjunction with other quest-related
    methods to ensure proper reward delivery. The method does not perform any database
    lookup itself; it simply returns the stored ID from the quest data.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method, as incorrect usage can lead
    to missing or incorrect rewards being sent to players. Ensure that the returned
    mail template ID is valid and corresponds to an existing mail template in the
    database.
