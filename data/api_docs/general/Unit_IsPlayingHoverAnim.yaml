  method: IsPlayingHoverAnim
  signature: bool Unit::IsPlayingHoverAnim() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit is currently playing a hover animation.
  description: This method determines whether the unit (player or creature) is currently
    executing a hover animation, which typically occurs when the unit is in flight
    or hovering above ground. The method returns true if the unit is actively performing
    a hover animation, and false otherwise. This functionality is commonly used in
    game mechanics to determine if a unit is in an airborne state or to control visual
    effects related to movement. It can be particularly useful for detecting when
    a player or creature is in flight mode or when certain animations are active.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is currently playing a hover animation, false
    otherwise. This indicates that the unit is either in flight or hovering above
    ground, and may be used to determine whether specific visual effects or movement
    states are active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsPlayingHoverAnim())\n{\n    // Unit is currently hovering\n\
      \    // Do something here\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Unit is not hovering\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be used in conjunction with other movement-related methods
    to determine the current state of a unit. It's important to note that this method
    only checks for hover animation specifically, and not other types of movement
    animations such as flying or swimming.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in combination with other
    movement-related functions, as it may not always reflect the actual movement state
    of the unit. For example, a unit might be in flight mode but not playing a hover
    animation if it's using a different animation.
