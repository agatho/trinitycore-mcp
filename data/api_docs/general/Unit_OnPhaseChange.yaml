documentation:
  brief: Handles phase change events for units in World of Warcraft
  description: The OnPhaseChange method is responsible for managing and processing
    phase-related events within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically gets
    invoked when a unit's phase status changes, such as when entering or leaving a
    specific phase area, or when phase transitions occur due to game mechanics like
    quest completion, zone changes, or player interaction. It ensures proper handling
    of phase-related logic and maintains synchronization between the unit's current
    phase state and the game world.

  - title: Basic Phase Change Handling
    code: "void Unit::OnPhaseChange()\n{\n    // Implementation for handling phase\
      \ changes\n    // This method may be called during phase transitions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically part of the core unit behavior and may be overridden
    in custom scripts or modules. It's important to understand that phase changes
    can affect visibility, interaction, and other gameplay mechanics.
  warnings: Improper handling of phase changes can lead to incorrect visibility or
    interaction behaviors, especially when dealing with players and NPCs.
