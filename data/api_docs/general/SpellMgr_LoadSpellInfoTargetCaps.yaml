documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads target cap data for all spells within the SpellMgr.
  description: The LoadSpellInfoTargetCaps method is responsible for loading and initializing
    target cap information for all spells in the TrinityCore database. This method
    processes spell target constraints and limits, ensuring that each spell's allowed
    target types and counts are properly configured. It typically runs during server
    startup or spell data initialization phases, populating internal data structures
    with target cap configurations from the database. The method does not require
    any parameters and performs its operations internally using the SpellMgr's database
    connection and data loading mechanisms.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeSpells()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->LoadSpellInfoTargetCaps();\n\
      \    // Other spell initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup as part of the SpellMgr
    initialization sequence. It should only be invoked after the database connection
    is established and spell data has been loaded. The method modifies internal SpellMgr
    state and is not thread-safe for concurrent execution with other spell loading
    methods.
  warnings: Do not call this method multiple times without proper cleanup, as it may
    lead to duplicate data entries or memory leaks. Ensure that all required database
    tables containing target cap information are properly populated before invoking
    this method.
