  signature: const WorldSafeLocsEntry * ObjectMgr::GetWorldSafeLoc(uint32 id) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the world safe location entry for a given identifier.
  description: The GetWorldSafeLoc method retrieves a const pointer to a WorldSafeLocsEntry
    object based on the provided unique identifier. This entry typically contains
    information about a safe location in the game world, such as coordinates and map
    ID where players can safely respawn or teleport. The method performs a lookup
    in an internal data structure that maps safe location IDs to their corresponding
    entries. It is commonly used during player respawning, teleportation logic, or
    when determining valid spawn points for characters.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the WorldSafeLocsEntry associated with the given ID,
    or nullptr if no such entry exists.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Safe Location for Player Respawn
    code: "const WorldSafeLocsEntry* safeLoc = sObjectMgr->GetWorldSafeLoc(1234);\n\
      if (safeLoc)\n{\n    // Use safeLoc->MapID, safeLoc->X, safeLoc->Y, etc.\n \
      \   sLog->outString(\"Safe location found at map %u, coordinates (%f, %f)\"\
      ,\n        safeLoc->MapID, safeLoc->X, safeLoc->Y);\n}\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      No safe location found for ID 1234\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal data structures that are typically populated
    during server startup from database entries. The returned pointer is valid only
    as long as the ObjectMgr instance exists and the data has not been modified. It's
    thread-safe for read operations assuming the underlying data structure is properly
    synchronized.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned pointer; ensure it's not null before
    dereferencing. Also, note that WorldSafeLocsEntry may contain deprecated or invalid
    coordinates if the database entry was not properly maintained.
