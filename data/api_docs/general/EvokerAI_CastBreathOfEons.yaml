  class: EvokerAI
  method: CastBreathOfEons
  signature: void EvokerAI::CastBreathOfEons(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Casts the Breath of Eons spell on the specified target.
  description: The CastBreathOfEons method executes the Breath of Eons ability, a
    damage-over-time spell that applies a debuff to the target. This method is typically
    invoked by an Evoker AI instance during combat when appropriate conditions are
    met. The spell deals initial damage and then applies a stacking debuff that continues
    to deal damage over time. The method takes a pointer to an integer representing
    the target's identifier, which is used to locate and apply the spell effect. The
    EvokerAI class manages the cooldowns and targeting logic for this ability.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer identifying the target unit for the Breath
      of Eons spell. This value represents the target's GUID or similar identifier
      used by the TrinityCore framework.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Evoker AI Context
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        CastBreathOfEons(&target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the EvokerAI instance has valid access to the target
    unit and that the spell is not on cooldown. The target parameter should be validated
    before calling this method to prevent potential crashes or undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is properly dereferenced and that the target
    unit exists in the current world context. Passing an invalid or null target can
    lead to unexpected behavior or server crashes.
