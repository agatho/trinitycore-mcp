documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the rate of health change over time for the analyzed
    combat state.
  description: The GetHealthTrend method computes the trend of health changes for
    a combatant within the analyzed combat state. It evaluates the difference in health
    values over a specified time interval to determine whether the health is increasing,
    decreasing, or remaining stable. This value represents the average rate of change
    in health per second and can be used to assess the effectiveness of healing or
    damage dealt during combat. The method relies on internal tracking mechanisms
    that monitor health fluctuations and time intervals between measurements. It is
    typically used by AI systems or combat analysis tools to evaluate combat performance
    or predict future health states.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the rate of health change per second. Positive
    values indicate increasing health (healing), negative values indicate decreasing
    health (damage), and zero indicates no change in health over the measured interval.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "CombatStateAnalyzer analyzer;\nfloat trend = analyzer.GetHealthTrend();\n\
      if (trend > 0.0f) {\n    printf(\"Player is being healed at %.2f HP/sec\\n\"\
      , trend);\n} else if (trend < 0.0f) {\n    printf(\"Player is taking damage\
      \ at %.2f HP/sec\\n\", -trend);\n} else {\n    printf(\"Player health is stable\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Analysis
    code: "CombatStateAnalyzer analyzer;\n// Assume combat state has been initialized\
      \ with health data\nfloat trend = analyzer.GetHealthTrend();\nif (trend < -5.0f)\
      \ {\n    // Player is taking heavy damage\n    printf(\"Critical damage detected:\
      \ %.2f HP/sec\\n\", -trend);\n} else if (trend > 10.0f) {\n    // Player is\
      \ receiving strong healing\n    printf(\"Strong healing detected: %.2f HP/sec\\\
      n\", trend);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that health data has been properly recorded and tracked
    within the CombatStateAnalyzer instance. The accuracy of the returned value depends
    on the frequency and precision of internal health measurements. This method may
    return unexpected values if the combat state is not fully initialized or if there
    are gaps in health tracking data.
  warnings: This method should not be called before initializing the combat state
    with sufficient health data points. Calling it immediately after construction
    without data may result in undefined behavior or inaccurate results. The returned
    value is only meaningful when the combat state has been actively monitored for
    a measurable time period.
