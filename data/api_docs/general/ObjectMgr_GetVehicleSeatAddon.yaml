  brief: Retrieves the seat addon data for a specified vehicle seat ID
  description: The GetVehicleSeatAddon method retrieves the addon data associated
    with a specific vehicle seat ID. This data typically contains information about
    seat positioning, mounting offsets, or other vehicle-specific attachment points
    used in the game's vehicle system. The method returns a pointer to an array of
    integers that represent the addon configuration for the given seat. If no addon
    data exists for the specified seat ID, the method may return a null pointer or
    a default configuration depending on internal implementation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an array of integers representing the vehicle seat addon
    data. Returns nullptr if no addon data is found for the given seat ID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use vehicle seat addon data
    code: "const int* addonData = sObjectMgr->GetVehicleSeatAddon(5);\nif (addonData\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process addon data\n    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i)\n\
      \    {\n        printf(\"Addon[%d] = %d\\n\", i, addonData[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in vehicle-related systems to determine how
    passengers should be positioned or attached to vehicles. The returned integer
    array typically contains offset values and positioning data that affects the visual
    and physical placement of players on vehicles.
