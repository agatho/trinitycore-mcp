  brief: Removes a player from the ignore list
  description: The HandleDelIgnoreOpcode method processes incoming packets to remove
    a specified player from the current session's ignore list. This function is part
    of the social system in TrinityCore, allowing players to manage their list of
    ignored users. The method typically receives a packet containing the GUID or name
    of the player to be removed from the ignore list. It validates that the player
    exists and is currently on the ignore list before performing the removal operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in social system
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleDelIgnoreOpcode(WorldPackets::Social::DelIgnore&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    if (packet.PlayerGUID)\n    {\n        Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(packet.PlayerGUID);\n\
      \        if (player && GetPlayer()->GetSocial()->HasIgnore(packet.PlayerGUID))\n\
      \        {\n            GetPlayer()->GetSocial()->RemoveIgnore(packet.PlayerGUID);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as a result of a client-side social packet.
    The implementation assumes that the player's social list has already been initialized
    and validated. The method does not send any confirmation back to the client upon
    successful removal.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID provided in the packet is valid and corresponds to
    an actual player. Attempting to remove a non-existent player from the ignore list
    may result in no-op behavior or potential errors if not properly validated.
