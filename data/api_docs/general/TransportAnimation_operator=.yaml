  brief: Moves the contents of another TransportAnimation object to this instance
  description: The move assignment operator for TransportAnimation transfers all resources
    and state from the source TransportAnimation object to this object. This operation
    is typically used to efficiently transfer ownership of dynamically allocated memory
    or other resources without performing a deep copy. The source object is left in
    a valid but unspecified state after the move operation. In the context of TrinityCore's
    transport system, this operator allows for efficient management of transport animation
    data during object lifecycle operations, such as when moving transports between
    different maps or when reassigning transport entities.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current TransportAnimation object after the move assignment
    has been completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'TransportAnimation anim1;

      TransportAnimation anim2 = std::move(anim1); // Uses move assignment

      // anim1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Transport Management
    code: "void UpdateTransport(TransportAnimation& oldTransport, TransportAnimation\
      \ newTransport) {\n    oldTransport = std::move(newTransport); // Efficiently\
      \ transfer new transport data\n    // newTransport is now empty and ready for\
      \ reuse\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is part of the C++ move semantics standard and should be used
    when transferring ownership of resources. The moved-from object remains valid
    but its contents are unspecified. This operation typically has O(1) complexity
    as it only transfers pointers or handles rather than copying large data structures.
  warnings: Be cautious when using move assignment with objects that may still be
    referenced elsewhere, as the source object's state becomes undefined after the
    operation. Ensure no other code relies on the pre-move state of the source object.
