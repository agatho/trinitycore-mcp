  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: GetBotMetrics
  signature: int PerformanceOptimizer::GetBotMetrics(uint32_t botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves performance metrics for a specified bot using its unique identifier.
  description: The GetBotMetrics method retrieves detailed performance statistics
    for a specific bot within the TrinityCore environment. This function is typically
    used by performance monitoring systems or administrative tools to gather data
    about bot behavior, resource usage, and operational efficiency. The method accepts
    a bot's unique global identifier (GUID) as input and returns an integer value
    representing the collected metrics. The returned integer may encode various performance
    indicators such as CPU usage, memory consumption, or processing time depending
    on the internal implementation of the PerformanceOptimizer class.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: A unique 32-bit identifier (GUID) that uniquely identifies a specific
      bot instance within the game world. This value should correspond to a valid
      bot entry in the system's database or runtime state.
  returns: An integer value representing aggregated performance metrics for the specified
    bot. The exact meaning of this integer depends on the internal implementation
    but typically encodes information such as resource utilization, processing time,
    or other relevant performance indicators. A return value of zero may indicate
    no data was available or an error occurred during metric collection.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve bot metrics
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = 12345;\nint metrics = optimizer.GetBotMetrics(botGuid);\n\
      if (metrics > 0) {\n    printf(\"Bot %u has performance score: %d\\n\", botGuid,\
      \ metrics);\n} else {\n    printf(\"Failed to retrieve metrics for bot %u\\\
      n\", botGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger performance monitoring framework within
    TrinityCore. It assumes that the provided botGuid corresponds to an active or
    previously registered bot in the system. The actual format and interpretation
    of the returned integer value should be determined by examining the internal implementation
    of PerformanceOptimizer.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid parameter refers to a valid bot instance, otherwise
    the behavior is undefined. This method may block or cause performance degradation
    if called frequently without proper caching mechanisms in place.
