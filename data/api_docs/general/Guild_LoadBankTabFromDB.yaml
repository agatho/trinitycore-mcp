documentation:
  brief: Loads guild bank tab data from the database into the guild object.
  description: The LoadBankTabFromDB method retrieves all bank tab information associated
    with a guild from the database and populates the internal data structures of the
    Guild class. This method is typically invoked during guild initialization or when
    refreshing guild data. It processes the database fields related to bank tabs,
    including tab names, icons, permissions, and item storage. The method assumes
    that the database connection is already established and that the necessary field
    indices are correctly mapped. It does not perform any validation on the loaded
    data, relying on the integrity of the database records.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Guild Initialization
    code: 'Guild* guild = new Guild();

      // Assume database connection is established

      int fields[] = {0}; // Placeholder for actual DB fields

      guild->LoadBankTabFromDB(fields);

      // Bank tab data is now loaded into the guild object'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal guild management system and should not
    be called directly by external code. It's typically invoked by the Guild::LoadFromDB
    method during the guild loading process. The method expects that the database
    fields are properly indexed and that the data structure matches the expected schema
    for guild bank tabs.
  warnings: This method modifies internal guild state and should only be called when
    the guild object is in a valid initialization state. Improper use or calling this
    method with incorrect field indices may result in corrupted guild data or undefined
    behavior.
