  class: InterruptCoordinatorFixed
  method: OnEnemyCastComplete
  signature: void InterruptCoordinatorFixed::OnEnemyCastComplete(int casterGuid, uint32
    spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the completion of an enemy spell cast by notifying the interrupt
    coordinator to process potential interruptions.
  description: The OnEnemyCastComplete method is invoked when an enemy creature finishes
    casting a spell. This method serves as a callback within the TrinityCore AI system
    to inform the InterruptCoordinatorFixed class that a spell cast has completed,
    allowing it to determine whether any interrupts or reactions should be triggered
    based on the caster's GUID and the spell ID. It plays a key role in managing combat
    behavior and reaction timing for enemy NPCs during spellcasting sequences. The
    method does not return any value but is essential for maintaining proper AI state
    transitions and interrupt logic within the game engine.
  parameters:
  - name: casterGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the enemy creature that completed
      casting the spell. This value identifies which NPC or unit performed the action.
  - name: spellId
    description: The ID of the spell that was cast and completed by the enemy. Used
      to determine if specific interrupt conditions apply based on spell properties.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI context
    code: "void EnemyAI::OnSpellCastFinished(Unit* caster, uint32 spellId)\n{\n  \
      \  if (caster && caster->IsCreature())\n    {\n        InterruptCoordinatorFixed*\
      \ interruptCoord = sObjectMgr->GetInterruptCoordinator();\n        interruptCoord->OnEnemyCastComplete(caster->GetGUID().GetCounter(),\
      \ spellId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the InterruptCoordinatorFixed instance is properly
    initialized and accessible through the global object manager. It should only be
    called when a valid enemy unit has finished casting a spell, otherwise behavior
    may be undefined.
  warnings: Ensure that both casterGuid and spellId are valid before calling this
    method to avoid potential logic errors or crashes in interrupt handling logic.
