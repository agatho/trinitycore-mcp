  brief: Sends a list of available hotfixes to the connected client.
  description: The SendAvailableHotfixes method is responsible for transmitting a
    list of hotfixes that are available for download to the World of Warcraft client.
    This functionality is part of the game's patching and content update system, allowing
    the client to know which data files need to be updated or downloaded. The method
    typically sends information about hotfix versions, checksums, and file paths that
    the client can use to determine what needs updating. It is usually invoked during
    the initial connection handshake or when the client requests hotfix information.

  notes: This method is typically called during the session establishment phase when
    a player connects to the server. The hotfix data sent may include information
    about database changes, client-side files, or other dynamic content updates that
