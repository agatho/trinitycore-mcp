  class: PerformanceProfile
  method: Compare
  signature: float PerformanceProfile::Compare(const PerformanceProfile & other) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares this performance profile with another and returns a similarity ratio
    as a float value.
  description: The Compare method evaluates the similarity between this PerformanceProfile
    instance and another PerformanceProfile object. It calculates a normalized score
    representing how closely the two profiles match, typically based on internal metrics
    such as processing time, memory usage, or other performance-related attributes.
    This method is useful for profiling systems, identifying performance regressions,
    or comparing different configurations of game systems. The returned value is usually
    between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 indicates identical profiles and 0.0 indicates
    completely dissimilar profiles. The comparison logic may involve statistical analysis
    or direct metric matching depending on the internal implementation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating the similarity ratio of this
    profile to the other. A value of 1.0 means identical, while 0.0 means completely
    different. Values in between indicate partial similarity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Profile Comparison
    code: "PerformanceProfile profileA;\nPerformanceProfile profileB;\nfloat similarity\
      \ = profileA.Compare(profileB);\n// similarity will be a value between 0.0 and\
      \ 1.0\nif (similarity > 0.95f) {\n    // Profiles are very similar\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Regression Detection
    code: "PerformanceProfile baseline;\nPerformanceProfile current;\nfloat score\
      \ = current.Compare(baseline);\nif (score < 0.8f) {\n    // Significant performance\
      \ degradation detected\n    sLog->outString(\"Warning: Performance regression\
      \ detected (score: %f)\", score);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by TrinityCore's profiling and debugging
    tools. The exact comparison algorithm may vary based on the specific attributes
    tracked in each PerformanceProfile instance. For accurate results, both profiles
    should be generated under similar conditions.
  warnings: The interpretation of the returned float value depends on the internal
    implementation details of how performance metrics are weighted and normalized.
    Ensure that both PerformanceProfile objects being compared were generated using
    consistent measurement methods to avoid misleading results.
