  class: BotThreatManager
  method: CalculateAbilityModifier
  signature: float BotThreatManager::CalculateAbilityModifier(Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the threat modifier value based on the bot's ability
    relative to the target unit.
  description: The CalculateAbilityModifier method computes a float value that represents
    how much additional threat a bot's abilities will generate against a specific
    target. This value is used internally by the threat management system to determine
    the effectiveness of various combat actions and abilities in increasing or decreasing
    threat levels. The calculation typically takes into account factors such as the
    bot's current stats, the target's resistance or mitigation, and the type of ability
    being used. This method is part of the BotThreatManager class which handles all
    threat-related calculations for AI-controlled bots in TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated ability modifier. Positive values
    increase threat generation, negative values decrease it, and zero means no change
    to threat levels. The exact range depends on implementation details but typically
    falls within a reasonable combat balance range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in threat calculation
    code: 'float modifier = botThreatManager->CalculateAbilityModifier(targetUnit);

      // Use the modifier to adjust threat generated by an ability

      float baseThreat = 100.0f;

      float modifiedThreat = baseThreat * (1.0f + modifier);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called during ability execution or threat generation
    events within the bot's AI decision-making process. The implementation may vary
    based on the specific bot class and ability type being evaluated.
