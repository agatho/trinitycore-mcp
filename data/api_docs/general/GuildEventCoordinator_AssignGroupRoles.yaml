  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: AssignGroupRoles
  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::AssignGroupRoles(int * group, uint32 eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns group roles to guild members participating in a specific event.
  description: The AssignGroupRoles method is responsible for distributing predefined
    group roles among guild members who are registered for a particular guild event.
    This functionality ensures that players are properly organized into roles such
    as tanks, healers, and damage dealers based on the event's requirements. The method
    takes an array of group member identifiers and assigns them appropriate roles
    according to the guild's event configuration. It is typically invoked during event
    initialization or when members join an ongoing event.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to an integer array containing the identifiers of guild members
      participating in the event. Each element represents a unique player identifier
      within the group.
  - name: eventId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific guild event that roles are being
      assigned to. This determines which role configurations should be applied to
      the group members.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerGroup[] = {1001, 1002, 1003, 1004};

      GuildEventCoordinator eventCoord;

      eventCoord.AssignGroupRoles(playerGroup, 501);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Group
    code: 'std::vector<int> dynamicGroup = {1005, 1006, 1007};

      int* groupPtr = dynamicGroup.data();

      GuildEventCoordinator eventCoord;

      eventCoord.AssignGroupRoles(groupPtr, 502);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group members are already registered for the
    specified event. The actual role assignment logic depends on the guild's event
    configuration settings and may involve checking player class roles or other game-specific
    attributes.
  warnings: Ensure that all players in the group have valid identifiers and are properly
    registered for the event before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior
    or errors during role assignment.
