  class: ProtectionPaladinRefactored
  method: ConsumeHolyPower
  signature: void ProtectionPaladinRefactored::ConsumeHolyPower(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes the specified amount of holy power from the Protection Paladin.
  description: The ConsumeHolyPower method reduces the current holy power resource
    of a Protection Paladin by the specified amount. This method is typically used
    when abilities or talents consume holy power to grant effects or activate mechanics.
    The method ensures that the consumed amount does not exceed the available holy
    power, and will not result in negative holy power values. It is commonly invoked
    during spell casting or ability usage within the Protection Paladin's gameplay
    loop.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of holy power to consume. Must be a non-negative integer
      representing the amount of holy power to reduce from the current resource.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Holy Power Consumption
    code: 'ProtectionPaladinRefactored* paladin = ...;

      paladin->ConsumeHolyPower(3);

      // Consumes 3 holy power from the paladin''s resource.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Holy Power Consumption
    code: "ProtectionPaladinRefactored* paladin = ...;\nif (paladin->GetHolyPower()\
      \ >= 5) {\n    paladin->ConsumeHolyPower(5);\n    // Execute ability that requires\
      \ 5 holy power\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal state variables related to holy power
    and may trigger events or callbacks for UI updates. It is assumed to be thread-safe
    within the context of TrinityCore's single-threaded game loop.
  warnings: Ensure that the amount passed does not exceed available holy power, as
    this could lead to unexpected behavior if not properly validated before calling.
    The method should only be called when the paladin has sufficient holy power to
    avoid unintended consequences.
