documentation:
  brief: Updates the accuracy of loot analysis based on player decisions and actual
    loot outcomes
  description: The UpdateAnalysisAccuracy method is responsible for refining the internal
    loot decision-making models within the LootAnalysis system. It takes a player's
    decision during a loot roll, compares it with the actual outcome, and adjusts
    the system's predictive accuracy for future loot distributions. This method plays
    a crucial role in adaptive loot management systems that learn from player behavior
    to improve fairness and satisfaction. The method operates on the principle of
    reinforcement learning where correct predictions increase confidence while incorrect
    ones decrease it. It requires a valid player object and a complete LootItem structure
    to function properly.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose decision is being analyzed for
      accuracy. Must be a valid, non-null pointer to an active player in the game
      world.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure representing the item being evaluated.
      Contains all relevant information about the loot item including its properties
      and potential values.
  - name: actualDecision
    description: LootRollType enum value representing the actual outcome of the loot
      decision process. Indicates whether the item was awarded to the player, passed,
      or other possible outcomes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void HandleLootDecision(Player* player, LootItem& item, LootRollType decision)\
      \ {\n    LootAnalysis::UpdateAnalysisAccuracy(player, item, decision);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Loot Roll System
    code: "void OnLootRollComplete(Player* player, LootItem& item, LootRollType actualOutcome)\
      \ {\n    // Update analysis after loot roll completion\n    LootAnalysis::UpdateAnalysisAccuracy(player,\
      \ item, actualOutcome);\n    \n    // Log the accuracy improvement for debugging\
      \ purposes\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"loot\", \"Loot analysis accuracy updated for player\
      \ {}\", player->GetName());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after a loot decision has been finalized
    and the actual outcome is known. The internal analysis system maintains statistical
    models that improve over time with repeated calls. Performance impact is minimal
    as it only updates internal counters and does not perform heavy computations.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and the item structure contains
    complete information before calling this method. Passing invalid or null pointers
    may cause undefined behavior. The method assumes that actualDecision accurately
    reflects the outcome of the loot process.
