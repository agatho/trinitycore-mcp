documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of bots that are currently stalled or unresponsive in the
    bot system
  description: The GetStalledBots method retrieves the number of bots within the TrinityCore
    bot system that have been identified as stalled or unresponsive. This typically
    occurs when a bot's behavior or movement has stopped functioning properly, often
    due to pathfinding issues, server lag, or other environmental factors. The method
    is used by the bot management system to monitor and potentially restart or reinitialize
    stalled bots to maintain optimal performance of the automated player units.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total count of bots currently marked as stalled
    or unresponsive in the system. Returns 0 if no bots are stalled, or a positive
    integer indicating the number of affected bots.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Stalled Bots
    code: "BotHealthCheck healthCheck;\nint stalledCount = healthCheck.GetStalledBots();\n\
      if (stalledCount > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Found \" << stalledCount << \"\
      \ stalled bots.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of a periodic health check routine
    for the bot system. The internal tracking of stalled bots may rely on timeout
    mechanisms or specific state checks that monitor bot activity. Performance-wise,
    this method should be lightweight as it only returns a cached count.
