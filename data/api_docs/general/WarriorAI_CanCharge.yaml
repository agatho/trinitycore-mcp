  class: WarriorAI
  method: CanCharge
  signature: bool WarriorAI::CanCharge(::Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the warrior AI can initiate a charge ability against a
    target unit.
  description: The CanCharge method evaluates if the WarriorAI instance is capable
    of performing a charge attack against a specified target. This includes checking
    various conditions such as the target's distance, line of sight, and the warrior's
    current state or resource availability. The method typically returns true when
    all prerequisites for a charge are met, allowing the AI to proceed with the charge
    action. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, this is used to control
    combat behavior for warrior NPCs, ensuring that charges are only attempted when
    mechanically valid.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the warrior AI can perform a charge against the target;
    otherwise returns false. This indicates whether all necessary conditions (such
    as proximity and line of sight) are satisfied for initiating the charge ability.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (ai->CanCharge(target)) {\n    ai->DoAction(WARAI_ACTION_CHARGE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom warrior behavior
    code: "void CustomWarriorAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff) {\n    if (CanCharge(me->GetVictim()))\
      \ {\n        DoCast(me, SPELL_CHARGE);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely performs distance checks and line-of-sight validation internally.
    It may also consider the warrior's current mana or rage levels if charge requires
    resources. This method is typically called before attempting to execute a charge
    spell or ability in the AI logic.
  warnings: Ensure that target unit is valid before calling this method, as passing
    a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. The method does not validate
    whether the actual spell or ability can be cast; it only checks if the conditions
    for initiating a charge are met.
