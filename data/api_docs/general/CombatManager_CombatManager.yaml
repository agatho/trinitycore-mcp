  brief: Copies an existing combat manager instance to create a new one
  description: The CombatManager copy constructor creates a new CombatManager object
    by copying all properties and state from an existing CombatManager instance. This
    method is essential for creating duplicate combat managers during gameplay, particularly
    when handling combat-related events or managing multiple combatant states simultaneously.
    The copied instance maintains all original data integrity while allowing independent
    manipulation of the new instance without affecting the source. This behavior is
    crucial for maintaining game mechanics consistency and preventing cross-contamination
    between different combat scenarios.

  examples:
  - title: Basic CombatManager Copy
    code: 'CombatManager cm1;

      CombatManager cm2(cm1);

      // cm2 now contains all data from cm1'
    language: cpp
  notes: The copy constructor ensures that all combat manager properties are properly
    duplicated, including any internal state variables and combat-related data structures.
    This implementation is thread-safe when used correctly in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Improper use of this constructor can lead to memory corruption if the
    source object is destroyed before the copy is completed. Always ensure proper
    synchronization between source and destination objects during copying operations.
