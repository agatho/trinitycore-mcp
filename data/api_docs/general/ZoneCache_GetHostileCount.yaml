  signature: uint32 ZoneCache::GetHostileCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of hostile units within the zone cache.
  description: The GetHostileCount method retrieves the total number of hostile units
    currently present in the zone cache. This method is typically used by AI systems
    or game mechanics that need to evaluate the threat level or engagement status
    of players within a specific zone. The returned count includes all hostile creatures,
    NPCs, and players that are considered hostile to the player's faction or group.
    The method performs no side effects and is read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of hostile units found within
    the zone cache. Returns zero if no hostile units are present or if the cache is
    empty.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Hostile Presence
    code: "uint32 hostileCount = player->GetZoneCache()->GetHostileCount();\nif (hostileCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Player is in combat or near enemies\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Hostile units detected: %u\", hostileCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely optimized for frequent calls and may utilize cached
    data structures to avoid expensive recalculations. It's important to note that
    the count returned reflects only those hostile entities currently within the zone
    cache boundaries, not globally across the entire map.
