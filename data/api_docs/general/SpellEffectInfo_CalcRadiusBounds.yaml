  class: SpellEffectInfo
  method: CalcRadiusBounds
  signature: int SpellEffectInfo::CalcRadiusBounds(WorldObject * caster, int targetIndex,
    Spell * spell) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the radius bounds of a spell effect based on caster,
    target index, and spell information.
  description: The CalcRadiusBounds method determines the effective radius of a spell
    effect for a given caster, target index, and spell instance. This calculation
    is crucial for determining the area of effect for spells that impact multiple
    targets within a defined radius. The method takes into account various factors
    such as spell modifiers, caster attributes, and target positioning to compute
    an accurate radius value. It's typically used during spell execution to define
    the spatial parameters of effects like AoE (Area of Effect) spells. The returned
    value represents the calculated radius in game units, which can be used for collision
    detection, targeting logic, or visual effect placement.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that is casting the spell. This object
      determines the caster's position and attributes that may affect the spell radius
      calculation.
  - name: targetIndex
    description: The index of the target within the spell's target list. Used to determine
      which specific target's positioning or properties influence the radius bounds
      calculation.
  - name: spell
    description: Pointer to the Spell object that contains the spell data and configuration
      affecting how the radius is calculated.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the calculated radius bounds of the spell
    effect in game units. A value of 0 typically indicates no valid radius was computed,
    while positive values represent the effective radius for area effects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine spell radius
    code: "SpellEffectInfo effect;\nWorldObject* caster = player;\nint targetIndex\
      \ = 0;\nSpell* spell = player->GetCurrentSpell(CURRENT_GENERIC_SPELL);\nint\
      \ radius = effect.CalcRadiusBounds(caster, targetIndex, spell);\nif (radius\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Use the calculated radius for area effect processing\n   \
      \ LOG_DEBUG(\"spell\", \"Spell effect radius: {}\", radius);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in spell processing routines where area effects
    need precise radius calculations. The implementation likely involves checking
    spell effect properties, caster state, and target conditions to determine the
    final radius value. Performance-wise, this calculation should be lightweight as
    it's typically called during spell execution phases.
  warnings: Ensure that the caster and spell parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method, as null pointer dereferences can cause crashes. The targetIndex
    should be within the bounds of the spell's target list to avoid undefined behavior.
