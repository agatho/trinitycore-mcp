  brief: Deletes a pet from the database using its unique identifier.
  description: The DeletePetFromDB method removes a player's pet from the database
    by specifying the pet number, which corresponds to the pet's unique identifier.
    This function is typically used when a player wishes to remove their pet from
    the game world permanently, such as during pet deletion or when switching between
    different pet states. The method ensures that the pet's data is removed from the
    database and updates the player's pet information accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: petNumber
    description: The unique identifier of the pet to be deleted, which corresponds
      to the pet's GUID in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->DeletePetFromDB(1);

      // Deletes the pet with number 1 from the database'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when a pet
    needs to be removed from the database. It may involve updating related tables
    in the database such as the character_pet table, and should not be used directly
    unless necessary.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to inconsistencies in the player's
    pet data, potentially causing issues with pet behavior or database corruption
    if not handled correctly.
