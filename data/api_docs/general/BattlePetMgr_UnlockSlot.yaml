documentation:
  brief: Unlocks a specified battle pet slot for the player.
  description: The UnlockSlot method enables a specific battle pet slot in the player's
    battle pet collection. This action typically occurs when the player acquires the
    ability to use additional pet slots, either through leveling up, purchasing from
    vendors, or completing achievements. The method takes a BattlePetSlot parameter
    that identifies which slot to unlock within the player's battle pet manager. It
    modifies the internal state of the BattlePetMgr to reflect the unlocked status
    of the specified slot. This operation is generally part of the broader battle
    pet management system and may trigger UI updates or event notifications to reflect
    the change in available slots.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The BattlePetSlot enum value identifying which specific battle pet
      slot to unlock. Valid values correspond to the player's battle pet slot indices,
      typically ranging from 0 to N where N represents the maximum number of unlocked
      slots.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Unlock the first battle pet slot
    code: 'BattlePetSlot firstSlot = BattlePetSlot(0);

      battlePetMgr->UnlockSlot(firstSlot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Unlock a specific battle pet slot based on player progress
    code: "uint8 playerLevel = player->GetLevel();\nBattlePetSlot slotToUnlock = BattlePetSlot(playerLevel\
      \ - 10);\nif (slotToUnlock >= 0 && slotToUnlock < MAX_BATTLE_PET_SLOTS)\n{\n\
      \    battlePetMgr->UnlockSlot(slotToUnlock);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during player progression events such as
    level-ups or achievement unlocks. It's important to ensure that the slot index
    passed is within valid bounds to prevent undefined behavior. The method does not
    directly interact with the database but modifies in-memory state which may be
    persisted later.
  warnings: Passing an invalid BattlePetSlot value can lead to unexpected behavior
    or crashes. Always validate the slot parameter before calling this method. This
    function should only be called on the main thread to avoid race conditions in
    multi-threaded environments.
