documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total count of all relatives (invited players) associated with
    a specified calendar event.
  description: The GetAllEventRelatives method calculates and returns the number of
    individuals who have been invited or are related to a given calendar event. This
    includes players who have accepted, declined, or are pending invitations for the
    event. The method is typically used by the game's calendar system to determine
    how many participants are associated with an event, which can be useful for displaying
    event details, managing event capacity, or handling event-related notifications.
    It operates on a provided CalendarEvent object and does not modify its state.
    This function is part of the core calendar management functionality in TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of relatives (invited players)
    associated with the specified calendar event. A return value of zero indicates
    that no players have been invited to the event, or the event has no related participants.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Event Relative Count
    code: "CalendarEvent event;\n// Assume event is initialized with valid data\n\
      int relativeCount = sCalendarMgr->GetAllEventRelatives(event);\nif (relativeCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Event has \" << relativeCount << \" invited participants.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n    std::cout << \"No participants invited to the\
      \ event.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any database operations directly; it relies
    on internal data structures maintained by the CalendarMgr. The returned count
    includes all invitation statuses (accepted, declined, pending). Ensure that the
    CalendarEvent object passed to this method is valid and initialized before calling
    to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an uninitialized or invalid CalendarEvent object
    may result in incorrect counts or runtime errors. Always validate the input event
    object before invoking this function.
