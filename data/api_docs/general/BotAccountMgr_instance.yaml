documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotAccountMgr class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the BotAccountMgr
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the manager exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is commonly used to access global bot account management
    functionality within the TrinityCore framework. The returned pointer provides
    access to all bot account-related operations such as creating, managing, and retrieving
    bot accounts. The method is thread-safe and should be called whenever bot account
    management services are required.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single BotAccountMgr instance. The method never returns
    NULL as it's implemented as a singleton with proper initialization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotAccountMgr* botMgr = BotAccountMgr::instance();

      // Use botMgr to access bot account management functions'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Bot Account Functions
    code: "BotAccountMgr* mgr = BotAccountMgr::instance();\nPlayer* botPlayer = mgr->GetBotAccount(12345);\n\
      if (botPlayer)\n{\n    // Perform operations on the bot player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the standard singleton pattern implementation. The BotAccountMgr
    instance is typically initialized during server startup and remains valid for
    the entire application lifetime. Since it's a singleton, multiple calls to this
    method will always return the same pointer address.
