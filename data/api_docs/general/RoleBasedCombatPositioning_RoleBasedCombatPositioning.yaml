  brief: Initializes the role-based combat positioning system for handling player
    positioning during combat encounters.
  description: The RoleBasedCombatPositioning constructor initializes the internal
    state and data structures required for managing how players are positioned relative
    to each other during combat encounters. This system is designed to optimize combat
    dynamics by ensuring that players are placed in appropriate positions based on
    their roles (tank, healer, damage dealer) within a group or raid environment.
    The initialization process sets up necessary tracking mechanisms and configuration
    parameters that govern positioning behavior during combat scenarios.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'RoleBasedCombatPositioning positioningSystem;

      // Constructor automatically initializes the system for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should typically be called during object instantiation and
    does not require explicit invocation in most cases. The system relies on internal
    configuration files and group management to determine appropriate positioning
    strategies.
