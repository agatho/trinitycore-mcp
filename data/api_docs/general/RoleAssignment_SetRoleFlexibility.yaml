  class: RoleAssignment
  method: SetRoleFlexibility
  signature: void RoleAssignment::SetRoleFlexibility(uint32 playerGuid, bool isFlexible)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the role flexibility flag for a player in the role assignment system.
  description: The SetRoleFlexibility method updates whether a specific player is
    allowed to flexibly take on different roles within a group or raid instance. This
    functionality is typically used in dynamic role assignment systems where players
    can be reassigned roles based on need, class availability, or other game mechanics.
    The method modifies internal state tracking for the given player GUID and affects
    how the system handles role distribution during group creation or reorganization.
    It's commonly used in conjunction with other role management APIs to maintain
    consistent group composition and performance optimization.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose role flexibility
      setting is being modified. Must be a valid player GUID within the TrinityCore
      database.
  - name: isFlexible
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the player should be considered flexible
      for role assignment. True enables flexibility, false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Role Flexibility for a Player
    code: RoleAssignment::SetRoleFlexibility(123456, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Role Flexibility for a Player
    code: RoleAssignment::SetRoleFlexibility(789012, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal player role assignment data structures
    and may trigger cascading updates in group management systems. It's recommended
    to call this method before or during group initialization to ensure proper role
    distribution logic functions correctly.
