documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Holy Paladin AI bot with the specified player character.
  description: The HolyPaladinRefactored constructor initializes a Holy Paladin AI
    bot by setting up its internal state and configuration based on the provided Player
    object. This method configures the bot's behavior, abilities, and decision-making
    logic according to the Holy Paladin class specialization. It establishes the foundation
    for the AI to perform actions such as healing, damage mitigation, and spell casting
    within the TrinityCore framework. The initialization process ensures that all
    necessary data structures are properly allocated and configured before the bot
    becomes active in the game world.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Player* botPlayer = ...; // Obtain player reference

      HolyPaladinRefactored holyPaladin(botPlayer);

      // Bot is now initialized and ready for AI processing'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor assumes that the Player object passed in is valid and represents
    a Holy Paladin character. The method performs no validation on the input parameter,
    so it's expected that callers ensure proper initialization of the Player object
    before passing it to this constructor.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer or a Player object that does not represent a Holy
    Paladin class will result in undefined behavior. Ensure the Player object is properly
    initialized and represents a valid Holy Paladin character before calling this
    constructor.
