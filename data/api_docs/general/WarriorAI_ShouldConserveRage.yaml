  class: WarriorAI
  method: ShouldConserveRage
  signature: bool WarriorAI::ShouldConserveRage()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the warrior should conserve rage during combat.
  description: The ShouldConserveRage method evaluates the current combat state and
    warrior's resource management needs to decide if rage conservation is advisable.
    This decision is based on factors such as available rage, incoming threat levels,
    and the effectiveness of rage-generating abilities. When true is returned, the
    AI will prioritize abilities that consume less rage or avoid unnecessary rage
    generation to maintain optimal resource usage for high-damage abilities. The method
    typically influences the warrior's tactical behavior in situations where rage
    management is critical for maintaining damage output.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the warrior should conserve rage (i.e., avoid generating
    excessive rage or use low-rage abilities), false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (warriorAI->ShouldConserveRage()) {\n    // Use low-rage abilities like\
      \ Slam or Heroic Strike\n    // Avoid high-rage abilities like Bloodthirst or\
      \ Whirlwind\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Decision Making
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff) {\n    if (ShouldConserveRage())\
      \ {\n        // Prioritize rage-efficient abilities\n        if (me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\n\
      \            return;\n        \n        if (me->GetPower(POWER_RAGE) < 50)\n\
      \            DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n        else\n            DoSpellAttackIfReady();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles to make tactical
    decisions about ability usage. The implementation likely considers the warrior's
    current rage level, target threat, and available abilities that consume different
    amounts of rage. It may also factor in the time until next rage-generating ability
    becomes available.
  warnings: The return value directly affects combat behavior, so incorrect logic
    could lead to inefficient resource usage or suboptimal damage output. Ensure this
    method is only called when the warrior is in a valid combat state to avoid erroneous
    decisions.
