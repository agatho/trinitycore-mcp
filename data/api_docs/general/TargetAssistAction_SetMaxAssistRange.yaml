  class: TargetAssistAction
  method: SetMaxAssistRange
  signature: void TargetAssistAction::SetMaxAssistRange(float range)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum assist range for the target assist action.
  description: The SetMaxAssistRange method configures the maximum distance within
    which the AI will consider assisting a target. This parameter defines how far
    away from the current target an assistant can be and still be considered for assistance.
    The value is typically measured in yards or game units, and affects the behavior
    of NPC AI when determining which targets to assist with combat or other actions.
    This method is commonly used in custom AI scripts or modifications to adjust default
    assist behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: range
    description: The maximum assist range value in game units (typically yards). Valid
      values are positive floating-point numbers representing distance. A value of
      0 or negative may disable the assist functionality or cause undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Assist Range to 30 Yards
    code: 'TargetAssistAction action;

      action.SetMaxAssistRange(30.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disabling Assist Range with Zero Value
    code: 'TargetAssistAction action;

      action.SetMaxAssistRange(0.0f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal AI behavior parameters and should be called
    before the AI is initialized or during runtime when AI state transitions occur.
    The range value may be clamped or adjusted by the core engine based on game balance
    settings.
  warnings: Setting an extremely large assist range may cause performance issues due
    to excessive target scanning. Setting a negative value may result in undefined
    behavior or crash the AI system.
