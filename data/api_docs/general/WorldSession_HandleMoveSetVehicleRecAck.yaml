    & setVehicleRecIdAck)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a vehicle seat ID acknowledgment packet from the client.
  description: The HandleMoveSetVehicleRecAck method handles the client's response
    to a vehicle seat ID assignment. This method is invoked when the server sends
    a MoveSetVehicleRecIdAck packet to the client, and the client acknowledges receipt
    of the assigned vehicle seat ID. It typically updates internal state related to
    the player's current vehicle and seat position, ensuring synchronization between
    client and server. The method plays a crucial role in maintaining accurate vehicle
    occupancy tracking and seat assignment within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: setVehicleRecIdAck
    description: The MoveSetVehicleRecIdAck packet containing the acknowledged vehicle
      seat ID information from the client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in session handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleMoveSetVehicleRecAck(WorldPackets::Vehicle::MoveSetVehicleRecIdAck\
      \ & setVehicleRecIdAck)\n{\n    // Process the acknowledged vehicle seat ID\n\
      \    Player* player = GetPlayer();\n    if (player && player->IsInVehicle())\n\
      \    {\n        Vehicle* vehicle = player->GetVehicle();\n        // Update\
      \ vehicle seat information\n        vehicle->SetSeatId(setVehicleRecIdAck.RecID);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the vehicle movement synchronization system in TrinityCore.
    It should only be called when a valid vehicle assignment has been made to the
    player, and the client has acknowledged the seat ID. The method does not directly
    send packets but processes incoming acknowledgment data from the client.
  warnings: Improper handling of this packet can lead to incorrect vehicle seat assignments,
    potentially causing players to be placed in wrong seats or experience desynchronization
    issues with vehicle movement. Ensure proper validation of the RecID before processing.
