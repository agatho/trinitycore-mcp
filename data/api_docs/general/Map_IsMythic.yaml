documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current map is a mythic raid instance.
  description: This method checks if the current map represents a mythic difficulty
    raid instance, which is a special type of dungeon or raid that offers enhanced
    challenges and rewards compared to normal difficulty. In World of Warcraft, mythic
    dungeons are designed to provide more intense gameplay experiences with higher
    item levels and increased difficulty. The method returns true when the map is
    specifically configured as a mythic instance, allowing developers to distinguish
    between different difficulty levels in their code.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map is a mythic instance, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the current map has been configured for mythic difficulty gameplay.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a map is mythic
    code: "if (map->IsMythic()) {\n    // Handle mythic-specific logic\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other map-related methods
    to determine the difficulty level of a map. It's important to note that this method
    may return false for maps that are not explicitly configured as mythic but might
    be part of a larger raid instance.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with other difficulty-checking methods
    like IsHeroic or IsNormal, as it specifically checks for mythic instances. Using
    incorrect difficulty checks could lead to wrong gameplay mechanics being applied.
