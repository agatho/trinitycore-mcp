  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: UpdateMarketData
  signature: void MarketAnalysis::UpdateMarketData(uint32 itemId, uint32 price, uint32
    quantity, uint32 timestamp)
documentation:
  brief: Updates market data for a specific item with provided price, quantity, and
    timestamp values.
  description: The UpdateMarketData method is responsible for updating the market
    information associated with a specific item in the game's economy system. It accepts
    an item identifier, its current price, available quantity, and a timestamp to
    record when the data was updated. This method likely integrates with TrinityCore's
    auction house or market analysis subsystems to maintain real-time pricing and
    availability of items within the game world. The method does not return any value,
    indicating it performs a direct update operation on internal market data structures.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: Unique identifier for the item in the game database. Must correspond
      to a valid item entry in the item_template table.
  - name: price
    description: Current market price of the item, typically represented in copper
      coins (100 copper = 1 silver, 100 silver = 1 gold).
  - name: quantity
    description: Number of items currently available for purchase or sale in the market.
  - name: timestamp
    description: Unix timestamp indicating when the market data was last updated.
      Should be a valid time value representing seconds since epoch.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Market Data Update
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analysis;

      uint32 itemId = 12345;

      uint32 price = 50000; // 5 gold

      uint32 quantity = 10;

      uint32 timestamp = time(nullptr);


      analysis.UpdateMarketData(itemId, price, quantity, timestamp);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Market Data with Current Time
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analysis;

      uint32 itemId = 98765;

      uint32 price = 12500; // 1 silver 25 copper

      uint32 quantity = 1;

      uint32 timestamp = time(nullptr);


      analysis.UpdateMarketData(itemId, price, quantity, timestamp);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal caches or database records used by the
    auction house system. It may trigger additional processing such as notifying other
    subsystems about price changes or updating market statistics. The implementation
    should be thread-safe if called from multiple threads, though no explicit synchronization
    is implied in the signature.
  warnings: Ensure that itemId corresponds to an actual item in the database; invalid
    IDs could cause undefined behavior or database errors. Timestamp values must be
    valid Unix timestamps to prevent incorrect data interpretation. This method does
    not validate input parameters beyond basic type checking.
