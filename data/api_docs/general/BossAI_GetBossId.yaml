documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier of the boss associated with this AI instance.
  description: The GetBossId method returns an integer identifier that uniquely represents
    the boss entity managed by this BossAI instance. This identifier is typically
    used internally by the TrinityCore framework to track and manage boss-specific
    behaviors, events, and data. The returned value corresponds to the boss's entry
    ID or database identifier within the game world. This method is commonly called
    during boss encounter logic, event handling, or when checking the identity of
    a boss during combat phases.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique identifier (ID) of the boss associated
    with this AI instance. This ID typically matches the creature entry ID defined
    in the database for the specific boss entity.
  examples:

      \ override\n    {\n        int bossId = GetBossId();\n        if (bossId ==\
      \ 12345)\n        {\n            // Handle specific boss death logic\n     \
      \       DoCast(SPELL_VICTORY_EFFECT);\n        }\n    }\n};"

    to retrieve boss-specific data from the game's database or internal lookup tables.
