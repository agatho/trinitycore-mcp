documentation:
  brief: Loads all SmartAI scripts from the database into memory for use by creatures
    and game objects.
  description: The LoadSmartAIFromDB method initializes and populates the SmartAI
    system by retrieving all defined AI scripts from the database tables. It processes
    entries for creatures, game objects, and other entities that utilize the SmartAI
    framework. This method is typically invoked during server startup or when reloading
    AI scripts dynamically. The loaded scripts are stored internally within the SmartAIMgr
    singleton instance and become available for execution when the corresponding AI
    events occur in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: SmartAIMgr::instance()->LoadSmartAIFromDB();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or after
    a database reload. Repeated calls may result in duplicate script entries or memory
    leaks. The method assumes that the database connection is already established
    and valid.
  warnings: Calling this method while AI scripts are actively running can lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. Always ensure that no active AI processes are running
    before invoking this method.
