  class: Quest
  method: GetRequiredMinRepFaction
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetRequiredMinRepFaction() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the minimum reputation faction required to complete the quest.
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier of the faction that must
    be reached to meet the minimum reputation requirements for completing a specific
    quest. The returned value represents the faction ID from the game's faction database,
    which determines the minimum standing level needed to turn in the quest. This
    is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods to validate
    player progression and ensure proper quest completion conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the faction ID that represents the minimum reputation required
    to complete the quest. This value corresponds to a specific faction in the game's
    database, where 0 indicates no faction requirement, and higher values represent
    the required faction ID for the quest's reputation requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 factionId = quest->GetRequiredMinRepFaction();\nif (factionId >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // The quest requires a minimum reputation with a specific faction\n\
      \    // Process accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in quest completion validation logic and should
    be called after checking if the player has sufficient reputation. It may return
    0 if no faction requirement exists for the quest, which can occur with certain
    quests that do not require reputation to complete.
  warnings: Be aware that this method does not validate whether the player actually
    has sufficient reputation; it only returns the required faction ID. The actual
    reputation check should be performed separately using appropriate methods like
    GetReputationLevel or similar.
