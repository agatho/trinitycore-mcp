  signature: int GossipHandler::GetCachedPath(uint32 creatureEntry, InteractionType
    type) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the cached gossip path index for a specified creature entry and
    interaction type.
  description: The GetCachedPath method retrieves a cached path identifier associated
    with a specific creature entry and interaction type. This method is typically
    used within the World of Warcraft TrinityCore framework to manage and retrieve
    precomputed gossip interaction paths for NPCs. The cached path allows for efficient
    navigation through dialogue options without recalculating the interaction flow
    each time. The method operates on internal caches maintained by the GossipHandler
    class, which stores previously computed paths for performance optimization. It
    is commonly invoked when a player interacts with an NPC to determine the appropriate
    gossip menu or quest flow based on their current state and the creature's configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: creatureEntry
    description: The unique identifier (entry ID) of the creature (NPC) for which
      the cached path is being retrieved. This corresponds to the creature_template.entry
      field in the database.
  - name: type
    description: The interaction type that defines the context of the gossip interaction.
      This typically represents different states or categories of interactions such
      as normal gossip, quest gossip, or vendor interactions.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the cached path index for the specified
    creature entry and interaction type. A return value of -1 indicates that no cached
    path was found for the given parameters, while a non-negative value represents
    a valid cached path identifier.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int pathIndex = gossipHandler->GetCachedPath(12345, InteractionType::GOSSIP_TYPE_QUEST);
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Valid Cached Path
    code: "int pathIndex = gossipHandler->GetCachedPath(12345, InteractionType::GOSSIP_TYPE_NORMAL);\n\
      if (pathIndex >= 0)\n{\n    // Use the cached path\n    printf(\"Using cached\
      \ path: %d\\n\", pathIndex);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No cached path available, compute\
      \ new one\n    printf(\"No cached path found\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal caching mechanisms and assumes that the cache
    has been properly populated with relevant gossip data. The method is thread-safe
    as long as the underlying cache implementation supports concurrent access. Performance
    is optimized for repeated lookups, making it suitable for frequent NPC interaction
    checks.
  warnings: The method may return -1 if no cached path exists for the specified parameters.
    Developers should always check the return value before using the result to avoid
    undefined behavior. Additionally, caching behavior might vary depending on server
    configuration and whether gossip data has been pre-loaded into memory.
