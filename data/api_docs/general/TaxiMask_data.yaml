  method: data
  signature: const value_type * TaxiMask::data() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the internal data buffer of the TaxiMask object.
  description: The data() method provides direct access to the underlying memory buffer
    that stores the taxi path mask data. This is typically used to serialize or deserialize
    the taxi mask information, or to perform low-level operations on the mask data.
    The returned pointer points to the first element of the internal array and can
    be used with standard C-style array operations. The TaxiMask class likely represents
    a bitmask indicating which taxi paths are available to a player, and this method
    allows access to that raw bit representation for efficient processing or storage.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to the first element of the internal data buffer. The
    returned pointer remains valid as long as the TaxiMask object exists and is not
    modified. It points to an array of value_type elements that represent the bitmask
    data.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing TaxiMask data for serialization
    code: 'TaxiMask mask;

      // ... populate mask with taxi path data ...

      const uint8* rawData = mask.data();

      size_t dataSize = sizeof(mask);

      // Serialize rawData to database or network stream

      std::vector<uint8> serializedData(rawData, rawData + dataSize);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterating through TaxiMask bits
    code: "TaxiMask mask;\nconst uint8* dataPtr = mask.data();\nfor (size_t i = 0;\
      \ i < sizeof(TaxiMask); ++i)\n{\n    for (int bit = 0; bit < 8; ++bit)\n   \
      \ {\n        if (dataPtr[i] & (1 << bit))\n        {\n            // Taxi path\
      \ at position (i * 8 + bit) is available\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned pointer points to internal memory managed by the TaxiMask object.
    Modifying the data through this pointer directly affects the object's state. The
    size of the data buffer depends on the implementation of TaxiMask, which is likely
    a fixed-size structure based on the number of taxi paths in the game. This method
    provides direct memory access, so it should be used carefully to avoid buffer
    overruns or undefined behavior.
  warnings: Direct manipulation of the returned pointer's contents can corrupt the
    TaxiMask object. The data pointer should not be freed or reallocated by the caller.
    Ensure that any operations on the returned data do not exceed the bounds of the
    internal buffer, as this could lead to memory corruption or crashes.
