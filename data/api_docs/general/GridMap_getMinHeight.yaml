  class: GridMap
  method: getMinHeight
  signature: float GridMap::getMinHeight(float x, float y) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the minimum height value at the specified coordinates within the
    grid map.
  description: The getMinHeight method calculates and returns the lowest elevation
    point at the given x and y coordinates on the grid map. This function is essential
    for determining terrain features such as ground level, obstacles, or navigational
    boundaries. It typically uses spatial interpolation or direct lookup depending
    on the internal representation of the grid map data structure. The method assumes
    valid coordinate inputs within the defined map boundaries and may return unexpected
    results if called with out-of-bounds coordinates.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the minimum height at the specified coordinates.
    This value corresponds to the elevation level (in game units) of the terrain at
    that location, which can be used for collision detection, pathfinding, or positioning
    calculations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float minHeight = gridMap->getMinHeight(100.5f, 200.3f);

      // Returns the minimum height at coordinates (100.5, 200.3)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in pathfinding algorithms and collision detection
    systems within TrinityCore's AI and movement systems. It may involve interpolation
    between grid points for more accurate height values depending on the map implementation.
