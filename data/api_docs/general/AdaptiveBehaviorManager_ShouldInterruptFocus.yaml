  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: ShouldInterruptFocus
  signature: bool AdaptiveBehaviorManager::ShouldInterruptFocus() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current focus should be interrupted based on adaptive
    behavior rules.
  description: The ShouldInterruptFocus method evaluates the current state of an AI-controlled
    unit to determine if it should interrupt its current focus target. This decision
    is typically made in response to dynamic changes in the environment, such as new
    threats or priority targets becoming available. The method considers factors like
    threat levels, target validity, and behavior configuration settings to make this
    determination. It is commonly used within the TrinityCore AI system to ensure
    that units respond appropriately to changing battlefield conditions without unnecessary
    delays or inconsistent behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current focus should be interrupted according to adaptive
    behavior logic; otherwise returns false if the focus should be maintained.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "if (ai->GetAdaptiveBehaviorManager()->ShouldInterruptFocus()) {\n    ai->SetCurrentTarget(nullptr);\n\
      \    ai->SetNextTarget();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles and should be used
    in conjunction with other adaptive behavior checks for comprehensive decision
    making. The implementation may vary depending on the specific AI type and configuration.
