  class: ObstacleUtils
  method: CalculateAvoidanceRadius
  signature: float ObstacleUtils::CalculateAvoidanceRadius(float obstacleRadius, float
    botRadius, float safetyMargin)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the avoidance radius needed for a bot to safely navigate around
    an obstacle based on obstacle size, bot size, and safety margin.
  description: The CalculateAvoidanceRadius method computes the required radial distance
    a bot must maintain from an obstacle to avoid collision. This calculation considers
    the physical dimensions of both the obstacle and the bot, along with an additional
    safety margin to account for movement precision and reaction time. The result
    represents the minimum safe distance that should be maintained during pathfinding
    or movement decisions in the game environment.
  parameters:
  - name: obstacleRadius
    description: The radius of the obstacle that the bot needs to avoid. Must be a
      positive value representing the physical size of the obstacle in game units.
  - name: botRadius
    description: The radius of the bot character that is navigating around the obstacle.
      Must be a positive value representing the bot's physical size in game units.
  - name: safetyMargin
    description: Additional buffer distance added to the avoidance calculation for
      safety. Should be a non-negative value to ensure extra clearance from obstacles.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the calculated avoidance radius. This
    is the total distance (in game units) that the bot should keep from the obstacle
    to prevent collision, including all specified margins and sizes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: float avoidanceRadius = ObstacleUtils::CalculateAvoidanceRadius(2.0f, 1.0f,
      0.5f); // Avoids a 2-unit radius obstacle with a 1-unit bot and 0.5 unit safety
      margin
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Values
    code: 'float obstacleSize = GetObstacleRadius();

      float botSize = GetBotRadius();

      float safety = 0.3f;

      float safeDistance = ObstacleUtils::CalculateAvoidanceRadius(obstacleSize, botSize,
      safety);

      // Use safeDistance for pathfinding decisions'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI pathfinding systems to determine safe
    distances when navigating around static or dynamic obstacles. The calculation
    assumes circular collision shapes for both the obstacle and bot. Performance-wise,
    this is a lightweight mathematical operation that should not cause noticeable
    overhead during runtime.
  warnings: Ensure all input parameters are positive values; negative inputs may lead
    to incorrect calculations or unexpected behavior. The safety margin should be
    carefully tuned based on bot movement speed and reaction time to balance between
    safety and efficiency.
