  class: VendorItemData
  method: RemoveItem
  signature: bool VendorItemData::RemoveItem(uint32 item_id, uint8 type)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specific item from the vendor's item list based on item ID and
    type.
  description: The RemoveItem method removes an item with the specified item_id and
    type from the vendor's inventory. This function is typically used in the context
    of managing vendor items within the TrinityCore framework, allowing for dynamic
    modification of what items a vendor offers. The method returns true if the item
    was successfully removed, or false if the item was not found in the vendor's list.
    It is commonly used when vendors need to be updated during game events, quest
    completions, or other dynamic changes.
  parameters:
  - name: item_id
    description: The unique identifier of the item to be removed from the vendor's
      inventory. This corresponds to the entry ID in the item_template table.
  - name: type
    description: The type of item to remove, typically indicating whether it is a
      normal item (0) or a currency item (1). This helps distinguish between different
      categories of items within the vendor's inventory.
  returns: Returns true if the item was successfully removed from the vendor's item
    list. Returns false if the specified item_id and type combination does not exist
    in the vendor's inventory.
  examples:
  - title: Remove a regular item from vendor
    code: "VendorItemData* vendorData = ...;\nbool success = vendorData->RemoveItem(12345,\
      \ 0);\nif (success) {\n    // Item successfully removed\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove a currency item from vendor
    code: "VendorItemData* vendorData = ...;\nbool success = vendorData->RemoveItem(56789,\
      \ 1);\nif (success) {\n    // Currency item successfully removed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the internal data structure of the VendorItemData
    class and modifies the vendor's inventory list directly. It is important to ensure
    that the item_id and type parameters correctly match an existing entry in the
    vendor's inventory to avoid false returns. The method does not perform any database
    operations; it only affects the in-memory representation.
  warnings: Be cautious when removing items from a vendor during active gameplay,
    as this may cause inconsistencies if players are currently interacting with the
    vendor. Also, ensure that item_id and type values are valid before calling this
    function to prevent unexpected behavior.
