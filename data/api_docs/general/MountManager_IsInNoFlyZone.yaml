  signature: bool MountManager::IsInNoFlyZone(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player is currently within a no-fly zone where mount flight
    is not permitted.
  description: The IsInNoFlyZone method determines whether the player character is
    located in a geographic area where flying mounts are prohibited. This check is
    typically performed during mount activation or movement to prevent players from
    flying in restricted zones such as cities, battlegrounds, or specific quest areas.
    The method evaluates the current player's position against internal zone data
    and returns true if flying is not allowed at that location. It does not take any
    parameters and relies on the internal state of the MountManager instance to determine
    the player's context.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently in a no-fly zone where mount flight
    is prohibited, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (mountManager.IsInNoFlyZone()) {\n    // Player cannot fly in current\
      \ location\n    SendSystemMessage(\"You cannot fly here.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Mount Activation
    code: "void Player::OnMountActivate() {\n    if (mountManager.IsInNoFlyZone())\
      \ {\n        // Prevent mount activation\n        SendSystemMessage(\"You cannot\
      \ fly in this area.\");\n        return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with normal\
      \ mount behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a zone-based lookup which may involve checking player
    coordinates against predefined no-fly zone boundaries. The implementation likely
    caches zone information for performance reasons to avoid repeated expensive calculations
    during movement updates.
  warnings: The method assumes the MountManager instance has valid access to player
    state and zone data. Using this method outside of proper game context or with
    invalid player references may lead to undefined behavior.
