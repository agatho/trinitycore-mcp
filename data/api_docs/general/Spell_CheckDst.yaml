  brief: Checks the destination of the spell for valid target positions and updates
    the spell's target information
  description: The Spell::CheckDst method validates the destination coordinates of
    a spell to ensure they are within acceptable range and valid for targeting. This
    method is crucial for maintaining proper spell mechanics in World of Warcraft,
    particularly when dealing with spells that require specific target positions or
    areas. It verifies that the spell's target location meets game requirements such
    as line-of-sight, distance constraints, and valid target types. The method typically
    executes during spell cast initialization and updates the spell's target information
    accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic spell destination check
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->CheckDst();

      // This method is called during spell initialization'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be called multiple times during a spell's lifecycle, particularly
    when dealing with spells that have multiple targets or require destination validation.
    The method performs checks on the target position and updates the spell's target
    information accordingly.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by developers unless explicitly
    required for custom spell mechanics. It is typically invoked automatically during
    spell cast initialization and can affect spell behavior if called at inappropriate
    times.
