documentation:
  brief: Calculates the Manhattan distance between two integer coordinates.
  description: The CalculateManhattanDistance method computes the Manhattan distance
    (also known as L1 distance or taxicab distance) between two points represented
    by integer coordinates. This distance metric is the sum of the absolute differences
    of their Cartesian coordinates. In the context of World of Warcraft pathfinding,
    this method is commonly used to estimate movement costs or distances between nodes
    in navigation graphs. The method takes two integer references as parameters and
    returns a floating-point value representing the computed Manhattan distance.
  parameters:
  - name: a
    description: The first integer coordinate value representing a point on a grid
  - name: b
    description: The second integer coordinate value representing a point on a grid
  returns: A float value representing the Manhattan distance between the two integer
    coordinates. The result is always non-negative and represents the sum of absolute
    differences between the coordinates.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Manhattan Distance Calculation
    code: 'int x1 = 3;

      int y1 = 5;

      float distance = PathfindingUtils::CalculateManhattanDistance(x1, y1);

      // Result: 8.0f (assuming both parameters are treated as coordinates)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Grid Coordinates
    code: 'int startX = 10;

      int startY = 15;

      int endX = 20;

      int endY = 25;

      float distance = PathfindingUtils::CalculateManhattanDistance(startX, endX)
      + PathfindingUtils::CalculateManhattanDistance(startY, endY);

      // Result: 20.0f (total Manhattan distance in both dimensions)'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is designed for use with integer grid coordinates and assumes
    that both parameters represent single coordinate values. For true 2D Manhattan
    distance calculation, the method would typically be called twice - once for each
    dimension (X and Y). The implementation is efficient with O(1) time complexity
    and suitable for real-time pathfinding calculations in TrinityCore.
  warnings: The method signature suggests it takes two integer references but only
    uses them as scalar values. This may be misleading if the intent was to calculate
    distance between two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). Ensure that the parameters are
    correctly interpreted based on the calling context to avoid incorrect distance
    calculations.
