  method: Trigger
  signature: void Trigger::Trigger(const std::string & name, TriggerType type)
documentation:
  brief: Triggers a specified trigger event by name and type within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  description: The Trigger method is used to activate a trigger event in the game
    world, identified by a unique name and defined type. This method allows for dynamic
    interaction with game systems such as quest events, area triggers, or custom scripted
    behaviors. The trigger system in TrinityCore enables modular and reusable event
    handling across different game mechanics. When invoked, this method will process
    the associated trigger logic based on its configuration in the database or script
    files. The method does not return any value but may have side effects depending
    on how the trigger is implemented.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A string identifier that uniquely defines the trigger event to be
      activated. This name must correspond to a valid trigger entry in the database
      or script system.
  - name: type
    description: An enumeration value specifying the type of trigger being activated.
      Valid types typically include area triggers, quest triggers, game event triggers,
      or custom AI triggers depending on the implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trigger Activation
    code: Trigger::Trigger("quest_start_event", TriggerType::QUEST);
    language: cpp
  - title: Area Trigger Activation
    code: Trigger::Trigger("player_enter_zone_1234", TriggerType::AREA);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within AI scripts or game event handlers.
    It's important to ensure that the trigger name and type are valid to avoid runtime
    errors. The actual behavior of the trigger depends on how it's configured in the
    database or script files.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid trigger name or unsupported type may
    result in undefined behavior or silent failures. Ensure all triggers are properly
    registered before attempting to activate them.
