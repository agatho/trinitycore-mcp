  signature: void PerformanceOptimizer::UpdateStrategyFitness(OptimizationStrategy
    & strategy, float performance)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the fitness score of an optimization strategy based on performance
    metrics.
  description: The UpdateStrategyFitness method is used to adjust the fitness value
    of a given OptimizationStrategy object. This method takes a reference to an OptimizationStrategy
    and a float representing the current performance metric, then updates the internal
    fitness tracking of that strategy. In the context of TrinityCore's AI systems,
    this method likely plays a role in adaptive behavior selection where strategies
    are ranked or selected based on their historical performance. The method does
    not return any value but modifies the state of the provided strategy object directly.
  parameters:
  - name: strategy
    description: Reference to an OptimizationStrategy object whose fitness score will
      be updated. This parameter must be a valid, initialized strategy object.
  - name: performance
    description: Float value representing the current performance metric for the strategy.
      This typically reflects how well the strategy has performed in recent evaluations
      or simulations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'OptimizationStrategy myStrategy;

      float currentPerformance = 0.85f;

      performanceOptimizer.UpdateStrategyFitness(myStrategy, currentPerformance);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Strategy Selection Loop
    code: "for (auto& strategy : strategyPool) {\n    float performance = evaluateStrategy(strategy);\n\
      \    performanceOptimizer.UpdateStrategyFitness(strategy, performance);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger adaptive AI system where strategies
    are continuously evaluated and their fitness scores updated. It's important to
    ensure that the strategy object passed in is valid and initialized before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing an uninitialized or invalid OptimizationStrategy reference may
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all parameters are properly
    validated before calling this method.
