  class: AuctionHouse
  method: AdaptPricingStrategy
  signature: void AuctionHouse::AdaptPricingStrategy(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the auction house pricing strategy based on current market conditions
    and player behavior.
  description: The AdaptPricingStrategy method dynamically modifies how auction prices
    are set within the auction house system. This function likely analyzes factors
    such as item demand, recent sales data, and player bidding patterns to optimize
    pricing. It may adjust price floors, ceilings, or scaling factors to maintain
    a healthy auction economy. The method operates on internal auction house state
    and does not directly interact with external systems, but influences the overall
    market dynamics by modifying how items are priced for sale.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier or index.
      This parameter is likely used to determine which player's behavior or data should
      influence the pricing strategy adaptation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      AuctionHouse ah;

      ah.AdaptPricingStrategy(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method appears to be part of an adaptive economic system within the
    auction house. It may be called periodically or in response to specific events
    like item sales or player actions. The exact implementation details regarding
    how pricing is adapted are not available, but it likely involves internal data
    structures tracking market trends.
  warnings: The parameter 'player' must point to a valid integer; passing an invalid
    pointer could lead to undefined behavior. This method modifies internal auction
    house state and should be used carefully in performance-critical sections of code.
