documentation:
  brief: Performs cleanup and shutdown operations for the auction house system
  description: The OnShutdown method is called during server shutdown to gracefully
    terminate all active auction house operations. This method ensures that all pending
    auctions are properly handled, outstanding bids are processed, and any temporary
    auction data is safely persisted or discarded. The method typically flushes auction
    records to the database, closes auction windows, and releases any resources held
    by the auction manager. It plays a critical role in maintaining data integrity
    during server maintenance or restarts.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Server Shutdown Cleanup
    code: "void World::UpdateWorldState()\n{\n    // During shutdown sequence\n  \
      \  sAuctionMgr->OnShutdown();\n    // Continue with other shutdown procedures\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during server shutdown sequences. It's
    typically invoked automatically by the core shutdown mechanism and shouldn't be
    manually triggered outside of this context.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a proper shutdown sequence may result in
    data loss or inconsistent auction states. The method assumes all auctions are
    in a stable state and should not be called while auction operations are actively
    processing.
