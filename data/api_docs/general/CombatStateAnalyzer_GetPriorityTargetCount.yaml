  method: GetPriorityTargetCount
  signature: uint32 CombatStateAnalyzer::GetPriorityTargetCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of priority targets in the combat state analyzer's target
    list.
  description: The GetPriorityTargetCount method retrieves the number of targets that
    have been classified as priority targets within the CombatStateAnalyzer instance.
    Priority targets are typically those that meet specific criteria such as being
    in melee range, having high threat, or being designated as primary objectives.
    This count is used by AI decision-making systems to determine combat behavior
    and target selection strategies. The method does not modify any internal state
    and is safe for repeated calls during combat evaluation cycles.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of priority targets currently
    tracked by the CombatStateAnalyzer instance. Returns 0 if no priority targets
    are present or if the analyzer has not been initialized with target data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "void CombatStrategy::Update()\n{\n    uint32 priorityCount = m_combatAnalyzer->GetPriorityTargetCount();\n\
      \    if (priorityCount > 0)\n    {\n        // Execute high-priority combat\
      \ actions\n        DoHighPriorityCombatAction();\n    }\n    else\n    {\n \
      \       // Switch to defensive or movement behavior\n        DoDefensiveBehavior();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple count operation on an internal target list
    and should have minimal performance impact. The priority target classification
    is typically updated during combat state evaluation cycles, so calling this method
    between such updates may return stale data.
