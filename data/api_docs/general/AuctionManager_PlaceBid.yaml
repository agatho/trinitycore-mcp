  class: AuctionManager
  method: PlaceBid
  signature: bool AuctionManager::PlaceBid(Player * bot, uint32 auctionId, uint64
    bidAmount)
documentation:
  brief: Places a bid on an auction item using the specified player character.
  description: The PlaceBid method allows a player character to place a bid on an
    existing auction item. It validates that the bid amount is sufficient (higher
    than the current highest bid) and that the player has enough money to cover the
    bid. The method updates the auction's bid information and handles the transaction
    of funds between the bidder and the auction house. This function is typically
    used in automated bot systems or scripts that interact with the auction house
    system.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character placing the
      bid. Must be a valid player instance with sufficient funds.
  - name: auctionId
    description: Unique identifier of the auction item to bid on. Must correspond
      to an active auction in the auction house system.
  - name: bidAmount
    description: The amount of gold the player wishes to bid. Must be greater than
      the current highest bid for the auction item.
  returns: Returns true if the bid was successfully placed and processed, false otherwise.
    A return value of false may indicate insufficient funds, invalid auction ID, or
    bid amount lower than the current highest bid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bid Placement
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player instance\nuint32 auctionId = 12345;\n\
      uint64 bidAmount = 1000000; // 100 gold\nbool success = sAuctionMgr->PlaceBid(player,\
      \ auctionId, bidAmount);\nif (success) {\n    // Bid placed successfully\n}\
      \ else {\n    // Handle bid failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Bid Placement with Error Handling
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 auctionId = 12345;\nuint64 bidAmount = 500000;\n\
      \nif (sAuctionMgr->PlaceBid(player, auctionId, bidAmount)) {\n    // Notify\
      \ player of successful bid\n    player->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"Bid\
      \ placed successfully.\");\n} else {\n    // Notify player of failed bid\n \
      \   player->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"Failed to place bid. Please check\
      \ your gold and the auction details.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally checks for valid auction state, sufficient funds,
    and proper bid increment rules. It may trigger database updates and session notifications.
    The method assumes that the player has already been validated and is in a valid
    game state.
  warnings: Ensure that the player object passed is valid and not null. Passing an
    invalid auction ID or insufficient bid amount will result in a failed bid without
    any error message being sent to the client. Always verify the auction's active
    status before attempting to place a bid.
