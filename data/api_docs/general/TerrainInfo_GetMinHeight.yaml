  class: TerrainInfo
  method: GetMinHeight
  signature: float TerrainInfo::GetMinHeight(const PhaseShift & phaseShift, uint32
    mapId, float x, float y)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the minimum height value at the specified coordinates for a given
    map and phase shift.
  description: The GetMinHeight method calculates and returns the lowest elevation
    point (height) at the provided world coordinates (x, y) within the specified map
    ID. This function takes into account the current phase shift which may affect
    visibility or accessibility of certain terrain features. The result is a floating-point
    value representing the height in game units, typically used for collision detection,
    pathfinding, or positioning logic. It's essential that the map ID corresponds
    to a valid map loaded in the server environment and that the coordinates are within
    the boundaries of that map.
  parameters:
  - name: phaseShift
    description: The phase shift object defining the current game phase context. This
      affects which parts of the terrain are visible or accessible, such as during
      world events or instance phases.
  - name: mapId
    description: Unique identifier for the map where the height is to be retrieved.
      Must correspond to a valid loaded map in the server's terrain system.
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate (horizontal axis) in world space for which to query
      the minimum height value.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate (vertical axis) in world space for which to query
      the minimum height value.
  returns: A float value representing the minimum height at the specified coordinates.
    Returns a reasonable default or zero if the requested location is invalid or outside
    of loaded terrain data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get minimum height for player position
    code: float minHeight = terrainInfo->GetMinHeight(phaseShift, mapId, playerX,
      playerY);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GetMinHeight for collision detection in movement logic
    code: "if (terrainInfo->GetMinHeight(phaseShift, mapId, newX, newY) > currentHeight\
      \ + 5.0f)\n{\n    // Potential obstacle or steep incline detected\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying terrain data structures and may involve
    lookup operations against height maps. For performance-critical code paths, consider
    caching results or using alternative methods like GetHeight() if only a single
    point's height is needed.
  warnings: Ensure that mapId refers to an actual loaded map; otherwise, undefined
    behavior or errors might occur. Also, be cautious with coordinates outside valid
    terrain boundaries as they may return unexpected values or cause assertion failures
    in debug builds.
