  class: BotWorldEntry
  method: GetElapsedTime
  signature: uint32 BotWorldEntry::GetElapsedTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the elapsed time in seconds since the bot world entry
    was created or last reset.
  description: The GetElapsedTime method computes the amount of time that has passed
    since this BotWorldEntry instance was initialized or its internal timer was last
    reset. This value is typically used to track how long a specific bot or bot-related
    process has been active within the game world. The returned value represents seconds
    as a 32-bit unsigned integer, making it suitable for time-based logic such as
    cooldowns, activity tracking, or lifecycle management of bot entities. This method
    does not modify any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of seconds elapsed since the BotWorldEntry
    was initialized or last reset. Returns zero if no time has been recorded or if
    the timer has not started.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Bot Activity Duration
    code: "BotWorldEntry* entry = ...; // Assume this is a valid pointer\nuint32 elapsedSeconds\
      \ = entry->GetElapsedTime();\nif (elapsedSeconds > 3600) {\n    // Bot has been\
      \ active for over an hour\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot has been running for %u\
      \ seconds.\", elapsedSeconds);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on an internal timer that must be properly initialized
    when the BotWorldEntry object is created. If the timer hasn't started or was reset,
    the returned value may not reflect meaningful time intervals. The implementation
    uses standard system time functions for accuracy.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotWorldEntry instance is fully initialized before calling
    this method; otherwise, unexpected behavior may occur. Also note that this function
    returns seconds, so for millisecond precision, consider using a higher-resolution
    timer if needed.
