documentation:
  brief: Checks whether debug logging is enabled for the bot packet relay system
  description: This method determines if the debug logging functionality is currently
    active within the BotPacketRelay class. It is used to control verbose output of
    packet handling operations, which can be useful for diagnosing issues with bot
    communication or network behavior in TrinityCore. The return value indicates whether
    additional logging information will be generated during packet processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if debug logging is enabled, false otherwise. This boolean
    flag controls the verbosity of internal logging within the packet relay system.
  examples:
  - title: Check Debug Logging Status
    code: "if (botPacketRelay.IsDebugLoggingEnabled()) {\n    // Perform additional\
      \ logging or debugging actions\n    sLog->outDebug(\"Bot packet relay debug\
      \ logging is enabled\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other debug-related methods
    to provide comprehensive logging control. The state of this flag may be modified
    through configuration settings or runtime commands.
