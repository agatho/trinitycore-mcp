  method: CalculateItemLevel
  signature: float LFGBotSelector::CalculateItemLevel(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the average item level of all equipped items for the
    specified bot player.
  description: The CalculateItemLevel method computes the average item level of all
    currently equipped items on a given bot player. This calculation is used by the
    LFG (Looking for Group) bot system to determine the appropriate difficulty levels
    and group compositions for the bot. The method iterates through all equipped slots,
    sums up the item levels of each equipped item, and divides by the total number
    of equipped items to produce an average. If no items are equipped, it returns
    0.0f. This value is crucial for matching bots with appropriate content and ensuring
    balanced group dynamics in World of Warcraft's LFG system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the average item level of all currently equipped
    items on the bot player. Returns 0.0f if no items are equipped or if the input
    player is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is a valid Player pointer

      float itemLevel = LFGBotSelector::CalculateItemLevel(bot);

      printf("Bot''s average item level: %.2f\n", itemLevel);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's current equipment state and will reflect
    changes immediately upon item equip/unequip. The calculation excludes non-equippable
    items such as consumables or quest items. Performance is generally low since it
    iterates through all equipped slots, but this is typically negligible in LFG bot
    contexts where such calculations are infrequent.
  warnings: Ensure the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not null
    before calling. The method does not perform any safety checks on the player object
    itself, so passing an invalid or uninitialized pointer may cause undefined behavior.
