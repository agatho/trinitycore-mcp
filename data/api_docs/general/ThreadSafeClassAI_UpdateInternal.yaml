  signature: void ThreadSafeClassAI::UpdateInternal(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the internal state of the thread-safe AI class based on the elapsed
    game time.
  description: The UpdateInternal method is responsible for performing periodic updates
    to the AI's internal state. It is typically called by the game engine's main loop
    at regular intervals, using the delta time (diff) parameter to determine how much
    time has passed since the last update. This method ensures that AI behaviors and
    logic are executed in a thread-safe manner, making it suitable for use in multi-threaded
    environments such as those found in TrinityCore. The method processes any pending
    AI actions, updates internal timers, and may trigger behavior changes based on
    game conditions or elapsed time.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the last update call. This
      value is used to determine how much time has passed for AI logic that depends
      on timing.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateInternal Usage
    code: "void SomeAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Perform AI updates\n    UpdateInternal(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced UpdateInternal with Conditional Logic
    code: "void AdvancedAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_updateTimer <= diff)\n\
      \    {\n        UpdateInternal(diff);\n        m_updateTimer = 1000; // Reset\
      \ timer\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        m_updateTimer -= diff;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not be called directly
    from outside the AI update loop. It's typically invoked by the core game engine
    or through a wrapper function that ensures proper synchronization.
  warnings: Do not call UpdateInternal manually unless you are certain about thread
    safety implications. Improper usage in multi-threaded contexts can lead to race
    conditions and undefined behavior.
