  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: HandleRouteDeviations
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::HandleRouteDeviations(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and handles route deviations for a specified group within an instance
    coordination context.
  description: The HandleRouteDeviations method in the InstanceCoordination class
    is responsible for managing and resolving any discrepancies or deviations in the
    movement paths of players within a group during instance encounters. This method
    ensures that group members stay coordinated and follow designated routes, particularly
    when unexpected events occur such as player disconnections, path obstructions,
    or dynamic environment changes. It typically updates internal state tracking,
    recalculates group positions, and may trigger corrective actions to maintain group
    integrity and instance progression. The method operates on a provided Group object,
    which represents the collection of players whose route deviations need to be handled.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group of players whose
      route deviations are being processed. This parameter is required and must not
      be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Instance Encounter
    code: "Group* myGroup = sObjectAccessor->GetGroupByLeader(playerGuid);\nif (myGroup)\n\
      {\n    sInstanceCoordination->HandleRouteDeviations(myGroup);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during instance encounters where group coordination
    is critical. It may involve internal synchronization and state updates that could
    impact performance if called excessively in rapid succession. The method assumes
    the provided Group pointer is valid and represents an active group within an instance.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed to this method is not null or invalid,
    as passing such a pointer can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This method
    should only be called during active instance encounters where route coordination
    is necessary.
