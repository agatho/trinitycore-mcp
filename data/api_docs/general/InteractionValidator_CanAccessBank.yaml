  signature: bool InteractionValidator::CanAccessBank(::Player * bot) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can access their bank inventory.
  description: The CanAccessBank method evaluates if a given player character has
    the necessary conditions to interact with their bank. This includes checking for
    valid player state, such as being in a non-combat state, not in a taxi flight,
    and having sufficient permissions or quest requirements. The method is typically
    used by AI systems or game logic to prevent invalid interactions with bank facilities.
    It ensures that the player's current game context allows for safe bank access
    without causing game state inconsistencies.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player can access their bank, false otherwise. This
    indicates whether all preconditions for bank interaction are met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (validator.CanAccessBank(bot)) {\n    // Proceed with bank interaction\
      \ logic\n    bot->GetSession()->SendBankFrame();\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid\
      \ state\n    bot->Say(\"Cannot access bank at this time.\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks on player state flags and may interact
    with the game's internal state management system. It is recommended to call this
    before attempting any bank-related operations to avoid unexpected behavior or
    client-side errors.
  warnings: Do not assume that a player can always access their bank; always validate
    using this method before performing bank operations. Calling bank functions without
    validation may result in disconnected sessions or corrupted game state.
