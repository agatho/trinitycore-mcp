  class: MonkAI
  method: CalculateRollDestination
  signature: int MonkAI::CalculateRollDestination(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the destination coordinate for a Monk's Roll ability
    based on target position.
  description: The CalculateRollDestination method determines the optimal landing
    position for the Monk's Roll ability by analyzing the current target's location
    and applying game mechanics such as distance constraints and line-of-sight checks.
    This method is typically invoked during the execution of a Monk's Roll ability
    to compute where the player should be teleported upon successful activation. The
    calculation considers factors like the target's position, the maximum range of
    the ability, and any environmental obstacles that might affect the teleportation
    path.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer array representing the target coordinates (x,
      y, z). This parameter defines the destination point for the Monk's Roll ability.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the calculation.
    A return value of 0 typically indicates a successful calculation and valid destination,
    while non-zero values may indicate errors such as invalid target coordinates,
    out-of-range conditions, or obstruction detection.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CalculateRollDestination
    code: "int targetCoords[3] = {100, 200, 300};\nint result = monkAI->CalculateRollDestination(targetCoords);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // Proceed with Monk's Roll teleportation\n    printf(\"\
      Roll destination calculated successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle error\
      \ condition\n    printf(\"Failed to calculate roll destination\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Monk AI system and relies on internal game state
    variables such as player position, target distance, and environmental data. It
    may perform multiple checks including range validation and obstacle detection
    to ensure a valid teleportation point is calculated.
  warnings: The target parameter must be properly initialized with valid coordinate
    values; otherwise, the method may return an error code or cause undefined behavior.
    Additionally, this method should only be called when the Monk's Roll ability is
    actually being used, not during other AI operations.
