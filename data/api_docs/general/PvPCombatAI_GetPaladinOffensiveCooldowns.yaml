  signature: int PvPCombatAI::GetPaladinOffensiveCooldowns(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the offensive cooldowns for a paladin player in PvP combat.
  description: The GetPaladinOffensiveCooldowns method retrieves the current offensive
    cooldown values for a paladin class player within PvP combat scenarios. This method
    is typically used by the PvPCombatAI system to determine which offensive abilities
    are currently available or on cooldown for the paladin. The returned value represents
    the number of offensive cooldowns that are active, and the player parameter is
    expected to be a pointer to a valid player object. This functionality is integral
    to AI decision-making in PvP combat situations where paladin players must manage
    their ability usage efficiently.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to a player object representing the paladin whose offensive
      cooldowns are being retrieved. Must be a valid pointer to a Player instance,
      otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the count of active offensive cooldowns
    for the paladin. A return value of 0 indicates all offensive abilities are available,
    while higher values indicate how many offensive abilities are currently on cooldown.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* paladin = ...; // Get a valid paladin player\nint cooldowns = ai->GetPaladinOffensiveCooldowns(paladin);\n\
      if (cooldowns == 0) {\n    // All offensive abilities available\n    // Execute\
      \ offensive action\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: PvP Combat Decision Making
    code: "Player* paladin = ...;\nPvPCombatAI* ai = ...;\nint cooldowns = ai->GetPaladinOffensiveCooldowns(paladin);\n\
      if (cooldowns < 3) {\n    // Only a few offensive abilities on cooldown\n  \
      \  // Consider using Divine Storm or Hammer of Wrath\n} else {\n    // Many\
      \ abilities on cooldown\n    // Focus on defensive actions or movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PvPCombatAI system and assumes that the player
    object passed in is a valid paladin class instance. The implementation may vary
    depending on the specific version of TrinityCore and the current combat state.
    This function is likely used internally by AI decision trees to make tactical
    choices during PvP encounters.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null pointer for the player parameter will result
    in undefined behavior. Ensure that the player object is a valid paladin instance
    before calling this method. The returned integer represents active cooldowns,
    not total abilities, so interpretation of the value should consider the paladin's
    full offensive ability set.
