  class: QuestPickup
  method: ExecuteAcceptAllStrategy
  signature: void QuestPickup::ExecuteAcceptAllStrategy(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Accepts all available quests for the specified player bot using a predefined
    strategy.
  description: The ExecuteAcceptAllStrategy method processes and accepts all eligible
    quests available to a given player bot within the game world. This method typically
    operates as part of an automated questing system or AI behavior, where it evaluates
    the current state of the bot's quest log and available quest givers to determine
    which quests can be accepted. It follows a specific strategy to prioritize and
    accept quests in an optimal order, potentially considering factors such as quest
    level requirements, faction reputation, quest rewards, and quest chain progression.
    The method ensures that all valid quests are accepted without manual intervention
    from the player.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which quests
      will be accepted. This parameter must not be null and should refer to a valid
      player instance within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume initialized bot

      QuestPickup questPickup;

      questPickup.ExecuteAcceptAllStrategy(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in automated questing systems or AI scripts.
    It assumes that the provided player object has valid quest data and that quest
    givers are accessible within the game world. The strategy implementation may vary
    depending on the specific configuration of the TrinityCore instance.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter refers to a valid Player instance; passing
    a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. This method modifies the player's
    quest log directly, so it should be used carefully in scenarios where quest state
    consistency is critical.
