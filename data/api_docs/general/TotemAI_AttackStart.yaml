  class: TotemAI
  method: AttackStart
  signature: void TotemAI::AttackStart(int * victim)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates attack behavior against a specified target for a totem unit.
  description: The AttackStart method in TotemAI is responsible for triggering the
    combat behavior of a totem when it begins attacking a target. This method is typically
    invoked by the AI system when a totem detects an enemy within its detection range
    or when commanded to engage in combat. It sets up the necessary flags and states
    to ensure that the totem enters combat mode, performs its attack animation, and
    begins dealing damage to the specified victim. The method ensures proper targeting
    and maintains the totem's engagement with the target until either the target is
    defeated or the totem is otherwise disabled.
  parameters:
  - name: victim
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit's identifier.
      This parameter specifies which entity the totem should attack. The value must
      be a valid GUID of a creature or player within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Attack Start Usage
    code: "void ExampleFunction(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (totemAI)\n        totemAI->AttackStart(&target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Attack Start with Null Check
    code: "void HandleTotemAttack(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (!target || !totemAI)\n\
      \        return;\n\n    uint64 victimGUID = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n\
      \    totemAI->AttackStart(&victimGUID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI system for totems in TrinityCore and integrates
    with the core combat mechanics. It assumes that the target unit exists and is
    valid before being called. The method does not perform any validation on the victim
    pointer itself, so callers must ensure the validity of the target.
  warnings: Calling AttackStart with an invalid or null victim GUID may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes within the AI system. Always verify that the target exists
    and is accessible before invoking this method.
