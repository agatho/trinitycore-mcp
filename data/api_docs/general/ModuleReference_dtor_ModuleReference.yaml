  brief: Destroys a ModuleReference instance and releases associated resources
  description: The ~ModuleReference destructor is called automatically when a ModuleReference
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any resources held by the module reference, including releasing memory
    allocations and notifying the system that the module reference is no longer valid.
    In TrinityCore's module system, this typically occurs during server shutdown or
    when modules are dynamically unloaded. The destructor performs necessary cleanup
    to prevent memory leaks and maintain system stability.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of ModuleReference
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    ModuleReference ref = ModuleReference(\"MyModule\"\
      );\n    // ref is automatically destroyed when going out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of ModuleReference
    code: 'ModuleReference* ref = new ModuleReference("AnotherModule");

      // ... use the reference ...

      delete ref; // Triggers ~ModuleReference destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when objects go
    out of scope. Developers should not manually call this destructor unless explicitly
    managing object lifetime. The destruction process may involve notifying other
    subsystems about module unloading, so it's important that this method completes
    cleanly to avoid system instability.
  warnings: Never manually invoke the destructor (e.g., ref.~ModuleReference()) as
    this bypasses normal C++ object lifecycle management and can lead to undefined
    behavior or resource leaks. Ensure all references to the module are properly cleaned
    up before destruction.
