  signature: void SpellCastTargets::RemoveDst()
documentation:
  brief: Removes the destination target from the spell cast targets collection.
  description: The RemoveDst method clears or removes the destination target (Dst)
    from the SpellCastTargets object. This is typically used during spell casting
    to manage which target the spell will be cast upon, particularly when the target
    needs to be invalidated or cleared before a new target is set. The method does
    not take any parameters and performs no return operation. It is commonly invoked
    in spell handling logic where dynamic targeting is required, such as when a target
    becomes invalid or when preparing for a new target selection.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing a spell's destination target
    code: 'SpellCastTargets targets;

      targets.RemoveDst(); // Clears the destination target from the spell cast targets'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell targeting system in TrinityCore and should
    be used carefully when modifying spell targets during runtime. It is typically
    called internally by the core spell system, but can also be invoked directly when
    custom spell logic requires explicit target clearing.
