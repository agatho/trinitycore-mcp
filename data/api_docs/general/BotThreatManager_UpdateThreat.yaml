  class: BotThreatManager
  method: UpdateThreat
  signature: void BotThreatManager::UpdateThreat(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the threat values for all bots in the manager based on elapsed time.
  description: The UpdateThreat method is responsible for processing and updating
    the threat levels of all bot characters managed by this BotThreatManager instance.
    It typically runs on a regular interval within the game loop, adjusting threat
    values according to combat behavior, target selection, and AI decision-making
    logic. This method ensures that bots maintain appropriate threat states relative
    to their targets and the overall combat situation. The update is performed based
    on the time difference (diff) passed since the last execution, which allows for
    smooth and consistent threat decay or increase over time.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    static uint32 updateTimer = 0;\n    uint32 diff\
      \ = getMSTime();\n    \n    if (updateTimer <= diff)\n    {\n        botThreatManager->UpdateThreat(diff);\n\
      \        updateTimer = diff + 1000; // Update every second\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the main game update loop and
    should be invoked with a time delta (diff) that reflects the actual elapsed milliseconds
    since the last call. The implementation may include threat decay calculations,
    target switching logic, or AI behavior updates based on current threat levels.
