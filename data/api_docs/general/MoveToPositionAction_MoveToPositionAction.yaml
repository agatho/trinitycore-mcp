documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new MoveToPositionAction instance for AI movement behavior.
  description: The MoveToPositionAction constructor initializes a new instance of
    the MoveToPositionAction class, which is used in TrinityCore's AI system to define
    movement behaviors towards specific positions. This action is typically employed
    by creatures or NPCs to navigate to designated locations within the game world.
    The initialization process sets up internal state variables and prepares the action
    for execution within an AI context. It does not perform any immediate movement
    but rather configures the action to be executed later through the AI's decision-making
    loop.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic instantiation of MoveToPositionAction
    code: 'MoveToPositionAction* action = new MoveToPositionAction();

      // The action is now ready to be added to an AI''s action list

      // and will execute when the AI evaluates its behavior tree'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not validate position coordinates or check if the target
    location is reachable. The actual movement execution occurs during the AI's update
    cycle, not during construction. The action may require additional configuration
    (such as target position and movement parameters) before it can be effectively
    used.
