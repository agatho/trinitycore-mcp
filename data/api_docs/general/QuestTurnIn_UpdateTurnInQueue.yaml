  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: UpdateTurnInQueue
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::UpdateTurnInQueue(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the quest turn-in queue for the specified bot player.
  description: The UpdateTurnInQueue method processes and manages the list of quests
    that are ready to be turned in by a bot player. It evaluates the current state
    of the player's quest log, checks for completed quests that meet turn-in criteria,
    and updates the internal queue structure accordingly. This method is typically
    invoked during AI decision-making cycles to ensure that the bot prioritizes and
    processes quest completions efficiently. The method operates on the assumption
    that the provided player object represents a valid bot with active quest data.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose quest turn-in
      queue needs to be updated. Must not be null and should represent an active bot
      character.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this points to a valid bot player

      QuestTurnIn questTurnIn;

      questTurnIn.UpdateTurnInQueue(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the automated quest management system for AI-controlled
    bots. It may trigger internal quest state updates and should be called regularly
    during bot behavior cycles to maintain accurate turn-in readiness.
