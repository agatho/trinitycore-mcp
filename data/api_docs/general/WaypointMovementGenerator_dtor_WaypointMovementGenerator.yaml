documentation:
  brief: Destroys a WaypointMovementGenerator instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the WaypointMovementGenerator class is responsible
    for releasing any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the movement
    generator. This includes cleaning up internal data structures such as waypoint
    lists, pathfinding caches, or references to creature or unit objects that were
    being tracked. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this destructor
    ensures proper cleanup when a creature's waypoint-based movement behavior is no
    longer needed, preventing memory leaks and maintaining stable AI behavior. The
    destructor does not take any parameters and performs no explicit actions beyond
    standard object destruction.
  parameters: []
  returns: void

  - title: Automatic Destructor Call
    code: "void ExampleFunction() {\n    WaypointMovementGenerator* gen = new WaypointMovementGenerator();\n\
      \    // ... use the generator ...\n    delete gen; // Triggers ~WaypointMovementGenerator()\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted. Developers should not manually call destructors unless
    implementing custom memory management or placement new patterns. The WaypointMovementGenerator
    likely inherits from MovementGenerator, so its destruction may also trigger parent
    class cleanup routines.
