  class: HealerPositioning
  method: GetConfig
  signature: const HealerPositionConfig & HealerPositioning::GetConfig() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the healer positioning configuration settings.
  description: The GetConfig method returns a constant reference to the HealerPositionConfig
    object that holds all the configuration parameters for healer positioning behavior.
    This configuration typically includes settings such as preferred distance from
    target, positioning priority, and movement constraints used by the AI system when
    determining optimal healer placement during combat. The returned reference provides
    access to these settings without allowing modification of the underlying configuration,
    ensuring data integrity across the system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a HealerPositionConfig object containing all healer
    positioning configuration parameters. This reference remains valid for the lifetime
    of the HealerPositioning instance and should not be stored or used beyond that
    scope.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing healer positioning configuration
    code: 'const HealerPositionConfig& config = healerPositioning.GetConfig();

      float preferredDistance = config.GetPreferredDistance();

      bool useSmartMovement = config.UseSmartMovement();'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to an internal configuration object managed
    by the HealerPositioning class. Modifying the configuration through this reference
    is not allowed, as it's marked as const. The configuration data is typically initialized
    during the class construction or through a separate initialization method.
  warnings: Be aware that the returned reference becomes invalid if the HealerPositioning
    instance is destroyed or reinitialized. Always ensure the parent object remains
    alive while using the configuration reference. Also, since this is a const reference,
    any attempt to modify the configuration through it will result in compilation
    errors.
