  class: SpellInfo
  method: CalcCastTime
  signature: uint32 SpellInfo::CalcCastTime(Spell * spell) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the cast time of a spell based on its properties and the current
    context.
  description: The CalcCastTime method determines the total casting time for a given
    spell, taking into account various factors such as spell attributes, base cast
    time, and any modifiers that might affect the duration. This method is essential
    for determining when a spell will finish casting and become available for use
    again. It typically considers the spell's base cast time, any haste effects, and
    other relevant game mechanics to compute the final cast time in milliseconds.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the cast time in milliseconds, representing the duration required
    for the spell to complete its casting process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: uint32 castTime = spellInfo->CalcCastTime(spell);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other spell-related functions
    to determine the timing of spell execution. Performance considerations include
    potential for frequent calls during combat situations, so it should be optimized
    where possible.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method in contexts involving multiple
    spell effects or modifiers, as incorrect handling may lead to inaccurate cast
    times and potentially unbalanced gameplay mechanics.
