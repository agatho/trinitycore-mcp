  signature: void AreaTriggerDataStore::LoadAreaTriggerTemplates()
documentation:
  brief: Loads all area trigger templates from the database into memory for use in
    the game world.
  description: The LoadAreaTriggerTemplates method initializes and populates the internal
    data store with all area trigger definitions retrieved from the database. This
    method is typically called during server startup or when reloading area trigger
    data. It processes template information such as position, dimensions, activation
    conditions, and associated scripts to prepare them for runtime use. The loaded
    templates are then used by the game engine to create active area triggers when
    players enter specific zones or meet certain conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: AreaTriggerDataStore::Instance()->LoadAreaTriggerTemplates();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    explicitly reloading area trigger data. It is not thread-safe and should be executed
    in the main thread context. The method will silently fail if database connection
    is unavailable or if no area trigger templates exist.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in duplicate entries in
    the data store. Avoid calling it during active gameplay as it may cause performance
    issues due to data reloading operations.
