  signature: bool Creature::CanEnterWater() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a creature can enter water.
  description: This method checks if a creature is capable of entering water, typically
    used in pathfinding and movement logic within World of Warcraft. It evaluates
    the creature's movement type and current state to determine if it can transition
    into water environments. The method is commonly used during AI behavior calculations
    and movement updates to ensure proper creature handling in aquatic scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature can enter water, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the creature's movement capabilities allow for underwater traversal.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->CanEnterWater()) {\n    // Creature can enter water\n   \
      \ // Proceed with aquatic pathfinding\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include checking creature's movement type and state,
    typically involving movement flags and AI behavior. Performance considerations
    are minimal as this is a simple boolean check but may impact pathfinding calculations
    when used frequently.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining actual water entry capability
    in complex scenarios; it only indicates whether the creature can enter water based
    on its current state and movement type.
