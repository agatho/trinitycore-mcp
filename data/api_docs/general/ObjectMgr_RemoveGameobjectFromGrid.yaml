  signature: void ObjectMgr::RemoveGameobjectFromGrid(const int * data)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a game object from its associated grid cell in the world.
  description: The RemoveGameobjectFromGrid method is responsible for removing a GameObject
    from the grid system that manages spatial partitioning of objects within the game
    world. This function ensures that the specified game object is no longer tracked
    in its current grid cell, which is essential when an object moves to a new grid
    or is destroyed. The method operates on data provided through a pointer to an
    integer array, which likely contains the GameObject's grid coordinates and unique
    identifier. Proper removal from the grid is crucial for maintaining accurate spatial
    queries, collision detection, and memory management within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array containing game object data including
      grid coordinates and unique identifier. The exact structure of this array is
      implementation-dependent but typically includes at least the grid X/Y coordinates
      and the GameObject's GUID.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing a GameObject from its current grid
    code: 'int gameObjectData[3] = {10, 15, 12345}; // x, y, guid

      ObjectMgr::instance()->RemoveGameobjectFromGrid(gameObjectData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when a GameObject
    moves between grids or is destroyed. It's part of the spatial partitioning system
    that helps optimize performance by limiting object interactions to nearby cells
    only.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid data may lead to undefined behavior or
    memory corruption. Ensure that the data pointer points to valid grid coordinates
    and a valid GameObject GUID before calling this function.
