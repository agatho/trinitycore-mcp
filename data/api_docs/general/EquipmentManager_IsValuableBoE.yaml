  signature: bool EquipmentManager::IsValuableBoE(int * item)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an item is a valuable Bind on Equip (BoE) item.
  description: The IsValuableBoE method checks if a given item meets the criteria
    for being considered 'valuable' in the context of Bind on Equip items. This typically
    involves evaluating the item's quality, level, and potential value within the
    game economy. The method is used primarily by the EquipmentManager to make decisions
    about item handling, such as whether to automatically equip or stash certain items.
    It considers various factors including item rarity, level requirements, and possibly
    vendor values or market prices.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the item's identifier or database
      entry. This parameter should point to a valid item entry in the game's item
      database.
  returns: Returns true if the item is classified as a valuable Bind on Equip item,
    false otherwise. Valuable BoE items are typically those with high quality, significant
    level requirements, or substantial market value.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an item is a valuable BoE
    code: "int itemId = 12345;\nif (equipmentManager->IsValuableBoE(&itemId)) {\n\
      \    // Handle valuable BoE item\n    printf(\"This is a valuable BoE item\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle non-valuable BoE item\n    printf(\"This is not\
      \ a valuable BoE item\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely uses internal game data tables to determine item values
    and may be influenced by server configuration settings. It's important to note
    that the definition of 'valuable' can vary between different World of Warcraft
    expansions or custom server modifications.
  warnings: Ensure that the item pointer passed is valid and points to a properly
    initialized item entry. Passing null or invalid pointers could lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes.
