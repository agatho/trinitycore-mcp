documentation:
  brief: Sets the item's soulbound status to allow trading to other players
  description: This method modifies an item's soulbound status to enable or disable
    trading to other players. It allows the item to be traded and shared with other
    players, typically used for items that should be soulbound but still allow trading.
    The method affects the item's behavior in terms of loot distribution and player
    interaction. This is commonly used in scenarios where items need to be soulbound
    but remain tradable, such as in certain quest rewards or crafted items.
  parameters:
  - name: allowedLooters
    description: The number of allowed looters that can trade the item; typically
      set to 1 to allow trading to other players
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Item* item = player->GetItemByGUID(12345);

      item->SetSoulboundTradeable(1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByGUID(12345);\nif (item)\n{\n    item->SetSoulboundTradeable(1);\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other soulbound-related
    methods to control item behavior. Implementation may involve setting flags or
    modifying internal data structures that govern how the item behaves when looted.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it can affect item loot mechanics
    and player interaction. Improper use may lead to unexpected behavior in item trading
    or loot distribution.
