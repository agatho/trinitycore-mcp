  class: Item
  method: IsEquipped
  signature: bool Item::IsEquipped() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the item is currently equipped on a character.
  description: This method checks if the item is in an equipped state, meaning it
    has been placed into a valid equipment slot on a player's character. The method
    returns true when the item is actively equipped and false when it is not equipped
    or when it is in a bag or inventory slot. This functionality is essential for
    determining item status during gameplay mechanics such as item usage, equipment
    changes, and character state management.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item is equipped on a character, false otherwise. The
    method will return false if the item is in a bag or inventory slot, or if it has
    not been equipped yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByGuid(guid);\nif (item->IsEquipped()) {\n\
      \    // Item is currently equipped\n    // Perform actions specific to equipped\
      \ items\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on the item's current state and slot information. It does
    not consider whether the item is actually worn or simply placed in an equipment
    slot. The implementation uses internal flags that track the item's equipment status
    rather than checking physical slot positions.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if an item is in a bag or
    inventory slot, as it will return false for those cases. Be careful when using
    this method in conjunction with other item state checks, as it may lead to incorrect
    assumptions about item positioning.
