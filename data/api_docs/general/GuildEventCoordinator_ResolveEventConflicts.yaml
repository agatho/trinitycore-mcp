  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::ResolveEventConflicts(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Resolves conflicts between guild events by identifying and handling overlapping
    or conflicting event schedules.
  description: The ResolveEventConflicts method in the GuildEventCoordinator class
    is responsible for detecting and managing conflicts that arise when multiple guild
    events are scheduled at overlapping times. This method ensures that guild activities
    do not interfere with each other, maintaining a coherent event calendar. It typically
    iterates through all active guild events, compares their time ranges, and applies
    conflict resolution strategies such as rescheduling, cancelling, or notifying
    guild members about potential overlaps. The method may also update internal data
    structures to reflect resolved conflicts and ensure consistency across the guild's
    event management system.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier (GUID) whose
      events are being checked for conflicts. This parameter allows the method to
      focus on specific player-related events or determine which player initiated
      the conflict resolution process.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.ResolveEventConflicts(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conflict Resolution with Player Context
    code: "void HandleGuildEventConflict(Player* player)\n{\n    int playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      \    GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;\n    coordinator.ResolveEventConflicts(&playerId);\n\
      \    // Additional logic to notify player of resolved conflicts\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs time-based comparisons and may involve database
    queries or in-memory event tracking. It is designed to be called during guild
    event creation, modification, or periodic maintenance routines. The method assumes
    that events have valid start/end times and that the player identifier passed refers
    to an existing guild member.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null pointer for the player parameter could
    lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the player ID corresponds to an active
    guild member before invoking this function. Improper handling of conflict resolution
    may result in event disruptions or data inconsistency.
