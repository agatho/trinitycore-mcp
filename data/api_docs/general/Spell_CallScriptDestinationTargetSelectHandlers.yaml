  method: CallScriptDestinationTargetSelectHandlers
  signature: void Spell::CallScriptDestinationTargetSelectHandlers(SpellDestination
    & target, int effIndex, const SpellImplicitTargetInfo & targetType)
documentation:
  brief: Invokes script handlers to select destination targets for a spell effect.
  description: The CallScriptDestinationTargetSelectHandlers method is responsible
    for executing scripted target selection logic for spell effects that require custom
    destination targeting. This method is typically called during spell execution
    when the system needs to determine where a spell should be cast or where its effects
    should be applied, particularly for effects that use implicit target types requiring
    script-based selection. It processes the provided SpellDestination and effect
    index through registered script handlers to finalize the target selection process.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Reference to the SpellDestination object that will be modified by
      script handlers to define the final target location for the spell effect.
  - name: effIndex
    description: Integer index representing the specific spell effect being processed.
      Used to identify which effect's target selection logic should be executed.
  - name: targetType
    description: Reference to SpellImplicitTargetInfo containing information about
      the implicit target type for this spell effect, used by script handlers to determine
      appropriate targeting behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell processing
    code: 'SpellDestination dest;

      int effectIndex = 0;

      SpellImplicitTargetInfo targetInfo;

      spell->CallScriptDestinationTargetSelectHandlers(dest, effectIndex, targetInfo);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell execution pipeline and should only be called
    during active spell casting or effect application. Script handlers registered
    for destination target selection must properly handle the provided SpellDestination
    object to ensure correct targeting behavior.
