documentation:
  brief: Initiates the Fel Rush ability for the player, applying its effects and updating
    momentum tracking.
  description: The UseFelRush method activates the Fel Rush ability within the MomentumTracker
    system. This method typically handles the application of Fel Rush mechanics such
    as movement speed increases, damage bonuses, or other temporary effects. It updates
    internal momentum state tracking to reflect the usage of this ability. The method
    is generally called when a player uses the Fel Rush spell or ability in-game,
    and may trigger related cooldowns or resource consumption. This functionality
    is part of the class's core gameplay mechanics for managing player abilities and
    their associated momentum states.

    code: 'MomentumTracker tracker;

      tracker.UseFelRush();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's current momentum state and
    may modify internal cooldown timers or resource counters. It is expected to be
    called only when the player has the ability available and meets prerequisites
    such as having sufficient mana or energy.
  warnings: Ensure that the MomentumTracker instance is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as calling it on an uninitialized object may lead to undefined
    behavior. The method assumes proper game state validation has been performed prior
    to execution.
