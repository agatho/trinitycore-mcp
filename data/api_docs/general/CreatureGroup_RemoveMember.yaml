  class: CreatureGroup
  method: RemoveMember
  signature: void CreatureGroup::RemoveMember(Creature * member)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified creature from the creature group.
  description: The RemoveMember method removes a given creature from the current creature
    group. This operation updates internal group tracking structures to ensure the
    creature is no longer considered part of the group. The method typically handles
    cleanup of group-related data and may trigger events or state changes depending
    on the group's behavior. It is commonly used when a creature in a group needs
    to be separated, either due to death, despawn, or manual removal from the group.
  parameters:
  - name: member
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that should be removed from the group.
      Must not be null and must represent a valid creature currently in the group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a creature from a group
    code: 'Creature* targetCreature = ...; // Assume this is a valid creature in a
      group

      creatureGroup->RemoveMember(targetCreature);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided creature pointer is valid and belongs
    to the group. It does not perform any validation on whether the creature actually
    exists in the group, which could lead to undefined behavior if misused.
  warnings: Calling RemoveMember with a creature not currently in the group may result
    in inconsistent internal state or crashes. Always ensure that the creature is
    part of the group before calling this method.
