  class: BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized
  method: AddBotSession
  signature: bool BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::AddBotSession(int playerGuid, std::shared_ptr<BotSession>
    session)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a new bot session to the manager using the specified player GUID and
    session pointer.
  description: The AddBotSession method is responsible for registering a new bot session
    within the BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized class. It takes a player GUID and a shared
    pointer to a BotSession object, and attempts to associate them within the internal
    session management structure. This method is typically used during the initialization
    or spawning of bot characters in the game world. The method returns true if the
    session was successfully added, or false if an error occurred, such as a duplicate
    GUID or invalid session pointer. The implementation likely involves thread-safe
    operations and may include validation checks to ensure data integrity.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player associated with the bot
      session. This value must be a valid, non-zero GUID that uniquely identifies
      the bot character in the game world.
  - name: session
    description: A shared pointer to the BotSession object representing the bot's
      session state. The pointer must be valid and not null; otherwise, the method
      will likely fail or cause undefined behavior.
  returns: Returns true if the bot session was successfully added to the manager,
    false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that a session with
    the same playerGuid already exists, or that the provided session pointer is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "std::shared_ptr<BotSession> botSession = std::make_shared<BotSession>(playerGuid);\n\
      bool success = botWorldSessionMgr.AddBotSession(playerGuid, botSession);\nif\
      \ (success) {\n    // Session added successfully\n} else {\n    // Handle failure\
      \ case\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling
    code: "std::shared_ptr<BotSession> session = std::make_shared<BotSession>(guid);\n\
      if (!botWorldSessionMgr.AddBotSession(guid, session)) {\n    // Log error or\
      \ handle duplicate session\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to add bot session for\
      \ GUID: %u\", guid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented in a thread-safe manner due to the nature
    of World of Warcraft's multi-threaded environment. It may internally use locking
    mechanisms or atomic operations to prevent race conditions when managing bot sessions
    concurrently.
  warnings: Ensure that the playerGuid parameter is unique and valid before calling
    this method, as duplicate GUIDs can lead to unexpected behavior or data corruption.
    Also, always verify that the session pointer is not null to avoid runtime errors.
