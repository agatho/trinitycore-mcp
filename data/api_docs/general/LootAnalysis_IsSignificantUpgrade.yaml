  class: LootAnalysis
  method: IsSignificantUpgrade
  signature: bool LootAnalysis::IsSignificantUpgrade(Player * player, const LootItem
    & item)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a loot item represents a significant upgrade for the player
    based on item level and quality comparisons.
  description: The IsSignificantUpgrade method evaluates whether a given loot item
    provides a meaningful improvement over the player's currently equipped items.
    It compares the item's stats, such as item level and quality, against the player's
    existing gear to determine if the new item is substantially better. This functionality
    is typically used in loot distribution systems, particularly for determining how
    items should be awarded or whether they should be flagged for special handling
    during loot analysis. The method considers factors like item slot, current equipped
    item level, and potential stat improvements.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose equipped items will be compared
      against the loot item. Must not be null.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing information about
      the item being evaluated for upgrade significance. The item must have valid
      item data and slot information.
  returns: Returns true if the loot item represents a significant upgrade over the
    player's currently equipped item in that slot; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nLootItem lootItem = ...;\nbool isUpgrade = LootAnalysis::IsSignificantUpgrade(player,\
      \ lootItem);\nif (isUpgrade)\n{\n    // Handle significant upgrade logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Loot Distribution
    code: "void ProcessLoot(Player* player, LootItem& item)\n{\n    if (LootAnalysis::IsSignificantUpgrade(player,\
      \ item))\n    {\n        // Award special loot bonus or notify player\n    \
      \    player->SendNotification(\"You found a significant upgrade!\");\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate item level calculations and proper comparison
    logic between the new loot item and the player's current gear. The implementation
    may consider factors such as item slot, quality thresholds, and stat deltas to
    determine significance. Performance is generally acceptable for single-item evaluations
    but could become a bottleneck in high-frequency loot processing scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer and LootItem reference are valid before
    calling this method; passing null or invalid references will likely result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. The method assumes that item level comparisons
    are meaningful within the context of the current game version and expansion.
