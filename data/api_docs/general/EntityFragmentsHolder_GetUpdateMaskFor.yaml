    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the update mask value for a specified entity fragment.
  description: The GetUpdateMaskFor method returns the update mask associated with
    a given entity fragment. This mask is used in World of Warcraft's packet system
    to determine which fields of an entity should be included in an update packet.
    The update mask helps optimize network traffic by only sending relevant data changes
    to clients. This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when constructing update packets for entities such as players, creatures, or game
    objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the update mask for the specified entity fragment.
    Each bit in this mask corresponds to a specific field in the entity's update data
    structure, indicating whether that field should be included in updates.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'uint8 mask = holder->GetUpdateMaskFor(EntityFragment::FRAGMENT_1);

      // Use mask to determine which fields to include in update packet'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal entity update system and should not typically
    be called directly by addon developers. The update mask values are usually managed
    automatically by the TrinityCore framework when handling entity updates.
