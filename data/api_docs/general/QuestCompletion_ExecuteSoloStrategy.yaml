  class: QuestCompletion
  method: ExecuteSoloStrategy
  signature: void QuestCompletion::ExecuteSoloStrategy(Player * bot, QuestProgressData
    & progress)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the solo quest completion strategy for a player bot, updating quest
    progress and handling quest rewards.
  description: The ExecuteSoloStrategy method implements the core logic for completing
    quests in a solo gameplay scenario within the TrinityCore framework. It processes
    the provided quest progress data for a given player bot, determining appropriate
    actions such as quest acceptance, objective fulfillment, reward collection, and
    quest advancement. This method is typically invoked during AI-driven quest completion
    routines where a bot character autonomously handles quest progression without
    group assistance. The implementation ensures proper state management of quest-related
    data structures and may interact with the game's quest system to update player
    progress, handle quest item requirements, and manage quest reward distribution.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character that
      will execute the quest completion strategy. Must be a valid player instance
      with active quest tracking capabilities.
  - name: progress
    description: Reference to QuestProgressData structure containing current quest
      progress information for the bot. This includes objective completion states,
      item requirements, and other quest-related data that determines how the strategy
      should be executed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic quest completion execution
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Get player bot

      QuestProgressData progress;

      // Initialize progress data with quest state

      questCompletion.ExecuteSoloStrategy(bot, progress);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Complete quest with multiple objectives
    code: 'Player* bot = ...;

      QuestProgressData progress;

      progress.questId = 12345;

      progress.objectives[0].status = OBJECTIVE_COMPLETE;

      progress.objectives[1].status = OBJECTIVE_INCOMPLETE;

      questCompletion.ExecuteSoloStrategy(bot, progress);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided bot player object has valid quest tracking
    capabilities and that the QuestProgressData structure contains properly initialized
    data. The implementation may perform multiple database operations and game state
    updates during execution. It's recommended to ensure the bot is in a valid state
    before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or null bot pointer will likely result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that QuestProgressData contains valid
    quest information before passing it to this method. The method may modify the
    provided progress data structure directly, so consider making a copy if you need
    to preserve original values.
