  class: LFGGroupCoordinator
  method: OnGroupReady
  signature: bool LFGGroupCoordinator::OnGroupReady(int groupGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a group is ready for LFG dungeon matching and returns true if successful.
  description: The OnGroupReady method in LFGGroupCoordinator evaluates whether a
    specific group, identified by its GUID, has met all necessary conditions to be
    considered ready for LFG (Looking For Group) dungeon matchmaking. This includes
    verifying that all group members are present, have appropriate levels, and meet
    other game requirements such as having no pending restrictions or cooldowns. The
    method ensures the integrity of the LFG system by preventing groups with incomplete
    or invalid states from being matched to dungeons. It is typically invoked during
    group creation, member changes, or when a player attempts to join a dungeon queue.
  parameters:
  - name: groupGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group to check for readiness.
      This value must correspond to an existing group in the LFG system and should
      be validated before calling this method.
  returns: Returns true if the group is ready for LFG dungeon matching, otherwise
    false. A return value of false may indicate that one or more members are missing,
    have invalid levels, or are otherwise ineligible to participate in a dungeon queue.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage checking group readiness
    code: "if (LFGGroupCoordinator::OnGroupReady(123456)) {\n    // Proceed with LFG\
      \ queue submission\n    printf(\"Group is ready for dungeon matching\\n\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle invalid group state\n    printf(\"Group not ready for\
      \ dungeon matching\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after verifying that the group exists and
    is active within the LFG framework. It performs internal checks on member status,
    level requirements, and cooldowns, so performance impact is minimal but not negligible
    in high-traffic scenarios.
  warnings: Do not call this method with an invalid or non-existent group GUID; it
    may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all members of the group
    are properly initialized before invoking this check.
