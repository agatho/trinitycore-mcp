  signature: bool WorldObject::isNeedNotify(uint16 f) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a WorldObject requires notification for specific events
    or changes
  description: The isNeedNotify method checks if a WorldObject needs to be notified
    about certain events or changes, typically related to movement, updates, or interactions
    within the game world. This method is crucial for determining when objects should
    trigger notifications to other players or systems, particularly in scenarios involving
    dynamic updates like movement, combat, or environmental changes. The function
    uses a bitmask parameter 'f' to specify which types of notifications are required,
    allowing fine-grained control over notification behavior based on object type
    and context.
  parameters:
  - name: f
    description: A uint16 bitmask representing the specific notification types required
      for this WorldObject. This parameter defines what kind of events or changes
      will trigger a notification, such as movement updates, combat state changes,
      or environmental interactions.
  returns: Returns true if the WorldObject needs to be notified about the specified
    event type, false otherwise. The method returns a boolean value indicating whether
    notification is required for the given bitmask 'f'.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (obj->isNeedNotify(0x0001))\n{\n    // This object needs notification\
      \ for movement updates\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with multiple notification types
    code: "uint16 notificationMask = 0x0001 | 0x0002 | 0x0004;\nif (obj->isNeedNotify(notificationMask))\n\
      {\n    // Object needs notification for multiple event types\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other WorldObject update
    methods to determine when notifications should be sent. The bitmask 'f' allows
    for precise control over which events trigger notification, making it useful for
    optimizing performance and reducing unnecessary updates. Implementation details
    may vary based on the specific object type and its role in the game world.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a general-purpose check for all notifications.
    It's important to understand that the bitmask 'f' represents specific notification
    types, and using incorrect values can lead to either missed notifications or unnecessary
    notifications. Care should be taken when setting the bitmask value.
