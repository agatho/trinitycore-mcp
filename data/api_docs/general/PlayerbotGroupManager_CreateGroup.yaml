  class: PlayerbotGroupManager
  method: CreateGroup
  signature: bool PlayerbotGroupManager::CreateGroup(Player * leader, GroupFormationType
    type)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new player group with the specified leader and formation type.
  description: The CreateGroup method initializes a new player group in the TrinityCore
    world, assigning the provided player as the group leader. The method supports
    different group formation types which determine how the group will be structured
    and managed. This functionality is primarily used in player bot systems to dynamically
    form groups for coordinated gameplay activities such as raids, dungeons, or battlegrounds.
    The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the group creation was successful,
    with failure typically occurring due to invalid parameters or system constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: leader
    description: Pointer to the Player object that will become the leader of the new
      group. Must be a valid player instance with proper authentication and in-game
      state.
  - name: type
    description: Enumeration value specifying the formation type for the group. Valid
      values include different group configurations such as raid, dungeon, or battleground
      formations that affect how players are organized and managed within the group.
  returns: Returns true if the group was successfully created with the specified leader
    and formation type; returns false if creation failed due to invalid parameters,
    system limitations, or other constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Creation
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get a valid player instance\nGroupFormationType\
      \ formation = GROUP_FORMATION_RAID;\nbool success = botGroupManager->CreateGroup(player,\
      \ formation);\nif (success) {\n    // Group created successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Different Formation Types
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get a valid player instance

      // Create a dungeon group

      bool dungeonSuccess = botGroupManager->CreateGroup(player, GROUP_FORMATION_DUNGEON);

      // Create a battleground group

      bool bgSuccess = botGroupManager->CreateGroup(player, GROUP_FORMATION_BATTLEGROUND);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player bot system and should only be called when
    managing automated player groups. The group creation process involves internal
    state management and may have performance implications if used excessively in
    rapid succession. Ensure that the leader parameter points to an active, valid
    player object before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null or invalid player pointer will likely
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate that the player exists
    and is properly initialized before attempting group creation. Additionally, excessive
    use of this method without proper cleanup may lead to memory leaks or system resource
    exhaustion.
