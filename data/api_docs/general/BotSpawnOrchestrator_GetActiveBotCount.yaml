  class: BotSpawnOrchestrator
  method: GetActiveBotCount
  signature: uint32 BotSpawnOrchestrator::GetActiveBotCount(uint32 zoneId) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of active bots within the specified zone ID.
  description: The GetActiveBotCount method retrieves the number of currently active
    bots in a given zone. This method is typically used by the bot spawning orchestrator
    to manage and monitor bot populations across different zones in the game world.
    It helps ensure that the server maintains appropriate bot density and avoids overpopulation
    in specific areas. The method takes a zone identifier as input and returns a uint32
    representing how many bots are currently active within that zone. This information
    is crucial for dynamic bot management systems that adjust bot spawning rates based
    on player activity or server load.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the zone for which to count active bots.
      This value corresponds to a specific area in the game world, typically defined
      by the zone's database entry or map ID.
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of active bots currently spawned
    in the specified zone. Returns zero if no bots are active in the zone or if the
    zone ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 botCount = botSpawnOrchestrator->GetActiveBotCount(1234);\nif (botCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process active bots in zone 1234\n    sLog->outString(\"Active\
      \ bots in zone 1234: %u\", botCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Bot Management
    code: "uint32 currentZoneId = player->GetZoneId();\nuint32 activeBots = botSpawnOrchestrator->GetActiveBotCount(currentZoneId);\n\
      if (activeBots < 5)\n{\n    // Spawn more bots if zone is underpopulated\n \
      \   botSpawnOrchestrator->SpawnBotForZone(currentZoneId);\n}\nelse if (activeBots\
      \ > 20)\n{\n    // Reduce bot population if zone is overpopulated\n    botSpawnOrchestrator->DespawnBotFromZone(currentZoneId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on internal data structures maintained by the
    BotSpawnOrchestrator class, such as a map or list of active bots per zone. The
    implementation may involve locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety when accessing
    shared bot state information. Performance is generally O(1) for lookup operations
    assuming proper indexing by zone ID.
  warnings: Ensure that the zoneId parameter corresponds to a valid zone in the game
    world; invalid IDs might return unexpected results or cause undefined behavior.
    This method should not be called during critical sections where bot spawning/despawning
    is actively occurring, as it may lead to inconsistent counts.
