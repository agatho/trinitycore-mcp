  class: CooldownManager
  method: StopChanneling
  signature: void CooldownManager::StopChanneling(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Stops the channeling of a specified spell by the owner of the CooldownManager.
  description: The StopChanneling method terminates any ongoing channeling effect
    associated with the given spell ID. This method is typically invoked when a player's
    channeling is interrupted, such as by taking damage, moving out of range, or explicitly
    canceling the channel. It ensures that the channeling state is properly reset
    and any related cooldowns are handled accordingly. The method does not validate
    whether the spell was actually channeling; it simply stops the channeling process
    if it exists.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell whose channeling should be stopped.
      This ID must correspond to a valid spell that supports channeling mechanics
      in TrinityCore.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: cooldownManager->StopChanneling(12345); // Stops channeling of spell with
      ID 12345
    language: cpp
  - title: Interrupting Channeling on Damage
    code: "void Player::OnTakeDamage(Unit* attacker, uint32 damage)\n{\n    if (IsChanneling())\n\
      \        StopChanneling(GetCurrentChannelSpellId());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the core when channeling is interrupted.
    Developers should ensure that spell IDs passed to this function are valid and
    support channeling effects. The method does not directly manage cooldowns or reset
    timers; it only stops the channeling state.
  warnings: Calling StopChanneling with an invalid or non-channeling spell ID may
    result in undefined behavior or silent failures. Ensure proper validation of spell
    IDs before invoking this method.
