  class: BotProfiler
  method: SetMaxSessions
  signature: void BotProfiler::SetMaxSessions(uint32_t maxSessions)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum number of bot sessions allowed by the profiler.
  description: The SetMaxSessions method configures the upper limit for concurrent
    bot sessions that can be tracked by the BotProfiler. This setting affects how
    many individual bot activities the profiler will monitor simultaneously. The method
    accepts a uint32_t parameter representing the desired maximum session count. Once
    set, this value determines the capacity of the profiler's internal session tracking
    mechanism. If the maximum is exceeded, new sessions may be rejected or existing
    ones may be terminated based on the implementation logic.
  parameters:
  - name: maxSessions
    description: The maximum number of concurrent bot sessions to allow. Must be a
      positive integer value. This parameter defines the capacity limit for session
      tracking within the profiler.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Bot Sessions
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      profiler.SetMaxSessions(100); // Allow up to 100 concurrent bot sessions'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Profiler for High Load
    code: 'BotProfiler* profiler = BotProfiler::GetSingleton();

      profiler->SetMaxSessions(500); // Configure for handling 500 concurrent bots'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies an internal configuration value that affects
    session management. The change takes effect immediately without requiring a restart
    or additional initialization steps. Consider the performance implications when
    setting very high values, as each session consumes memory and processing resources.
  warnings: Setting this value too low may cause active bot sessions to be terminated
    prematurely if the limit is exceeded. Setting it too high could lead to resource
    exhaustion under heavy load conditions. Ensure that the system has sufficient
    memory and CPU capacity to handle the specified number of concurrent sessions.
