  method: GetInterruptibleCasts
  signature: int InterruptAwareness::GetInterruptibleCasts(float maxRange) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of interruptible casts within the specified maximum range.
  description: The GetInterruptibleCasts method determines how many ongoing spell
    casts can be interrupted by the current unit within a given range. This is typically
    used in AI logic to assess threat or targeting behavior, particularly when deciding
    whether to interrupt an enemy's casting. The method evaluates all nearby hostile
    units and counts those whose current spell casts are interruptible. It considers
    factors such as cast state, spell mechanics, and proximity to the calling unit.
    The result is a count of interruptible casts that can be used for tactical decision-making
    in combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of interruptible casts found within
    the maximum range. Returns zero if no interruptible casts are detected or if the
    range is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "int interruptibleCasts = unit->GetInterruptibleCasts(30.0f);\nif (interruptibleCasts\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Initiate interrupt strategy\n    unit->CastSpell(target, SPELL_INTERRUPT_CAST,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Tactical Decision Based on Interrupts
    code: "float maxRange = 25.0f;\nint interrupts = unit->GetInterruptibleCasts(maxRange);\n\
      \nif (interrupts >= 2)\n{\n    // Prioritize interrupting high-priority targets\n\
      \    unit->SetTarget(highPriorityTarget);\n}\nelse if (interrupts == 1)\n{\n\
      \    // Consider interrupting single target\n    unit->CastSpell(target, SPELL_SHOCKWAVE,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only counts casts that are currently in progress and can be interrupted
    by the calling unit. It does not account for spell immunities or resistance to
    interruption effects. Performance-wise, this method iterates through nearby units
    and checks their cast states, so it should be used judiciously in high-frequency
    AI loops.
  warnings: The method may return inaccurate results if called during a unit's casting
    state transition or if the unit's target is not properly updated. Avoid calling
    this method with extremely large range values as it could impact performance significantly.
