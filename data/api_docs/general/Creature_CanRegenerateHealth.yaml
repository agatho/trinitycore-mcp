documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature can regenerate its health points.
  description: This method checks if a creature is capable of regenerating health
    points over time. It evaluates various conditions such as whether the creature
    has a valid health regeneration rate, whether it's in a state where regeneration
    is possible, and if the creature's current health status allows for regeneration.
    The method is commonly used in game mechanics to determine if a creature can recover
    health during combat or other gameplay scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature can regenerate health points; otherwise returns
    false if health regeneration is not possible or disabled.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->CanRegenerateHealth()) {\n    // Creature can regenerate\
      \ health\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically checks internal creature state flags and health regeneration
    settings. It's often used in conjunction with other health-related methods to
    determine overall creature behavior during gameplay.
