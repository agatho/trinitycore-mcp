  class: Unit
  method: GetTotalStatValue
  signature: float Unit::GetTotalStatValue(int stat) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total value of a specified stat for the unit.
  description: This method retrieves the total value of a given stat for the Unit,
    including all modifiers and bonuses that affect the stat. It is commonly used
    in World of Warcraft to calculate character attributes such as strength, agility,
    stamina, intellect, and spirit. The method accounts for base stats, buffs effects,
    and any other relevant modifiers that influence the final stat value. This functionality
    is essential for determining character abilities and performance in combat.
  parameters:
  - name: stat
    description: 'The stat type to retrieve. Valid values include: strength (0), agility
      (1), stamina (2), intellect (3), spirit (4). This parameter determines which
      stat value is returned.'
  returns: Returns the total stat value as a float, representing the combined base
    value and all modifiers applied to that specific stat. The return value may be
    zero or negative if no stat modifiers exist, or if the stat has been modified
    by negative effects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: float strength = unit->GetTotalStatValue(STAT_STRENGTH);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'float totalStamina = unit->GetTotalStatValue(STAT_STAMINA);

      float baseStamina = unit->GetBaseStatValue(STAT_STAMINA);

      float bonusStamina = unit->GetBonusStatValue(STAT_STAMINA);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically involves calculations that include both base stat values
    and modifiers from buffs, gear, talents, and other sources. Performance considerations
    arise when calling this method frequently during combat or in complex calculations
    involving multiple stats.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with negative stat values, as it may
    result in unexpected behavior if the stat has been modified by negative effects.
    Also, ensure that stat types are correctly specified to avoid incorrect results.
