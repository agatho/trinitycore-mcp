documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a unit's spline movement is enabled.
  description: This method checks if a unit has enabled spline movement, which is
    used for smooth pathfinding and movement animations in World of Warcraft. It returns
    true when the unit is actively using spline-based movement, typically during movement
    or combat situations. The method is commonly used to verify that a unit's movement
    state is properly configured for pathfinding operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit has enabled spline movement, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the unit is currently using spline-based movement mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsSplineEnabled())\n{\n    // Unit is using spline movement\n\
      \    // Perform actions related to spline movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related
    methods. The implementation may vary depending on the specific unit type (player,
    creature, etc.). Performance considerations should be noted when checking this
    value frequently during movement updates.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a unit is moving, as it
    only indicates whether spline movement is enabled. Use other methods like IsMoving()
    for actual movement status.
