  brief: Loads and initializes all gossip menu entries from the database into memory
    for use in World of Warcraft NPC interactions.
  description: The LoadGossipMenu method is responsible for loading all gossip menu
    data from the database tables into memory during server startup or reload operations.
    This method processes entries from tables such as gossip_menu, gossip_menu_option,
    and related gossip data structures to build internal caches that are used when
    NPCs interact with players through the gossip system. It ensures that all available
    gossip options, quest links, and menu structures are properly loaded and accessible
    for runtime use. The method typically executes during server initialization or
    when reloading NPC data, and it's crucial for proper NPC interaction functionality
    in TrinityCore.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadGossipMenus()\n{\n    sObjectMgr->LoadGossipMenu();\n \
      \   // This method is typically called internally during server startup\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically during server startup or database
    reload operations. It performs database queries to fetch all gossip menu data
    and builds internal lookup structures for fast access during NPC interactions.
    The method may be called multiple times during runtime when reloading NPC data,
    but it's primarily designed as a one-time initialization during server boot.
