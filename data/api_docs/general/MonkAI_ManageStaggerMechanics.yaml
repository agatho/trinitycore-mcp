  signature: void MonkAI::ManageStaggerMechanics()
documentation:
  brief: Manages the stagger mechanics for a monk AI, handling damage absorption and
    mitigation based on the Monk's Stagger ability.
  description: The ManageStaggerMechanics method is responsible for implementing the
    core logic of the Monk's Stagger ability within the AI system. This method evaluates
    incoming damage, applies stagger calculations to determine how much damage is
    absorbed or mitigated, and manages the visual and gameplay effects associated
    with stagger. It ensures that the monk properly utilizes their stagger resource
    to reduce incoming damage over time, which is a key component of the Monk's defensive
    gameplay loop in World of Warcraft. The method typically runs during each AI update
    cycle and interacts with the target's damage system to maintain proper stagger
    state management.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within AI update loop
    code: "void ExampleCreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        // Other AI logic...\n        monkAI->ManageStaggerMechanics();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the AI update cycle to ensure
    proper stagger state tracking. The implementation likely involves checking current
    stagger values, comparing against incoming damage, and applying appropriate mitigation
    effects. Performance is generally low as it only processes when in combat.
  warnings: Improper invocation outside of combat may lead to incorrect stagger behavior
    or resource desynchronization. Ensure this method is only called when the AI unit
    is actively engaged in combat.
