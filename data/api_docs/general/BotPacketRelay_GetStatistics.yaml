  class: BotPacketRelay
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: const RelayStatistics & BotPacketRelay::GetStatistics()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current statistics for packet relay operations within the bot
    system
  description: The GetStatistics method provides access to a structured set of metrics
    that track the performance and activity of packet relay functionality in the TrinityCore
    bot system. These statistics typically include counts of packets sent, received,
    dropped, or processed, along with timing information and error rates. The returned
    RelayStatistics object is immutable and represents a snapshot of the current state
    at the time of the call. This method is primarily used for monitoring, debugging,
    and performance analysis of bot communication within the game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a RelayStatistics structure containing detailed
    metrics about packet relay operations including sent/received counts, error statistics,
    and timing data
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Display Packet Relay Statistics
    code: 'BotPacketRelay* relay = sBotManager->GetPacketRelay();

      const RelayStatistics& stats = relay->GetStatistics();

      std::cout << "Packets sent: " << stats.packetsSent << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Errors: " << stats.errorCount << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned RelayStatistics object is a snapshot and does not update automatically.
    Subsequent calls to GetStatistics() will return updated values reflecting the
    current state of packet relay operations. The method is thread-safe as it only
    reads from internal counters without modifying them.
