  class: PositionStrategyBase
  method: GetDangerLevel
  signature: float PositionStrategyBase::GetDangerLevel(const int & pos) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the danger level associated with a specified position
    in the game world.
  description: The GetDangerLevel method computes a float value representing the perceived
    danger at a given position within the World of Warcraft environment. This value
    is typically used by AI systems to evaluate threat levels, pathfinding decisions,
    or strategic positioning. The method takes an integer parameter that likely represents
    a position identifier or index within a predefined grid or navigation system.
    The returned danger level can influence NPC behavior, combat decisions, and environmental
    awareness. The implementation may consider factors such as proximity to enemies,
    terrain features, or scripted events when determining the final danger value.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific position in the game
      world. This could correspond to a grid cell index, waypoint number, or other
      positional reference used internally by the navigation system.
  returns: A float value indicating the danger level at the specified position. Higher
    values typically represent greater danger, while lower values suggest safer areas.
    The exact scale and interpretation may vary based on implementation details and
    context-specific factors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "float danger = strategy->GetDangerLevel(42);\nif (danger > 5.0f) {\n  \
      \  // Avoid this position\n    printf(\"High danger at position %d\\n\", 42);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Danger Level for Pathfinding
    code: "int bestPosition = 0;\nfloat minDanger = FLT_MAX;\nfor (int i = 0; i <\
      \ totalPositions; ++i) {\n    float danger = strategy->GetDangerLevel(i);\n\
      \    if (danger < minDanger) {\n        minDanger = danger;\n        bestPosition\
      \ = i;\n    }\n}\n// Use bestPosition for safe path selection"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger positioning or navigation strategy
    system. The exact calculation methodology may depend on the specific subclass
    implementation and current game state. It's recommended to cache results when
    repeatedly querying the same positions to improve performance.
  warnings: The returned danger level values are context-dependent and may change
    dynamically based on combat situations, environmental events, or AI state updates.
    Always validate that the position parameter is within expected bounds to prevent
    undefined behavior.
