  method: GetBankGold
  signature: uint64 EconomyManager::GetBankGold() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total gold amount stored in the player's bank.
  description: The GetBankGold method returns the quantity of gold currently held
    in a player's bank tab. This value represents the sum of all gold items stored
    within the player's bank, which is separate from their inventory gold. The method
    provides access to the bank's gold balance without modifying it. It is commonly
    used for displaying bank gold amounts in UI elements or checking if a player has
    sufficient funds before performing transactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the total amount of gold stored in the player's
    bank. Returns 0 if the bank contains no gold.
  examples:
  - title: Displaying Bank Gold
    code: 'uint64 bankGold = economyManager->GetBankGold();

      ChatHandler ch(player);

      ch.PSendSysMessage("Your bank contains %u gold.", bankGold);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Bank Gold Before Transaction
    code: "uint64 requiredGold = 100000; // 100g\nuint64 bankGold = economyManager->GetBankGold();\n\
      if (bankGold >= requiredGold)\n{\n    // Proceed with transaction\n    economyManager->RemoveBankGold(requiredGold);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    player->SendEquipError(EQUIP_ERR_NOT_ENOUGH_MONEY);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses the player's bank gold directly from the EconomyManager
    instance, which typically interfaces with the database or in-memory storage for
    bank data. It does not perform any database operations itself but relies on cached
    data that may be updated by other methods or events.
  warnings: Be aware that this value only reflects gold stored in the bank tab and
    does not include gold in the player's inventory. If you need to check total gold
    (inventory + bank), you should combine this with GetInventoryGold().
