    it processes all active auction listings. It should not be called excessively
    in rapid succession. The method operates on the main thread and blocks until completion.
  warnings: Calling this method while the auction house system is under heavy load
    may result in noticeable lag. Avoid invoking this method from time-critical code
    paths such as player interaction handlers or frequent event callbacks.
