  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: WillManeuverBreakFormation
  signature: bool ObstacleAvoidanceManager::WillManeuverBreakFormation(const AvoidanceManeuver
    & maneuver, const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified avoidance maneuver will cause a unit to break
    from its current formation.
  description: The WillManeuverBreakFormation method evaluates if a given avoidance
    maneuver would result in a unit leaving its current formation. This is used by
    the AI system to make decisions about when to perform evasive actions versus maintaining
    group cohesion. The method considers both the nature of the avoidance maneuver
    and the group context to determine if breaking formation is necessary or advisable.
  parameters:
  - name: maneuver
    description: The AvoidanceManeuver object that describes the proposed evasion
      action, including its type, direction, and intensity.
  - name: group
    description: An integer identifier representing the group or formation that the
      unit belongs to. This determines the context for evaluating whether the maneuver
      breaks formation.
  returns: Returns true if the specified avoidance maneuver would cause the unit to
    break from its current formation; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a maneuver breaks formation
    code: "AvoidanceManeuver maneuver;\nmaneuver.type = AvoidanceType::StrafeLeft;\n\
      int groupId = 1;\nbool breaksFormation = obstacleAvoidanceManager->WillManeuverBreakFormation(maneuver,\
      \ groupId);\nif (breaksFormation)\n{\n    // Handle the case where formation\
      \ is broken\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI decision-making processes to ensure
    that units maintain tactical formations unless absolutely necessary for survival.
    The implementation may consider factors such as group size, unit positioning,
    and threat level when making this determination.
