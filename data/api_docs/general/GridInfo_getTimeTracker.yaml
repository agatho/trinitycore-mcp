  class: GridInfo
  method: getTimeTracker
  signature: const int & GridInfo::getTimeTracker() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the time tracker value associated with the grid information.
  description: The getTimeTracker method retrieves a constant reference to an integer
    representing the time tracker for the GridInfo object. This value is typically
    used to track temporal events or cooldowns within a specific grid area in the
    game world. The returned reference allows for efficient access without copying
    the underlying data, and the const qualifier ensures that the value cannot be
    modified through this interface. The method is commonly used in game logic where
    time-based operations need to be synchronized across grid boundaries.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the current time tracker
    value for this GridInfo instance. This value typically represents a timestamp
    or elapsed time in game ticks, and its interpretation depends on how it's managed
    by the surrounding system.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Grid Time Tracker
    code: "GridInfo* gridInfo = ...;\nconst int& tracker = gridInfo->getTimeTracker();\n\
      // Use tracker value for time-based logic\nif (tracker > someThreshold)\n{\n\
      \    // Perform time-based action\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to internal data managed by the GridInfo object.
    Since this is a const reference, modifications to the underlying value should
    be done through appropriate setter methods or directly on the GridInfo instance.
    This method does not perform any validation or bounds checking on the returned
    value.
