  method: Remove
  signature: void DynamicObject::Remove()
documentation:
  brief: Removes the dynamic object from the world, making it no longer visible or
    interactable.
  description: The Remove method is used to permanently remove a DynamicObject from
    the game world. This action typically occurs when a spell or effect that created
    the dynamic object has ended its duration or been explicitly canceled. The method
    ensures that the object is properly cleaned up from all relevant systems, including
    removing it from the map's object lists and notifying any associated clients.
    Once removed, the dynamic object cannot be interacted with or queried for its
    properties. This method should only be called on objects that are currently active
    in the world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Removal of Dynamic Object
    code: "DynamicObject* dynObj = player->GetDynObject(0);\nif (dynObj)\n{\n    dynObj->Remove();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on dynamic objects that have been properly
    initialized and added to the world. Calling Remove() on an already removed object
    may result in undefined behavior or crashes. The removal process is asynchronous
    and might not immediately reflect in client-side rendering.
  warnings: Never call Remove() directly on a DynamicObject without verifying it exists
    and has been added to the world. Attempting to remove an object that's already
    been removed can cause memory corruption or access violations.
