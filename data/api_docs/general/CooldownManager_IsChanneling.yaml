  signature: bool CooldownManager::IsChanneling(uint32 spellId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player is currently channeling a spell with the specified ID.
  description: The IsChanneling method determines whether a player character is currently
    engaged in channeling a spell identified by the given spell ID. This functionality
    is crucial for managing spell interactions, preventing certain actions during
    channeling, and ensuring proper game mechanics such as interrupting or canceling
    ongoing channels. The method typically checks internal cooldown tracking structures
    within the CooldownManager to verify if the specified spell is in an active channeling
    state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently channeling a spell with the specified
    ID; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if player is channeling a specific spell
    code: "if (player->GetCooldownManager()->IsChanneling(12345)) {\n    // Player\
      \ is currently channeling spell ID 12345\n    // Handle accordingly, e.g., prevent\
      \ movement or casting\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsChanneling to prevent spell interruption
    code: "if (!player->GetCooldownManager()->IsChanneling(67890)) {\n    // Allow\
      \ the player to cast a new spell\n    player->CastSpell(target, 67890);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Do not interrupt existing channel\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Cannot cast while channeling.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking of spell channels and should
    only be called on active players. It does not validate the existence or validity
    of the spell ID itself, but rather checks if it's currently in a channeling state.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only used on valid player objects to avoid
    undefined behavior. Also note that this check may not account for all edge cases
    involving multi-channeling or complex spell interactions in advanced scenarios.
