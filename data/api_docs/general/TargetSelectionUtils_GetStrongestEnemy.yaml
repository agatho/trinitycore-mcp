  class: TargetSelectionUtils
  method: GetStrongestEnemy
  signature: Unit * TargetSelectionUtils::GetStrongestEnemy(Player * bot, float maxRange)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the strongest enemy unit within the specified range for a given player
    bot.
  description: The GetStrongestEnemy method identifies and returns the most powerful
    hostile unit within a defined maximum range for a specified player bot. This function
    is typically used in AI decision-making processes to determine optimal target
    selection for combat actions. The method evaluates potential enemies based on
    factors such as threat level, health, and damage output. It considers only units
    that are within the provided maxRange parameter and are hostile towards the bot.
    The returned Unit pointer may be null if no suitable enemy is found within range.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which to find
      the strongest enemy. Must not be null.
  - name: maxRange
    description: Maximum distance in yards to search for enemies. Units beyond this
      range will be ignored.
  returns: Pointer to the Unit object representing the strongest enemy within range,
    or nullptr if no valid enemy is found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* myBot = ...;\nfloat range = 30.0f;\nUnit* strongestEnemy = TargetSelectionUtils::GetStrongestEnemy(myBot,\
      \ range);\nif (strongestEnemy)\n{\n    // Proceed with attack logic\n    myBot->Attack(strongestEnemy,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: With Error Handling
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nUnit* enemy = TargetSelectionUtils::GetStrongestEnemy(bot,\
      \ 40.0f);\nif (enemy && enemy->IsAlive())\n{\n    // Ensure enemy is valid and\
      \ alive before targeting\n    bot->CastSpell(enemy, 12345, true); // Example\
      \ spell cast\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No valid target found\n    bot->GetMotionMaster()->MoveIdle();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal AI evaluation criteria to determine 'strength'
    of enemies, which may include factors like health percentage, damage dealt, threat
    level, and unit type. The implementation may cache or precompute target lists
    for performance optimization in high-frequency usage scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter is valid and not null before calling this
    method. The method may return nullptr if no enemies are within range or if all
    enemies are invalid (e.g., dead, invisible). Avoid using the returned Unit pointer
    without checking for null to prevent potential crashes.
