  class: MovementPriorityMapper
  method: GetPriorityDescription
  signature: std::string MovementPriorityMapper::GetPriorityDescription(PlayerBotMovementPriority
    priority)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the descriptive string label for a given player bot movement priority
    level.
  description: The GetPriorityDescription method maps a PlayerBotMovementPriority
    enumeration value to its corresponding human-readable description string. This
    utility function is used within the TrinityCore AI system to provide meaningful
    labels for different movement priorities assigned to player bots. The method ensures
    that developers and users can easily understand the significance of various priority
    levels without needing to interpret raw enumeration values directly. It serves
    as a lookup mechanism for displaying or logging movement priority information
    in a user-friendly format.
  parameters:
  - name: priority
    description: The PlayerBotMovementPriority enumeration value for which to retrieve
      the descriptive label. Valid values are typically defined within the PlayerBotMovementPriority
      enum, such as PRIORITY_IDLE, PRIORITY_COMBAT, PRIORITY_FOLLOW, etc.
  returns: A std::string containing the descriptive label associated with the specified
    movement priority. Returns an empty string if the priority value is invalid or
    not recognized by the mapper.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PlayerBotMovementPriority priority = PRIORITY_COMBAT;

      std::string description = MovementPriorityMapper::GetPriorityDescription(priority);

      // description will contain something like "Combat Priority" or similar'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Priority Descriptions
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)\n{\n    PlayerBotMovementPriority priority\
      \ = static_cast<PlayerBotMovementPriority>(i);\n    std::string desc = MovementPriorityMapper::GetPriorityDescription(priority);\n\
      \    LOG_INFO(\"ai\", \"Priority {}: {}\", i, desc.empty() ? \"Unknown\" : desc);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using a lookup table or switch statement
    internally to map enumeration values to their string representations. The implementation
    should be efficient and thread-safe since it may be called frequently during AI
    processing. Developers should ensure that all valid PlayerBotMovementPriority
    values have corresponding descriptions in the mapper.
  warnings: If an invalid or undefined PlayerBotMovementPriority value is passed,
    the method will return an empty string. Ensure proper validation of input parameters
    before calling this method if empty returns are not expected.
