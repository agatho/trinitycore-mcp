documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes game object values for client update packets
  description: This method constructs the data structure used for sending update packets
    to clients, containing the object's dynamic fields and other relevant information.
    It prepares the necessary data arrays for communication with the client, ensuring
    proper synchronization of object state. The method handles the creation of the
    update mask and populates it with appropriate values based on object flags and
    target data.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an array of integers that will store the update data for
      client communication
  - name: flags
    description: Integer representing the object's flags, determining which fields
      are included in the update packet
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an array of integers containing the target values for
      the update packet, used to populate specific field values
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'GameObject* obj = new GameObject();

      int data[10];

      int flags = 0;

      const int target[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

      obj->BuildValuesCreate(data, flags, target);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore's update system to
    prepare object data for client communication. The method may be called multiple
    times during an object's lifecycle as its state changes.
  warnings: The method requires careful handling of memory allocation and should not
    be called directly without proper context, as it's part of the internal update
    packet mechanism.
