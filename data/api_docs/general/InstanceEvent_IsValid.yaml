documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the instance event is valid and properly initialized
  description: The IsValid method determines if an InstanceEvent object has been correctly
    initialized and contains valid data. This method typically verifies that internal
    state variables are within expected ranges, that required resources are allocated,
    and that the event hasn't been marked as invalid due to destruction or error conditions.
    In the context of TrinityCore's instance management system, this validation is
    crucial for ensuring that event handlers and callbacks operate on legitimate instance
    events rather than stale or corrupted data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the instance event is valid and properly initialized; returns
    false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that the event has
    been destroyed, failed initialization, or encountered an error condition that
    makes it unsafe to use.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "InstanceEvent* event = sInstanceEventMgr->GetEvent(12345);\nif (event &&\
      \ event->IsValid())\n{\n    // Safe to proceed with event operations\n    event->HandleEvent();\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Event is invalid, skip processing\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Invalid instance event encountered\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before performing any operations on an InstanceEvent
    object to prevent undefined behavior. The implementation likely involves checking
    internal flags or pointers for null values and ensuring that the event's associated
    instance data is still valid.
  warnings: Calling methods on an invalid InstanceEvent can lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior. Always validate with IsValid() before using the event object in any
    context, especially when dealing with events from external sources or asynchronous
    operations.
