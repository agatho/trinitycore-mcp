  signature: void RestorationDruid::UpdateBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Updates all active buffs and debuffs for the Restoration Druid character.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing the
    state of all buffs and debuffs currently affecting a Restoration Druid character.
    This includes checking buff expiration times, applying new buff effects, removing
    expired or invalid buffs, and ensuring that the druid's active aura states are
    properly synchronized with the game world. The method typically runs during each
    update cycle to maintain accurate status effects for the player's character. It
    handles both self-applied buffs such as Rejuvenation and Regrowth, as well as
    external buffs from other players or environmental sources.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void RestorationDruid::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    UpdateBuffs();\n    // ... continue with other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat System
    code: "void RestorationDruid::OnCombatUpdate()\n{\n    // Handle combat-related\
      \ buff management\n    if (IsInCombat())\n    {\n        UpdateBuffs();\n  \
      \      // Additional combat-specific logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the character's update cycle
    to ensure accurate buff state management. The implementation may involve checking
    multiple aura stacks, handling proc mechanics, and updating visual indicators
    for active effects. Performance considerations include minimizing unnecessary
    checks for buffs that are not currently active or relevant.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of the normal update loop may cause unexpected
    behavior with aura states or visual effects. Ensure that all buff-related logic
    is properly synchronized with the game's tick system to avoid race conditions
    or inconsistent state updates.
