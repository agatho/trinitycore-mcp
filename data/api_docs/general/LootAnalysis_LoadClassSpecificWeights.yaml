documentation:
  brief: Loads class-specific loot weight configurations for the LootAnalysis system
  description: This method initializes and loads the loot weight configurations specific
    to each player class within the LootAnalysis system. It retrieves predefined weight
    values from the database or configuration files that determine how different item
    types are prioritized when analyzing potential loot drops. The loaded weights
    influence decision-making processes during loot distribution and evaluation, particularly
    in scenarios involving multiple players or group loot systems. This method is
    typically invoked during server startup or when class-specific settings need to
    be refreshed.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LootAnalysis lootAnalysis;

      lootAnalysis.LoadClassSpecificWeights();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the database connection is established
    and configuration data is available. It may trigger database queries to fetch
    class-specific settings, so performance impact should be considered during server
    initialization.
