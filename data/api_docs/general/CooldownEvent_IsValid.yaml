documentation:
  brief: Checks if the cooldown event is valid and can be processed
  description: The IsValid method determines whether a CooldownEvent object is in
    a valid state for processing. This method typically verifies that the event has
    been properly initialized, contains valid data, and hasn't been marked as expired
    or cancelled. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, cooldown
    events are used to manage spell and ability cooldowns, and this validation ensures
    that only legitimate cooldown states are acted upon. The method may check internal
    flags, time values, or associated object references to determine validity.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the cooldown event is valid and can be processed; returns
    false if the event is invalid, expired, cancelled, or improperly initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "CooldownEvent* event = new CooldownEvent();\nif (event->IsValid()) {\n\
      \    // Process the cooldown event\n    event->Execute();\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Handle invalid event\n    delete event;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in Game Loop
    code: "void UpdateCooldownEvents() {\n    for (auto it = cooldownEvents.begin();\
      \ it != cooldownEvents.end(); ++it) {\n        if ((*it)->IsValid()) {\n   \
      \         (*it)->Update();\n        } else {\n            // Remove invalid\
      \ events from list\n            it = cooldownEvents.erase(it);\n        }\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during game updates, so performance
    is important. The implementation should avoid expensive operations and prefer
    fast flag checks or simple value comparisons. In TrinityCore, cooldown events
    are often managed in a central system that periodically validates all active events.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or already destroyed CooldownEvent
    object may lead to undefined behavior. Always ensure proper object lifecycle management
    when using this method.
