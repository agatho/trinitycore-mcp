  class: Vehicle
  method: RemovePendingEventsForPassenger
  signature: void Vehicle::RemovePendingEventsForPassenger(Unit * passenger)
documentation:
  brief: Removes all pending events associated with a specific passenger from the
    vehicle's event queue.
  description: The RemovePendingEventsForPassenger method clears any queued or scheduled
    events that are designated for a particular passenger unit within the vehicle.
    This is typically used during passenger removal or vehicle dismounting to prevent
    stale or invalid events from executing later. The method ensures that no pending
    actions, such as boarding animations or passenger-specific triggers, are left
    in the event system once a passenger has been removed from the vehicle. It operates
    on the internal event management system of the Vehicle class and does not directly
    affect the passenger's state outside of event handling.
  parameters:
  - name: passenger
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the passenger whose pending
      events should be removed. Must not be null, and the unit must currently be a
      passenger on this vehicle.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing Pending Events When Dismounting Passenger
    code: "void MyVehicle::OnPassengerDismount(Unit* passenger)\n{\n    RemovePendingEventsForPassenger(passenger);\n\
      \    // Additional dismount logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the vehicle's internal event handling system and should
    only be called when it's certain that the passenger is no longer associated with
    the vehicle. Calling this method on a non-passenger unit may lead to undefined
    behavior or performance issues due to invalid lookups.
  warnings: Ensure that the passenger pointer is valid and that the unit is indeed
    a passenger of this vehicle before calling this method. Failure to do so can result
    in memory corruption or incorrect event handling.
