  class: InterruptAwareness
  method: InterruptAwareness
  signature: void InterruptAwareness::InterruptAwareness(Player * observer)
documentation:
  brief: Notifies the player that an interrupt has occurred, updating their awareness
    state.
  description: The InterruptAwareness method is used to inform a Player object that
    an interrupt event has taken place within the game world. This typically occurs
    when a player's spell casting is interrupted by damage or other actions. The method
    updates the player's internal state to reflect this interruption, potentially
    affecting their current spell casting, combat stance, or other gameplay mechanics
    related to spell interruption. It serves as part of the core interrupt handling
    system in TrinityCore's AI and player behavior framework.
  parameters:
  - name: observer
    description: A pointer to the Player object that will be notified about the interrupt
      event. This parameter must not be null, as it represents the specific player
      whose awareness state is being updated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupt Awareness Notification
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get a valid player reference

      InterruptAwareness awareness;

      awareness.InterruptAwareness(player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during combat or spell casting scenarios
    where an interrupt might occur. It's important to ensure that the Player pointer
    passed in is valid and not null, as attempting to call this method with a null
    reference could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
  warnings: Do not call this method without ensuring the Player object is fully initialized
    and valid. Passing a null pointer will likely cause a crash or unexpected behavior
    in the game engine.
