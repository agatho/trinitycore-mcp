documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the dispel types available for a specified class in the DispelCoordinator
    system
  description: The GetClassDispelTypes method returns an integer bitmask representing
    the types of dispels that a specific class is capable of applying. This method
    is used within the TrinityCore AI system to determine which magical effects a
    bot class can remove from targets. The returned value typically corresponds to
    a combination of dispel type flags defined in the game's constants, such as magic,
    disease, poison, curse, and holy dispels. This information is crucial for AI decision-making
    when selecting appropriate spells or abilities during combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer bitmask indicating the dispel types available to the specified
    class. Each bit in the returned value represents a different dispel type (e.g.,
    magic, disease, poison, curse). The specific bit values are defined by TrinityCore's
    dispel type constants and can be combined using bitwise OR operations.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a class can dispel magic
    code: "int classDispelTypes = coordinator->GetClassDispelTypes(CLASS_MAGE);\n\
      if (classDispelTypes & DISPEL_MAGIC)\n{\n    // Mage can dispel magic effects\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine if a class can remove multiple dispel types
    code: "int classDispelTypes = coordinator->GetClassDispelTypes(CLASS_PRIEST);\n\
      if ((classDispelTypes & (DISPEL_MAGIC | DISPEL_DISEASE)) == (DISPEL_MAGIC |\
      \ DISPEL_DISEASE))\n{\n    // Priest can dispel both magic and disease\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI decision-making processes where bots
    need to determine their capability to remove debuffs from targets. The returned
    bitmask should be checked against predefined dispel type constants defined in
    the TrinityCore codebase. This method likely caches its results for performance
    reasons, as it's called frequently during AI processing.
  warnings: The return value represents a bitmask, so direct comparison with specific
    values may not work as expected. Always use bitwise operations (AND, OR) when
    checking for specific dispel types. Be aware that the exact bit positions and
    meanings of dispel types may vary between different versions of TrinityCore.
