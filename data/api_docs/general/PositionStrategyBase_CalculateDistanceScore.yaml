  class: PositionStrategyBase
  method: CalculateDistanceScore
  signature: float PositionStrategyBase::CalculateDistanceScore(const int & pos, Unit
    * target, float optimalRange) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates a distance-based score for positioning strategy relative to a
    target unit.
  description: The CalculateDistanceScore method evaluates how well a given position
    aligns with an optimal range from a target unit, returning a float score that
    represents positional desirability. This method is typically used in AI behavior
    systems to determine the most effective positioning for units such as NPCs or
    players during combat or movement decisions. The score is derived based on the
    distance between the specified position and the target's current location, normalized
    against an optimal range parameter. A higher score indicates better alignment
    with desired positioning criteria.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The index or identifier of the position being evaluated within a
      positioning strategy context. This value is used to determine which specific
      point in space is being scored for its suitability relative to the target.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that serves as the reference point for
      calculating distance. The method uses this unit's current position to compute
      how well the given position aligns with optimal range criteria.
  - name: optimalRange
    description: The desired or preferred distance from the target unit at which positioning
      is considered optimal. This value defines the ideal range for scoring purposes,
      and deviations from it will influence the returned score.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated distance-based score. Higher
    values indicate better positioning relative to the optimal range. Scores typically
    decrease as the actual distance diverges from the optimal range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "float score = strategy->CalculateDistanceScore(5, targetUnit, 10.0f);\n\
      if (score > 0.8f) {\n    // Proceed with action based on good positioning\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using distance score to select best position
    code: "float bestScore = -1.0f;\nint bestPosition = -1;\nfor (int i = 0; i < totalPositions;\
      \ ++i) {\n    float currentScore = strategy->CalculateDistanceScore(i, target,\
      \ 15.0f);\n    if (currentScore > bestScore) {\n        bestScore = currentScore;\n\
      \        bestPosition = i;\n    }\n}\n// Use bestPosition for movement or attack"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a positioning strategy system and may be used in conjunction
    with other scoring mechanisms to determine overall tactical positioning. The exact
    scoring algorithm depends on implementation details within the derived classes
    of PositionStrategyBase. It's assumed that the target unit is valid and has a
    defined position in the world.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'target' parameter is not null before calling this method,
    as dereferencing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also, be aware
    that the returned score may vary depending on implementation-specific logic for
    normalization or weighting of distance metrics.
