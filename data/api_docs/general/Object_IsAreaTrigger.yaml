documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the object is an area trigger.
  description: This method checks if the current Object instance represents an area
    trigger within the TrinityCore framework. Area triggers are special game objects
    that define regions where certain effects or events occur, such as spell effects,
    quest triggers, or other gameplay mechanics. The method returns true when the
    object is an area trigger and false otherwise. This functionality is essential
    for identifying and handling area trigger-specific behaviors in game logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the object is an area trigger, false otherwise. The return
    value indicates whether the object instance belongs to the area trigger class
    type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (obj->IsAreaTrigger()) {\n    // Handle area trigger logic\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other object type checks
    to determine the specific class of an object. Implementation relies on internal
    object type flags and may be subject to performance considerations when called
    frequently.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a primary identifier for area triggers
    without proper context, as it may return false positives or negatives depending
    on how the object was created or modified in memory.
