  class: CalendarEvent
  method: GetGuildId
  signature: int CalendarEvent::GetGuildId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the guild identifier associated with the calendar event
  description: The GetGuildId method returns the unique identifier of the guild that
    created or is associated with the calendar event. This identifier is used to determine
    which guild the event belongs to, particularly for guild-specific events such
    as guild raids, guild meetings, or other organized activities. The method provides
    access to the underlying guild data stored within the calendar event object and
    can be useful when filtering or displaying events based on guild membership. It
    is important to note that this method will return 0 if the event is not associated
    with any guild, indicating a player-created or general event rather than a guild-specific
    one.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the guild identifier (GuildId) of the calendar
    event. Returns 0 if the event is not associated with any guild.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Guild ID for Display
    code: "CalendarEvent* event = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(eventId);\nif (event)\n{\n\
      \    int guildId = event->GetGuildId();\n    if (guildId > 0)\n    {\n     \
      \   // Event is associated with a guild\n        std::cout << \"Event belongs\
      \ to Guild ID: \" << guildId << std::endl;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n       \
      \ // Event is not guild-specific\n        std::cout << \"Event is player-created\
      \ or general.\" << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses a cached value within the CalendarEvent object. It does
    not perform any database queries and should be fast to execute. The returned GuildId
    can be used to query additional guild information through other TrinityCore APIs
    such as sGuildMgr.
