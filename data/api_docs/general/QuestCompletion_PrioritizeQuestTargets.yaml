  class: QuestCompletion
  method: PrioritizeQuestTargets
  signature: void QuestCompletion::PrioritizeQuestTargets(Player * bot, const int
    & enemies)
documentation:
  brief: Prioritizes quest targets for a bot player based on enemy count.
  description: The PrioritizeQuestTargets method adjusts the target selection logic
    for a bot player during quest completion activities. It evaluates and ranks potential
    quest-related targets, such as NPCs or objects, based on the number of enemies
    present in the area. This ensures that the bot focuses on completing quests efficiently
    while managing combat priorities. The method modifies the bot's behavior to prioritize
    objectives that are both quest-relevant and safe to engage given the current enemy
    density.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will have
      its quest targets prioritized.
  - name: enemies
    description: Reference to an integer indicating the number of enemies currently
      in the bot's vicinity. Used to determine target priority and safety.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume initialized bot

      int enemyCount = 3;

      QuestCompletion::PrioritizeQuestTargets(myBot, enemyCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within AI logic for quest completion modules.
    It assumes that the bot has already been assigned a quest and is actively pursuing
    its objectives. The prioritization algorithm may vary depending on the specific
    quest type and environment.
  warnings: Ensure that the enemy count parameter accurately reflects the current
    state of the battlefield to avoid inefficient or dangerous target selection. Improper
    use might lead to bots ignoring important quest objectives.
