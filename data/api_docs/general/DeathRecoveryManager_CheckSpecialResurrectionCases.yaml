  method: CheckSpecialResurrectionCases
  signature: bool DeathRecoveryManager::CheckSpecialResurrectionCases()
documentation:
  brief: Checks for special resurrection cases and returns true if a special case
    is met.
  description: The CheckSpecialResurrectionCases method evaluates whether the current
    death scenario qualifies for any special resurrection mechanics within the TrinityCore
    framework. This includes checking for scenarios such as resurrection by specific
    NPCs, special quest-based resurrections, or other game-defined conditions that
    override standard resurrection behavior. The method typically integrates with
    the player's death state and resurrection logic to determine if a custom or special
    resurrection should be applied instead of the default one. It is generally called
    during the death processing phase before standard resurrection checks are performed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a special resurrection case is detected and handled, otherwise
    false if no special case applies and standard resurrection logic should proceed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Death Handler
    code: "if (!deathRecoveryManager.CheckSpecialResurrectionCases()) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with normal resurrection logic\n    player->ResurrectPlayer();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal death recovery system and should not
    be called directly from outside the core death handling flow. It relies on internal
    state tracking of the player's death context.
  warnings: Improper use or modification of this method may lead to incorrect resurrection
    behavior, potentially causing players to lose resurrection benefits or experience
    unexpected game state transitions.
