  class: WrongFactionAppend
  method: Append
  signature: void WrongFactionAppend::Append(WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    & param0) const
documentation:
  brief: Appends channel notification data to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    object for wrong faction players.
  description: The Append method populates a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet with data indicating that a player is attempting to join or interact with
    a channel they do not belong to based on faction restrictions. This method is
    typically used in the context of TrinityCore's channel system to enforce faction-based
    access control for different channels, such as those designated for specific factions
    like Horde or Alliance. The method modifies the provided packet object by adding
    appropriate notification data that will be sent to the client to inform them about
    the faction restriction.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A reference to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify object that
      will be populated with faction restriction notification data. This packet is
      modified in-place and contains the necessary information to notify the client
      about the wrong faction attempt.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'WrongFactionAppend append;

      WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      append.Append(notifyPacket);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's internal channel management system and
    is typically called when a player attempts to join or interact with a faction-restricted
    channel. The implementation likely checks the current player's faction against
    the channel's required faction and sets appropriate flags or data in the notification
    packet.
  warnings: This method modifies the provided WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    object in-place, so ensure that the packet is properly initialized before calling
    this method. Improper use could lead to incorrect client behavior or protocol
    violations.
