  class: WeatherScript
  method: WeatherScript
  signature: void WeatherScript::WeatherScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a WeatherScript instance with the specified name.
  description: The WeatherScript constructor initializes a new weather script instance
    with the provided name. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore framework
    to register and manage weather effects in different zones or areas of the game
    world. The name parameter serves as a unique identifier for the weather script,
    allowing the game to distinguish between various weather systems such as rain,
    snow, or storms. When called, this constructor sets up internal state tracking
    for the weather system, enabling it to be linked with specific zones and triggered
    based on game events or time conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated string that serves as the unique identifier for
      this weather script. This name is used internally by TrinityCore to reference
      and manage different weather systems within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic WeatherScript Initialization
    code: "class RainWeatherScript : public WeatherScript\n{\npublic:\n    RainWeatherScript()\
      \ : WeatherScript(\"rain\") {}\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Custom Weather Script with Unique Name
    code: "class BlizzardWeatherScript : public WeatherScript\n{\npublic:\n    BlizzardWeatherScript()\
      \ : WeatherScript(\"blizzard\") {}\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during class initialization and should
    not be invoked directly by game code. The name parameter must be a valid, non-null
    string that uniquely identifies the weather script within the TrinityCore system.
    WeatherScript instances are usually managed automatically by the core framework
    when scripts are registered through the scripting system.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor with a null or empty string as the name parameter,
    as this could lead to undefined behavior or registration failures in the weather
    system. The name should be unique across all active weather scripts to prevent
    conflicts in zone-based weather management.
