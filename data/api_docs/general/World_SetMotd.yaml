documentation:
  brief: Sets the Message of the Day (MOTD) for the world server
  description: The SetMotd method updates the Message of the Day that is displayed
    to players when they log into the game. This MOTD is typically shown in the login
    screen and can contain important announcements, server rules, or other relevant
    information for players. The method accepts a string parameter representing the
    new MOTD content and stores it within the world server's configuration. This change
    takes effect immediately for new connections and does not require a server restart.
  parameters:
  - name: motd
    description: The new Message of the Day text to be displayed to players upon login.
      This string can contain standard text and basic formatting characters, but should
      be kept within reasonable length limits for client display compatibility.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Basic MOTD
    code: World::instance()->SetMotd("Welcome to our TrinityCore server! Please read
      the rules before playing.");
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting MOTD with Line Breaks
    code: World::instance()->SetMotd("Server Update Notice:\n- Patch 1.2.3 released\n-
      New battleground added\n- Bug fixes applied");
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the in-memory MOTD value and typically persists it to
    the database or configuration file depending on the server's implementation. The
    change is immediate for new player connections but existing sessions will not
    see the updated MOTD until they reconnect.
