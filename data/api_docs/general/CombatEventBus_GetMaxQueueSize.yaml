  method: GetMaxQueueSize
  signature: uint32 CombatEventBus::GetMaxQueueSize() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the maximum queue size allowed for combat events in the CombatEventBus.
  description: The GetMaxQueueSize method returns the maximum number of combat events
    that can be queued within the CombatEventBus before it begins dropping new events.
    This value is typically set during initialization and defines the upper limit
    of event buffering capacity for combat-related actions such as damage calculations,
    spell casts, and player interactions. The method provides a read-only view of
    this configuration parameter, allowing subsystems to understand queue constraints
    and potentially adjust their behavior accordingly. This is particularly important
    in high-frequency combat scenarios where event overflow could lead to lost combat
    data or performance degradation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of combat events that can
    be queued within the CombatEventBus. This value defines the buffer capacity limit
    for combat-related events.
  examples:
  - title: Check Combat Event Queue Limit
    code: "uint32 maxQueueSize = combatEventBus->GetMaxQueueSize();\nif (maxQueueSize\
      \ < 1000)\n{\n    // Log warning about low queue capacity\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Warning: Combat event queue size is low (%u)\", maxQueueSize);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Queue Size Monitoring
    code: "void MonitorCombatEventBus()\n{\n    uint32 maxSize = sCombatEventBus->GetMaxQueueSize();\n\
      \    uint32 currentSize = sCombatEventBus->GetQueueSize();\n    float utilization\
      \ = (float)currentSize / maxSize;\n    \n    if (utilization > 0.9f)\n    {\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"High combat event queue utilization: %.2f%%\", utilization\
      \ * 100);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    returned value represents a static configuration parameter that should not change
    during runtime. The CombatEventBus may use this value to implement backpressure
    mechanisms when the queue approaches capacity.
  warnings: Calling this method repeatedly in performance-critical code paths may
    introduce unnecessary overhead. Consider caching the result if it's accessed frequently.
    Also, be aware that exceeding the maximum queue size will cause events to be dropped,
    potentially leading to incomplete combat logs or missed interactions.
