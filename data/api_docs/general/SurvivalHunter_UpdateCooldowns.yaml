  class: SurvivalHunter
  method: UpdateCooldowns
  signature: void SurvivalHunter::UpdateCooldowns(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown timers for all abilities and items used by the survival
    hunter.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method is responsible for managing and updating
    the internal cooldown tracking system for a Survival Hunter character. This method
    processes the elapsed time since the last update (passed via the 'diff' parameter)
    and decrements or resets cooldown timers for various hunter abilities, trinkets,
    and other cooldown-based items. It ensures that abilities become available again
    once their cooldown periods have expired, maintaining proper game balance and
    player progression. The method is typically called during the creature's update
    cycle to synchronize cooldown states with real-time gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the last cooldown update.
      This value determines how much time has passed and how much cooldown time should
      be reduced.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in update loop
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateCooldowns(diff))\n\
      \        return;\n    // Additional AI logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom hunter behavior
    code: "class MySurvivalHunter : public SurvivalHunter\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override\n    {\n        UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n        // Custom logic\
      \ for ability usage based on cooldown state\n        if (HasAbilityReady(SpellId::RapidFire))\n\
      \        {\n            CastSpell(SpellId::RapidFire);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI update loop and should be called regularly
    to maintain accurate cooldown states. It's important to note that this method
    does not directly cast spells or trigger abilities; it only manages the internal
    cooldown tracking state.
  warnings: Improper handling of the 'diff' parameter may lead to incorrect cooldown
    behavior, such as abilities becoming available too early or remaining on cooldown
    longer than intended. Ensure that the time delta passed is accurate and consistent
    with the game's update frequency.
