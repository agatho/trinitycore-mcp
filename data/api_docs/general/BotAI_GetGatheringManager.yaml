  class: BotAI
  method: GetGatheringManager
  signature: const GatheringManager * BotAI::GetGatheringManager() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the gathering manager instance used by the bot AI.
  description: The GetGatheringManager method provides access to the GatheringManager
    object that controls all gathering-related behaviors for the bot. This manager
    handles resource collection, mining, herbalism, and other gathering activities
    within the game world. The returned pointer is constant, meaning it should not
    be modified directly. The method ensures thread safety when accessing the gathering
    manager instance, making it safe to call from multiple threads during bot operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the GatheringManager instance associated with this BotAI
    object. Returns nullptr if no gathering manager has been initialized or if the
    bot AI is not configured for gathering activities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const GatheringManager* gatherMgr = botAI->GetGatheringManager();\nif (gatherMgr\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the gathering manager to check gathering status\n\
      \    bool isGathering = gatherMgr->IsGathering();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Gathering Information
    code: "BotAI* botAI = ...; // Assume initialized bot AI\nconst GatheringManager*\
      \ manager = botAI->GetGatheringManager();\nif (manager)\n{\n    // Get current\
      \ gathering target\n    WorldObject* target = manager->GetGatherTarget();\n\
      \    if (target)\n    {\n        // Perform gathering-related logic\n      \
      \  ChatHandler ch = ChatHandler(bot->GetSession());\n        ch.PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Currently gathering: %s\", target->GetName().c_str());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned GatheringManager pointer is valid only as long as the BotAI
    instance exists. The method does not perform any initialization of the gathering
    manager; it simply returns a reference to an already-created instance if one exists.
    This method should be called frequently during bot operation to ensure up-to-date
    gathering state information.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the returned GatheringManager object directly
    through the pointer, as it is const. If you need to change gathering behavior,
    use the appropriate methods on the BotAI class or related manager interfaces instead.
