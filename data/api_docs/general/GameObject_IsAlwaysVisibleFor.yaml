  signature: bool GameObject::IsAlwaysVisibleFor(const int * seer) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a game object is always visible to a specific player.
  description: This method checks if a game object remains visible to a specified
    player regardless of their location or distance from the object. It is commonly
    used in scenarios where objects need to be visible even when outside normal visibility
    ranges, such as in certain quest triggers or world events. The method returns
    true if the object is always visible to the player, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: seer
    description: Pointer to the player object whose visibility status is being checked.
      This parameter represents the player who may or may not see the game object.
  returns: Returns true if the game object is always visible to the specified player,
    false otherwise. The return value indicates whether the object's visibility is
    unaffected by distance or location.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'GameObject* go = ...;

      Player* player = ...;

      bool isVisible = go->IsAlwaysVisibleFor(&player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with visibility checks for game
    objects. It may be implemented using internal flags or state tracking, and should
    not be called frequently without performance considerations.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it might affect game balance
    or quest completion if used incorrectly. The parameter must not be null; otherwise,
    the behavior is undefined.
