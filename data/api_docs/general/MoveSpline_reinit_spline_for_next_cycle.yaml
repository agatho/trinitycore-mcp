  class: MoveSpline
  method: reinit_spline_for_next_cycle
  signature: void MoveSpline::reinit_spline_for_next_cycle()
documentation:
  brief: Reinitializes the movement spline for the next cycle, preparing it for subsequent
    path updates.
  description: The reinit_spline_for_next_cycle method resets and prepares a MoveSpline
    object for reuse in the next movement cycle. This typically occurs after a spline
    has completed its current path traversal or when transitioning between different
    movement states. The method ensures that internal state variables are properly
    reset, allowing the spline to be reused without memory leaks or inconsistent behavior.
    It is commonly invoked during dynamic pathfinding updates where an NPC or player's
    movement needs to be recalculated and restarted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in movement update
    code: "void UpdateMovement()\n{\n    if (m_spline->isFinished())\n    {\n    \
      \    m_spline->reinit_spline_for_next_cycle();\n        // Recalculate new path\
      \ here\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the spline is in a finished state
    or when explicitly required to reset its internal state. It's important to ensure
    that no references to the spline remain active before calling this method, as
    it may invalidate previous path data.
  warnings: Calling reinit_spline_for_next_cycle while the spline is actively processing
    movement can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify the spline's
    completion status before invoking this method.
