  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::UseDefensiveCooldowns()
documentation:
  brief: Uses defensive cooldowns for the AI-controlled unit based on current threat
    and health conditions.
  description: The UseDefensiveCooldowns method evaluates the current state of the
    AI-controlled unit, including its health percentage, threat level from nearby
    enemies, and available defensive abilities. It determines whether to activate
    defensive cooldowns such as defensive stance, healing abilities, or damage reduction
    mechanics. This method is typically called during the AI's decision-making cycle
    to ensure optimal use of defensive resources when the unit is under attack or
    in high-risk situations. The behavior may vary depending on the specific class
    and specialization of the unit.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void CustomAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    m_behaviorManager.UseDefensiveCooldowns();\n    // ... rest of AI logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the unit is in combat or has active
    threat. It's recommended to call this method after checking for immediate threats
    but before executing offensive actions. The implementation may include cooldown
    timers and health thresholds that are specific to the unit's class.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of combat or without proper threat assessment
    may result in unnecessary resource expenditure. Ensure that the AI unit has valid
    target information before invoking this function to avoid incorrect cooldown usage.
