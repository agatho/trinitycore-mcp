  class: GroupFormation
  method: AddMember
  signature: void GroupFormation::AddMember(uint32 memberGuid, const int & preferredPosition)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a member to the group formation with a preferred position.
  description: The AddMember method integrates a new player into the group formation
    system by assigning them a specific position based on their preferred location.
    This method is typically used during group creation or when players join an existing
    group to ensure proper positioning within the formation. The preferredPosition
    parameter allows for strategic placement of members, which can be crucial for
    gameplay mechanics such as tanking, healing, or damage dealing roles. The method
    does not return any value but modifies the internal state of the GroupFormation
    object to include the new member.
  parameters:
  - name: memberGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player being added to the group
      formation. This must be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  - name: preferredPosition
    description: The desired position for the member within the group formation. This
      value typically represents an index or coordinate in the formation structure,
      with negative values possibly indicating automatic positioning or invalid states.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of AddMember
    code: 'GroupFormation formation;

      uint32 playerGuid = 12345;

      int preferredPos = 2;

      formation.AddMember(playerGuid, preferredPos);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding multiple members with different positions
    code: 'GroupFormation formation;

      formation.AddMember(1001, 0);

      formation.AddMember(1002, 1);

      formation.AddMember(1003, 2);

      formation.AddMember(1004, -1); // Auto-positioning'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GroupFormation object is properly initialized
    and ready to accept members. It's recommended to validate the memberGuid before
    calling this method to avoid potential errors. The preferredPosition parameter
    may be clamped or adjusted internally depending on the formation size and existing
    member positions.
  warnings: Calling AddMember with an invalid GUID (e.g., zero or non-existent player)
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all members are valid players
    before adding them to a formation. Also, repeated calls with the same GUID may
    result in duplicate entries unless handled by the implementation.
