documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the LfgWaitTime class with default values.
  description: The LfgWaitTime constructor initializes a new instance of the LfgWaitTime
    class, setting up internal state variables to their default values. This class
    is typically used within the TrinityCore framework to manage waiting times for
    players in Looking For Group (LFG) queues. The initialization ensures that all
    member variables are properly set before any operations are performed on the object.
    It does not perform any complex logic or external operations, serving purely as
    a setup mechanism for the class instance.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new LfgWaitTime instance
    code: 'LfgWaitTime waitTime;

      // Initializes a new LfgWaitTime object with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a default constructor, so no parameters are required. The class likely
    contains member variables that track waiting times and queue states, which are
    initialized to zero or null values upon construction.
