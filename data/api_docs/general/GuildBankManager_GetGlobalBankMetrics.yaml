documentation:
  brief: Retrieves global bank metrics for the guild bank system
  description: The GetGlobalBankMetrics method returns a BankMetrics structure containing
    comprehensive statistics and usage data for the guild bank across all realms.
    This includes information such as total items stored, gold deposited, transaction
    counts, and storage utilization rates. The method aggregates data from all active
    guild banks in the server environment to provide an overview of guild banking
    activity. It is typically used for administrative purposes, monitoring system
    performance, or generating reports on guild resource management.
  parameters: []
  returns: A BankMetrics object containing aggregated statistics about guild bank
    usage including item counts, gold amounts, transaction data, and storage metrics
    across all guild banks in the server.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BankMetrics metrics = guildBankManager->GetGlobalBankMetrics();

      uint32 totalItems = metrics.totalItems;

      uint64 totalGold = metrics.totalGold;

      uint32 transactionCount = metrics.transactionCount;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Guild Bank Activity
    code: "BankMetrics globalMetrics = guildBankManager->GetGlobalBankMetrics();\n\
      std::cout << \"Total Items: \" << globalMetrics.totalItems << std::endl;\nstd::cout\
      \ << \"Total Gold: \" << globalMetrics.totalGold << std::endl;\nstd::cout <<\
      \ \"Transactions: \" << globalMetrics.transactionCount << std::endl;\nif (globalMetrics.storageUtilization\
      \ > 0.9f) {\n    // Alert: Storage nearly full\n    sLog->outString(\"Warning:\
      \ Guild bank storage utilization at %f%%\", globalMetrics.storageUtilization\
      \ * 100);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs aggregation across all guild banks in the server, which
    may involve database queries or cached data retrieval. The returned metrics are
    typically updated periodically rather than real-time to optimize performance.
    Developers should be aware that the BankMetrics structure may contain additional
    fields beyond those explicitly documented.
  warnings: The method may return stale data if the internal cache has not been refreshed
    recently. In high-traffic environments, calling this method too frequently could
    impact server performance due to aggregation overhead. The returned metrics should
    not be used for real-time transaction validation or immediate decision making.
