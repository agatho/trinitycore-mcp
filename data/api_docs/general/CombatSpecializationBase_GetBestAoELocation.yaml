  signature: int CombatSpecializationBase::GetBestAoELocation(float radius) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal area-of-effect location within a specified
    radius for combat specialization usage.
  description: The GetBestAoELocation method determines the most advantageous position
    within a given radius for casting area-of-effect abilities or spells. This method
    is typically used in AI decision-making processes to maximize damage output or
    utility while considering environmental constraints and target positioning. The
    returned value represents a location identifier that can be used to guide spell
    placement or movement decisions. The implementation likely evaluates factors such
    as enemy density, terrain, and spell range to determine the best strategic point
    for area control.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the index or identifier of the optimal area-of-effect
    location within the specified radius. A negative value may indicate failure or
    no suitable location was found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int bestLocation = combatSpec->GetBestAoELocation(10.0f);\nif (bestLocation\
      \ >= 0) {\n    // Proceed with using the calculated AoE location\n    printf(\"\
      Best AoE location index: %d\\n\", bestLocation);\n} else {\n    // No valid\
      \ location found\n    printf(\"No suitable AoE location available\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely performance-sensitive and may involve complex spatial
    calculations. It's recommended to cache results when possible, especially in high-frequency
    AI decision loops. The exact algorithm for determining the 'best' location might
    vary based on combat specialization type and current game state.
  warnings: The method may return negative values indicating failure or no valid location.
    Always check the return value before using it in gameplay logic to avoid undefined
    behavior. This method should not be called during critical sections of AI processing
    due to potential computational overhead.
