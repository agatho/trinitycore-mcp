  class: IBotResourceMonitor
  method: RecordCpuTime
  signature: void IBotResourceMonitor::RecordCpuTime(uint64 microseconds)
documentation:
  brief: Records CPU time usage in microseconds for bot resource monitoring.
  description: The RecordCpuTime method logs the amount of CPU time consumed by a
    bot operation in microseconds. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore
    framework's AI system to track performance metrics and resource utilization of
    automated player characters (bots). It allows developers to monitor how much processing
    power individual bots are consuming, which is crucial for maintaining server performance
    and identifying potential bottlenecks in bot behavior. The recorded data can be
    used for profiling, optimization, and ensuring that bot operations do not excessively
    impact the game server's overall performance.
  parameters:
  - name: microseconds
    description: The CPU time consumed by a bot operation, measured in microseconds.
      This value represents the actual processor time spent executing the bot's logic
      or specific actions during a given period.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint64 cpuTime = 15000; // 15 milliseconds in microseconds

      botMonitor->RecordCpuTime(cpuTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Profiling Example
    code: 'auto startTime = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      // Bot AI logic here

      auto endTime = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      uint64 elapsedMicroseconds = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(endTime
      - startTime).count();

      botMonitor->RecordCpuTime(elapsedMicroseconds);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the IBotResourceMonitor interface and should be called
    periodically to maintain accurate CPU usage statistics. The recorded values are
    typically aggregated over time to provide insights into bot performance trends.
    Implementation may involve thread-safe operations if multiple bots are recording
    CPU times concurrently.
  warnings: Ensure that the microseconds parameter represents actual CPU time rather
    than wall-clock time, as incorrect measurements can lead to misleading performance
    data. Avoid calling this method too frequently in tight loops, as it may introduce
    unnecessary overhead.
