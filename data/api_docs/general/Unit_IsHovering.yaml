  class: Unit
  method: IsHovering
  signature: bool Unit::IsHovering() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is currently hovering in the air.
  description: This method checks if a unit (such as a player or creature) is currently
    in a hovering state, which typically occurs when the unit is suspended in mid-air
    without being on the ground. The method returns true if the unit is hovering and
    false otherwise. This functionality is commonly used in game mechanics related
    to flight paths, movement states, and certain special abilities that allow units
    to hover above ground level. It is particularly relevant for players who are using
    flight paths or have abilities that enable them to hover.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is currently hovering in mid-air, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the unit's movement state is in a hovering condition rather
    than standing on the ground or moving on the ground.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsHovering()) {\n    // Do something\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking hover state in a movement context
    code: "bool isHovering = unit->IsHovering();\nif (isHovering) {\n    // Unit is\
      \ hovering, so it's not on ground\n}\nelse {\n    // Unit is on ground or moving\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related
    methods to determine the current state of a unit. It may be affected by various
    game mechanics such as flight paths, abilities, or environmental conditions that
    allow units to hover. Performance considerations are minimal since this is a simple
    boolean check.
  warnings: This method does not account for all possible hovering states; it only
    checks for basic hovering behavior. Some units might have additional movement
    states that could affect this result, such as being in a state of flight or using
    specific abilities that allow hovering.
