  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: PreferAOE
  signature: bool AdaptiveBehaviorManager::PreferAOE() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the adaptive behavior manager prefers using area-of-effect
    abilities.
  description: The PreferAOE method evaluates the current combat situation and returns
    true if the adaptive behavior manager determines that area-of-effect abilities
    should be prioritized over single-target abilities. This decision is typically
    based on factors such as enemy density, available mana, spell cooldowns, and overall
    tactical context within the AI's decision-making framework. The method does not
    modify any internal state but provides a read-only assessment of the preferred
    combat strategy.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the adaptive behavior manager prefers area-of-effect abilities
    in the current situation; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check AOE preference
    code: "if (adaptiveBehaviorManager.PreferAOE()) {\n    // Execute AOE spell\n\
      \    unit->CastSpell(target, AOE_SPELL_ID, true);\n} else {\n    // Execute\
      \ single-target spell\n    unit->CastSpell(target, SINGLE_TARGET_SPELL_ID, true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI decision-making cycles to dynamically
    adjust spell selection based on real-time combat conditions. The implementation
    may consider factors like number of nearby enemies, threat levels, and resource
    availability.
