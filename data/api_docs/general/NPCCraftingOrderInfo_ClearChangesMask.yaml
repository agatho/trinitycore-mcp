  signature: void NPCCraftingOrderInfo::ClearChangesMask()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the NPC crafting order info object.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask flag within
    the NPCCraftingOrderInfo class. This operation typically indicates that any previously
    tracked modifications to the crafting order have been acknowledged or committed,
    effectively clearing the 'dirty' state of the object. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, this method is likely used to manage synchronization
    between server-side crafting data and client updates, ensuring that changes are
    properly tracked and communicated when needed. The method performs no operations
    on external systems or data structures beyond resetting its internal mask.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'NPCCraftingOrderInfo orderInfo;

      orderInfo.ClearChangesMask();

      // The changes mask is now cleared, indicating no pending modifications.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after applying or acknowledging changes to ensure
    proper state management. It's typically used in conjunction with other methods
    that set or check the changes mask to maintain data consistency in crafting order
    handling.
