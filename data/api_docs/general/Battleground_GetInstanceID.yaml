  class: Battleground
  method: GetInstanceID
  signature: int Battleground::GetInstanceID() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the instance identifier associated with the battleground.
  description: The GetInstanceID method returns the unique instance identifier for
    the battleground. In TrinityCore, battlegrounds are managed through instances,
    and each battleground instance has a distinct ID that helps differentiate between
    multiple active battlegrounds. This identifier is crucial for managing player
    entries, tracking game state, and ensuring proper synchronization of battleground-related
    data. The method is typically used internally by the core system to identify which
    specific battleground instance a player is participating in.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the instance ID of the battleground. A value of
    0 typically indicates that the battleground has not been assigned an instance
    yet, or the instance has been destroyed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Instance ID
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);\nif (bg)\n\
      {\n    int instanceId = bg->GetInstanceID();\n    if (instanceId > 0)\n    {\n\
      \        // Process the battleground with valid instance ID\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Battleground instance ID: %d\", instanceId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The instance ID returned by this method is assigned when the battleground
    is created and remains constant during the lifetime of that battleground instance.
    It's important to note that this ID is not the same as a player's GUID or a battleground
    template ID.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-zero return value always means the battleground
    is active. The instance ID may be assigned even before the battleground officially
    starts, and it might persist after the battleground ends if cleanup hasn't occurred
    yet.
