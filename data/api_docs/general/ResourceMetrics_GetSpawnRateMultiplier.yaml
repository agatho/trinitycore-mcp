  method: GetSpawnRateMultiplier
  signature: float ResourceMetrics::GetSpawnRateMultiplier() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current spawn rate multiplier applied to resource generation
    in the game world.
  description: The GetSpawnRateMultiplier method retrieves the float value representing
    how much the base spawn rate of resources has been modified by various game mechanics,
    such as difficulty settings, world events, or player activity. This multiplier
    is used internally by the TrinityCore server to scale the frequency at which resources
    (like ore veins, herb nodes, etc.) respawn in the game world. The returned value
    typically ranges from 0.0f upwards, where 1.0f represents normal spawn rates,
    values less than 1.0f reduce spawn rates, and values greater than 1.0f increase
    them. This method is read-only and does not modify any internal state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current resource spawn rate multiplier.
    A value of 1.0f indicates normal spawn rates; values below 1.0f decrease spawn
    frequency, while values above 1.0f increase it. The method will always return
    a non-negative value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float spawnRate = resourceMetrics.GetSpawnRateMultiplier();\nif (spawnRate\
      \ > 1.0f)\n{\n    // Resources are spawning faster than normal\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Enhanced spawn rate active: %.2f\", spawnRate);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Resource Generation Logic
    code: "ResourceMetrics* metrics = sObjectMgr->GetResourceMetrics();\nfloat multiplier\
      \ = metrics->GetSpawnRateMultiplier();\nif (multiplier < 0.5f)\n{\n    // Very\
      \ low spawn rate - might indicate a special event or difficulty\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Low resource spawn rate detected: %.2f\", multiplier);\n}\nelse if (multiplier\
      \ > 2.0f)\n{\n    // High spawn rate - possibly during a holiday event\n   \
      \ sLog->outString(\"High resource spawn rate active: %.2f\", multiplier);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ResourceMetrics class which tracks various game
    metrics related to resource generation. It's commonly used in conjunction with
    other methods like GetSpawnRateModifier() or GetResourceSpawnTimer(). The value
    returned may be influenced by server configuration settings, active world events,
    and player count in certain scenarios.
  warnings: This method returns a cached value that might not reflect real-time changes
    if the spawn rate is dynamically modified during runtime without explicit updates
    to the ResourceMetrics object. Ensure any logic depending on this value accounts
    for potential staleness if the game state changes frequently.
