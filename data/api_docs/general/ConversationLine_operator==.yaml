  class: ConversationLine
  method: operator==
  signature: bool ConversationLine::operator==(const ConversationLine & right) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two ConversationLine objects for equality based on their internal
    data members.
  description: The operator== method performs a member-wise comparison between this
    ConversationLine object and another ConversationLine object provided as a parameter.
    It evaluates whether both objects contain identical data, typically used to determine
    if two conversation lines are the same in terms of their content, timing, or associated
    data. This is particularly useful when managing dialogue sequences or checking
    for duplicate entries within conversation systems. The comparison considers all
    relevant fields that define a conversation line's identity, ensuring accurate
    equality checks in game logic involving NPC dialogues and quest conversations.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: A constant reference to another ConversationLine object that this
      instance will be compared against for equality.
  returns: Returns true if all corresponding data members of both ConversationLine
    objects are equal; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Equality Check
    code: 'ConversationLine line1;

      ConversationLine line2;

      bool isEqual = (line1 == line2); // Returns true if both lines have identical
      data'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Dialogue Management
    code: 'std::vector<ConversationLine> conversationLines;

      ConversationLine currentLine;


      // Check if current line already exists in the conversation

      bool exists = std::find(conversationLines.begin(), conversationLines.end(),
      currentLine) != conversationLines.end();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented using a direct member-wise comparison.
    Developers should ensure that all data members of ConversationLine are properly
    comparable for accurate results. The method is const and does not modify either
    object.
  warnings: Be cautious when comparing objects with floating-point values; slight
    differences in precision might cause unexpected inequality results even if the
    values appear equal.
