  signature: bool GroupCoordinator::QueueForRaid(uint32 raidId)
documentation:
  brief: Queues a group for a specific raid instance and returns true if successful.
  description: The QueueForRaid method attempts to register the current group with
    a specified raid instance in the World of Warcraft server's grouping system. This
    method is typically used during dungeon or raid queueing processes where players
    form groups and request entry into a particular raid instance. The method checks
    if the group meets the requirements for joining the raid, such as level restrictions,
    item level requirements, and group composition rules. It returns true upon successful
    queuing, or false if the group cannot be added to the raid due to various constraints
    like invalid raid ID, insufficient group members, or existing queue conflicts.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group was successfully queued for the specified raid
    instance; otherwise returns false if the queuing process failed due to invalid
    parameters, group restrictions, or other constraint violations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Raid Queueing
    code: "GroupCoordinator* coordinator = sGroupCoordinator->GetGroupCoordinator();\n\
      if (coordinator->QueueForRaid(1234)) {\n    // Group successfully queued for\
      \ raid with ID 1234\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_RAID_QUEUE_SUCCESS);\n}\
      \ else {\n    // Failed to queue group\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_RAID_QUEUE_FAILED);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's group management system and should
    only be called when a group has been properly formed. The raidId parameter must
    correspond to an existing raid instance in the server's configuration. This method
    may perform internal checks for group leader permissions, player eligibility,
    and raid availability before attempting to queue.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the group is valid or that
    the raid ID exists can result in silent failures. The method does not validate
    whether players have already queued for another raid; it's up to the calling code
    to manage such scenarios. Improper use may lead to inconsistent group states or
    queueing errors.
