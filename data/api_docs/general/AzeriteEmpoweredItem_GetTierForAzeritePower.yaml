  class: AzeriteEmpoweredItem
  method: GetTierForAzeritePower
  signature: int AzeriteEmpoweredItem::GetTierForAzeritePower(int playerClass, int
    azeritePowerId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the tier level associated with a specified Azerite power for a
    given player class.
  description: The GetTierForAzeritePower method determines the tier level of an Azerite
    power based on the provided player class and Azerite power ID. This function is
    used within the Azerite system to identify which tier of Azerite abilities a specific
    power belongs to, enabling proper gameplay mechanics such as power progression
    and itemization. The method likely accesses internal data structures that map
    Azerite powers to their respective tiers for each class. It's important to note
    that this method operates on the assumption that valid player class and Azerite
    power ID values are provided, as invalid inputs may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect tier assignments.
  parameters:
  - name: playerClass
    description: The numeric identifier representing the player's class (e.g., CLASS_WARRIOR
      = 1, CLASS_MAGE = 8). Must be a valid class constant from the TrinityCore API.
  - name: azeritePowerId
    description: The unique identifier for the Azerite power being queried. This ID
      corresponds to specific abilities within the Azerite system and must represent
      a valid power defined in the game's data files.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the tier level of the specified Azerite
    power for the given player class. The tier value typically indicates progression
    level (e.g., 1-5) or a specific category within the Azerite system. Returns -1
    if either parameter is invalid or if the power does not exist for that class.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int tier = azeriteItem->GetTierForAzeritePower(CLASS_WARRIOR, 12345); //
      Gets tier for a specific warrior Azerite power
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling Example
    code: int tier = azeriteItem->GetTierForAzeritePower(CLASS_ROGUE, 99999); // Returns
      -1 if power ID doesn't exist for rogue class
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal lookup tables or databases that map
    Azerite powers to their corresponding tiers per class. Developers should ensure
    that the provided player class and azeritePowerId are valid before calling this
    function to avoid unexpected results. The implementation may involve accessing
    cached data structures for performance reasons.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid playerClass or azeritePowerId values
    can lead to undefined behavior or incorrect tier assignments. Always validate
    input parameters when using this method in production code.
