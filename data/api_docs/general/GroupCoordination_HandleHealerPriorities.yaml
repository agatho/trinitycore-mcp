  brief: Updates and synchronizes healer priority assignments within the group coordination
    system.
  description: The HandleHealerPriorities method manages the assignment and updating
    of healer roles within a group coordination framework. This method is responsible
    for determining which group members are designated as healers, ensuring proper
    distribution of healing responsibilities, and maintaining synchronization of healer
    priorities across all group members. It typically operates in response to changes
    in group composition, player availability, or raid configuration settings. The
    method may also handle priority adjustments based on player roles, gear, or performance
    metrics to optimize healing efficiency during encounters.

      }"

  notes: This method likely interacts with internal group state tracking and may trigger
    additional synchronization events. It should be called whenever group composition
    or player roles change to maintain accurate healer prioritization.
