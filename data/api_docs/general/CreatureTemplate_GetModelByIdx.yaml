documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the creature model data for a specific index from the creature
    template.
  description: The GetModelByIdx method retrieves a pointer to the CreatureModel structure
    associated with a given index within the creature template. This method is typically
    used when accessing specific model information for a creature, such as its display
    ID or model-related properties. The index parameter corresponds to an entry in
    the creature's model data array, which may contain multiple models for different
    states or variants of the creature. The returned pointer is const, indicating
    that the model data should not be modified through this interface. This method
    assumes valid indexing and will return a null pointer if the index is out of bounds
    or if no model data exists for that index.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the CreatureModel structure at the specified index,
    or nullptr if the index is invalid or no model data exists for that index.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing a creature's model by index
    code: "CreatureTemplate* template = sObjectMgr->GetCreatureTemplate(12345);\n\
      const CreatureModel* model = template->GetModelByIdx(0);\nif (model)\n{\n  \
      \  // Use model data\n    uint32 displayId = model->DisplayID;\n    // Process\
      \ display ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the creature template system in TrinityCore and should
    be used carefully with proper bounds checking. The index parameter must be validated
    before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior. The returned CreatureModel
    pointer is read-only and should not be modified directly.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid index may result in a null pointer
    being returned. Always check for null before using the returned pointer to prevent
    crashes or undefined behavior. This method does not perform any bounds checking
    internally, so callers must ensure valid indices are provided.
