  method: IsBox
  signature: bool AreaTriggerShapeInfo::IsBox() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the area trigger shape is a box.
  description: The IsBox method checks if the current AreaTriggerShapeInfo object
    represents a box-shaped area trigger. This method is used in TrinityCore's area
    trigger system to identify the geometric shape of triggers, which affects how
    they interact with players and game objects. The result of this check is typically
    used during trigger activation logic to determine appropriate collision detection
    and effect application behaviors. This method does not modify any internal state
    and is purely a query operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the area trigger shape is a box, false otherwise. This
    indicates whether the underlying shape data represents a rectangular prism or
    cuboid geometry.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Trigger Logic
    code: "if (areaTrigger->GetShapeInfo()->IsBox()) {\n    // Apply box-specific\
      \ logic\n    HandleBoxAreaTriggerEffects(player);\n} else {\n    // Handle other\
      \ shape types\n    HandleGenericAreaTriggerEffects(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Area Trigger Behavior
    code: "void AreaTriggerHandler::ProcessAreaTrigger(AreaTrigger* trigger) {\n \
      \   auto shapeInfo = trigger->GetShapeInfo();\n    if (shapeInfo->IsBox()) {\n\
      \        // Box triggers use different collision detection\n        ApplyBoxCollisionRules(trigger);\n\
      \    } else if (shapeInfo->IsSphere()) {\n        // Sphere triggers use radial\
      \ collision\n        ApplyRadialCollisionRules(trigger);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the area trigger shape abstraction system in TrinityCore.
    The implementation likely checks internal flags or shape parameters to determine
    if the current shape is defined as a box. It's commonly used in conjunction with
    other shape checking methods like IsSphere() for polymorphic behavior handling.
  warnings: Ensure that the AreaTriggerShapeInfo object is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as accessing uninitialized shape data could lead to undefined
    behavior. The method assumes valid internal state and does not perform null checks
    on its own.
