  brief: Resets all bot statistics to their default values.
  description: The ResetStatistics method clears and resets all accumulated statistics
    for bot characters within the TrinityCore instance. This includes kill counts,
    death counts, quest completions, and other performance metrics that are tracked
    per bot. The method ensures a clean slate for bots, typically used when administrators
    want to reset tracking data or during server maintenance periods. It does not
    affect the bot's core behavior or configuration, only the statistical records
    associated with each bot character.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  notes: This method operates on all active bots within the server's memory and may
    have performance implications if a large number of bots are present. It should
    be used judiciously during high-traffic periods.
  warnings: Invoking this method will permanently delete all historical statistics
    for bots, which cannot be recovered. Ensure that any important data has been backed
    up before execution.
