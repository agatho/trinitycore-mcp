documentation:
  brief: Records that a player has interacted with a creature by its entry ID and
    GUID
  description: This method is used to mark a player's interaction with a specific
    creature in the game world. It typically records the creature's entry ID and GUID
    when the player talks to or interacts with the creature, allowing the game to
    track which creatures have been interacted with by the player. The method is commonly
    used in quest systems and NPC interaction handling to ensure proper tracking of
    player-creature interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The creature entry ID (unique identifier) of the NPC being interacted
      with
  - name: guid
    description: The GUID of the creature being interacted with, used to uniquely
      identify the specific instance of the creature
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      uint32 entry = 12345;

      int guid = 67890;

      player->TalkedToCreature(entry, guid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore's quest system and
    NPC interaction handling. It may be called automatically when a player interacts
    with a creature through dialogue or other means. The method does not directly
    perform any action but rather records the interaction for tracking purposes.
  warnings: This method should only be called when a player actually interacts with
    a creature, otherwise it may cause incorrect tracking of quest progress or NPC
    interactions. It's important to ensure that the entry and guid parameters are
    valid before calling this method.
