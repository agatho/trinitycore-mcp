documentation:
  brief: Moves an AreaTriggerAI object by transferring its resources from a temporary
    to a target instance.
  description: The move assignment operator for AreaTriggerAI transfers all resources
    owned by the source AreaTriggerAI object (passed as an rvalue reference) to the
    current object. This operation is typically used when assigning one AreaTriggerAI
    instance to another, effectively moving the internal state and data without performing
    a deep copy. The method ensures that the source object is left in a valid but
    unspecified state after the move. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this
    operator allows efficient handling of AreaTriggerAI objects during dynamic creation,
    destruction, or reassignment within the game world's trigger systems.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to another AreaTriggerAI object whose resources
      will be moved to this instance. This parameter is typically used in temporary
      or temporary-like objects during assignment operations.
  returns: A reference to the current AreaTriggerAI object after the move assignment
    has been completed, enabling chained assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'AreaTriggerAI target;

      AreaTriggerAI source = CreateSomeAreaTriggerAI();

      target = std::move(source); // Moves resources from source to target'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in AI Context
    code: "class MyAreaTrigger : public AreaTriggerAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (someCondition)\n            *this = std::move(CreateNewAI());\
      \ // Efficiently replace current AI\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is part of the C++ move semantics implementation and should
    be used carefully to avoid dangling references or undefined behavior. The source
    object after a move operation may have an unspecified but valid state, and further
    use of it should be avoided unless explicitly documented otherwise.
  warnings: Using this operator on an already moved-from object can lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the source object is not used after being moved from, especially
    if it holds resources like memory or file handles.
