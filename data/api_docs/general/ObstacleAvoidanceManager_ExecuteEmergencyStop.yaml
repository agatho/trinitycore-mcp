  signature: void ObstacleAvoidanceManager::ExecuteEmergencyStop()
documentation:
  brief: Immediately halts all movement and obstacle avoidance behaviors for the associated
    unit.
  description: The ExecuteEmergencyStop method is designed to forcefully interrupt
    any ongoing movement or obstacle avoidance routines for a unit managed by the
    ObstacleAvoidanceManager. This function typically serves as a safety mechanism
    to prevent collisions or unwanted behavior when an unexpected event occurs, such
    as a sudden change in environment or an emergency condition. It ensures that the
    unit ceases all motion immediately and resets its internal state related to pathfinding
    and avoidance logic. The method is commonly invoked during critical game events
    where immediate stopping is required to maintain game stability and prevent exploits.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Emergency Stop Usage
    code: 'ObstacleAvoidanceManager* manager = unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetOrAddMotionMaster()->GetObstacleAvoidanceManager();

      manager->ExecuteEmergencyStop();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the unit is in a state where immediate
    stopping is necessary. It may reset the unit's movement flags and clear any pending
    waypoints or avoidance paths. The function does not perform any checks for whether
    the unit is currently moving; it simply forces an immediate halt.
  warnings: Calling ExecuteEmergencyStop while the unit is in a critical combat state
    or during complex AI behavior sequences might lead to unexpected movement artifacts
    or AI state corruption if not properly synchronized with other motion control
    systems.
