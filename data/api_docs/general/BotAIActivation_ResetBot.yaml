  method: ResetBot
  signature: void BotAIActivation::ResetBot(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the specified bot's AI state and behavior to its initial configuration.
  description: The ResetBot method in the BotAIActivation class is responsible for
    reverting a bot's artificial intelligence state back to its default settings.
    This includes clearing any active AI decisions, resetting behavior flags, and
    restoring the bot to its original configuration as defined during initialization.
    The method ensures that the bot can be reactivated with clean state without carrying
    over previous AI decisions or temporary modifications. It is typically used when
    a bot needs to be restarted or reinitialized after an error, or when transitioning
    between different gameplay scenarios where fresh AI behavior is required.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the integer identifier of the bot to be reset. This parameter
      must point to a valid bot ID that has been previously registered with the AI
      system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Reset Usage
    code: 'int botId = 12345;

      BotAIActivation aiActivation;

      aiActivation.ResetBot(&botId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset Multiple Bots in Loop
    code: "std::vector<int> botIds = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nBotAIActivation aiActivation;\n\
      for (int& id : botIds) {\n    aiActivation.ResetBot(&id);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot ID provided is valid and corresponds to
    an active bot within the AI system. The reset operation does not destroy the bot
    object itself, but rather resets its internal AI state. It's recommended to ensure
    that no active AI processes are running on the target bot before calling this
    method to prevent race conditions.
  warnings: Calling ResetBot on a non-existent or unregistered bot ID may result in
    undefined behavior or system errors. Always validate the bot ID before invoking
    this method. Additionally, resetting a bot during active gameplay may cause temporary
    disruption in AI behavior until the reset is fully processed.
