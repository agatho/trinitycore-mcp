  class: BotProfiler
  method: IntegrateLoadTester
  signature: void BotProfiler::IntegrateLoadTester()
documentation:
  brief: Integrates a load testing component into the bot profiler for performance
    analysis.
  description: The IntegrateLoadTester method initializes and configures a load testing
    framework within the BotProfiler class. This functionality allows developers to
    simulate various bot behaviors under different load conditions, enabling performance
    benchmarking and optimization of AI-driven bots in World of Warcraft environments.
    The method sets up necessary hooks and data structures required for collecting
    profiling metrics during simulated bot operations. It typically prepares the profiler
    to capture detailed statistics about resource usage, execution time, and system
    responsiveness when bots are subjected to stress testing scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Integration Usage
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      profiler.IntegrateLoadTester();

      // Profiler is now ready for load testing scenarios'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initiating any load testing procedures.
    The integration process may involve setting up background threads or registering
    callbacks with the TrinityCore framework. Ensure that the environment has sufficient
    resources allocated for concurrent bot simulations.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without proper initialization can lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. Avoid calling this method multiple times in succession
    without proper cleanup between sessions.
