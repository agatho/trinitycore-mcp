  method: IsAlliance
  signature: bool CurrencyTypesEntry::IsAlliance() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the currency type is associated with the Alliance faction.
  description: The IsAlliance method checks if the currency represented by this CurrencyTypesEntry
    instance is specifically tied to the Alliance faction in World of Warcraft. This
    is useful for determining faction-specific rewards, currencies, or items that
    are only available or applicable to players of the Alliance side. The method evaluates
    internal faction flags or identifiers within the currency entry to make this determination.
    It does not require any external state or context to perform its check.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the currency type is exclusive to or associated with the
    Alliance faction; otherwise, returns false if it's for the Horde, neutral, or
    a universal currency.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Currency is Alliance-only
    code: "const CurrencyTypesEntry* entry = sCurrencyTypesStore.LookupEntry(1234);\n\
      if (entry && entry->IsAlliance()) {\n    // Handle Alliance-specific currency\
      \ logic\n    printf(\"This currency is for Alliance players only.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal faction association stored within the
    CurrencyTypesEntry structure. It's typically used in reward systems, quest logic,
    or UI display logic where faction-specific currencies need to be handled differently.
