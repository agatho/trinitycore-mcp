  class: Map
  method: isCellMarked
  signature: bool Map::isCellMarked(uint32 pCellId)
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specific cell on the map has been marked for processing
    or update.
  description: The isCellMarked method determines if a given cell ID has been marked
    within the map's internal tracking system. This functionality is typically used
    in the context of dynamic map updates, where certain cells are flagged to indicate
    they require special handling such as object repositioning, visibility recalculations,
    or event triggers. The marking mechanism helps optimize performance by avoiding
    unnecessary computations for unmodified areas of the map. Cells are usually marked
    during various game events like player movement, object spawns, or environmental
    changes.
  parameters:
  - name: pCellId
    description: The unique identifier of the cell to check. This ID typically represents
      a specific grid cell within the map's coordinate system and is used to track
      which areas have been modified or require attention.
  returns: Returns true if the specified cell has been marked, false otherwise. A
    marked cell indicates that it has undergone some form of change or requires processing
    by the game engine.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a cell is marked before updating
    code: "if (map->isCellMarked(12345)) {\n    // Perform special handling for this\
      \ marked cell\n    map->UpdateCell(12345);\n} else {\n    // Cell hasn't changed,\
      \ skip expensive operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterate through cells to find all marked ones
    code: "for (uint32 i = 0; i < map->GetNumCells(); ++i) {\n    if (map->isCellMarked(i))\
      \ {\n        // Process the marked cell\n        HandleMarkedCell(map, i);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the map's internal state management system and should
    be used primarily by core game systems that handle map updates. The marking mechanism
    may be implemented using bitmasks or hash tables depending on the specific implementation
    details of the Map class.
  warnings: Be cautious when relying on this method for critical gameplay logic, as
    it only reflects the current marking state and may not account for all possible
    changes in cell states. Also, ensure that the cell ID passed is valid within the
    map's coordinate system to avoid undefined behavior.
