  class: CooldownManager
  method: ResetCooldown
  signature: void CooldownManager::ResetCooldown(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the cooldown timer for a specified spell in the CooldownManager.
  description: The ResetCooldown method clears the cooldown state for a given spell
    ID within the CooldownManager. This function is typically used to immediately
    make a spell available for use, bypassing any existing cooldown period. It operates
    on the assumption that the spell ID corresponds to a valid spell in the game's
    spell system. The method does not validate whether the spell is actually usable
    or if it has a cooldown; it simply resets its cooldown state. This can be useful
    for effects like spell refreshes, item proc resets, or temporary cooldown reductions.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell whose cooldown is to be reset.
      Must correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resetting a Spell Cooldown
    code: 'CooldownManager* cm = player->GetSpellCooldownManager();

      cm->ResetCooldown(12345); // Resets cooldown for spell ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Resetting Multiple Cooldowns
    code: "std::vector<uint32> cooldownSpells = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nfor (uint32 spellId\
      \ : cooldownSpells)\n{\n    player->GetSpellCooldownManager()->ResetCooldown(spellId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly manipulates internal cooldown state and should be used
    carefully. It does not trigger any visual or auditory feedback to the player,
    such as cooldown reset animations. Ensure that the spell ID passed is valid to
    avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid spell ID may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Always validate spell IDs before calling ResetCooldown, especially
    when dealing with dynamic or user-provided input.
