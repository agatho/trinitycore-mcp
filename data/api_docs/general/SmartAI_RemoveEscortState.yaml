  method: RemoveEscortState
  signature: void SmartAI::RemoveEscortState(uint32 escortState)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified escort state from the SmartAI instance.
  description: The RemoveEscortState method is used to remove a specific escort state
    flag from the SmartAI instance. This method is typically invoked during NPC escort
    quests or scripted events where certain states need to be cleared or disabled.
    The escort state flags control various aspects of NPC behavior during escorted
    sequences, such as whether the NPC should follow a path, stop moving, or perform
    specific actions. Removing an escort state allows for dynamic modification of
    NPC behavior during quest progression or scripted events.
  parameters:
  - name: escortState
    description: The escort state flag to be removed from the SmartAI instance. This
      is typically a bitmask value representing specific states such as ESCORT_STATE_NONE,
      ESCORT_STATE_ACTIVE, ESCORT_STATE_RETURNING, etc.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove active escort state
    code: "void RemoveActiveEscortState()\n{\n    // Remove the active escort state\
      \ flag\n    me->GetAI()->RemoveEscortState(ESCORT_STATE_ACTIVE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Clear all escort states
    code: "void ClearAllEscortStates()\n{\n    // Clear multiple escort states at\
      \ once\n    me->GetAI()->RemoveEscortState(ESCORT_STATE_ACTIVE | ESCORT_STATE_RETURNING\
      \ | ESCORT_STATE_ESCORTING);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state flags of the SmartAI instance. It
    should be used carefully during quest progression or scripted events to ensure
    proper NPC behavior. The escort states are typically managed internally by the
    SmartAI system and may interact with other quest-related systems.
  warnings: Calling this method without understanding the current state of the NPC's
    escort sequence may cause unexpected behavior. Ensure that the escortState parameter
    is a valid flag that has been previously set, otherwise it may have no effect
    or potentially interfere with other systems.
