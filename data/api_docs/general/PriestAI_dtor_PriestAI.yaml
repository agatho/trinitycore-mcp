documentation:
  brief: Destroys a PriestAI instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the PriestAI class is responsible for cleaning up
    any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used by the priest's AI
    behavior. This method ensures proper deallocation of internal data structures,
    such as spell queues, target tracking information, or any custom AI state variables.
    It is automatically invoked when a PriestAI object goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted. The destructor does not take any parameters and performs no return operations.
    In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this method plays a crucial role in
    preventing memory leaks and maintaining stable performance during creature AI
    lifecycle management.

  - title: Basic Destructor Usage
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    PriestAI* ai = new PriestAI(creature);\n\
      \    // ... use the AI ...\n    delete ai; // Triggers ~PriestAI()\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime when an object
    is destroyed. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless performing
    explicit memory management. The implementation assumes that all internal resources
    have been properly initialized and managed through the class's constructor and
    other methods.
