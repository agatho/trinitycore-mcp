documentation:
  brief: Converts navigation mesh coordinates to world coordinates
  description: The NavToWorld method transforms navigation mesh position coordinates
    into corresponding world coordinates. This conversion is essential for pathfinding
    and movement calculations within the game world, particularly when working with
    AI navigation systems. The method takes a navigation mesh position (typically
    in local or grid-based coordinates) and converts it to standard world coordinates
    that can be used for positioning objects, characters, or calculating movement
    paths. The transformation accounts for the specific coordinate system used by
    the navigation mesh implementation and ensures proper alignment with the game
    world's coordinate system.
  parameters:
  - name: navPos
    description: Pointer to an array of three float values representing the navigation
      mesh coordinates (x, y, z). These coordinates are typically in the local navigation
      mesh space and may represent a point on the navmesh surface.
  - name: worldPos
    description: Reference to an integer value that will be updated with the converted
      world coordinate. This parameter is passed by reference and will contain the
      resulting world position after the conversion is complete.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Navigation to World Coordinate Conversion
    code: 'float navPosition[3] = {100.0f, 200.0f, 50.0f};

      int worldPosition;

      navMeshInterface->NavToWorld(navPosition, worldPosition);

      // worldPosition now contains the converted world coordinate'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other navigation mesh APIs
    for pathfinding and movement calculations. The conversion process may involve
    transformations based on the specific map or zone's coordinate system, and the
    resulting world coordinates should be validated before use in game logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the navPos array contains valid floating-point values before
    calling this method, as invalid input could lead to incorrect world position calculations.
    Also, note that the worldPos parameter is modified in place, so ensure it's properly
    initialized or handled to avoid unexpected behavior.
