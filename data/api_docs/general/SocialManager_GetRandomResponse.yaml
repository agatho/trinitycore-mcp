  method: GetRandomResponse
  signature: std::string SocialManager::GetRandomResponse(const std::string & trigger)
documentation:
  brief: Returns a random response string based on the provided trigger keyword.
  description: The GetRandomResponse method retrieves a randomly selected response
    from a predefined set of possible replies associated with a given trigger keyword.
    This functionality is typically used in social interactions within the game, such
    as when players engage in dialogue or chat with NPCs or other players. The method
    selects one response from a collection of potential replies that are mapped to
    the specified trigger, ensuring varied and dynamic interaction experiences. It
    is commonly employed in quest systems, gossip menus, or general player communication
    mechanics where contextual replies enhance immersion.
  parameters:
  - name: trigger
    description: A string identifier used to determine which set of responses to draw
      from. This parameter defines the context or topic of the interaction, such as
      'greeting', 'quest_accepted', or 'farewell'. Valid values are defined by the
      game's social system configuration.
  returns: A std::string containing a randomly selected response that corresponds
    to the provided trigger. If no responses are configured for the given trigger,
    an empty string may be returned depending on implementation behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "std::string response = socialManager->GetRandomResponse(\"greeting\");\n\
      if (!response.empty()) {\n    // Send the response to a player\n    player->SendChatMessage(CHAT_MSG_SAY,\
      \ LANG_UNIVERSAL, response);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in NPC Dialogue
    code: "void GossipHello(Player* player, Creature* creature) {\n    std::string\
      \ greeting = socialManager->GetRandomResponse(\"npc_greeting\");\n    if (!greeting.empty())\
      \ {\n        creature->Say(greeting, LANG_UNIVERSAL, player->GetGUID());\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on internal data structures that map triggers to collections
    of possible responses. These mappings are usually defined in database tables or
    configuration files and can be dynamically updated during runtime. The randomness
    is typically implemented using a pseudo-random number generator seeded appropriately
    for consistent behavior within a session.
  warnings: Ensure that the trigger parameter passed to this method corresponds to
    valid entries in the social response database; otherwise, it may return an empty
    string or cause unexpected behavior. Avoid calling this method with invalid or
    malformed triggers unless the system is designed to handle such cases gracefully.
