  class: MovementRequest
  method: MakeIdleMovement
  signature: MovementRequest MovementRequest::MakeIdleMovement(PlayerBotMovementPriority
    priority, std::string reason, std::string sourceSystem)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new MovementRequest object configured for idle movement
    with specified priority, reason, and source system.
  description: The MakeIdleMovement method constructs a MovementRequest instance that
    represents an idle movement state for a player bot. This method is typically used
    in AI-driven bot behavior to signal that the bot should cease active movement
    and enter an idle state. The returned MovementRequest can be used to update the
    bot's movement state within the TrinityCore framework. The method accepts parameters
    to define the priority level of the idle movement, a descriptive reason for the
    state change, and the source system or module that initiated this request. This
    allows for better tracking and debugging of bot behaviors in complex AI systems.
  parameters:
  - name: priority
    description: Specifies the movement priority level (PlayerBotMovementPriority
      enum) for this idle movement request. Higher priority movements will take precedence
      over lower ones.
  - name: reason
    description: A descriptive string explaining why the idle movement is being requested.
      This helps with debugging and logging of bot behavior changes.
  - name: sourceSystem
    description: Identifies the system or module that initiated this idle movement
      request. Useful for tracking which component triggered the state change.
  returns: Returns a new MovementRequest object configured with the specified priority,
    reason, and source system for an idle movement state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of MakeIdleMovement
    code: MovementRequest request = bot->MakeIdleMovement(PlayerBotMovementPriority::LOW,
      "Waiting for target", "CombatAI");
    language: cpp
  - title: Using MakeIdleMovement in a complex AI system
    code: "void BotAI::HandleIdleState()\n{\n    MovementRequest idleRequest = this->MakeIdleMovement(\n\
      \        PlayerBotMovementPriority::HIGH,\n        \"Processing quest objectives\"\
      ,\n        \"QuestHandler\"\n    );\n    // Apply the movement request to update\
      \ bot state\n    this->ApplyMovementRequest(idleRequest);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method creates a new MovementRequest object rather than modifying an
    existing one. The returned object should be applied to the bot's movement system
    using appropriate methods like ApplyMovementRequest(). The priority parameter
    affects how the movement request interacts with other active movement requests
    in the system.
  warnings: Ensure that the priority value passed is valid according to the PlayerBotMovementPriority
    enum; invalid values may cause unexpected behavior. The reason and sourceSystem
    strings should be kept concise for performance reasons, especially when used frequently
    in AI decision-making loops.
