  class: ObjectCache
  method: GetInteractionTarget
  signature: WorldObject * ObjectCache::GetInteractionTarget() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the WorldObject that is currently targeted for interaction by this
    ObjectCache instance.
  description: The GetInteractionTarget method returns a pointer to the WorldObject
    that represents the current target for interaction within the context of this
    ObjectCache. This typically corresponds to the object that a player or NPC is
    interacting with, such as a quest objective, a game object, or another unit. The
    returned pointer may be null if no valid interaction target exists. This method
    is commonly used in interaction-based systems like quest tracking, gossip handling,
    and object-based interactions within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the WorldObject that is currently targeted for interaction,
    or nullptr if no interaction target is set.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Interaction Handler
    code: "WorldObject* target = objectCache->GetInteractionTarget();\nif (target\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process interaction with the target\n    target->HandleInteraction(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Valid Interaction Target Before Action
    code: "WorldObject* target = objectCache->GetInteractionTarget();\nif (target\
      \ && target->IsInWorld())\n{\n    // Safe to perform interaction logic\n   \
      \ player->SendGameObjectQueryData(target);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No valid target,\
      \ handle accordingly\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"No valid interaction target.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation on the returned WorldObject beyond
    ensuring it is a valid pointer. It's the caller's responsibility to verify that
    the object is in a valid state before using it. The interaction target may be
    updated by various game events such as player movement, quest state changes, or
    NPC behavior updates.
  warnings: Be cautious when dereferencing the returned pointer without checking for
    null, as this can lead to segmentation faults. Also, ensure that the returned
    WorldObject is still valid and in the world before performing operations on it,
    since it may have been destroyed or removed between the time the target was set
    and when it's accessed.
