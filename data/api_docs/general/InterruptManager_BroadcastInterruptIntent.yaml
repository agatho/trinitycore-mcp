  method: BroadcastInterruptIntent
  signature: void InterruptManager::BroadcastInterruptIntent(const InterruptTarget
    & target)
documentation:
  brief: Broadcasts an interrupt intent message to all nearby players for a given
    target.
  description: The BroadcastInterruptIntent method sends a network message to all
    players within the target's interaction range, notifying them of an impending
    or occurring interrupt event. This method is typically used in combat scenarios
    where a spell or ability is interrupted, and it ensures that all nearby players
    are visually and logically informed about the interruption. The method does not
    directly perform the interrupt itself but rather communicates the intent to interrupt
    to other players in the vicinity.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The InterruptTarget object representing the entity whose interrupt
      intent is being broadcasted. This typically contains information about the target's
      current state, spell being interrupted, and relevant combat data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Handler
    code: "void MyCombatHandler::HandleSpellInterrupt(Unit* caster, Unit* target)\
      \ {\n    InterruptTarget interruptTarget;\n    interruptTarget.caster = caster;\n\
      \    interruptTarget.target = target;\n    interruptTarget.spellId = currentSpell->GetSpellInfo()->Id;\n\
      \    \n    sInterruptManager->BroadcastInterruptIntent(interruptTarget);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from the server-side game logic and
    will automatically handle the network distribution to nearby players. The actual
    interrupt mechanics should be handled separately by calling appropriate spell
    interruption functions. Performance-wise, this method may cause network overhead
    if used excessively in rapid succession.
  warnings: Do not call this method without ensuring that the InterruptTarget data
    is properly initialized, as it could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect visual
    feedback for players. Avoid broadcasting interrupt intents for non-combat scenarios
    unless specifically required by game design.
