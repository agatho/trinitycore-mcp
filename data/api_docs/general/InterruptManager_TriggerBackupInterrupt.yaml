  method: TriggerBackupInterrupt
  signature: bool InterruptManager::TriggerBackupInterrupt(const InterruptTarget &
    target)
documentation:
  brief: Triggers a backup interrupt for the specified target, returning true if successful.
  description: The TriggerBackupInterrupt method is responsible for initiating an
    interrupt mechanism on a given target within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    typically handles situations where an interrupt needs to be forcefully applied
    to a unit or spell that might otherwise not be interrupted by standard means.
    It's commonly used in scenarios involving spell interruption, ability cancellation,
    or defensive mechanics. The method evaluates whether the interrupt can be successfully
    triggered based on various game conditions and state checks before applying the
    interrupt effect.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The InterruptTarget object representing the unit or spell that will
      be interrupted. This parameter defines which entity receives the interrupt action.
  returns: Returns true if the backup interrupt was successfully triggered and applied
    to the target, false otherwise. The method may return false if the target is invalid,
    already interrupted, or if interrupt conditions are not met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of TriggerBackupInterrupt
    code: "InterruptTarget target;\ntarget.SetUnit(targetUnit);\nbool success = interruptManager.TriggerBackupInterrupt(target);\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Interrupt was successfully applied\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      InterruptManager\", \"Backup interrupt triggered successfully\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using TriggerBackupInterrupt with Spell Interrupt
    code: "InterruptTarget target;\ntarget.SetSpell(spellInfo);\nif (interruptManager.TriggerBackupInterrupt(target))\n\
      {\n    // Spell interrupt applied successfully\n    targetUnit->InterruptNonMeleeSpells(true);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Failed to trigger backup interrupt\n    LOG_ERROR(\"InterruptManager\"\
      , \"Failed to apply backup interrupt to spell {}\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other interrupt-related
    systems and should be called only when necessary. It may have performance implications
    if used excessively during high-frequency events such as combat loops or rapid
    spell casting sequences.
  warnings: Ensure that the InterruptTarget object passed to this method is properly
    initialized before calling, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. Avoid calling
    this method in contexts where it might cause recursion or stack overflow issues.
