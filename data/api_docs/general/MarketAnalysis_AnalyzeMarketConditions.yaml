  signature: void MarketAnalysis::AnalyzeMarketConditions()
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes current market conditions and updates internal tracking data for
    item prices and demand trends.
  description: The AnalyzeMarketConditions method performs a comprehensive evaluation
    of the in-game market dynamics, collecting and processing data related to item
    pricing, supply, and player demand. This method is typically invoked periodically
    by the game's economic system to maintain up-to-date market information that influences
    NPC vendor pricing, auction house behavior, and player trading decisions. The
    analysis may involve examining recent transaction logs, comparing inventory levels
    across different zones, and correlating item availability with player activity
    patterns. It serves as a core component of TrinityCore's dynamic economy system,
    ensuring that virtual market conditions reflect realistic supply-demand relationships.

  notes: This method is designed to be called from the game's main update loop or
    periodic tick handler. It may perform database operations and should not be invoked
    too frequently to avoid performance degradation. The analysis results are typically
    cached internally for efficiency.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of the intended game loop context might lead
    to inconsistent market data or unexpected behavior in related systems such as
    auction house pricing or NPC vendor inventories.
