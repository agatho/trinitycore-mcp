  method: SetPetitioner
  signature: void Creature::SetPetitioner(bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the petitioner status for a creature, enabling or disabling pet-related
    behavior.
  description: The SetPetitioner method controls whether a creature can function as
    a pet for a player. When applied, it allows the creature to be petitioned by players
    and enables pet mechanics such as pet AI behavior, command states, and related
    gameplay interactions. This method is typically used in conjunction with other
    pet-related functions to manage creature behavior within the game world. The method
    affects the creature's ability to be controlled by players and influences its
    interaction with player pet systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetPetitioner(true);

      // Creature now can be petitioned by players'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with pet mechanics
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetPetitioner(false);

      // Creature cannot be petitioned

      // This disables pet AI behavior and related command states'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include that this method likely modifies internal
    flags or state variables within the creature object. Performance considerations
    are minimal, as it only affects the creature's ability to be petitioned rather
    than its overall functionality. Thread safety is not an issue since this method
    typically operates within a single thread context.
  warnings: This method should not be used in scenarios where the creature is already
    controlled by another player or AI system, as it may lead to conflicts or unexpected
    behavior in pet-related systems. Avoid calling this method on creatures that are
    already in a pet state or have been previously petitioned.
