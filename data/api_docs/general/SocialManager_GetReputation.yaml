documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the reputation level of a player within the social manager system.
  description: The GetReputation method fetches the current reputation value associated
    with a specific player identified by their GUID. This value typically represents
    how well the player is regarded within the game's social systems, such as faction
    standings or guild relationships. The method operates on the assumption that the
    player GUID is valid and corresponds to an existing entry in the social manager's
    internal data structures. It does not perform any validation checks on the input
    parameter itself, relying instead on the integrity of the calling code to provide
    a legitimate player identifier.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int32 value representing the player's reputation level. Positive
    values typically indicate favorable standing, while negative values may represent
    hostile or neutral relationships. A value of zero often signifies a balanced or
    default state. The exact interpretation of these values depends on the specific
    implementation and context within which this method is used.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int32 playerRep = socialManager.GetReputation(12345);\nif (playerRep >\
      \ 0) {\n    // Player has positive reputation\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Reputation Status
    code: "uint32 playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nint32 rep = socialManager.GetReputation(playerId);\n\
      switch (rep) {\n    case 0:  // Neutral\n        break;\n    case > 0: // Friendly\n\
      \        break;\n    default: // Hostile\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger social system that tracks relationships
    between players and factions. The internal storage mechanism for reputation data
    may involve caching or database lookups, which could affect performance if called
    frequently in tight loops. Ensure that the player GUID passed to this method is
    valid to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or non-existent player GUID might result in unexpected
    behavior or errors depending on the underlying implementation. Always validate
    input parameters before calling this method if there's any possibility of receiving
    invalid data.
