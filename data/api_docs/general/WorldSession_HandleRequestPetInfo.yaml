documentation:
  brief: Processes a client request to retrieve detailed information about a pet.
  description: The HandleRequestPetInfo method is invoked when a World of Warcraft
    client sends a packet requesting detailed information about a specific pet. This
    typically occurs when the player opens their pet's action bar or interacts with
    the pet in the UI. The method retrieves and sends back relevant pet data including
    pet stats, abilities, and status information to ensure the client's UI accurately
    reflects the pet's current state. It is part of the core session handling logic
    for pet-related communications in TrinityCore.

  - title: Basic usage in session handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleRequestPetInfo(WorldPackets::Pet::RequestPetInfo&\
      \ requestPetInfo)\n{\n    // Process the pet info request\n    SendPetInfo(requestPetInfo.PetGUID);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the standard packet handling flow
    within WorldSession. The actual pet data retrieval and sending logic may involve
    multiple internal calls to fetch creature data, pet stats, and other related information
    from the game world state.
