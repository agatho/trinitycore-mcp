documentation:
  brief: Destroys the LazyManagerFactory instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the LazyManagerFactory class is responsible for
    properly cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were managed
    by this factory instance. In the context of TrinityCore's architecture, this typically
    involves releasing references to managers or other objects that may have been
    lazily initialized and stored within the factory. This method ensures proper resource
    deallocation when the factory object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted,
    preventing memory leaks and maintaining the integrity of the server's memory management
    system.

  - title: Basic Destructor Usage
    code: 'LazyManagerFactory* factory = new LazyManagerFactory();

      // ... use the factory ...

      delete factory; // Triggers ~LazyManagerFactory()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically invoked when a LazyManagerFactory object
    is destroyed. It's important to ensure that no other threads are accessing the
    factory during destruction, as this could lead to undefined behavior if resources
    are being concurrently accessed.
