    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is within combat range of another unit
  description: This method checks if the calling unit is within the standard combat
    distance of the specified target unit. It evaluates the distance between two units
    and returns true if they are within the defined combat range, false otherwise.
    The method is commonly used in AI scripts to determine whether a unit can engage
    in combat with another unit based on proximity. This functionality is essential
    for determining valid combat targets and implementing proper combat mechanics
    in World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: obj
    description: The target unit to compare distance against. This parameter defines
      the reference point for distance calculation.
  - name: dist2compare
    description: Optional distance parameter that specifies the maximum combat distance
      to check against. If not provided, defaults to standard combat range.
  returns: Returns true if the unit is within combat range of the target unit, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsWithinCombatRange(targetUnit)) {\n    // Perform combat actions\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with custom distance
    code: "if (unit->IsWithinCombatRange(targetUnit, 10.0f)) {\n    // Check if within\
      \ 10 yards of target\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses the standard combat range defined by the game mechanics.
    It's important to note that this method does not account for line of sight or
    other environmental factors that might affect combat validity. Performance considerations
    include checking distance calculations efficiently, especially when used in AI
    loops.
  warnings: The method may return false positives if the target unit is not within
    standard combat range but is within a different distance threshold. Care should
    be taken when using this method in conjunction with other distance-based checks
    to ensure proper combat mechanics are maintained.
