documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of unique battle pet species owned by the player
  description: The GetPetUniqueSpeciesCount method retrieves the number of distinct
    battle pet species that have been collected by the player. This count represents
    the variety of different pet types rather than individual pets, meaning that multiple
    pets of the same species only contribute a single increment to the total. The
    method is typically used in UI displays and achievement tracking within the Battle
    Pet system. It operates on the player's current battle pet collection data and
    does not account for any temporary or conditional pets.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the number of unique battle pet species owned
    by the player. Returns 0 if no battle pets have been collected yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int uniqueSpeciesCount = player->GetBattlePetMgr()->GetPetUniqueSpeciesCount();\n\
      if (uniqueSpeciesCount > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Player has collected \" <<\
      \ uniqueSpeciesCount << \" unique battle pet species.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Progress Towards Achievement
    code: "BattlePetMgr* petMgr = player->GetBattlePetMgr();\nint currentCount = petMgr->GetPetUniqueSpeciesCount();\n\
      if (currentCount >= 100)\n{\n    // Player has collected 100 unique species\
      \ - grant achievement\n    player->CompleteAchievement(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses the player's battle pet collection data, which may be
    cached or loaded from database on first access. The count includes all species
    regardless of whether they are currently in the player's active team or stored
    in their pet journal.
  warnings: The returned value does not include any temporary pets such as those obtained
    through quests or events that might expire. Additionally, this method may not
    reflect newly acquired pets until the collection data is refreshed, particularly
    after rapid acquisition of multiple pets.
