  class: TradeManager
  method: EstimateItemValue
  signature: uint32 TradeManager::EstimateItemValue(uint32 itemEntry, uint32 count)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Estimates the value of a specified item based on its entry and count for
    trade purposes.
  description: The EstimateItemValue method calculates an estimated monetary value
    for a given item entry and quantity. This estimation is used within the trading
    system to determine fair exchange rates between items during trades. The method
    likely considers factors such as item rarity, level, vendor price, and market
    demand to compute this value. It serves as a core utility in ensuring balanced
    trade mechanics within the game's economy system. The returned value represents
    the estimated gold amount that the item(s) would be worth in a typical trade scenario.
  parameters:
  - name: itemEntry
    description: The unique identifier (entry ID) of the item to estimate value for.
      This corresponds to the item's entry in the game database.
  - name: count
    description: The number of items of the specified entry to estimate value for.
      Used to calculate total value when multiple items are involved.
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the estimated gold value of the specified
    item(s). This value is typically used in trade calculations and represents how
    much the item would be worth in a typical transaction.
  examples:
  - title: Estimate value of a single common item
    code: uint32 value = tradeManager->EstimateItemValue(12345, 1); // Estimates value
      of one item with entry ID 12345
    language: cpp
  - title: Estimate value of multiple items
    code: uint32 totalValue = tradeManager->EstimateItemValue(67890, 5); // Estimates
      value of five items with entry ID 67890
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the trading system's internal valuation logic
    and may be used to prevent trades that are significantly imbalanced. The estimation
    algorithm might incorporate data from item templates, vendor prices, and possibly
    auction house data if available. Performance-wise, this should be a fast operation
    as it's called frequently during trade negotiations.
  warnings: The estimated value returned by this method is not necessarily the exact
    market price or vendor sell price of an item. It represents a calculated estimate
    for trading purposes only and may vary based on internal game mechanics or updates
    to the valuation algorithm.
