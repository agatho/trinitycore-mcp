  class: WarriorAI
  method: UseChargeAbilities
  signature: void WarriorAI::UseChargeAbilities(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes charge-based abilities for a warrior AI unit targeting the specified
    enemy.
  description: The UseChargeAbilities method is responsible for activating and managing
    all charge-related combat abilities within the WarriorAI class. This method evaluates
    the current state of the warrior unit, including available rage, cooldowns, and
    target distance, to determine which charge abilities can be executed. It typically
    handles abilities such as Charge, Intercept, or other melee charge-based attacks
    that require a specific positioning or movement mechanic. The method ensures proper
    targeting and execution of these abilities based on game mechanics and AI decision-making
    logic.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target enemy unit. This
      parameter is essential for determining ability usage, range calculations, and
      targeting validation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Warrior AI Context
    code: "void SomeWarriorAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        UseChargeAbilities(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Ability Validation
    code: "void AdvancedWarriorAI::UseChargeAbilities(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (!target\
      \ || !target->IsInWorld())\n        return;\n\n    // Check if we can use charge\
      \ abilities\n    if (me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\n        return;\n\
      \n    // Execute charge abilities\n    if (me->GetDistance(target) <= 8.0f)\n\
      \    {\n        DoCast(target, SPELL_CHARGE);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles and should only be
    invoked when the warrior unit has a valid target. The implementation may include
    checks for line of sight, distance thresholds, and resource availability before
    executing any charge abilities.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is valid and in world before calling
    this method to prevent crashes or undefined behavior. This method assumes proper
    AI state management and should not be called during combat state transitions.
