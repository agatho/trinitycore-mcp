documentation:
  brief: Initiates a resurrection request for group members who are currently dead
    or in spirit mode.
  description: The RequestResurrection method is used by the GroupCoordinator to send
    a resurrection request to all eligible group members who are currently in a dead
    or spirit state. This method typically triggers the display of resurrection icons
    and handles the logic for offering resurrection to players within the group. It
    is commonly invoked during group encounters or when a player dies and needs to
    be resurrected by their group members. The method does not directly perform the
    resurrection itself but rather coordinates the process, potentially sending packets
    to clients and managing the state of group members.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Group Coordinator Context
    code: "void SomeGroupHandler::HandlePlayerDeath()\n{\n    // When a player dies,\
      \ trigger resurrection request for the group\n    groupCoordinator.RequestResurrection();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the Group's internal state tracking system
    to identify which members are eligible for resurrection. It may also be tied to
    cooldowns or restrictions such as whether a player has already been resurrected
    recently.
