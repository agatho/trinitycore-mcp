  class: FlightPathMovementGenerator
  method: DoInitialize
  signature: void FlightPathMovementGenerator::DoInitialize(Player * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the flight path movement generator for a player, setting up internal
    state for flight path navigation.
  description: The DoInitialize method prepares a FlightPathMovementGenerator instance
    for use with a specific player. It configures the movement generator's internal
    data structures to track and manage the player's progress along a predefined flight
    path. This typically occurs when a player begins flying using a flight master
    or when a flight path is initiated programmatically. The method sets up necessary
    state variables, initializes movement parameters, and prepares the generator to
    handle subsequent movement updates during the flight. It ensures that the player's
    movement is correctly synchronized with the flight path's waypoints and timing.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which the flight path movement generator
      is being initialized. This parameter represents the target entity that will
      follow the flight path.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Flight Path Initialization
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      FlightPathMovementGenerator* movementGen = new FlightPathMovementGenerator();

      movementGen->DoInitialize(player); // Initialize for the player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore movement system
    when a flight path is assigned to a player. Developers should not call this directly
    unless implementing custom movement logic. The method assumes that the provided
    Player pointer is valid and that the player has an active flight path assigned.
  warnings: Calling DoInitialize with a null player pointer will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the player object is properly initialized before
    calling this method. This method modifies internal state of the movement generator,
    so it should only be called once per instance during its lifecycle.
