documentation:
  brief: Loads account-wide item appearance data for known and favorite appearances.
  description: 'The LoadAccountItemAppearances method initializes and retrieves item
    appearance data associated with a player''s account. It processes two categories
    of appearances: known appearances, which represent all item appearances the player
    has seen or obtained, and favorite appearances, which are user-defined preferred
    appearances. This method is typically invoked during account loading or initialization
    phases to ensure that the player''s appearance preferences and collected items
    are properly synchronized with the client. The method does not return any value
    but modifies internal state within the CollectionMgr class to reflect the loaded
    appearance data.'

  - name: knownAppearances

  - name: favoriteAppearances
    description: An integer representing the number of item appearances marked as
      favorites by the player. These are user-selected appearances that may be prioritized
      or displayed differently in the UI.
