  class: MonkAI
  method: UseTranscendenceTransfer
  signature: void MonkAI::UseTranscendenceTransfer()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the Transcendence transfer ability for a Monk AI character.
  description: The UseTranscendenceTransfer method activates the Monk's Transcendence
    ability, which allows the character to teleport to a designated location or perform
    a special movement mechanic. This method is typically invoked within the MonkAI
    class to handle the logic associated with using this powerful ability during combat
    or traversal. The implementation likely includes checks for ability cooldowns,
    resource requirements, and valid target conditions before executing the transfer.
    It may also trigger visual effects or animations related to the ability's activation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Monk AI Context
    code: "void SomeMonkAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (CanUseTranscendenceTransfer())\n\
      \    {\n        UseTranscendenceTransfer();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Monk's AI behavior system and should only be called
    when the Monk character has the appropriate conditions met for using Transcendence.
    The actual teleportation logic may depend on internal state tracking within the
    MonkAI class.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying preconditions may result in unexpected
    behavior or errors. Ensure that the Monk AI is in a valid state before invoking
    this function to avoid potential crashes or incorrect gameplay mechanics.
