  signature: void GameEventMgr::UpdateEventNPCVendor(uint16 event_id, bool activate)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the vendor inventory for NPCs participating in a specific game event.
  description: The UpdateEventNPCVendor method manages the vendor item lists for NPCs
    that are part of a game event. When activated, it modifies the vendor's available
    items to reflect the event-specific inventory. This method is typically called
    during game event start and end times to ensure NPCs display appropriate items.
    The method operates on a per-event basis, allowing for dynamic vendor content
    changes without requiring server restarts.
  parameters:
  - name: event_id
    description: The unique identifier of the game event to update. This ID corresponds
      to entries in the game_event table and determines which NPCs and vendors are
      affected by this update.
  - name: activate
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to activate (true) or deactivate
      (false) the event vendor updates. When true, NPC vendors are updated with event-specific
      items; when false, they revert to normal inventory.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Activate Event Vendor Items
    code: GameEventMgr::instance()->UpdateEventNPCVendor(42, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Deactivate Event Vendor Items
    code: GameEventMgr::instance()->UpdateEventNPCVendor(42, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the GameEventMgr when events
    start or end. Developers should be aware that NPC vendors are updated in real-time
    and may affect player interactions immediately upon execution. The method does
    not perform any database operations directly but relies on internal event tracking
    and vendor data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method manually can cause unexpected behavior if not synchronized
    with the actual game event timing. Ensure proper event state management to avoid
    conflicts with automatic updates. Incorrect event_id values may result in no vendors
    being updated or unexpected vendor modifications.
