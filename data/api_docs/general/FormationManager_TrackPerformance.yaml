api:
  class: FormationManager
  method: TrackPerformance
  signature: void FormationManager::TrackPerformance(std::chrono::microseconds duration,
    const std::string & operation)
documentation:
  brief: Records performance metrics for a given operation duration within the formation
    management system.
  description: The TrackPerformance method logs timing data for specific operations
    performed by the FormationManager class. It accepts a duration in microseconds
    and an operation identifier string to track how long various formation-related
    tasks take to complete. This functionality is crucial for identifying performance
    bottlenecks in AI-driven unit positioning and movement logic, particularly when
    managing large groups of creatures or players in complex tactical formations.
    The method does not return any value but contributes to internal performance monitoring
    and debugging capabilities.
  parameters:
  - name: duration
    description: The time taken to complete the tracked operation, measured in microseconds.
      This parameter represents the actual execution time of the operation being monitored.
  - name: operation
    description: A descriptive string identifying the specific operation being tracked.
      This helps categorize and analyze performance data for different formation management
      tasks such as 'UpdateFormation', 'CalculatePathing', or 'AdjustPosition'.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Performance Tracking
    code: 'auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      // ... perform some formation logic ...

      auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      std::chrono::microseconds duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end
      - start);

      formationManager.TrackPerformance(duration, "UpdateFormation");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Multiple Operations
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {\n    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \    // Simulate formation calculation\n    formationManager.CalculateFormation();\n\
      \    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n    std::chrono::microseconds\
      \ duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end - start);\n\
      \    formationManager.TrackPerformance(duration, \"CalculateFormation\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with profiling tools or debug
    builds to monitor the efficiency of formation-related operations. The recorded
    data may be aggregated or exported for performance analysis. The operation string
    should remain consistent across similar operations to enable meaningful statistical
    aggregation.
  warnings: Ensure that timing measurements are accurate and not affected by external
    factors like system load or clock drift. Avoid calling this method excessively
    in performance-critical code paths as it may introduce overhead during profiling
    sessions.
