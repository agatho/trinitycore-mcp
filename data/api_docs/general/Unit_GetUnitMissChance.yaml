  class: Unit
  method: GetUnitMissChance
  signature: float Unit::GetUnitMissChance() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total miss chance for the unit, including all
    modifiers from buffs, debuffs, and base attributes.
  description: The GetUnitMissChance method computes the overall chance that a unit
    will miss an attack or spell when engaging in combat. This value is influenced
    by various factors including base miss chance, buffs, debuffs, and any applicable
    modifiers. The method returns a float value representing the percentage chance
    of missing, with 0.0 indicating no chance of missing and values up to 1.0 (100%)
    indicating full chance of missing. This function is commonly used in combat calculations
    for determining hit probabilities and is essential for understanding game mechanics
    related to combat effectiveness.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the total miss chance percentage. A
    value of 0.0 indicates no chance of missing, while values up to 1.0 (100%) indicate
    full chance of missing. The method may return null or undefined values in certain
    edge cases depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "float missChance = unit->GetUnitMissChance();\nif (missChance > 0.5f)\n\
      {\n    // Handle high miss chance\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves complex calculations based on multiple factors
    including base attributes, buffs/debuffs, and combat modifiers. Performance considerations
    may arise from frequent calls during combat calculations. Thread safety depends
    on implementation details but generally should be safe for single-threaded operations.
  warnings: Care must be taken when interpreting results as this method may include
    various modifiers that can significantly alter the final miss chance value. Incorrect
    application of modifiers could lead to inaccurate combat calculations.
