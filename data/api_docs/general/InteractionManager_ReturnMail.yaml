  class: InteractionManager
  method: ReturnMail
  signature: bool InteractionManager::ReturnMail(Player * bot, uint32 mailId)
documentation:
  brief: Returns mail to its original sender from the bot's mailbox.
  description: The ReturnMail method attempts to return a specific piece of mail identified
    by its mailId back to the original sender. This functionality is typically used
    in automated bot behavior where the bot needs to process or discard mail that
    cannot be handled normally, such as when the sender is no longer available or
    the mail contains items that are not suitable for the bot to keep. The method
    checks if the mail exists and can be returned before performing the operation.
    If successful, the mail is removed from the bot's mailbox and sent back to the
    original sender.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that owns the mail.
  - name: mailId
    description: Unique identifier of the mail to be returned. Must correspond to
      an existing mail item in the bot's mailbox.
  returns: True if the mail was successfully returned to the sender, false otherwise.
    Returns false if the mail does not exist or cannot be processed for return.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ReturnMail
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized\nuint32 mailId = 12345;\n\
      bool success = sInteractionManager->ReturnMail(bot, mailId);\nif (success)\n\
      {\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"bot.ai\", \"Mail with ID %u returned successfully.\", mailId);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"bot.ai\", \"Failed to return mail with ID %u.\"\
      , mailId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot has sufficient permissions and that the
    mail is eligible for return. It may not work on all types of mail, particularly
    those with special flags or those already marked as returned.
  warnings: Ensure that the mailId passed to this function corresponds to an actual
    mail item in the bot's mailbox; otherwise, the operation will fail silently or
    result in undefined behavior.
