  signature: void WorldSession::SendConnectToInstance(WorldPackets::Auth::ConnectToSerial
    serial)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a connect-to-instance packet to the client with the specified serial
    number.
  description: The SendConnectToInstance method is responsible for transmitting a
    serialized connection packet to the player's client, indicating that the player
    should connect to a specific instance. This method is typically invoked during
    the process of transferring a player into a dungeon, raid, or other instance-based
    content. The serial parameter contains the unique identifier required by the client
    to establish the connection. The method does not return any value and operates
    synchronously within the context of the WorldSession's communication channel.
  parameters:
  - name: serial
    description: A WorldPackets::Auth::ConnectToSerial object containing the serialized
      connection data required by the client to establish an instance connection.
      This typically includes instance identifiers, map IDs, and other relevant session
      data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'WorldPackets::Auth::ConnectToSerial serial;

      serial.MapID = 1234;

      serial.InstanceID = 5678;

      serial.Difficulty = DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_NORMAL;


      session->SendConnectToInstance(serial);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the authentication and instance management system
    in TrinityCore. It should only be called when a player is transitioning into an
    instance, and the serial data must be properly initialized before sending. The
    method relies on the underlying network infrastructure to deliver the packet to
    the client.
