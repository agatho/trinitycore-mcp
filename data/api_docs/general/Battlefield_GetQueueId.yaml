  method: GetQueueId
  signature: int Battlefield::GetQueueId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the queue identifier associated with the battlefield instance
  description: The GetQueueId method retrieves the unique queue identifier that corresponds
    to this Battlefield instance. This identifier is used internally by TrinityCore
    to manage player queues for battlefield instances, particularly in the context
    of battleground and battlefield systems. The returned value typically represents
    a specific queue type or group within the game's matchmaking system, allowing
    the server to properly route players to appropriate battlefield environments based
    on their queued status.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the queue identifier for this battlefield instance.
    This value is typically used to distinguish between different types of battlefield
    queues (e.g., different battleground types) and may be used in conjunction with
    other battlefield APIs to manage player entry and matchmaking.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(12345);\n\
      if (bf)\n{\n    int queueId = bf->GetQueueId();\n    // Use queueId for further\
      \ processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during battlefield initialization or player
    queue management. The returned queue ID should not be modified directly as it's
    managed by the battlefield system. This method is thread-safe as it only reads
    from internal state.
  warnings: Do not assume that all Battlefield instances will have a valid queue ID.
    Some instances may return 0 or negative values if they are not properly initialized
    or are in an invalid state.
