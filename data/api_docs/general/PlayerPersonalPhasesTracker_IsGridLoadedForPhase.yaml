  class: PlayerPersonalPhasesTracker
  method: IsGridLoadedForPhase
  signature: bool PlayerPersonalPhasesTracker::IsGridLoadedForPhase(uint32 gridId,
    uint32 phaseId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specific grid is loaded for the given phase in the player's
    personal phases tracker.
  description: The IsGridLoadedForPhase method determines if a particular grid (identified
    by gridId) has been loaded for a specified phase (phaseId) within the player's
    personal phases tracking system. This functionality is crucial for managing visibility
    and interaction of game objects, NPCs, and areas based on player-specific phase
    configurations. The method evaluates the internal state of the PlayerPersonalPhasesTracker
    to return a boolean result indicating whether the grid is currently active or
    loaded under the given phase context. It is typically used during zone loading,
    object spawning, or visibility checks to ensure that only relevant content is
    displayed to the player based on their current phase settings.
  parameters:
  - name: gridId
    description: The unique identifier of the grid to check for phase loading status.
      Grids represent specific areas or sections of the game world that may be loaded
      or unloaded based on phase conditions.
  - name: phaseId
    description: The phase identifier used to determine if the specified grid is loaded
      within that particular phase context. Phases define different states or configurations
      of the game world visible to individual players.
  returns: Returns true if the grid identified by gridId is currently loaded for the
    specified phaseId, otherwise returns false. This indicates whether the player's
    view of the grid should include content associated with that phase.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a grid is loaded for a specific phase
    code: "if (player->GetPersonalPhasesTracker()->IsGridLoadedForPhase(1234, 5678))\
      \ {\n    // Grid 1234 is loaded for phase 5678\n    // Proceed with phase-specific\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the method to conditionally spawn objects based on grid phase loading
    code: "uint32 gridId = player->GetMap()->GetGridId();\nuint32 currentPhase = player->GetPhaseMask();\n\
      if (player->GetPersonalPhasesTracker()->IsGridLoadedForPhase(gridId, currentPhase))\
      \ {\n    // Spawn phase-specific objects\n    // Example: spawn quest NPCs or\
      \ interactable items\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the player's personal phases system which allows
    for unique world states per player. The implementation likely involves checking
    internal data structures that track which grids are active under which phase conditions,
    and may involve caching or lazy loading mechanisms to optimize performance.
