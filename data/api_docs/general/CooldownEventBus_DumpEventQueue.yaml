documentation:
  brief: Dumps the contents of the cooldown event queue to the console for debugging
    purposes.
  description: The DumpEventQueue method outputs all pending cooldown events currently
    stored in the CooldownEventBus queue. This utility function is primarily used
    during development and debugging to inspect the state of active cooldowns, their
    associated timers, and event scheduling. It provides visibility into how cooldowns
    are managed within the TrinityCore framework, which is essential for understanding
    game mechanics such as spell cooldowns, item cooldowns, and other time-based events
    that rely on this event bus system. The method does not modify any internal state;
    it only reads and displays the current queue contents.

  - title: Basic Usage in Debug Context
    code: "void MyDebugHandler()\n{\n    sCooldownEventBus->DumpEventQueue();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically only available in debug builds of TrinityCore and
    should not be called in production environments due to performance overhead. It
    may output large amounts of data depending on the number of active cooldowns,
    so use with caution in high-frequency scenarios.
