  class: EvokerCalculator
  method: ShouldConserveEssence
  signature: bool EvokerCalculator::ShouldConserveEssence(int * caster, int currentEssence)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the evoker should conserve essence based on current caster
    state and essence level.
  description: The ShouldConserveEssence method evaluates if an evoker class character
    should hold onto their essence rather than spending it. This decision is influenced
    by the caster's current state (passed as a pointer to an integer) and the amount
    of essence currently available. The method typically checks for conditions such
    as low essence reserves, imminent spell casting needs, or strategic gameplay considerations
    that would benefit from preserving essence for future use. It returns true when
    essence conservation is advised, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: A pointer to an integer representing the current state of the caster.
      This value likely indicates mana, essence reserves, or other relevant resource
      levels that affect decision-making.
  - name: currentEssence
    description: An integer representing the amount of essence currently available
      to the evoker. This value is used in the logic to determine if conservation
      is necessary.
  returns: Returns true if the evoker should conserve essence, indicating that spending
    essence at this moment would be disadvantageous or unnecessary; returns false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int casterState = 50;\nint essenceLevel = 30;\nbool conserve = calculator.ShouldConserveEssence(&casterState,\
      \ essenceLevel);\nif (conserve) {\n    // Do not spend essence\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with dynamic resource management
    code: "int* casterPtr = &player->GetPower(POWER_ESSENCE);\nint currentEssence\
      \ = *casterPtr;\nif (calculator.ShouldConserveEssence(casterPtr, currentEssence))\
      \ {\n    // Save essence for emergency spells or high-priority abilities\n \
      \   player->SetCanCastSpells(false);\n} else {\n    // Proceed with normal spell\
      \ casting\n    player->SetCanCastSpells(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger evoker AI or resource management system.
    The exact logic for when to conserve essence may depend on game balance, class-specific
    abilities, and spell cooldowns.
  warnings: Ensure that the caster parameter points to valid memory and contains meaningful
    values; passing invalid pointers can lead to undefined behavior.
