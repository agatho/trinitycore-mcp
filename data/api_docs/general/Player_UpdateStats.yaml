documentation:
  brief: Updates the specified stat for the player, recalculating derived values and
    sending updates to the client.
  description: The UpdateStats method is responsible for recalculating and updating
    a specific stat for the player character. This method typically handles the recalculation
    of derived statistics such as health, mana, armor, or other combat-related attributes
    based on base stats, buffs, debuffs, and equipment changes. It ensures that all
    dependent values are properly updated and synchronized with the client. The method
    may also trigger visual updates or notifications to the player's UI when stat
    changes occur. This function is commonly invoked when a player's equipment changes,
    when buffs or debuffs are applied or removed, or during level-ups where stat distributions
    change.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the stat update was successfully processed and applied;
    returns false if the update failed or if an invalid stat index was provided.
  examples:
  - title: Update a single stat
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nbool success = player->UpdateStats(STAT_STRENGTH);\
      \ // Update strength stat\nif (success)\n{\n    // Stat update successful\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Update all stats
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nfor (int i = 0; i < MAX_STATS; ++i)\n{\n    player->UpdateStats(i);\n\
      }\n// All stats recalculated and synchronized"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically triggers a cascade of recalculations for dependent
    stats. It's important to note that calling UpdateStats with an invalid stat index
    may result in undefined behavior or silent failures. The method is usually called
    internally by the core when stat-modifying events occur, but can also be invoked
    manually for specific scenarios like custom stat modifications or testing.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently without proper throttling can cause performance
    issues due to the recalculations and potential UI updates it triggers. Avoid calling
    UpdateStats in tight loops or high-frequency event handlers unless absolutely
    necessary. Ensure that stat indices passed to the method are within valid ranges
    to prevent memory corruption or unexpected behavior.
