  class: ContainerData
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void ContainerData::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, int fieldVisibilityFlags,
    const Bag * owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes container creation data into a ByteBuffer for transmission to a player.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the container's data into a ByteBuffer,
    which is typically used to send packet data to a client when creating or updating
    a container object in the game world. This method handles the serialization of
    container fields such as item counts, slot information, and other relevant metadata
    based on visibility flags and owner context. It is commonly invoked during player
    login, container interaction, or when sending updates about container contents
    to a specific receiver.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to the ByteBuffer where serialized container data will
      be written.
  - name: fieldVisibilityFlags
    description: Integer flag indicating which fields should be included in the packet.
      Controls visibility of container properties based on game logic and player permissions.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Bag object that owns this container data. Can be null
      if no owner exists.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player who will receive this packet. Used for determining
      visibility and access rights.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      ContainerData containerData;

      Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      Bag* bag = ...; // Get bag reference

      containerData.WriteCreate(data, VISIBILITY_FLAG_NORMAL, bag, player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the packet serialization system for container objects
    in TrinityCore. It assumes that all necessary data has been set on the ContainerData
    object before calling. The fieldVisibilityFlags parameter controls which fields
    are included in the output, allowing for optimized network traffic by only sending
    relevant information.
