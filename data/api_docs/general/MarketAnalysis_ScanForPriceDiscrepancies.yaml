  signature: int MarketAnalysis::ScanForPriceDiscrepancies()
documentation:
  brief: Scans the auction house for items with significant price discrepancies between
    different sellers.
  description: The ScanForPriceDiscrepancies method analyzes auction house data to
    identify items where the current bid or buyout price varies significantly from
    the average market price. This functionality is typically used by in-game economists
    or automated systems to detect potential arbitrage opportunities, price manipulation,
    or market inefficiencies. The method iterates through all currently listed auctions,
    calculates statistical measures such as standard deviation or variance of prices
    for identical items, and flags those that exceed predefined thresholds. It requires
    access to the auction house database and appropriate permissions to read auction
    listings.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of price discrepancies found
    during the scan. A return value of zero indicates no significant discrepancies
    were detected within the specified parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "MarketAnalysis analyzer;\nint discrepancies = analyzer.ScanForPriceDiscrepancies();\n\
      if (discrepancies > 0) {\n    printf(\"Found %d price discrepancies\\n\", discrepancies);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be computationally intensive when scanning large auction
    house databases. It's recommended to run this operation during low-traffic periods
    or as a background task. The accuracy of the results depends on having sufficient
    data points for statistical analysis.
  warnings: The method assumes that all auction listings are valid and accessible.
    Running this during high server load may impact performance. Additionally, frequent
    execution might trigger anti-abuse measures in some server configurations.
