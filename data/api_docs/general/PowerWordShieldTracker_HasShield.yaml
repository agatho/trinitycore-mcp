  method: HasShield
  signature: bool PowerWordShieldTracker::HasShield(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: 'Checks if a player has an active Power Word: Shield effect.'
  description: 'The HasShield method determines whether a specific player currently
    has an active Power Word: Shield buff applied to them. This method is typically
    used in spell handling and aura management systems within the TrinityCore framework.
    It evaluates the shield status based on stored data or active auras associated
    with the player GUID. The method does not modify any state but simply returns
    the current shield status for the specified player.'
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: 'The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to check for an active
      Power Word: Shield effect.'
  returns: 'Returns true if the specified player has an active Power Word: Shield
    effect; otherwise, returns false.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (tracker.HasShield(playerGuid)) {\n    // Player already has a shield\n\
      \    SendSystemMessage(\"You already have a shield!\");\n} else {\n    // Apply\
      \ new shield\n    ApplyPowerWordShield(playerGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Logic
    code: "void HandlePowerWordShieldSpell(Unit* caster, Unit* target) {\n    if (target\
      \ && tracker.HasShield(target->GetGUID().GetCounter())) {\n        // Prevent\
      \ stacking of Power Word: Shield\n        SendSpellFailed(caster, SPELL_POWER_WORD_SHIELD,\
      \ SPELL_FAILED_AURA_BOUNCED);\n        return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with shield\
      \ application\n    ApplyShieldEffect(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal tracking of active auras or effects.
    It's important to note that GUIDs in TrinityCore are typically represented as
    uint64 values, and the method expects a valid player GUID. The implementation
    may cache shield status for performance reasons.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid player entity; passing
    an invalid or non-player GUID may result in undefined behavior or incorrect results.
    This method should not be used with creature GUIDs unless specifically designed
    to handle such cases.
