documentation:
  brief: Retrieves and processes item information for the auction bot buyer based
    on configuration settings.
  description: The GetItemInformation method is responsible for fetching and processing
    item data within the AuctionBotBuyer class. It utilizes the provided BuyerConfiguration
    to determine which items should be considered for purchase, including filters
    such as item quality, level ranges, and price thresholds. This method typically
    iterates through the configured item sets or categories and gathers relevant metadata
    about each item, such as its ID, name, required level, and auction house pricing
    information. The function returns a count of successfully processed items that
    meet the specified criteria.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of items that were successfully
    retrieved and processed according to the buyer configuration settings.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AuctionBotBuyer buyer;

      BuyerConfiguration config;

      // Configure the buyer with specific item filters

      config.minItemLevel = 80;

      config.maxItemLevel = 100;

      config.requiredQuality = ITEM_QUALITY_RARE;

      uint32 itemCount = buyer.GetItemInformation(config);

      // itemCount now contains how many items matched the criteria'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal data structures and may perform
    database queries or cache lookups to gather item information. It's important to
    ensure that the BuyerConfiguration is properly initialized before calling this
    function to avoid unexpected behavior.
