  class: ScriptedAI
  method: DoTeleportPlayer
  signature: void ScriptedAI::DoTeleportPlayer(int * unit, float x, float y, float
    z, float o)
documentation:
  brief: Teleports a player to the specified coordinates in the world.
  description: The DoTeleportPlayer method is used by AI scripts to instantly move
    a player to a given location within the game world. This method takes a pointer
    to a unit (typically representing the player) and teleport coordinates including
    x, y, z position and orientation (o). It's commonly used in scripted events or
    boss encounters where players need to be moved for tactical reasons or to set
    up specific gameplay scenarios. The teleportation occurs immediately without any
    delay or animation, making it suitable for precise positioning during combat or
    quest sequences.
  parameters:
  - name: unit
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the player to be teleported.
      This parameter must not be null and should point to a valid player instance.
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the destination location in the world.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the destination location in the world.
  - name: z
    description: The Z coordinate (height) of the destination location in the world.
  - name: o
    description: The orientation angle (in radians) that the player should face after
      teleporting.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Player Teleportation
    code: "void BossAI::JustDied(Unit* who)\n{\n    if (who && who->IsPlayer())\n\
      \    {\n        DoTeleportPlayer(&who, 1234.5f, 6789.0f, 100.0f, 0.0f);\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Teleporting Player to Boss Encounter Position
    code: "void InstanceScript::OnPlayerEnter(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player)\n\
      \    {\n        float x = 500.0f;\n        float y = 600.0f;\n        float\
      \ z = 700.0f;\n        float o = M_PI / 2; // 90 degrees\n        DoTeleportPlayer(&player,\
      \ x, y, z, o);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs an immediate teleport without any visual effects or
    movement animation. It's recommended to use this method carefully as it bypasses
    normal movement checks and collision detection. The unit parameter should always
    be validated before use to prevent crashes. This function is typically called
    from within AI scripts during combat or event handling.
  warnings: Using this method with invalid coordinates may cause the player to become
    stuck or invisible in the world. Always ensure that the destination coordinates
    are valid and accessible. Never call this method directly on non-player units
    unless you're certain about the behavior. Be cautious when teleporting players
    during combat as it can disrupt gameplay balance.
