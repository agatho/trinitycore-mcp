  class: BeastMasteryHunterRefactored
  method: GetOptimalPosition
  signature: int BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::GetOptimalPosition(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal position for a beast mastery hunter to
    maintain maximum damage output.
  description: The GetOptimalPosition method determines the best location for a beast
    mastery hunter to stand during combat, considering factors such as pet positioning,
    target distance, and environmental obstacles. This method is crucial for optimizing
    damage per second (DPS) in both single-target and multi-target scenarios. It evaluates
    the hunter's current state, including pet health, available abilities, and tactical
    positioning to return a calculated optimal position value that can be used by
    the AI or game engine to guide movement decisions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the optimal position index or identifier.
    A positive value indicates a valid position, while negative values may indicate
    failure conditions such as invalid state or unavailable positioning data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int optimalPos = hunter.GetOptimalPosition(nullptr);\nif (optimalPos >=\
      \ 0) {\n    // Move to the calculated optimal position\n    std::cout << \"\
      Moving to position: \" << optimalPos << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ error case\n    std::cout << \"Failed to calculate optimal position\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal AI state tracking and may require
    the hunter to be in a combat-ready state for accurate calculations. The returned
    position value should be interpreted within the context of the game's positioning
    system.
  warnings: The method signature indicates a parameter that is not used (int * param0),
    which might suggest incomplete implementation or legacy code. Ensure proper null
    checking when calling this method.
