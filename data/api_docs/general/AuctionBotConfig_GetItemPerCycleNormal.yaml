documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of items processed per cycle for normal auction bot operations.
  description: The GetItemPerCycleNormal method retrieves the configured number of
    items that the Auction Bot will process during each operational cycle under normal
    conditions. This value determines how many items are evaluated, listed, or managed
    by the bot in a single iteration. It is typically used to control the bot's workload
    and prevent system overload during high-activity periods. The returned value is
    usually defined in the auction house configuration settings and may vary depending
    on server performance and administrative settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of items processed per cycle for
    normal auction bot operations. This value should be a positive integer, typically
    ranging from 10 to 1000 depending on configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 itemsPerCycle = auctionBotConfig.GetItemPerCycleNormal();

      LOG_INFO("auctionbot", "Items per cycle: {}", itemsPerCycle);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the bot's periodic execution routine
    to determine batch size. The value returned may be influenced by server load,
    configuration files, or runtime adjustments made through in-game commands or database
    updates.
