  signature: OptimizationStrategy PerformanceOptimizer::CreateRandomStrategy(OptimizationGoal
    goal) const
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a random optimization strategy based on the specified
    goal.
  description: The CreateRandomStrategy method generates a new OptimizationStrategy
    object using a random selection process. This method is typically used in performance
    optimization scenarios where randomized approaches are beneficial, such as in
    AI decision-making or load balancing within the TrinityCore framework. The generated
    strategy adheres to the provided OptimizationGoal, which defines the objective
    of the optimization. The randomness ensures varied behavior while maintaining
    adherence to the specified goal. This method does not modify any internal state
    and is designed to be deterministic when given the same input parameters.
  parameters: []
  returns: An OptimizationStrategy object representing a randomly generated strategy
    that aligns with the specified optimization goal. The returned strategy can be
    used for performance tuning, AI behavior selection, or other optimization tasks
    within the TrinityCore system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      OptimizationGoal goal = OptimizationGoal::kCPUUtilization;

      OptimizationStrategy strategy = optimizer.CreateRandomStrategy(goal);

      // Use the generated strategy for performance tuning'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on a pseudo-random number generator and may produce different
    results across multiple invocations. The randomness is seeded based on system
    time or other environmental factors to ensure varied outputs. For testing purposes,
    consider using a fixed seed for reproducible results.
