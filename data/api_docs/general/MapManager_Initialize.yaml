  class: MapManager
  method: Initialize
  signature: void MapManager::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the MapManager instance, setting up internal data structures
    and loading map configurations.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the MapManager for operation by initializing
    its internal state, loading map-related configurations, and preparing necessary
    data structures for managing game maps. This method is typically called during
    server startup to ensure that all map-related systems are properly configured
    before gameplay begins. It handles the setup of map instances, tile loading, and
    any required pre-processing of map data. The initialization process may involve
    reading configuration files, allocating memory for map data, and establishing
    connections or references needed for map management operations.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'MapManager* mapMgr = new MapManager();

      mapMgr->Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization. Repeated
    calls may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. The method is typically
    invoked internally by the TrinityCore server framework and may not need explicit
    calling in most custom implementations.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times without proper cleanup can cause memory
    leaks or inconsistent internal state. This method must be called before any map-related
    operations are performed.
