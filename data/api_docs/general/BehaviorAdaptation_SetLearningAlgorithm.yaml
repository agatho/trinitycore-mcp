  class: BehaviorAdaptation
  method: SetLearningAlgorithm
  signature: void BehaviorAdaptation::SetLearningAlgorithm(LearningAlgorithm algo)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the learning algorithm for behavior adaptation in AI systems.
  description: The SetLearningAlgorithm method configures the learning algorithm used
    by the BehaviorAdaptation class to modify and improve NPC or creature behaviors
    over time. This method allows developers to specify which machine learning or
    adaptive algorithm should be employed for behavior modification, such as Q-learning,
    reinforcement learning, or other AI-driven adaptation techniques. The setting
    affects how creatures respond to environmental stimuli, player actions, and game
    events in a dynamic manner. This configuration is typically applied during initialization
    or when transitioning between different behavioral states within the AI framework.
  parameters:
  - name: algo
    description: The learning algorithm to be used for behavior adaptation. This parameter
      specifies the type of algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA, etc.) that will govern
      how the AI adapts its behavior based on rewards and environmental feedback.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Q-Learning Algorithm
    code: 'BehaviorAdaptation* behavior = new BehaviorAdaptation();

      LearningAlgorithm algo = LEARNING_ALGORITHM_Q_LEARNING;

      behavior->SetLearningAlgorithm(algo);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic NPC Behavior
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...; // Get a reference to an AI-controlled creature

      BehaviorAdaptation* behavior = creature->GetBehaviorAdaptation();

      LearningAlgorithm algo = LEARNING_ALGORITHM_REINFORCEMENT;

      behavior->SetLearningAlgorithm(algo);

      // Creature will now adapt its behavior using reinforcement learning'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before the AI system begins executing behaviors
    to ensure proper initialization. The learning algorithm affects runtime performance
    and memory usage, particularly with complex algorithms like neural networks or
    deep Q-learning. It's recommended to set this during creature creation or AI module
    initialization rather than dynamically during gameplay.
  warnings: Setting an invalid or unsupported learning algorithm may cause undefined
    behavior or crashes in the AI system. Ensure that the specified algorithm is compatible
    with the current implementation and available resources. Changing algorithms mid-execution
    could lead to inconsistent behavior patterns or loss of previously learned states.
