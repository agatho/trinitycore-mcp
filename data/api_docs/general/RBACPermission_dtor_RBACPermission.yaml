  signature: void RBACPermission::~RBACPermission()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an RBACPermission instance and releases its allocated resources.
  description: The destructor for the RBACPermission class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources associated with the permission
    object. In TrinityCore's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system, this method
    ensures proper deallocation when a RBACPermission object goes out of scope or
    is explicitly deleted. This is an essential part of memory management within the
    authentication and authorization framework of the server.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of RBACPermission object
    code: 'RBACPermission* perm = new RBACPermission();

      // ... use the permission object

      delete perm; // Triggers ~RBACPermission()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-allocated RBACPermission destruction
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    RBACPermission perm;\n    // ... use perm\n\
      \    // ~RBACPermission() automatically called when perm goes out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called during object destruction. Developers
    should not manually invoke this destructor unless performing low-level memory
    management. The RBAC system relies on proper object lifecycle management to prevent
    memory leaks in the authentication subsystem.
