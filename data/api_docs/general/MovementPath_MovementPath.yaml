documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new MovementPath object with default values.
  description: The MovementPath constructor initializes a new instance of the MovementPath
    class. This constructor sets up the internal state of the movement path object,
    preparing it for use in handling NPC or creature movement paths within the TrinityCore
    framework. The initialization typically includes setting default values for path
    points, movement type, and other internal tracking variables necessary for path
    following mechanics. This method is automatically called when creating a new MovementPath
    instance and should not be invoked manually unless specifically required by advanced
    custom scripting scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new MovementPath instance
    code: 'MovementPath* path = new MovementPath();

      // The path object is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using MovementPath in a custom AI behavior
    code: "class CustomAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void InitializePath()\n\
      \    {\n        MovementPath path;\n        // Use path for custom movement\
      \ logic\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the MovementPath class initialization sequence.
    It's important to note that while this constructor initializes the object, it
    does not populate the actual path data - that requires additional methods or data
    loading. The MovementPath class is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related
    systems such as WaypointManager and CreatureMovement.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly unless implementing custom movement
    logic. In most cases, MovementPath objects are created and managed automatically
    by the TrinityCore movement system. Manual instantiation may lead to incomplete
    initialization if proper path data is not subsequently set.
