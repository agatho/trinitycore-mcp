  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: SetPerformanceWeights
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::SetPerformanceWeights(const std::array<double,
    10> & weights)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the performance weights used by the bot analytics system to evaluate
    and score bot behavior.
  description: The SetPerformanceWeights method configures a set of 10 double-precision
    floating-point values that define how different aspects of bot performance are
    weighted when calculating overall performance scores. These weights determine
    the relative importance of various metrics such as combat efficiency, resource
    management, quest completion, and other behavioral indicators. The method accepts
    an array of exactly 10 weights, which should typically sum to 1.0 for normalized
    scoring, though this is not enforced. This configuration directly impacts how
    the BotPerformanceAnalytics system evaluates bot effectiveness and can be used
    to fine-tune performance evaluation criteria based on specific gameplay goals
    or server requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: weights
    description: An array of exactly 10 double-precision floating-point values representing
      weights for different performance metrics. Each value should typically be between
      0 and 1, with the sum of all weights ideally equal to 1.0 for normalized scoring.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'std::array<double, 10> weights = {0.2, 0.15, 0.25, 0.1, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05,
      0.05, 0.03, 0.02};

      botAnalytics.SetPerformanceWeights(weights);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Custom Weight Configuration
    code: 'std::array<double, 10> combatFocusWeights = {0.4, 0.0, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1,
      0.1, 0.05, 0.05, 0.0};

      botAnalytics.SetPerformanceWeights(combatFocusWeights);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The weights array must contain exactly 10 elements; any deviation will likely
    cause undefined behavior or runtime errors. The method does not validate that
    the weights sum to 1.0, but for meaningful normalized scoring, this is recommended.
    This method should be called before performance analytics are actively computed
    to ensure proper weight application.
  warnings: Passing an array with fewer or more than 10 elements will result in undefined
    behavior. Setting all weights to zero may cause division-by-zero errors during
    scoring calculations. Modifying weights while active bot evaluations are occurring
    can lead to inconsistent performance metrics.
