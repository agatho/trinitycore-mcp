documentation:
  brief: Returns the game object associated with a specific spell ID.
  description: This method retrieves the GameObject that is linked to a given spell
    ID. It is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to access
    game objects that are triggered by spells, particularly those related to quest
    objectives or environmental interactions. The method operates within the context
    of a Unit's spell casting or interaction behavior, where the GameObject may be
    created or associated with a specific spell during gameplay. This function is
    essential for handling spell-related game object interactions and can be used
    in conjunction with other methods that manage spell effects or game object states.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the GameObject associated with the specified spell
    ID, or nullptr if no such GameObject exists. The returned GameObject may be null
    if the spell ID does not correspond to any active game object in the current context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "GameObject *go = unit->GetGameObject(12345);\nif (go)\n{\n    // Use the\
      \ GameObject\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with spell-related game object
    creation or management. Performance considerations include checking for null returns
    and ensuring that the spell ID corresponds to a valid GameObject before accessing
    its properties.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may return nullptr if no GameObject
    exists for the specified spell ID, which could lead to dereference errors if not
    properly handled. Also, ensure that the spell ID is valid and corresponds to an
    active game object in the current context.
