documentation:
  brief: Sends garrison information to the player's client
  description: The SendInfo method is responsible for transmitting all relevant garrison
    data to the player's client, including garrison level, available buildings, followers,
    and other related information. This method is typically invoked when a player
    interacts with a garrison or when the garrison state needs to be synchronized
    with the client. The method ensures that the player's UI accurately reflects their
    current garrison status and available options.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Garrison Interaction
    code: "void HandleGarrisonInteraction(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->GetGarrison())\n\
      \    {\n        player->GetGarrison()->SendInfo();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers a series of network packets to update the client's
    garrison UI. It should only be called when the garrison data is valid and up-to-date.
    The method may internally check for changes in garrison state before sending updates.
