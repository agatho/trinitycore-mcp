documentation:
  brief: Processes a missile trajectory collision packet received from a client, handling
    the impact of spell projectiles.
  description: The HandleMissileTrajectoryCollision method is responsible for processing
    incoming collision data from a client's spell projectile trajectory. This method
    typically handles cases where a spell projectile (such as a ranged attack or spell)
    has collided with a target or environment. It validates the packet data, processes
    the collision event, and may trigger additional game mechanics such as damage
    application, visual effects, or status updates. The method is part of the WorldSession's
    packet handling system and is invoked when the client reports that a missile trajectory
    has resulted in a collision. This functionality is crucial for maintaining synchronization
    between client and server regarding spell effects and combat outcomes.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within WorldSession
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleMissileTrajectoryCollision(WorldPackets::Spells::MissileTrajectoryCollision&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Validate packet data\n    if (!packet.TargetGUID)\n   \
      \     return;\n\n    // Process collision logic\n    Player* player = GetPlayer();\n\
      \    if (player)\n    {\n        // Apply spell effects or update combat state\n\
      \        // Example: Apply damage to target\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the WorldSession's packet processing
    pipeline. It assumes that the packet has already been validated by the network
    layer and contains valid data. The method may perform checks for target validity,
    spell casting state, and player permissions before proceeding with collision handling.
  warnings: Improper handling of this packet can lead to desynchronization between
    client and server, potentially causing incorrect damage application or visual
    glitches. Ensure that all target validation and permission checks are performed
    before processing the collision event.
