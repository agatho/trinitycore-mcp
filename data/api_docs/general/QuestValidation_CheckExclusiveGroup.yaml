  class: QuestValidation
  method: CheckExclusiveGroup
  signature: bool QuestValidation::CheckExclusiveGroup(const Quest * quest, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a quest is part of an exclusive group that conflicts with the player's
    current quests.
  description: The CheckExclusiveGroup method determines whether a given quest belongs
    to an exclusive group that would conflict with any currently active or completed
    quests in the player's quest log. In World of Warcraft, certain quests are marked
    as exclusive to prevent players from accepting multiple quests from the same group
    simultaneously. This method evaluates the exclusive group membership of the specified
    quest and verifies if it conflicts with existing quests in the player's log. The
    method returns true if there is no conflict, and false if the quest cannot be
    accepted due to exclusive group restrictions.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object being checked for exclusive group conflicts.
      Must not be null.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose quest log is being evaluated for
      conflicts. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the quest can be accepted without conflicting with exclusive
    groups in the player's quest log, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (QuestValidation::CheckExclusiveGroup(quest, player)) {\n    // Quest\
      \ can be accepted\n    player->AddQuest(quest);\n} else {\n    // Quest cannot\
      \ be accepted due to exclusive group conflict\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      This quest conflicts with another active quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Accept Logic
    code: "void Player::OnQuestAccept(Quest const* quest) {\n    if (!QuestValidation::CheckExclusiveGroup(quest,\
      \ this)) {\n        SendQuestInvalidReason(QUEST_INVALID_REASON_EXCLUSIVE_GROUP);\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with normal quest acceptance logic\n\
      \    AddQuest(quest);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during quest acceptance to prevent players
    from accepting quests that are mutually exclusive. It checks the database-defined
    exclusive group IDs and compares them against all active and completed quests
    in the player's log. The method does not modify any quest state but only performs
    validation.
  warnings: Ensure both parameters are non-null before calling this method, as passing
    null pointers will result in undefined behavior. This method should be called
    before attempting to add a quest to a player's log to avoid conflicts.
