  class: Map
  method: GetLiquidStatus
  signature: int Map::GetLiquidStatus(const PhaseShift & phaseShift, float x, float
    y, float z, int ReqLiquidType, int * data, float collisionHeight)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the liquid status at a specific position within the map
  description: The GetLiquidStatus method determines the type and level of liquid
    (such as water, lava, or solid ground) present at a given coordinate position
    in the world. It is used by the game engine to check whether a player or creature
    can move through a particular area based on liquid conditions. This method is
    essential for pathfinding and collision detection in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters:
  - name: phaseShift
    description: Represents the phase shift that defines the current phase of the
      map, which may affect how liquid data is interpreted.
  - name: x
    description: X coordinate position in the world where the liquid status is being
      checked.
  - name: y
    description: Y coordinate position in the world where the liquid status is being
      checked.
  - name: z
    description: Z coordinate position in the world where the liquid status is being
      checked.
  - name: ReqLiquidType
    description: Specifies the required liquid type to check for, such as water or
      lava. If set to -1, all types are considered.
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer that will receive the liquid data information
      upon successful completion.
  - name: collisionHeight
    description: The height at which collision occurs with the liquid surface; used
      for determining whether a unit can pass through.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the liquid status type. Possible values
    include 0 (no liquid), 1 (water), 2 (lava), or 3 (solid ground). A value of -1
    indicates an error or invalid data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: int liquidStatus = map->GetLiquidStatus(phaseShift, x, y, z, -1, &data,
      collisionHeight);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example with specific liquid type
    code: "int liquidStatus = map->GetLiquidStatus(phaseShift, x, y, z, 1, &data,\
      \ collisionHeight);\nif (liquidStatus == 1) {\n    // Water found at position\n\
      }\nelse if (liquidStatus == 2) {\n    // Lava found at position\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core collision detection system and should be
    used carefully during pathfinding calculations. Performance impact may occur when
    checking multiple positions simultaneously.
  warnings: The method assumes that the coordinates are valid and within map boundaries;
    invalid coordinates can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
