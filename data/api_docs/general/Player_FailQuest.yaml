documentation:
  brief: Fail a quest by its ID, marking it as failed and removing it from the player's
    quest log
  description: The FailQuest method is used to immediately fail a specific quest for
    a player. This method removes the quest from the player's active quest log and
    marks it as failed, preventing further progress on that quest. It is typically
    used when a quest needs to be abandoned or when a player fails to complete a quest
    due to time constraints or other game mechanics. The method does not trigger any
    quest completion events or rewards, but simply sets the quest status to failed.
  parameters:
  - name: quest_id
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to be failed. This must be a valid
      quest ID that exists in the player's quest log.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->FailQuest(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the quest is actually in the player's
    quest log. Calling it on a non-existent quest ID may result in undefined behavior
    or no effect. The method internally handles quest removal from the player's quest
    log and updatess the quest status to failed.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring that the quest exists in the player's
    quest log can lead to invalid memory access or other undefined behavior. It should
    only be used when the quest is confirmed to be active.
