documentation:
  brief: Logs the current threat status of all units in the coordinator's threat list.
  description: The LogThreatStatus method outputs detailed information about the threat
    levels of all units managed by this ThreatCoordinator instance. This function
    is typically used for debugging and monitoring purposes to understand how threat
    is being calculated and maintained within the AI system. It iterates through all
    tracked units and logs their current threat values, target information, and other
    relevant status data. The method does not modify any internal state but provides
    diagnostic output that can be useful during development or troubleshooting of
    NPC behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Debug Context
    code: "void SomeAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    threatCoordinator.LogThreatStatus();\n    // ... continue with AI logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for debugging and should not be called
    in performance-critical sections of code. The logging output may vary depending
    on the build configuration (debug vs release) and available logging verbosity
    settings.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently during gameplay can generate significant
    log output and potentially impact performance. It should only be used during development
    or when debugging specific threat-related issues.
