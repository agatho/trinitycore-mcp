  signature: void GroupInvitationHandler::~GroupInvitationHandler()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a GroupInvitationHandler instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ~GroupInvitationHandler destructor is responsible for cleaning
    up all resources allocated by the GroupInvitationHandler class. This includes
    removing any pending group invitations from internal tracking structures, releasing
    memory associated with invitation data, and ensuring no dangling references remain.
    The destructor is automatically invoked when a GroupInvitationHandler object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's group management
    system, this method ensures proper cleanup of invitation-related state to prevent
    memory leaks and maintain system stability during player session termination or
    group disbanding.

  - title: Automatic destruction of GroupInvitationHandler
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    GroupInvitationHandler handler;\n    // ...\
      \ use handler ...\n    // handler is automatically destroyed here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when objects go out
    of scope. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless performing
    explicit object destruction in dynamic allocation scenarios.
