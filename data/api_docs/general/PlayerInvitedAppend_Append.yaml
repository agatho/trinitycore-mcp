  brief: Appends player invitation data to a channel notification packet
  description: The Append method populates a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet with player invitation information. This method is typically used in the
    context of WoW's channel system to notify players about new invitations or changes
    in channel membership. The method operates on a const object and modifies the
    provided packet reference in-place. It likely handles serialization of invitation-related
    data such as player names, invitation status, or channel-specific metadata.

    code: 'PlayerInvitedAppend invited;

      WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      invited.Append(notifyPacket);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's internal channel management system and
    should only be called when processing player invitations. The method modifies
    the packet in-place, so ensure the packet object is properly initialized before
    calling.
