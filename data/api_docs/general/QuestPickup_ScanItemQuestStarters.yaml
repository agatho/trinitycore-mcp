  brief: Scans item quest starters for the player's current quest pickup state.
  description: The ScanItemQuestStarters method evaluates the items currently in a
    player's inventory to determine which quests can be started based on item requirements.
    This method is typically invoked during quest update cycles or when a player interacts
    with quest givers. It checks for items that have associated quest start conditions
    and updates the internal quest state accordingly. The method does not directly
    interact with the database but relies on cached quest data and item templates
    to perform its evaluation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest management system and should not

    interaction with quest givers or when inventory changes occur.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of its intended context may result in inconsistent
    quest states or unexpected behavior. Ensure that all related quest data is properly
    initialized before invoking this method.
