documentation:
  brief: Returns the creature addon data associated with this creature instance
  description: This method retrieves the CreatureAddon object that contains additional
    data specific to a creature, such as spawn parameters, movement patterns, and
    other creature-specific configurations. The returned pointer points to a const
    CreatureAddon structure which holds data about how the creature should behave
    in the game world, including its spawn location, movement type, and other configuration
    settings. This method is typically used during creature initialization or when
    accessing creature-specific data for gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to a const CreatureAddon structure which contains additional
    creature configuration data. Returns nullptr if no addon data exists for the creature
    or if the creature has not been properly initialized with addon data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "const CreatureAddon* addon = creature->GetCreatureAddon();\nif (addon)\n\
      {\n    // Access addon data\n    uint32 spawnId = addon->SpawnId;\n    uint32\
      \ movementType = addon->MovementType;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during creature initialization or when accessing
    creature-specific data for gameplay mechanics. The returned pointer should be
    checked for nullptr before dereferencing to avoid access violations. Performance
    considerations include that this method involves a lookup operation in the game
    world's creature database.
  warnings: The returned pointer may be nullptr if the creature has not been properly
    initialized with addon data, or if the creature is not associated with any addon
    data. Always check for null before dereferencing to avoid access violations.
