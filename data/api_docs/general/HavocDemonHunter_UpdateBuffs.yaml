  brief: Updates all active buff states and modifiers for the Havoc Demon Hunter.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for refreshing and applying all
    active buff effects, including temporary stat boosts, aura modifications, and
    combat-related enhancements specific to the Havoc Demon Hunter class. This method
    ensures that the player's current buff state is synchronized with their character's
    actual attributes and abilities. It typically runs during combat updates or when
    new buffs are applied, recalculating any modified stats such as attack power,
    critical strike chance, or movement speed. The method may also handle removal
    of expired buffs and updating visual indicators for active effects.

    buff status changes occur. It may trigger additional recalculations of player
    stats and abilities, so performance considerations are important in high-frequency
    scenarios.
