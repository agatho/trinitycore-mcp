  method: SetDPSConfig
  signature: void RoleBasedCombatPositioning::SetDPSConfig(const DPSPositionConfig
    & config)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the DPS positioning configuration for role-based combat behavior.
  description: The SetDPSConfig method configures the positioning parameters used
    by the RoleBasedCombatPositioning system for DPS characters during combat. This
    method allows developers to define specific positioning rules, such as optimal
    distance from targets, preferred angles, and movement patterns that DPS players
    should follow. The configuration is applied immediately and affects subsequent
    combat behavior decisions made by the AI. This method is typically called during
    initialization or when dynamically adjusting player behavior based on encounter
    mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: config
    description: A const reference to a DPSPositionConfig object containing the positioning
      rules and parameters for DPS characters. This includes settings such as target
      distance thresholds, movement speed modifiers, and positioning priority values.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic DPS Configuration Setup
    code: 'DPSPositionConfig config;

      config.minDistance = 8.0f;

      config.maxDistance = 25.0f;

      config.preferredAngle = 0.0f;

      config.movementSpeedModifier = 1.2f;

      roleBasedCombat->SetDPSConfig(config);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic DPS Configuration Update
    code: 'DPSPositionConfig dynamicConfig;

      dynamicConfig.minDistance = 5.0f;

      dynamicConfig.maxDistance = 30.0f;

      dynamicConfig.preferredAngle = M_PI_4; // 45 degrees

      roleBasedCombat->SetDPSConfig(dynamicConfig);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method replaces the existing DPS configuration entirely. The configuration
    object should be properly initialized before calling this method to avoid undefined
    behavior. Changes made through this method take immediate effect on all active
    DPS characters using the RoleBasedCombatPositioning system.
  warnings: Calling this method while combat is in progress may cause immediate changes
    to character positioning, potentially disrupting ongoing combat actions. Ensure
    that configuration values are within reasonable bounds to prevent erratic movement
    behavior.
