documentation:
  brief: Updates the internal state and performs periodic logic for the WorldObject.
  description: The Heartbeat method is a core periodic update function called on WorldObject
    instances to maintain their internal state and execute time-based logic. It typically
    handles tasks such as updating movement states, processing AI behaviors, managing
    object visibility, and performing other time-sensitive operations that occur at
    regular intervals. This method is invoked by the game's main update loop and ensures
    that objects remain synchronized with the server's simulation state. The heartbeat
    mechanism allows for consistent timing of operations without requiring explicit
    timers or delays.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Heartbeat Call
    code: 'WorldObject* obj = ...;

      obj->Heartbeat();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Heartbeat in Update Loop Context
    code: "void WorldSession::Update()\n{\n    // Process all active objects\n   \
      \ for (auto& obj : m_activeObjects)\n    {\n        if (obj)\n            obj->Heartbeat();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically called by the server's main update cycle and
    should not be invoked directly from game logic unless specifically required. The
    frequency of heartbeat execution depends on the server's tick rate configuration.
    Implementations may vary between different object types (Player, Creature, GameObject,
    etc.) as each inherits specific heartbeat behaviors.
  warnings: Direct invocation of Heartbeat outside of the intended update cycle can
    cause unexpected behavior or synchronization issues. Avoid calling this method
    in tight loops or without proper context as it might interfere with the server's
    timing mechanisms.
