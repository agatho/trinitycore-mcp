  class: TradeSystem
  method: GetPlayerTrustLevel
  signature: float TradeSystem::GetPlayerTrustLevel(uint32 playerGuid, uint32 targetGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the trust level between two players involved in a
    trade.
  description: The GetPlayerTrustLevel method determines the degree of trust between
    a player and their trading partner based on various factors such as previous trade
    history, reputation, and interaction patterns. This value is typically used to
    influence trade mechanics, such as determining acceptable item restrictions, trade
    fee multipliers, or the likelihood of successful trades. The returned float value
    usually ranges from 0.0 (no trust) to 1.0 (maximum trust), though specific bounds
    may vary depending on implementation details. This method does not modify any
    game state and is purely informational.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose trust level is being
      evaluated.
  - name: targetGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the trading partner whose relationship
      with the player is assessed.
  returns: A float value representing the trust level between the two players, typically
    ranging from 0.0 (no trust) to 1.0 (maximum trust). Values outside this range
    may indicate special conditions or errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float trustLevel = tradeSystem->GetPlayerTrustLevel(12345, 67890);\nif\
      \ (trustLevel > 0.7f)\n{\n    // Allow advanced trade options\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"High trust level detected.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Trust Level for Trade Restrictions
    code: "uint32 playerGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nuint32 targetGuid\
      \ = targetPlayer->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nfloat trustLevel = tradeSystem->GetPlayerTrustLevel(playerGuid,\
      \ targetGuid);\n\nif (trustLevel < 0.3f)\n{\n    // Prevent high-value trades\n\
      \    player->SendNotification(\"Low trust level - limited trade options available.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on stored player data such as past transactions,
    reputation scores, and social interactions. It may be called frequently during
    trade sessions, so performance optimization is recommended. The exact algorithm
    for calculating trust levels is not specified but could involve weighted averages
    of historical data.
  warnings: Ensure that both GUIDs are valid before calling this method to avoid undefined
    behavior or incorrect results. This method should not be used in contexts where
    real-time updates are critical due to potential caching or delayed data synchronization.
