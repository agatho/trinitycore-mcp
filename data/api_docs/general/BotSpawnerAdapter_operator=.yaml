documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one BotSpawnerAdapter object to another
  description: The assignment operator for BotSpawnerAdapter performs a deep copy
    of all member variables from the source object to the target object. This method
    ensures that both objects maintain independent copies of their data, preventing
    shared references that could lead to unexpected behavior. In the context of TrinityCore's
    bot system, this operation is typically used when duplicating or reassigning bot
    spawner configurations, allowing for flexible management of multiple bot spawning
    setups without interference between instances.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotSpawnerAdapter object whose contents will be copied
      to this object
  returns: A reference to the current BotSpawnerAdapter object, enabling chained assignment
    operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Usage
    code: 'BotSpawnerAdapter spawner1;

      BotSpawnerAdapter spawner2 = spawner1; // Uses copy constructor

      spawner2 = spawner1; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'BotSpawnerAdapter adapter1, adapter2, adapter3;

      adapter1 = adapter2 = adapter3; // Chained assignment

      // All three objects now contain the same data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements a deep copy strategy to ensure that internal
    data structures are properly duplicated. The implementation should handle any
    dynamically allocated memory or complex member variables correctly to avoid memory
    leaks or dangling pointers.
