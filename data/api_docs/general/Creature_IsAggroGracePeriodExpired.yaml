  class: Creature
  method: IsAggroGracePeriodExpired
  signature: bool Creature::IsAggroGracePeriodExpired()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature's aggro grace period has expired, allowing
    it to enter combat.
  description: This method checks if the creature has completed its initial grace
    period during which it cannot be attacked by players or other creatures. The grace
    period is typically used to prevent immediate combat when a creature spawns or
    is summoned, giving it time to stabilize before entering aggressive state. Once
    the grace period expires, the creature can begin attacking targets that are within
    its aggro range. This method is crucial for controlling creature behavior and
    preventing premature combat situations in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the grace period has expired and the creature can enter
    combat, false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the creature's
    aggro state is active and it can attack targets within its range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->IsAggroGracePeriodExpired())\n{\n    // Creature can now\
      \ enter combat\n    // Perform actions like attacking target\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with creature AI behavior to
    control when creatures can begin attacking. The grace period is usually set during
    creature initialization and may vary based on creature type or difficulty settings.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it directly affects creature
    combat behavior. Incorrect usage could lead to premature combat situations or
    prevent creatures from properly entering combat state.
