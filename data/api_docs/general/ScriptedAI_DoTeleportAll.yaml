  class: ScriptedAI
  method: DoTeleportAll
  signature: void ScriptedAI::DoTeleportAll(float x, float y, float z, float o)
documentation:
  brief: Teleports all players within the AI's threat list to the specified location.
  description: The DoTeleportAll method is used in TrinityCore's ScriptedAI framework
    to instantly teleport all players who are currently on the AI's threat list to
    a designated position in the world. This method is typically invoked during scripted
    encounters or boss fights where it's necessary to reposition players for tactical
    reasons, such as moving them away from dangerous areas or into specific locations
    for mechanics. The teleportation occurs immediately without any animation or delay,
    and only affects players who are currently engaged with the AI through threat
    generation. Players not on the threat list will remain unaffected by this call.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the destination position in world space
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the destination position in world space
  - name: z
    description: The Z coordinate of the destination position in world space
  - name: o
    description: The orientation (heading) angle in radians for the target position
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a boss encounter
    code: "void BossAI::JustEngagedWith(Unit* who)\n{\n    // Teleport all players\
      \ to a safe location when combat begins\n    DoTeleportAll(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f,\
      \ 0.0f);\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  - title: Teleporting players to a specific mechanic position
    code: "void BossAI::DoSpecialMechanic()\n{\n    // Teleport all threat list players\
      \ to the center of the room\n    float centerX = GetPositionX();\n    float\
      \ centerY = GetPositionY();\n    float centerZ = GetPositionZ();\n    DoTeleportAll(centerX,\
      \ centerY, centerZ, 0.0f);\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only affects players who are currently on the AI's threat list.
    It does not teleport players who are in different phases or zones. The teleportation
    is immediate and bypasses normal movement restrictions. The orientation parameter
    'o' should be specified in radians, where 0 represents facing east, pi/2 faces
    north, pi faces west, and 3*pi/2 faces south.
  warnings: Using this method during active combat can cause unexpected behavior if
    players are not properly prepared for the sudden teleportation. It's recommended
    to use this method only when the encounter state allows for safe player positioning.
    Be cautious with coordinates that may place players in solid geometry or out of
    bounds areas.
