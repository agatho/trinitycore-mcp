  class: GameObjectAI
  method: SetGUID
  signature: void GameObjectAI::SetGUID(const int & guid, int32 id)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the GUID of a game object AI instance with an associated identifier.
  description: The SetGUID method assigns a unique identifier (GUID) to a GameObjectAI
    instance, typically used to track or reference specific game objects within the
    TrinityCore framework. This method allows for linking a game object's internal
    identifier with additional metadata or context through the optional id parameter.
    It is commonly invoked during object initialization or when establishing relationships
    between different game entities. The GUID serves as a persistent handle for identifying
    objects across server sessions and world updates, while the id parameter can be
    used to categorize or tag the GUID for specialized handling.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the game object. This is typically
      a 32-bit integer that uniquely identifies the object within the game world.
  - name: id
    description: An optional identifier used to categorize or tag the GUID. This can
      be used for specialized handling or grouping of objects with similar properties
      or roles.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in GameObjectAI implementation
    code: "class MyGameObjectAI : public GameObjectAI {\npublic:\n    void Initialize()\
      \ override {\n        SetGUID(12345, 0); // Assign GUID and default ID\n   \
      \ }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using SetGUID with custom ID for object categorization
    code: "class QuestGiverGameObjectAI : public GameObjectAI {\npublic:\n    void\
      \ OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest) override {\n        SetGUID(player->GetGUID().GetRawValue(),\
      \ quest->GetQuestId()); // Store player GUID with quest ID\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the initialization phase of a GameObjectAI.
    The GUID parameter should be a valid object identifier from the game world, and
    the id parameter can be used to implement custom logic based on object types or
    roles. Consider thread safety when calling this method in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID being set is valid and corresponds to an actual GameObject
    in the world. Incorrect GUIDs may lead to undefined behavior or failed object
    references. Avoid setting duplicate GUIDs unless intentionally designed for specific
    game mechanics.
