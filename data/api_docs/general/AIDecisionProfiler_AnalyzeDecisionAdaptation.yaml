  class: AIDecisionProfiler
  method: AnalyzeDecisionAdaptation
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::AnalyzeDecisionAdaptation(uint32_t botGuid,
    BotAIDecisionProfile & profile)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and adapts AI decision-making behavior for a specified bot based
    on its profile.
  description: The AnalyzeDecisionAdaptation method evaluates the current AI decision-making
    patterns of a bot identified by its GUID, using the provided BotAIDecisionProfile
    to determine how the bot's behavior should be adjusted or optimized. This method
    is typically used in dynamic AI systems where bots need to adapt their strategies
    based on performance data or changing game conditions. It processes the decision
    profile to identify areas for improvement and modifies the bot's internal state
    accordingly. The method does not return any value but updates the bot's decision-making
    framework in-place.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose AI decisions are being
      analyzed and adapted. Must correspond to a valid active bot within the game
      world.
  - name: profile
    description: Reference to the BotAIDecisionProfile containing decision data, performance
      metrics, and behavioral patterns used for analysis and adaptation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AI Decision Adaptation
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      BotAIDecisionProfile profile;

      // Assume profile is populated with decision data

      profiler.AnalyzeDecisionAdaptation(botGuid, profile);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adapting Bot Behavior Based on Performance Metrics
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      BotAIDecisionProfile profile;

      profile.SetDecisionCount(100);

      profile.SetSuccessRate(0.75f);

      profiler.AnalyzeDecisionAdaptation(botGuid, profile);

      // Bot''s decision logic is now adapted based on the provided performance data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot with the specified GUID exists and is currently
    active in the game world. It modifies internal AI state directly without returning
    a new profile, so any changes made are persistent within the bot's context. The
    performance impact of this method depends on the complexity of the BotAIDecisionProfile
    being analyzed.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or inactive bot GUID may result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the BotAIDecisionProfile is properly
    initialized before passing it to this method, as malformed data could lead to
    incorrect adaptation logic.
