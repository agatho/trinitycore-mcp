documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell effect creates an area aura.
  description: 'The IsAreaAuraEffect method checks if the current spell effect is
    of a type that generates an area aura. In World of Warcraft''s TrinityCore, area
    auras are effects that apply to multiple targets within a specified radius, such
    as healing aoe spells or damage-over-time effects that spread across enemies.
    This method returns true if the spell effect is classified as an area aura effect,
    which typically involves effects like ''Apply Aura: Area Effect'' or similar mechanics.
    The check is based on the spell effect''s inherent properties and does not require
    any runtime parameters or context.'
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell effect creates an area aura; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Logic
    code: "if (spellInfo->GetEffect(0)->IsAreaAuraEffect()) {\n    // Handle area\
      \ aura specific logic\n    // e.g., apply effect to all targets in radius\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Effects
    code: "for (uint8 i = 0; i < spellInfo->GetEffects(); ++i) {\n    if (spellInfo->GetEffect(i)->IsAreaAuraEffect())\
      \ {\n        // Process area aura effect\n        sLog->outString(\"Effect %u\
      \ is an area aura\", i);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spell effect type definitions within TrinityCore.
    It's important to note that not all area effects are necessarily classified as
    'area aura' effects in the codebase, so this check should be used carefully when
    distinguishing between different types of area-based spells.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method for logic that depends on exact spell
    behavior, as some spells may have complex combinations of effects where only one
    effect is an area aura while others are not. This method does not account for
    conditional or dynamic aura application.
