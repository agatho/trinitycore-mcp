documentation:
  brief: Processes quest objectives for a bot AI instance, updating progress and handling
    completion conditions.
  description: The ProcessQuestObjectives method in the QuestStrategy class is responsible
    for evaluating and managing the current state of quest objectives assigned to
    a bot AI. It iterates through active quest objectives, checks their completion
    status based on the bot's actions and environment, and updates internal tracking
    structures accordingly. This method typically integrates with the broader AI decision-making
    system to ensure that bots progress through quests in a logical and game-appropriate
    manner. The method does not directly interact with the player or database but
    modifies internal AI state related to quest management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within bot AI processing loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    questStrategy.ProcessQuestObjectives(this);\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the bot's AI update cycle and may
    be invoked multiple times per tick depending on the AI implementation. It assumes
    that quest data has already been initialized and that the bot has valid quest
    information loaded in its internal state.
  warnings: Improper invocation of this method without proper initialization of quest
    data or AI context can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all
    required quest objectives are properly registered before calling this method.
