  signature: void InterruptDatabase::LoadPvPSpells()
documentation:
  brief: Loads PvP spell data from the database into memory for use in combat mechanics.
  description: The LoadPvPSpells method initializes and populates internal data structures
    with PvP-related spell information stored in the TrinityCore database. This method
    is typically called during server startup or database reload operations to ensure
    that all applicable PvP spells are available for processing during player versus
    player encounters. It retrieves spell data including spell IDs, cooldowns, and
    PvP-specific modifiers from the database tables and caches them for fast access
    during gameplay. The method performs necessary validation and error handling to
    ensure data integrity before making the spell information available to the core
    game systems.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'InterruptDatabase* interruptDB = new InterruptDatabase();

      interruptDB->LoadPvPSpells(); // Loads PvP spell data from database'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the database connection is established
    and valid. It's typically invoked as part of the server initialization sequence
    before gameplay begins. The method may block briefly during database queries,
    so it's recommended to call it during server startup rather than runtime.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate data entries. Ensure that any existing PvP spell data
    is properly cleared before reloading.
