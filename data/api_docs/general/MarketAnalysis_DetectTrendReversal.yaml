  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: DetectTrendReversal
  signature: bool MarketAnalysis::DetectTrendReversal(const int & prices)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes market price data to determine if a trend reversal has occurred.
  description: The DetectTrendReversal method evaluates historical price data within
    the MarketAnalysis class to identify potential trend reversals. This functionality
    is crucial for in-game economic modeling and player-driven market prediction systems.
    The method examines price movements over time, comparing recent trends against
    established patterns to detect significant shifts that may indicate a change in
    market direction. It typically utilizes technical analysis algorithms such as
    moving averages or momentum indicators to make this determination. The method
    requires valid price data to be available within the class instance before execution.
  parameters:
  - name: prices
    description: A constant reference to an integer representing the current market
      price data to analyze for trend reversal patterns.
  returns: Returns true if a trend reversal is detected based on the analysis of the
    provided price data; otherwise returns false. The detection logic may consider
    factors such as price momentum, moving average crossovers, or other technical
    indicators to determine reversal points.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trend Reversal Detection
    code: "MarketAnalysis analyzer;\nint currentPrice = 1500;\nbool isReversal = analyzer.DetectTrendReversal(currentPrice);\n\
      if (isReversal) {\n    // Handle trend reversal logic\n    std::cout << \"Potential\
      \ market trend reversal detected.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal data structures that store historical
    price information. It may require previous calls to populate price history before
    accurate trend analysis can be performed. The exact algorithm used for detection
    is not specified but would typically involve comparing current price behavior
    against established market patterns.
  warnings: The method's accuracy depends heavily on the quality and quantity of historical
    price data stored within the MarketAnalysis instance. Using this method without
    sufficient price history may lead to false positives or negatives in trend reversal
    detection.
