  class: WaypointMovementGenerator
  method: GetResetPosition
  signature: bool WaypointMovementGenerator::GetResetPosition(Unit * param0, float
    & x, float & y, float & z)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and retrieves the reset position for a waypoint movement generator,
    returning true if successful.
  description: The GetResetPosition method determines the coordinates where a unit
    should return to when resetting its waypoint path. This is typically used in AI
    behavior for creatures following predefined paths. The method modifies the provided
    x, y, and z float references with the calculated reset position values. It returns
    true if the reset position was successfully determined and populated, or false
    if the operation failed due to invalid parameters or internal state issues. This
    functionality is crucial for ensuring proper creature movement behavior when path
    loops or resets occur in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Unit object for which the reset position is being
      calculated. This represents the creature or NPC whose waypoint movement path
      needs to be reset.
  returns: Returns true if the reset position was successfully calculated and stored
    in the provided coordinates, false otherwise. A return value of false typically
    indicates invalid input parameters or internal errors preventing position calculation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* creature = ...; // Some creature with waypoint movement\nfloat resetX,\
      \ resetY, resetZ;\nif (waypointGenerator->GetResetPosition(creature, resetX,\
      \ resetY, resetZ)) {\n    // Use the calculated reset position\n    printf(\"\
      Reset position: (%f, %f, %f)\\n\", resetX, resetY, resetZ);\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Handle error case\n    printf(\"Failed to calculate reset position\\n\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI movement system and should only be called on
    units that are actively using waypoint movement generators. The reset position
    typically corresponds to the starting point of the waypoint path or a designated
    anchor point in the creature's movement pattern.
  warnings: Ensure that the Unit pointer passed as parameter is valid and not null
    before calling this method, as passing an invalid pointer may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. This method modifies the provided coordinate references directly,
    so make sure these variables are properly initialized before use.
