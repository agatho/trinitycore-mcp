documentation:
  brief: Stops the auto-repeat spell from being cast on the target.
  description: This method sends a cancel signal to the client when an auto-repeat
    spell is interrupted or stopped, typically used when a player's target changes
    or when the spell is no longer valid. It ensures that the client properly stops
    the auto-repeat behavior and updates the UI accordingly. The method is commonly
    invoked during combat situations where auto-repeat spells are interrupted by damage
    or other actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SendAutoRepeatCancel(nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically called internally by TrinityCore when auto-repeat
    spells are interrupted or when the target changes. It's important to note that
    this method does not directly affect spell casting but rather communicates with
    the client to stop auto-repeat behavior.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player's auto-repeat spell
    is being canceled, otherwise it may cause UI inconsistencies or unexpected behavior
    in the client.
