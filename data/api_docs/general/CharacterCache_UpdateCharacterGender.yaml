  class: CharacterCache
  method: UpdateCharacterGender
  signature: void CharacterCache::UpdateCharacterGender(const int & guid, uint8 gender)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the gender of a character in the cache using the provided GUID.
  description: The UpdateCharacterGender method modifies the stored gender information
    for a specific character identified by its globally unique identifier (GUID).
    This method is typically used to synchronize character data between the database
    and in-memory cache, ensuring that gender changes made in the game world are reflected
    in the cache. The operation updates only the cached copy of the character's gender
    and does not directly interact with the database unless explicitly handled by
    the calling code. This method assumes that the GUID corresponds to a valid character
    entry in the cache.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: A constant reference to the globally unique identifier (GUID) of
      the character whose gender is being updated. The GUID uniquely identifies the
      character within the game world.
  - name: gender
    description: The new gender value to be stored for the character. Valid values
      are typically 0 for male, 1 for female, and 2 for none or unspecified.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update a Character's Gender
    code: 'CharacterCache* cache = CharacterCache::Instance();

      uint32 characterGuid = 12345;

      uint8 newGender = GENDER_FEMALE;

      cache->UpdateCharacterGender(characterGuid, newGender);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on an in-memory cache and does not persist changes to
    the database. It is expected that the calling code will handle database synchronization
    if necessary. The method should be used carefully to avoid inconsistencies between
    cached and database data.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID provided corresponds to an existing character entry
    in the cache, otherwise behavior may be undefined. Also, this method does not
    validate the gender value; it's up to the caller to ensure that the value is valid
    for the game's gender system.
