  class: LFGBotManager
  method: Update
  signature: void LFGBotManager::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the LFG bot manager state and processes queued requests.
  description: The Update method is responsible for maintaining the internal state
    of the LFGBotManager by processing any pending requests, updating timers, and
    managing the overall workflow of the LFG (Looking for Group) bot system. This
    method is typically called from the game loop at regular intervals to ensure that
    all bot-related activities are handled in a timely manner. It manages the queuing
    and execution of LFG operations such as joining groups, leaving groups, or handling
    player interactions with the LFG system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: LFGBotManager::instance()->Update(1000); // Called every second
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other update logic...\n\
      \    lfgBotManager->Update(diff);\n    // Other update logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the main game loop to ensure
    proper handling of LFG bot operations. It's designed to be lightweight and non-blocking,
    but frequent calls may impact performance if the internal processing becomes heavy.
  warnings: Do not call this method from multiple threads simultaneously without proper
    synchronization as it may lead to race conditions in the LFG bot state management.
