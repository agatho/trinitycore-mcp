  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: DistributeObjectiveTargets
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::DistributeObjectiveTargets(Group * group, uint32
    questId, uint32 objectiveIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Distributes quest objective targets to group members within the specified
    group.
  description: The DistributeObjectiveTargets method is responsible for sending quest
    objective updates to all players in a given group when a specific quest's objective
    index changes. This functionality ensures that group members remain synchronized
    with the current state of shared quest progress, particularly for objectives that
    affect multiple players such as killing creatures or collecting items. The method
    typically gets invoked when an objective is completed or modified, and it handles
    the necessary network communication to update all relevant players in the group.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the members who will receive
      the updated quest objective information. Must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest whose objective targets are being
      distributed. This ID must correspond to a valid active quest in the group member's
      quest log.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: The index of the specific objective within the quest that has been
      updated. Used to determine which portion of the quest progress needs to be synchronized
      among group members.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Distributing Objective Targets for a Group Quest
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    uint32 questId\
      \ = 12345;\n    uint32 objectiveIndex = 0;\n    sObjectMgr->DistributeObjectiveTargets(myGroup,\
      \ questId, objectiveIndex);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal packet sending mechanisms to communicate
    with players in the group. It may also perform checks to ensure that only players
    who are actively on the quest receive updates. The method is commonly used during
    quest progression events, such as when a creature is killed or an item is collected.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Group pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this method. Also, verify that the questId and objectiveIndex parameters correspond
    to actual active objectives in the group members' quest logs; otherwise, the behavior
    may be undefined or silently ignored.
