  signature: void MoveSplineInit::SetTransportExit()
documentation:
  brief: Configures the spline to handle exiting a transport vehicle during movement.
  description: The SetTransportExit method prepares the movement spline for a unit
    to exit from a transport vehicle. This method is typically invoked when a player
    or creature is scheduled to disembark from a vehicle such as a boat, zeppelin,
    or other transport object. It modifies internal spline parameters to ensure proper
    positioning and animation upon exit, handling the transition from transport-relative
    coordinates to world coordinates. The method ensures that the unit's movement
    path correctly reflects the exit point and direction from the transport.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for player exit from transport
    code: 'MoveSplineInit splineInit;

      splineInit.SetTransportExit();

      // This prepares the movement spline to handle exiting a transport vehicle.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the core movement system when
    a unit is scheduled to exit a transport. Developers should not typically call
    this directly unless implementing custom transport exit logic. The actual exit
    coordinates and orientation are determined by the transport's current state at
    the time of execution.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context (e.g., when not on a transport)
    may result in undefined behavior or incorrect movement paths. Ensure that the
    unit is actually on a transport before invoking this method.
