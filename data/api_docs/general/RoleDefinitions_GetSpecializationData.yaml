  method: GetSpecializationData
  signature: const SpecializationData & RoleDefinitions::GetSpecializationData(uint8
    classId, uint8 specId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves specialization data for a given class and specialization ID.
  description: The GetSpecializationData method retrieves the specialization data
    associated with a specific class and specialization ID. This method is typically
    used in TrinityCore to access predefined specialization information such as role,
    spell IDs, and other class-specific attributes. The returned reference points
    to internal static data structures that define how each specialization behaves
    within the game mechanics. This function does not perform any validation on input
    parameters and assumes valid class and spec IDs are provided. It is primarily
    used during player initialization, talent calculations, or when determining class-specific
    behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: classId
    description: The class identifier (e.g., CLASS_WARRIOR = 1, CLASS_PALADIN = 2,
      etc.) for which specialization data is requested.
  - name: specId
    description: The specialization identifier within the specified class. Each class
      has multiple specializations (e.g., Arms, Fury for Warriors).
  returns: A constant reference to a SpecializationData structure containing all relevant
    data for the requested class and specialization combination. The returned data
    includes role information, spell lists, and other class-specific attributes.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve specialization data for a Warrior's Arms spec
    code: 'const SpecializationData& data = RoleDefinitions::GetSpecializationData(CLASS_WARRIOR,
      SPEC_WARRIOR_ARMS);

      // Use data.role, data.spellIds, etc.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Access specialization role for a Mage's Fire spec
    code: 'const SpecializationData& mageFireSpec = RoleDefinitions::GetSpecializationData(CLASS_MAGE,
      SPEC_MAGE_FIRE);

      uint8 role = mageFireSpec.role;

      // role will be set to appropriate value like ROLE_CASTER'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a reference to internal static data. The returned object
    should not be modified directly as it affects all users of that specialization
    data. This function is thread-safe for read operations but should not be used
    in multi-threaded contexts where data modification might occur.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned SpecializationData object as it's shared across
    the system. Passing invalid classId or specId values may result in undefined behavior
    or access to garbage data. Ensure that the provided IDs correspond to valid TrinityCore
    class and specialization definitions.
