  method: ExecuteSingleTargetRotation
  signature: void FrostMageRefactored::ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the frost mage's single-target rotation logic for the current target.
  description: The ExecuteSingleTargetRotation method implements the core spell casting
    logic for a frost mage when engaged in single-target combat. This method evaluates
    the current game state, including mana levels, cooldowns, and target conditions,
    to determine the optimal sequence of spells to cast. It typically utilizes abilities
    such as Frostbolt, Ice Lance, and other frost-specific mechanics to maximize damage
    output while maintaining proper resource management. The method assumes a valid
    target exists and is within casting range.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target's identifier or object reference. This parameter
      specifies which enemy unit the frost mage should cast spells upon during the
      rotation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void FrostMageAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(&m_currentTarget);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Rotation Logic
    code: "void FrostMageRefactored::ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(int* target)\n{\n\
      \    if (!target || *target <= 0)\n        return;\n    \n    Unit* pTarget\
      \ = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*m_creature, *target);\n    if (!pTarget || !pTarget->IsAlive())\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Execute frost mage rotation logic here\n    //\
      \ e.g., cast Frostbolt, Ice Lance, etc.\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the AI update loop of a frost mage
    NPC or player class. It requires that the target remains valid and alive for proper
    execution. The rotation logic may include checks for debuffs, buffs, and optimal
    spell timing based on current combat situation.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is properly initialized before calling
    this method to avoid null pointer dereferences. This method should not be called
    when the frost mage is not in combat or when there is no valid target present.
