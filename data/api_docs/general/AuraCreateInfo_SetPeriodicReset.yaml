  class: AuraCreateInfo

  signature: AuraCreateInfo & AuraCreateInfo::SetPeriodicReset(bool reset)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the aura's periodic timer should be reset.
  description: The SetPeriodicReset method configures whether an aura's periodic tick
    timer will be reset when the aura is applied or refreshed. This is particularly
    relevant for auras that have periodic effects such as damage over time or healing
    over time. When reset is enabled, the next periodic tick occurs at the full duration
    interval from the current time, rather than continuing from where it left off.
    This method returns a reference to the AuraCreateInfo object, enabling fluent
    interface style usage.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the AuraCreateInfo object, allowing for method chaining
    in fluent interfaces.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AuraCreateInfo createInfo;

      createInfo.SetPeriodicReset(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Fluent Interface Usage
    code: "AuraCreateInfo createInfo;\ncreateInfo.SetPeriodicReset(true)\n       \
      \ .SetDuration(30000)\n        .SetMaxStacks(5);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used when creating auras via AuraCreateInfo to control
    the behavior of periodic effects. It's important to understand that setting reset
    to true will cause the aura's next periodic tick to occur at the full duration
    interval, which can be crucial for maintaining proper spell mechanics in World
    of Warcraft.
