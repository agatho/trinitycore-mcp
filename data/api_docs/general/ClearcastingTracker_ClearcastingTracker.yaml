  class: ClearcastingTracker
  method: ClearcastingTracker
  signature: void ClearcastingTracker::ClearcastingTracker()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new ClearcastingTracker instance with default values.
  description: The ClearcastingTracker constructor initializes a new instance of the
    ClearcastingTracker class. This tracker is used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    emulation to monitor and manage the clearcasting buff state for applicable spells.
    The constructor sets up internal tracking variables and ensures proper initialization
    of the buff duration, stack count, and associated spell information. It prepares
    the tracker for use in spell casting mechanics where clearcasting effects modify
    spell behavior by removing mana costs or providing other beneficial effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new ClearcastingTracker instance
    code: "ClearcastingTracker* tracker = new ClearcastingTracker();\n// The tracker\
      \ is now initialized and ready for use in spell processing\nif (tracker)\n{\n\
      \    // Use the tracker in spell handling logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when creating a new ClearcastingTracker
    object. It does not perform any validation or initialization of external dependencies,
    so it's expected that the object will be properly configured before being used
    in gameplay mechanics.
