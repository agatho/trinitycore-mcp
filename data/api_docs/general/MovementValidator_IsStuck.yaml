  class: MovementValidator
  method: IsStuck
  signature: bool MovementValidator::IsStuck(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player bot is stuck in an invalid or unreachable location
    during movement.
  description: The IsStuck method evaluates the current state of a player bot to determine
    if it is trapped or unable to proceed with normal movement. This typically occurs
    when the bot's position becomes invalid due to terrain, collision, or other environmental
    factors that prevent further navigation. The method checks various movement-related
    conditions and returns true if the bot is deemed stuck, allowing the AI system
    to take corrective action such as repositioning or pathfinding.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player bot is detected as being stuck in an invalid
    location; otherwise returns false if the bot can continue moving normally.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if bot is stuck
    code: "if (movementValidator.IsStuck(bot)) {\n    // Handle stuck condition\n\
      \    bot->TeleportTo(bot->GetMapId(), bot->GetPositionX(), bot->GetPositionY(),\
      \ bot->GetPositionZ(), bot->GetOrientation());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within AI logic loops to monitor bot behavior
    and prevent infinite loops or invalid states. It may perform checks against collision
    detection, height differences, or movement path validity.
  warnings: The method assumes that the Player object passed in is valid and properly
    initialized. Using an uninitialized or invalid Player pointer may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes.
