  method: UpdateTargetPriorities
  signature: void GroupCoordination::UpdateTargetPriorities()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the priority levels of targets within the group coordination system
    based on current threat and positioning.
  description: The UpdateTargetPriorities method recalculates and adjusts the priority
    rankings of all targets currently tracked by the GroupCoordination instance. This
    process considers factors such as threat levels, distance from group members,
    and target aggro status to determine which enemies should be prioritized for targeting
    or control. The method is typically invoked during combat updates to ensure that
    the group's focus remains on the most dangerous or strategically important targets.
    It modifies internal target priority data structures but does not directly affect
    gameplay actions; instead, it prepares the coordination system for subsequent
    targeting decisions.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update Loop
    code: "void CombatUpdate()\n{\n    groupCoordination->UpdateTargetPriorities();\n\
      \    // Subsequent logic uses updated priorities\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently during combat scenarios,
    ideally at regular intervals to maintain up-to-date target prioritization. It
    performs internal calculations that may involve multiple group members and their
    respective threat tables, so performance should be considered in high-frequency
    contexts.
