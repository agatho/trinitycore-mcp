  signature: void MapManager::~MapManager()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the MapManager instance and cleans up all associated map data and
    resources.
  description: The MapManager destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up all
    map-related resources when the MapManager instance is destroyed. This includes
    releasing memory allocated for maps, unloading map data, and ensuring no dangling
    pointers or memory leaks occur. The destructor typically iterates through all
    active maps managed by this instance and calls their respective cleanup routines.
    In TrinityCore's architecture, this method ensures that when the server shuts
    down or when the MapManager is explicitly destroyed, all map-related subsystems
    are properly terminated without leaving resources in an inconsistent state.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction during server shutdown
    code: "void ServerShutdown()\n{\n    // MapManager instance is automatically destroyed\
      \ here\n    // All maps are cleaned up properly\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should never be called manually in normal operation as it's
    meant to be invoked automatically by the C++ runtime when the object goes out
    of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important that all map data is properly
    synchronized before destruction to avoid race conditions, especially in multi-threaded
    environments.
  warnings: Never call this destructor directly unless you're certain about the implications
    and have proper synchronization in place. Improper use can lead to memory corruption
    or resource leaks if other parts of the system are still using map data.
