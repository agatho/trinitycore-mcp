  signature: bool CombatSpecializationBase::ShouldUsePotions() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the combat specialization should use potions during combat.
  description: The ShouldUsePotions method evaluates the current combat specialization's
    configuration and state to decide if potion usage is appropriate. This decision
    is typically based on factors such as player health, mana levels, available potion
    types, and combat situation. The method is used by AI systems to make tactical
    decisions about when to consume consumable items during battle. It does not directly
    consume potions but rather provides a boolean flag indicating whether the specialization's
    logic supports potion usage at this time.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the combat specialization logic determines that using potions
    would be beneficial or appropriate in the current state; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (player->GetCombatSpecialization()->ShouldUsePotions()) {\n    // Logic\
      \ to use a potion\n    player->UsePotion();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Making
    code: "class CombatAI {\npublic:\n    void Update() {\n        auto specialization\
      \ = GetCombatSpecialization();\n        if (specialization->ShouldUsePotions())\
      \ {\n            // Check for available potions\n            if (HasAvailablePotion())\
      \ {\n                UsePotion();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within AI decision loops and may be influenced
    by various combat states such as low health, mana depletion, or specific class-based
    potion strategies. The implementation likely considers the specialization's role
    (e.g., tank, healer, damage dealer) and current threat level.
  warnings: Do not directly call this method to consume potions; it only returns a
    decision flag. Always verify that potions are actually available before attempting
    to use them.
