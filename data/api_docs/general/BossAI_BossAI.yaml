  class: BossAI
  method: BossAI
  signature: void BossAI::BossAI(int * creature, int bossId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the BossAI class with a creature pointer and boss identifier
    for AI behavior management.
  description: The BossAI constructor initializes the AI system for a boss creature
    within the TrinityCore framework. It sets up internal state variables including
    the creature reference and boss ID to enable proper AI behavior, event handling,
    and quest progression. This method is typically called during the creation or
    spawning of boss NPCs to establish their AI context. The initialization ensures
    that the boss can respond to combat events, manage phases, handle loot distribution,
    and interact with player actions according to predefined boss mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the boss NPC. This parameter
      is essential for accessing creature properties, health, movement, and AI state
      during gameplay.
  - name: bossId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific boss type. Used to distinguish
      between different bosses in the same instance or dungeon, enabling proper behavior
      customization and quest tracking.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic BossAI Initialization
    code: "class MyBossAI : public BossAI {\npublic:\n    MyBossAI(Creature* creature,\
      \ uint32 bossId) : BossAI(creature, bossId) {}\n};\n\nvoid OnSpawn() {\n   \
      \ Creature* boss = me->SummonCreature(BOSS_ENTRY, position);\n    new MyBossAI(boss,\
      \ BOSS_ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The BossAI constructor should only be called once during the creature's initialization
    phase. It assumes that the provided creature pointer is valid and not null. The
    bossId parameter must correspond to a known boss entry in the database to ensure
    proper AI behavior.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor multiple times on the same creature instance,
    as it may lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks. Ensure that the creature
    pointer remains valid throughout the boss's lifetime.
