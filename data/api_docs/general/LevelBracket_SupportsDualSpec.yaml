  signature: bool LevelBracket::SupportsDualSpec() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the level bracket supports dual specialization for player
    characters.
  description: The SupportsDualSpec method checks if a given level bracket allows
    players to have dual specializations. In World of Warcraft, dual specialization
    enables players to switch between two different talent builds without having to
    re-spec their talents. This functionality is typically restricted based on player
    level and game expansion content. The method returns true if the level bracket
    permits dual spec, false otherwise. This check is essential for determining valid
    talent system behavior within the game's progression mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the level bracket supports dual specialization, false if
    it does not support dual specialization.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Level Bracket Supports Dual Spec
    code: "LevelBracket* bracket = sObjectMgr->GetLevelBracket(50);\nif (bracket &&\
      \ bracket->SupportsDualSpec()) {\n    // Allow dual spec logic here\n    printf(\"\
      Dual specialization is supported at level 50\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ case where dual spec is not supported\n    printf(\"Dual specialization is\
      \ NOT supported at level 50\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks internal game data tables or configuration settings
    that define which levels support dual specialization. The implementation may vary
    based on expansion content and server configuration.
