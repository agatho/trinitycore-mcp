documentation:
  brief: Processes command-line interface commands for the world instance.
  description: The ProcessCliCommands method handles and executes any pending command-line
    interface (CLI) commands that have been queued for processing within the World
    instance. This method is typically invoked during the game loop to ensure that
    administrative or configuration commands entered via the console are properly
    interpreted and executed. It allows server operators to manage the game world
    dynamically through CLI input without requiring a dedicated UI or external tool.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void World::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    ProcessCliCommands();\n    // ... more update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called periodically within the main game loop to ensure
    timely processing of CLI commands. It's important to note that this method does
    not block execution; it processes all pending CLI commands synchronously but efficiently.
