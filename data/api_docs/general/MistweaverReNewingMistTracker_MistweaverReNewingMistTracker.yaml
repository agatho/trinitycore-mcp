  method: MistweaverReNewingMistTracker
  signature: void MistweaverReNewingMistTracker::MistweaverReNewingMistTracker()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the MistweaverReNewingMistTracker class for
    tracking Renewing Mist effects.
  description: The MistweaverReNewingMistTracker constructor initializes a new instance
    of the tracker class used to monitor and manage the effects of the Renewing Mist
    ability in the Mistweaver monk specialization. This class is responsible for tracking
    the duration, healing amounts, and application of the Renewing Mist buff on targets.
    The tracker ensures that the healing from Renewing Mist is properly distributed
    over time and correctly integrated with other gameplay mechanics such as the Mistweaver's
    mastery effects and talent interactions. It also handles cleanup and state management
    when the effect expires or is removed.

  - title: Creating a new tracker instance
    code: 'MistweaverReNewingMistTracker* tracker = new MistweaverReNewingMistTracker();

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track Renewing Mist effects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any validation or initialization of external
    dependencies. It simply sets up the internal state for tracking Renewing Mist
    effects. The actual tracking functionality requires subsequent calls to methods
    that apply or update the effect.
