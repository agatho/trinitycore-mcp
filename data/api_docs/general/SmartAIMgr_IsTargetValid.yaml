  method: IsTargetValid
  signature: bool SmartAIMgr::IsTargetValid(const SmartScriptHolder & e)
documentation:
  brief: Validates if the current target of a smart AI script is still valid and usable.
  description: The IsTargetValid method checks whether the target specified in a SmartScriptHolder
    object remains valid for use within the Smart AI system. This validation typically
    includes checking if the target entity exists, is alive (for creatures), is within
    range, or meets other contextual conditions required by the script. It's commonly
    used during AI execution to ensure that actions are performed on valid targets
    before proceeding with scripted behavior. The method returns true if the target
    is considered valid and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target in the SmartScriptHolder is valid and can be
    used by the AI script, false if the target is invalid or no longer suitable for
    the current action.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Smart AI Context
    code: "if (sSmartAIMgr->IsTargetValid(e)) {\n    // Proceed with AI action using\
      \ the valid target\n    e.GetAction()->Execute(source, target);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Target is no longer valid, handle accordingly\n    e.GetEvent()->HandleInvalidTarget(source);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the Smart AI framework during
    event processing. Developers should not call this method directly unless implementing
    custom AI logic that requires explicit target validation.
