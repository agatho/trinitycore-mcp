  signature: void QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr::SendCriteriaProgressRemoved(int criteriaId)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a packet to remove criteria progress for a specific quest objective
    criterion from the client.
  description: The SendCriteriaProgressRemoved method is responsible for notifying
    the player's client that a particular quest objective criterion progress has been
    removed or reset. This typically occurs when a quest is abandoned, completed,
    or when the criteria associated with it are no longer relevant. The method sends
    a specific packet to the connected client to update their UI and remove any visual
    indicators related to the specified criterion ID. It's part of the internal quest
    objective tracking system in TrinityCore and is used primarily during quest state
    transitions.
  parameters:
  - name: criteriaId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest objective criterion whose progress
      needs to be removed from the client's UI. This ID corresponds to a specific
      criteria entry in the database that defines what constitutes progress for a
      particular quest objective.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing Quest Criterion Progress
    code: "void RemoveQuestCriteriaProgress(Player* player, int32 criteriaId)\n{\n\
      \    if (player && criteriaId > 0)\n    {\n        QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr*\
      \ mgr = player->GetQuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr();\n        if (mgr)\n        {\n\
      \            mgr->SendCriteriaProgressRemoved(criteriaId);\n        }\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core when quest states
    change, and it's important to ensure that the criteriaId passed is valid and corresponds
    to an existing criterion in the database. The packet sent may not be immediately
    visible to players if they are not actively engaged with the quest UI.
