documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotNpcLocationService class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the BotNpcLocationService
    class, ensuring that only one instance of this service exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This service is responsible for managing NPC location data and related
    functionality within the bot system. The method performs lazy initialization,
    creating the instance on first call if it does not already exist. It is thread-safe
    and designed to be called from any context where access to the bot NPC location
    management functionality is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single instance of BotNpcLocationService. The method never
    returns NULL as it ensures instantiation on first call.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotNpcLocationService* service = BotNpcLocationService::instance();

      // Use the service to access NPC location data

      std::vector<BotNpcLocation> locations = service->GetAllLocations();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Service Methods
    code: "BotNpcLocationService* service = BotNpcLocationService::instance();\nif\
      \ (service)\n{\n    // Perform operations using the singleton instance\n   \
      \ service->UpdateLocations();\n    service->SaveToDatabase();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the classic singleton pattern implementation. The instance
    is created on first access and persists for the lifetime of the application. Since
    this is a core service class, it's typically initialized during server startup
    and should be available throughout the bot system's operation.
