  class: MoveSplineInitArgs
  method: _checkPathLengths
  signature: bool MoveSplineInitArgs::_checkPathLengths()
documentation:
  brief: Validates and checks the lengths of movement paths within the spline initialization
    arguments.
  description: The _checkPathLengths method performs validation on the path lengths
    defined in the MoveSplineInitArgs structure. This method ensures that the movement
    paths are within acceptable limits and properly formatted for spline interpolation.
    It is typically invoked during the initialization phase of movement operations
    to prevent invalid or excessively long paths from being processed, which could
    lead to performance issues or client-side movement glitches. The method evaluates
    internal path data structures and returns a boolean result indicating whether
    all path lengths are valid.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all path lengths in the spline initialization arguments
    are valid and within acceptable limits; otherwise returns false if any path length
    exceeds constraints or is malformed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in movement initialization
    code: "MoveSplineInitArgs args;\n// ... populate args with path data ...\nif (args._checkPathLengths())\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with spline initialization\n    // Movement is valid\n}\
      \ else {\n    // Handle invalid path lengths\n    // Log error or abort movement\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal movement system and should not typically
    be called directly by external code. It's designed to be invoked automatically
    during spline initialization routines. The validation performed includes checking
    for excessively long paths that might cause client-side stuttering or server performance
    degradation.
  warnings: Calling this method directly may interfere with normal movement flow.
    It's intended for internal use within the TrinityCore movement system and should
    not be used in custom scripts or modifications without understanding its impact
    on movement processing.
