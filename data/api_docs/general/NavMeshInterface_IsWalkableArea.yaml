  signature: bool NavMeshInterface::IsWalkableArea(uint32 areaFlags) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given area flag represents a walkable surface for NPC
    movement.
  description: The IsWalkableArea method evaluates whether the specified area flags
    correspond to a terrain type that allows for normal NPC navigation and movement.
    This function is crucial for pathfinding systems within TrinityCore, ensuring
    that creatures do not attempt to move through areas such as water, walls, or other
    impassable terrain. It checks against internal navigation mesh data to determine
    if an area is suitable for character traversal. The method typically returns true
    for standard ground surfaces and false for areas marked as non-walkable in the
    game's navigation system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the area flags indicate a walkable surface suitable for
    NPC movement; otherwise, returns false if the area is impassable or restricted.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 areaFlags = 0x00000001; // Example area flags\nbool isWalkable =\
      \ navMeshInterface->IsWalkableArea(areaFlags);\nif (isWalkable)\n{\n    // Proceed\
      \ with movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in Pathfinding
    code: "void CheckMovementPath(const std::vector<uint32>& areaFlagsList)\n{\n \
      \   for (uint32 flags : areaFlagsList)\n    {\n        if (!navMeshInterface->IsWalkableArea(flags))\n\
      \        {\n            // Skip this path segment\n            continue;\n \
      \       }\n        // Process valid walkable area\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal navigation mesh data structure and may
    be affected by map updates or custom terrain modifications. The implementation
    likely uses precomputed flags from the game's area table and navigation mesh files
    to make fast decisions during pathfinding operations.
