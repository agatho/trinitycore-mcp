  method: GetHomePosition
  signature: const int & Creature::GetHomePosition() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the home position coordinates of the creature.
  description: This method retrieves the home position coordinates of a creature,
    which represents the location where the creature was originally spawned or assigned.
    The returned coordinates are typically used for pathfinding and movement calculations
    within the game world. This method is essential for understanding creature behavior
    and maintaining proper AI logic in TrinityCore. The coordinates are stored as
    an integer value representing X, Y, and Z coordinates combined into a single value.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the home position coordinates of the creature as an integer value.
    This value represents the X, Y, and Z coordinates combined into a single integer
    where the lower 16 bits represent X coordinate, next 16 bits represent Y coordinate,
    and the remaining 16 bits represent Z coordinate.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'int homePos = creature->GetHomePosition();

      int x = homePos & 0xFFFF;

      int y = (homePos >> 16) & 0xFFFF;

      int z = (homePos >> 32) & 0xFFFF;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used for creature AI and movement calculations. It's
    important to note that the returned value represents a combined coordinate rather
    than separate X, Y, Z values. This method should be used carefully when dealing
    with pathfinding or movement logic.
  warnings: Be careful when using this method as it returns a combined coordinate
    value. The coordinate values are stored in a specific format where the lower 16
    bits represent X, next 16 bits represent Y, and remaining 16 bits represent Z.
    Incorrect handling of these values may lead to incorrect positioning calculations.
