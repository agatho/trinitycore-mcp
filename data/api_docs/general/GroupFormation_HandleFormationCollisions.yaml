documentation:
  brief: Processes and resolves collision events within group formations.
  description: The HandleFormationCollisions method is responsible for detecting and
    managing collision events that occur between members of a group formation in World
    of Warcraft. This method ensures that when units within a formation collide with
    each other or environmental obstacles, appropriate actions are taken to maintain
    proper group positioning and prevent undesirable behavior such as overlapping
    or stuck states. It typically operates during the game loop to continuously monitor
    and resolve these collisions in real-time, maintaining the integrity of the group's
    tactical formation.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    groupFormation->HandleFormationCollisions();\n\
      \    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the game's main update cycle
    and should not be called manually unless specifically required for custom behavior.
    It may involve performance considerations when dealing with large groups or complex
    formations, as collision detection can become computationally expensive.
