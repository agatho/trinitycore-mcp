documentation:
  brief: Calculates a priority score for interrupting an enemy's spell cast based
    on target and spell properties
  description: The CalculateInterruptScore method evaluates the strategic value of
    interrupting a specific enemy's spell cast. It takes into account both the target's
    current state and the characteristics of the enemy's ongoing spell to determine
    how beneficial an interruption would be. This score is typically used by AI decision-making
    systems to prioritize which spells to interrupt when multiple opportunities arise.
    The method considers factors such as spell duration, damage potential, and threat
    level to compute a floating-point value that represents the relative priority
    of the interruption.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or state.
      This parameter likely refers to the enemy unit being evaluated for spell interruption.
  - name: enemySpellId
    description: Unique identifier for the enemy's current spell being cast. This
      ID is used to look up spell properties such as duration, damage type, and interruptibility.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated interruption priority score.
    Higher values indicate more beneficial interruptions. The exact scoring mechanism
    depends on internal AI logic but generally reflects threat reduction and tactical
    advantage.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "float score = helper.CalculateInterruptScore(&enemyTarget, 12345);\nif\
      \ (score > 0.7f) {\n    // Execute interrupt action\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using interrupt score to select best target
    code: "float bestScore = 0.0f;\nUnit* bestTarget = nullptr;\nfor (auto& target\
      \ : enemyList) {\n    float score = helper.CalculateInterruptScore(&target,\
      \ target.GetSpellId());\n    if (score > bestScore) {\n        bestScore = score;\n\
      \        bestTarget = &target;\n    }\n}\n// Use bestTarget for interrupt decision"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ActionPriorityHelper class which handles AI decision-making
    logic. The implementation likely uses internal spell databases and target state
    information to compute scores. Performance is critical as this method may be called
    frequently during combat AI evaluation cycles.
  warnings: The target parameter must point to a valid enemy unit; otherwise, behavior
    is undefined. The enemySpellId should correspond to an actual active spell on
    the target for meaningful results.
