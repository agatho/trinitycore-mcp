  signature: void InteractionManager::SelectGossipOption(Player * bot, uint32 optionIndex,
    WorldObject * target)
documentation:
  brief: Selects a gossip option for a player character interacting with a world object.
  description: The SelectGossipOption method handles the selection of a specific gossip
    menu option by a player character. This method is typically invoked when a player
    chooses an action from a NPC's gossip menu, triggering the associated quest or
    dialogue flow. The method processes the selected option index and interacts with
    the target object (such as an NPC) to execute the appropriate gossip response.
    It is part of the interaction management system in TrinityCore that governs how
    players engage with non-player characters through the gossip system.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character selecting
      the gossip option. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: optionIndex
    description: The index of the selected gossip option, used to determine which
      action to perform. Should correspond to a valid menu item in the NPC's gossip
      menu.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that is the target of the interaction,
      typically an NPC or GameObject. Must be a valid world object with active gossip
      capabilities.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Gossip Option Selection
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      WorldObject* npc = ...;

      InteractionManager::SelectGossipOption(player, 0, npc);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Selecting a Specific Gossip Option from a Quest Giver
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      Creature* questGiver = ...;

      InteractionManager::SelectGossipOption(player, 2, questGiver);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when a player
    interacts with an NPC's gossip menu. It assumes that the player and target are
    within valid interaction range and that the gossip menu has already been presented
    to the player. The method does not validate the option index beyond ensuring it's
    a valid unsigned integer, so invalid indices may result in undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the player object is valid and that the target object supports
    gossip interactions before calling this method. Passing null pointers for bot
    or target will likely cause crashes or undefined behavior. The optionIndex should
    be within the bounds of available gossip options to avoid unexpected results.
