  signature: bool CurrencyTypesEntry::IsTrackingQuantity() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the currency type tracks quantity changes in the game
    system.
  description: The IsTrackingQuantity method checks if a specific currency type is
    configured to track and update its quantity within the World of Warcraft client
    and server systems. This flag is typically used to determine if a currency should
    be displayed with a dynamic count, such as reputation points or in-game tokens,
    rather than being static. When enabled, the currency's quantity can be modified
    through game events, quests, or player actions. The method returns true if quantity
    tracking is active for this currency type, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the currency type tracks quantity changes; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a Currency Tracks Quantity
    code: "const CurrencyTypesEntry* entry = sCurrencyTypesStore.LookupEntry(1234);\n\
      if (entry && entry->IsTrackingQuantity()) {\n    // Handle dynamic currency\
      \ tracking logic\n    printf(\"Currency ID %d tracks quantity changes\\n\",\
      \ entry->ID);\n} else {\n    // Handle static currency logic\n    printf(\"\
      Currency ID %d does not track quantity changes\\n\", entry->ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with currency update events and
    UI rendering to ensure that tracked currencies are properly displayed and updated
    in real-time. It's important to note that even if a currency type has tracking
    enabled, the actual quantity may still be zero until modified by game mechanics.
