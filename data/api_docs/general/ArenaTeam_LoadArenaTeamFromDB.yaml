documentation:
  brief: Loads arena team data from the database into the arena team object
  description: The LoadArenaTeamFromDB method retrieves all relevant information about
    an arena team from the database and populates the current ArenaTeam instance with
    that data. This method is typically called during server startup or when a player
    attempts to access arena team information. It performs a database query using
    the provided arena team ID and loads member details, statistics, and roster information
    into memory. The method ensures that all arena team data is consistent with the
    database state before returning control to the calling code.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the arena team data was successfully loaded from the database;
    returns false if the operation failed, which could occur due to invalid team ID,
    missing database records, or database connection errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = new ArenaTeam();\nif (team->LoadArenaTeamFromDB(12345))\
      \ {\n    // Team data successfully loaded\n    sLog->outString(\"Arena team\
      \ 12345 loaded successfully.\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to load team data\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Failed to load arena team 12345.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the database connection is already established and
    that the arena team ID passed to it is valid. It's designed to be thread-safe
    when used with proper synchronization mechanisms in place. The method may block
    during database I/O operations, so performance considerations should be taken
    into account for frequent calls.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring a valid database connection can result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Also, if the arena team ID is invalid or does
    not exist in the database, the method will return false but may still leave the
    object in an inconsistent state if partial data was loaded.
