documentation:
  brief: Restores the player's LFG (Looking for Group) state to its previous condition.
  description: The RestoreState method is used to revert a player's Looking for Group
    (LFG) data back to its previously saved state. This functionality is typically
    invoked when a player's LFG status needs to be rolled back, such as during a failed
    dungeon join attempt or when a player leaves a group. The method ensures that
    the player's LFG queue information, role preferences, and other related data are
    properly restored to maintain consistency in the game's LFG system. This is particularly
    important for maintaining proper matchmaking and preventing state corruption in
    the LFG subsystem.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'LfgPlayerData* playerData = sLFGMgr->GetPlayerData(playerGuid);

      playerData->RestoreState();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the LFG state needs to be reverted.
    It is typically used internally by the LFG manager and should not be invoked directly
    by external systems without proper context. The method assumes that a valid LFG
    state has been previously saved.
  warnings: Calling this method without a properly saved state may result in undefined
    behavior or data corruption. Ensure that the player's LFG data is in a consistent
    state before invoking this method.
