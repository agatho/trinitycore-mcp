  class: WorldSession
  method: HandleSpawnTrackingUpdate
  signature: void WorldSession::HandleSpawnTrackingUpdate(WorldPackets::Quest::SpawnTrackingUpdate
    & spawnTrackingUpdate)
documentation:
  brief: Processes spawn tracking updates from the client for quest-related NPC and
    object spawning.
  description: The HandleSpawnTrackingUpdate method handles incoming spawn tracking
    data from the client, which is used to synchronize quest-related NPC and object
    visibility states between the server and client. This functionality supports dynamic
    quest tracking where the client needs to be informed about which quest-related
    entities should be visible or hidden based on player progress. The method processes
    a SpawnTrackingUpdate packet that contains information about tracked spawns, likely
    including GUIDs of entities and their visibility status. It ensures that the server
    maintains consistent state with what the client is displaying for quest objectives.
  parameters:
  - name: spawnTrackingUpdate
    description: A reference to a SpawnTrackingUpdate packet containing data about
      quest-related spawn tracking updates from the client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in WorldSession handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSpawnTrackingUpdate(WorldPackets::Quest::SpawnTrackingUpdate\
      \ & spawnTrackingUpdate)\n{\n    // Process the spawn tracking update from client\n\
      \    _player->GetQuestTracker()->UpdateSpawnTracking(spawnTrackingUpdate);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the quest tracking system in TrinityCore and likely
    interacts with the player's quest tracker to maintain synchronization. It may
    be called during quest progression events when visibility of quest-related NPCs
    or objects changes.
