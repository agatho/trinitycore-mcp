    checks for any buffs or debuffs that may affect shield effectiveness, and ensures
    that the warrior's stance and weapon configuration are compatible with shield
    usage. This method is typically invoked during combat state transitions or when
    shield-related abilities are triggered to maintain accurate defensive mechanics.
