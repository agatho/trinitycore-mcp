  signature: void BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::ApplyTracking(uint32 param0)
documentation:
  brief: Applies tracking mechanics to the hunter's beast companion, enabling the
    hunter to track targets.
  description: The ApplyTracking method is responsible for activating or applying
    the tracking ability on a hunter's beast companion within the context of the Beast
    Mastery talent tree. This method typically modifies the behavior of the hunter's
    pet to allow it to track enemies or targets in the world. It may involve setting
    internal flags, updating the pet's AI state, or triggering visual effects that
    indicate the tracking status. The functionality is integral to the Beast Mastery
    hunter's gameplay mechanics and enhances the pet's utility in combat scenarios
    where target tracking is beneficial.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A uint32 parameter that likely represents the type or ID of the tracking
      effect to be applied, or a flag indicating specific tracking behavior. The exact
      meaning depends on internal implementation and may correspond to a spell ID
      or tracking state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BeastMasteryHunterRefactored hunter;

      hunter.ApplyTracking(12345); // Applies tracking with effect ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking with Spell ID
    code: 'uint32 trackingSpellId = 34477; // Hunter''s Mark

      BeastMasteryHunterRefactored hunter;

      hunter.ApplyTracking(trackingSpellId); // Applies the hunter''s mark as a tracking
      effect'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system managing pet behavior and abilities
    in the Beast Mastery hunter class. The parameter may be used to determine which
    specific tracking mechanic is activated, such as tracking a particular enemy or
    applying a specific buff to the pet.
