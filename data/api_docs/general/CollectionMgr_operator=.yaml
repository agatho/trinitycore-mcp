  brief: Moves the contents of another CollectionMgr instance to this instance
  description: The move assignment operator transfers ownership of resources from
    the source CollectionMgr object to the current object. This operation is typically
    used to efficiently transfer collections of items, achievements, or other game
    data without unnecessary copying. The source object is left in a valid but unspecified
    state after the move operation. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft
    emulation, this method supports efficient management of player collections such
    as toy collections, mount collections, and companion collections.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current CollectionMgr instance, allowing for chaining
    of assignment operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic move assignment usage
    code: 'CollectionMgr destCollection;

      CollectionMgr srcCollection;

      // ... populate srcCollection ...

      destCollection = std::move(srcCollection); // Move contents from src to dest'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining move assignments
    code: 'CollectionMgr col1, col2, col3;

      // ... populate collections ...

      col1 = std::move(col2) = std::move(col3); // Chain multiple moves'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator implements move semantics which is crucial for performance
    when dealing with large collection data structures. The moved-from object should
    not be used after the operation, as its contents are transferred. This is particularly
    important for managing player data in TrinityCore where collections can contain
    hundreds or thousands of entries.
  warnings: Using the move assignment operator on a CollectionMgr that has already
    been moved from results in undefined behavior. Always ensure proper initialization
    and usage patterns to avoid double-move scenarios.
