  brief: Sends updated group information to all members in the group.
  description: The BroadcastGroupUpdate method is responsible for synchronizing group-related
    data across all players within a group. This method ensures that each group member
    receives the most current information about the group's state, including member
    details, loot settings, and leadership assignments. It is typically invoked when
    changes occur to the group structure or configuration, such as when a player joins
    or leaves the group, or when group permissions are modified. The method handles
    the serialization and transmission of group data to all connected clients in the
    group.

      \    \n    // Broadcast updated group information to all members\n    group->BroadcastGroupUpdate();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally handles the process of creating and sending update
    packets to all group members. It should be called after any modification that
    affects group-wide settings or member information to ensure synchronization across
    all clients.
