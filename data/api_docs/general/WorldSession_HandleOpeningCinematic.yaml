documentation:
  brief: Handles the client's request to begin playing the opening cinematic when
    a player logs in.
  description: The HandleOpeningCinematic method is invoked by the WorldSession when
    the client signals that it is ready to play the opening cinematic sequence. This
    typically occurs during player login, where the game presents a pre-rendered cinematic
    to introduce the world or character. The method processes the packet received
    from the client and initiates the appropriate cinematic playback logic. It does
    not directly handle the cinematic data itself but rather acts as a trigger for
    the server-side handling of the opening cinematic sequence.
