  class: ResourceEventBus
  method: GetPendingEventCount
  signature: uint32 ResourceEventBus::GetPendingEventCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of pending resource events currently queued for processing.
  description: The GetPendingEventCount method returns the total count of resource
    events that are currently waiting in the event bus queue and have not yet been
    processed. This is useful for monitoring system load, debugging event flow, or
    determining when to trigger batch processing operations. The returned value represents
    a snapshot of the current state at the time of the call and may change immediately
    after the method returns. This method is typically used in resource management
    systems where events such as item pickups, currency changes, or quest progress
    updates are queued for asynchronous handling.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of pending events currently queued
    in the ResourceEventBus. Returns zero if there are no pending events.
  examples:
  - title: Monitor Pending Events
    code: "uint32 pendingCount = sResourceEventBus->GetPendingEventCount();\nif (pendingCount\
      \ > 100)\n{\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"resource\", \"High event queue load: {} pending\
      \ events\", pendingCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Batch Processing Trigger
    code: "uint32 pending = sResourceEventBus->GetPendingEventCount();\nif (pending\
      \ >= 50)\n{\n    // Process all pending events immediately\n    sResourceEventBus->ProcessAllPendingEvents();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a thread-safe read operation on the event queue count.
    The returned value is only valid at the moment of the call and may not reflect
    real-time changes in the queue size. It's recommended to use this method for monitoring
    purposes rather than making critical decisions based on its return value.
  warnings: Do not rely on the return value for synchronization or decision-making
    in performance-critical code paths, as the count can change immediately after
    the call. Avoid calling this method excessively in tight loops as it may impact
    performance.
