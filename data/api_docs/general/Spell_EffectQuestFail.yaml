documentation:
  brief: Triggers quest failure effect for the spell
  description: This method handles the quest failure effect when a spell is cast and
    fails to complete the quest requirements. It typically occurs when a player's
    quest progress is interrupted or when a spell fails to meet quest completion criteria.
    The method is part of the Spell class and operates within the context of World
    of Warcraft's quest system, specifically handling scenarios where quest objectives
    are not met due to spell effects. This method is commonly used in conjunction
    with other quest-related spell methods to manage quest progression and failure
    states.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(player, 12345);

      spell->EffectQuestFail();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell execution when quest conditions
    are not met. Implementation requires proper handling of quest state and may involve
    multiple steps including checking quest completion status, updating player's quest
    progress, and potentially triggering quest failure messages.
  warnings: The method should only be called when a spell actually fails to complete
    quest requirements. Improper usage can lead to incorrect quest progression or
    player behavior. Ensure that the spell has been properly initialized before calling
    this method.
