  class: GuildBankManager
  method: AnalyzeGuildBank
  signature: BankAnalysis GuildBankManager::AnalyzeGuildBank(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes the guild bank contents and returns detailed statistics about items,
    slots, and usage.
  description: The AnalyzeGuildBank method performs a comprehensive scan of the guild
    bank's inventory, collecting detailed information about all items stored within
    it. It evaluates item counts, slot usage, and categorizes items by type or quality.
    This method is typically used for administrative purposes, such as generating
    reports, detecting anomalies, or optimizing guild resource management. The analysis
    includes data on how many slots are occupied, which items are most frequently
    accessed, and overall bank utilization statistics. The returned BankAnalysis object
    contains structured data that can be used to make informed decisions about guild
    bank organization and item distribution.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player ID or index. Used to
      identify which player initiated the analysis, though this parameter may not
      be actively utilized in all implementations.
  returns: A BankAnalysis object containing detailed statistics about the guild bank
    inventory, including item counts, slot usage, and categorization data. Returns
    an empty or default-initialized BankAnalysis if no items are present or an error
    occurs during analysis.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Bank Analysis
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      BankAnalysis analysis = guildBankManager.AnalyzeGuildBank(&playerId);

      // Process the returned analysis data

      printf("Total items: %d\n", analysis.totalItems);

      printf("Occupied slots: %d\n", analysis.occupiedSlots);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Analysis for Bank Optimization
    code: "int playerId = 0;\nBankAnalysis analysis = guildBankManager.AnalyzeGuildBank(&playerId);\n\
      if (analysis.totalItems > 0) {\n    float utilization = (float)analysis.occupiedSlots\
      \ / (float)analysis.totalSlots;\n    if (utilization < 0.5f) {\n        // Warn\
      \ about underutilized bank\n        printf(\"Warning: Guild bank is less than\
      \ 50%% utilized\\n\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform heavy computations depending on the number of items
    in the guild bank. It should be called sparingly or during off-peak hours to avoid
    performance impact. The analysis results are typically cached for performance
    reasons, so repeated calls without changes may return stale data unless explicitly
    invalidated.
  warnings: The player parameter is currently unused and may be deprecated in future
    versions. Always verify that the guild bank is accessible before calling this
    method, as it may throw exceptions or return invalid data if the bank is locked
    or inaccessible.
