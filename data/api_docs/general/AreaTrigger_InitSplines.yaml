  class: AreaTrigger
  method: InitSplines
  signature: void AreaTrigger::InitSplines(const int & splinePoints, int overrideSpeed,
    int speedIsTimeInSeconds)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the spline paths for an area trigger based on provided point
    count and speed parameters.
  description: 'The InitSplines method sets up the movement path (spline) for an AreaTrigger
    object using a specified number of spline points. It configures how the area trigger
    will move through the world, including speed and timing behavior. This method
    is typically called during the initialization or activation of area triggers to
    define their motion patterns. The method supports overriding the default speed
    settings, allowing developers to customize movement duration and velocity for
    different gameplay scenarios. Precondition: The AreaTrigger must be properly initialized
    with valid data before calling this method. Postcondition: The internal spline
    structure of the area trigger is populated with calculated path points based on
    input parameters.'
  parameters:
  - name: splinePoints
    description: The number of spline points to generate for the area trigger's movement
      path. This determines how many waypoints the trigger will follow during its
      animation or movement sequence.
  - name: overrideSpeed
    description: An optional parameter that overrides the default speed setting for
      the spline movement. If set to a positive value, it defines the speed in units
      per second; if zero or negative, uses default speed settings.
  - name: speedIsTimeInSeconds
    description: A boolean flag (represented as integer) indicating whether the overrideSpeed
      parameter represents time duration in seconds rather than speed. When true (non-zero),
      the movement will take exactly that many seconds to complete; when false (zero),
      overrideSpeed is interpreted as units per second.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spline Initialization
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = new AreaTrigger();

      trigger->InitSplines(5, 10, 0); // Create 5-point spline with speed of 10 units/sec'
    language: cpp
  - title: Time-Based Spline Movement
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = new AreaTrigger();

      trigger->InitSplines(3, 2, 1); // Create 3-point spline that takes exactly 2
      seconds to complete'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in conjunction with area trigger events and
    spell effects where visual or physical movement of the trigger is required. The
    actual spline calculation logic may vary depending on the specific implementation
    within TrinityCore's core systems. Developers should ensure that spline points
    are valid and do not cause performance issues due to excessive complexity.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of the overrideSpeed parameter can lead to unexpected
    movement behavior or performance degradation. Setting speedIsTimeInSeconds incorrectly
    will result in either overly fast or slow animations. Always validate input parameters
    before calling this method, especially when dealing with dynamic values from game
    events or user inputs.
