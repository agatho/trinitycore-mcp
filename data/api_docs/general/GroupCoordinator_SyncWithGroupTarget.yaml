  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: SyncWithGroupTarget
  signature: void GroupCoordinator::SyncWithGroupTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Synchronizes the group coordinator's state with the current group target.
  description: The SyncWithGroupTarget method ensures that the GroupCoordinator instance
    accurately reflects the current state of the group's target. This typically involves
    updating internal references, validating target existence, and ensuring that all
    group members are properly aligned with the designated target. The method is commonly
    used in group-based gameplay mechanics such as raid coordination, quest targeting,
    or shared combat objectives where maintaining synchronized group targets is critical
    for proper functionality.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic synchronization call
    code: 'GroupCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.SyncWithGroupTarget();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called whenever there is a change in the group's target,
    such as when a new target is selected or when the current target becomes invalid.
    It may trigger internal updates to group member states and should not be called
    excessively during high-frequency operations.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper group context may result in undefined
    behavior or failed synchronization attempts. Ensure that the group coordinator
    has valid group membership before invoking this function.
