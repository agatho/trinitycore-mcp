  class: EvolutionaryOptimizer
  method: SetElitismCount
  signature: void EvolutionaryOptimizer::SetElitismCount(size_t count)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the number of elite individuals to preserve during each generation of
    the evolutionary optimization process.
  description: The SetElitismCount method configures the elitism count for the EvolutionaryOptimizer
    class, determining how many of the best-performing individuals from the current
    population will be directly carried over to the next generation without modification.
    This technique helps maintain the quality of solutions by preventing good genetic
    material from being lost due to crossover or mutation operations. In evolutionary
    algorithms used within game AI systems like those found in TrinityCore, elitism
    is a common strategy to ensure that the fitness of the population does not decrease
    over time. The method accepts a size_t parameter representing the number of elite
    individuals to retain and performs no validation on the input value, though practical
    limits may apply based on population size.
  parameters:
  - name: count
    description: The number of top-performing individuals to preserve unchanged in
      each generation. Must be a non-negative integer representing the desired elitism
      count.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Elitism Count to 5
    code: 'EvolutionaryOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.SetElitismCount(5);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Elitism for Large Population
    code: 'EvolutionaryOptimizer optimizer;

      size_t populationSize = 100;

      optimizer.SetElitismCount(populationSize / 10); // Preserve 10% of best individuals'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the EvolutionaryOptimizer.
    The elitism count should typically be set before starting optimization runs to
    ensure consistent behavior. If the elitism count exceeds the population size,
    it will effectively preserve all individuals in each generation.
  warnings: Setting a very high elitism count may reduce diversity in the population
    and potentially lead to premature convergence. Ensure that the elitism value is
    appropriate for your specific problem domain and population size to maintain effective
    evolutionary dynamics.
