  signature: void ArenaTeamMember::ModifyPersonalRating(Player * player, int32 mod,
    uint32 type)
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the personal rating of a player in an arena team.
  description: The ModifyPersonalRating method adjusts a player's personal rating
    within their arena team. This method is typically invoked when a player wins or
    loses an arena match, causing their rating to increase or decrease accordingly.
    The modification is applied directly to the player's arena team member record
    and may affect their overall standing and rewards within the arena system. The
    method takes into account the type of arena (2v2, 3v3, etc.) when applying the
    rating change.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose personal rating will be modified.
      Must not be null and must be a valid player currently in an arena team.
  - name: mod
    description: The amount by which to modify the player's personal rating. Positive
      values increase the rating, negative values decrease it. The magnitude of change
      depends on match outcome and opponent rating.
  - name: type
    description: Identifier for the type of arena team (2v2, 3v3, 5v5). Used to determine
      which specific arena team record to modify within the player's data. Valid values
      are typically 2, 3, or 5 representing the team size.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Increase player rating by 50 points in 3v3 arena
    code: "ArenaTeamMember* member = player->GetArenaTeamMember(3);\nif (member)\n\
      {\n    member->ModifyPersonalRating(player, 50, 3);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Decrease player rating by 25 points in 2v2 arena after loss
    code: "ArenaTeamMember* member = player->GetArenaTeamMember(2);\nif (member)\n\
      {\n    member->ModifyPersonalRating(player, -25, 2);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's arena team statistics and should
    only be called during appropriate game events such as match completion. The changes
    are typically persisted to the database asynchronously. Ensure that the player
    is actually part of an arena team before calling this method to avoid undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid parameters (e.g., null player pointer
    or invalid type) can lead to crashes or data corruption. Always verify that the
    player has an active arena team membership before modification. The rating change
    calculation logic may be complex and depends on factors like opponent rating,
    match outcome, and current rating tier.
