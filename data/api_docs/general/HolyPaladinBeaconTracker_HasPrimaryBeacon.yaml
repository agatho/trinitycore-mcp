  class: HolyPaladinBeaconTracker
  method: HasPrimaryBeacon
  signature: bool HolyPaladinBeaconTracker::HasPrimaryBeacon() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Holy Paladin has an active primary beacon.
  description: The HasPrimaryBeacon method checks if the Holy Paladin currently has
    a primary beacon active. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, paladins
    can place beacons on friendly targets that provide healing and other benefits.
    The primary beacon is typically the most recently placed or explicitly designated
    beacon. This method returns true if a primary beacon exists and is valid, and
    false otherwise. The check considers both the existence of a beacon and its active
    state within the game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Holy Paladin has an active primary beacon; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (paladinBeaconTracker->HasPrimaryBeacon()) {\n    // Perform actions\
      \ when a primary beacon exists\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"player\", \"Player has an active\
      \ primary beacon\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Beacon Logic
    code: "if (!paladinBeaconTracker->HasPrimaryBeacon()) {\n    // Place a new beacon\
      \ if none exists\n    beaconManager->PlacePrimaryBeacon(target);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Update or refresh existing beacon\n    beaconManager->RefreshPrimaryBeacon();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with beacon placement and management
    systems. It may be called frequently during gameplay, so performance should be
    considered when implementing logic that depends on this check.
  warnings: Ensure that the beacon tracker object is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as accessing an uninitialized or destroyed tracker could lead to
    undefined behavior.
