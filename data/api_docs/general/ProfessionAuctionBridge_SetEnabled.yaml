  class: ProfessionAuctionBridge
  method: SetEnabled
  signature: void ProfessionAuctionBridge::SetEnabled(int * player, bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the profession auction bridge functionality for a specified
    player.
  description: The SetEnabled method controls whether a player can interact with the
    profession auction bridge system in World of Warcraft. This system allows players
    to buy and sell items related to their professions through an auction house interface.
    The method takes a pointer to a player object and a boolean flag to enable or
    disable the functionality. When enabled, the player gains access to profession-specific
    auction features; when disabled, these features are temporarily unavailable. This
    method is typically used during player login, logout, or system maintenance scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which the profession auction bridge
      functionality will be enabled or disabled. Must not be null.
  - name: enabled
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      the profession auction bridge for the specified player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Profession Auction Bridge for Player
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      ProfessionAuctionBridge::SetEnabled(player, true); // Enable the bridge'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Profession Auction Bridge During Logout
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogout(Player* player)\n{\n    ProfessionAuctionBridge::SetEnabled(player,\
      \ false);\n    // Additional logout logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal player state flags or system configurations.
    The implementation may involve synchronization with the auction house subsystem
    and could trigger UI updates for the affected player. Consider performance implications
    when calling this method frequently on multiple players simultaneously.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    prevent segmentation faults. Disabling the bridge while a player has active auctions
    may result in unexpected behavior or data loss if not properly handled by the
    auction system.
