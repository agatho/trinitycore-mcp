  class: SchedulerStats
  method: GetExecutionRate
  signature: float SchedulerStats::GetExecutionRate() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the average execution rate of scheduled tasks within
    the scheduler.
  description: The GetExecutionRate method computes the average number of tasks executed
    per second by the scheduler. This metric is useful for monitoring performance
    and identifying potential bottlenecks in task scheduling. The value represents
    how efficiently the scheduler is processing queued tasks over time. The method
    does not modify any internal state and is thread-safe for read operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the average number of tasks executed per second.
    Returns 0.0 if no tasks have been executed or if the scheduler has not started
    yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Scheduler Performance
    code: 'SchedulerStats stats;

      // ... scheduler is running and processing tasks ...

      float rate = stats.GetExecutionRate();

      printf("Scheduler execution rate: %.2f tasks/sec\n", rate);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Execution Rate for Performance Tuning
    code: "void MonitorSchedulerPerformance(SchedulerStats& stats)\n{\n    float rate\
      \ = stats.GetExecutionRate();\n    if (rate < 10.0f) // Threshold for low performance\n\
      \    {\n        sLog->outError(\"Scheduler performance degraded: %f tasks/sec\"\
      , rate);\n        // Trigger performance optimization or alerting logic\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal timing mechanisms and task counters to compute
    the execution rate. The accuracy of the returned value depends on how frequently
    the scheduler's statistics are updated. For high-frequency monitoring, consider
    caching the result or using a more granular sampling approach.
  warnings: The execution rate may fluctuate significantly during periods of heavy
    load or when tasks are queued in bursts. Do not rely on this value for critical
    decision-making without considering its inherent variance and potential delays
    in statistical updates.
