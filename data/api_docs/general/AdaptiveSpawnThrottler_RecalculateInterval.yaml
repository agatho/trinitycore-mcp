  method: RecalculateInterval
  signature: void AdaptiveSpawnThrottler::RecalculateInterval()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the spawn interval based on current adaptive throttling logic.
  description: The RecalculateInterval method recalculates the time interval between
    spawns for a given AdaptiveSpawnThrottler instance. This method adjusts the spawn
    timing dynamically based on factors such as server load, player activity, and
    configured thresholds to optimize performance and maintain game balance. It is
    typically invoked internally by the throttler's update loop or when significant
    changes in conditions occur. The recalculated interval determines how frequently
    the system will attempt to spawn new entities.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AdaptiveSpawnThrottler throttler;

      throttler.RecalculateInterval();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the throttler is in an active state.
    The internal logic may depend on previous spawn events and system metrics to determine
    the new interval.
