documentation:
  brief: Clears all diminishing return values and resets the internal state of the
    DiminishingReturn object.
  description: The Clear method resets the internal state of a DiminishingReturn object
    by removing all stored diminishing return information. This method is typically
    used when a player's diminishing return effects need to be reset, such as after
    a combat encounter ends or when transitioning between different game states. The
    method ensures that no residual diminishing return data persists in memory, which
    is crucial for maintaining accurate gameplay mechanics and preventing unintended
    behavior. It does not take any parameters and performs no return operations.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'DiminishingReturn diminishingReturn;

      // ... some operations that populate the diminishing return data ...

      diminishingReturn.Clear(); // Reset all diminishing return values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it completely resets all diminishing
    return tracking. It is recommended to use this only when explicitly needed, such
    as at the end of a combat encounter or when resetting player state.
