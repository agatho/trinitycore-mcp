  signature: void CombatSpecializationBase::LogPerformance() const
documentation:
  brief: Logs combat specialization performance metrics for debugging and analysis
    purposes.
  description: The LogPerformance method outputs detailed performance data related
    to a character's combat specialization. This includes timing information, resource
    usage, and efficiency metrics during combat scenarios. The method is typically
    invoked during development or debugging phases to identify bottlenecks in specialization-specific
    code paths. It may log to the game's console or debug output stream depending
    on server configuration. The method does not modify any internal state and is
    intended for diagnostic use only.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Debug Context
    code: "CombatSpecializationBase* spec = player->GetCombatSpecialization();\nif\
      \ (spec)\n{\n    spec->LogPerformance();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used during development and testing phases. It may
    have performance overhead when enabled, so it should be used sparingly in production
    environments. The output format and content of the log may vary based on build
    configuration (debug vs release).
  warnings: Invoking this method in high-frequency combat situations may introduce
    noticeable lag or performance degradation. Do not call this method during active
    combat unless specifically required for debugging.
