  method: SelectImplicitTargetDestTargets
  signature: void Spell::SelectImplicitTargetDestTargets(const SpellEffectInfo & spellEffectInfo,
    const SpellImplicitTargetInfo & targetType, int targetIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Selects implicit target destination targets for spell effects based on provided
    spell effect information and target type.
  description: This method processes the selection of target destinations for spell
    effects, determining which targets are valid for a given spell effect based on
    the specified target type. It handles the logic for identifying appropriate targets
    in the context of World of Warcraft's spell system, particularly for spells that
    require multiple targets or have complex targeting mechanics. The method ensures
    proper target selection according to game rules and spell effect specifications,
    allowing for accurate execution of spell effects within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: spellEffectInfo
    description: Contains detailed information about the spell effect being processed,
      including effect type, radius, and other relevant parameters that determine
      target selection behavior.
  - name: targetType
    description: Defines the implicit target type for the spell effect, specifying
      how targets should be selected based on game mechanics and spell properties.
  - name: targetIndex
    description: Represents the index of the specific target being processed within
      a multi-target spell effect, allowing for precise targeting selection.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Target Selection Example
    code: 'Spell::SelectImplicitTargetDestTargets(spellEffectInfo, targetType, targetIndex);

      // This method processes target selection for a spell effect with multiple targets'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Target Selection Example
    code: "void Spell::SelectImplicitTargetDestTargets(const SpellEffectInfo & spellEffectInfo,\
      \ const SpellImplicitTargetInfo & targetType, int targetIndex)\n{\n    // Implementation\
      \ for selecting targets based on effect type\n    // Process target selection\
      \ logic\n}\n// Used in spell execution context to determine valid targets"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell targeting system and requires proper handling
    of target types and spell effect information. It should be called during spell
    execution process when target selection is needed. Performance considerations
    include avoiding unnecessary target calculations for large numbers of targets.
  warnings: This method may not handle all possible target types correctly if the
    target type is not properly defined or if spell effect information is incomplete.
    Care should be taken to ensure correct target selection in complex spell scenarios
    where multiple targets are involved.
