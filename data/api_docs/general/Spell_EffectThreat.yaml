documentation:
  brief: Applies threat generation mechanics to target units during spell effect execution.
  description: The EffectThreat method handles the generation of threat (aggression)
    from affected targets when a spell is applied. This method is responsible for
    calculating and applying threat values based on the spell's mechanics, ensuring
    that affected creatures or players generate appropriate threat levels to the caster.
    The method typically occurs during spell effect application and involves checking
    target validity, calculating threat modifiers, and applying threat changes to
    the target's aggro system. It is commonly used in spells that generate threat
    such as attack spells, area of effect spells, or spells that cause damage with
    threat generation.

    code: "void Spell::EffectThreat()\n{\n    // Implementation details\n    // Apply\
      \ threat to target based on spell mechanics\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell effect application and requires
    proper target validation. The implementation may vary depending on the specific
    spell type and target type. Performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary
    threat calculations for non-aggressive targets.
  warnings: The method should not be called directly by external code; it's intended
    to be used internally by the spell system. Care must be taken when implementing
    threat generation logic to avoid over- or under- generating threat values.
