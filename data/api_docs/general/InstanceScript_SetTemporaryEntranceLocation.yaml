api:
  class: InstanceScript
  method: SetTemporaryEntranceLocation
  signature: void InstanceScript::SetTemporaryEntranceLocation(uint32 worldSafeLocationId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the temporary entrance location for the instance to a specified world
    safe location ID.
  description: The SetTemporaryEntranceLocation method configures the instance script
    to use a specific world safe location ID as the temporary entrance point for players
    entering the instance. This is typically used during instance creation or reset
    scenarios where players need to be teleported to a designated safe area upon entry.
    The method updates internal state tracking for the instance's entrance location
    without affecting the actual player teleportation process, which is handled separately
    by the core systems. This functionality supports dynamic instance management and
    ensures proper player positioning when entering complex raid or dungeon environments.
  parameters:
  - name: worldSafeLocationId
    description: The unique identifier of the world safe location to set as the temporary
      entrance point. This ID corresponds to entries in the WorldSafeLocs.dbc file
      and defines valid teleportation destinations within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Temporary Entrance Location
    code: "class BossInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    void\
      \ OnPlayerEnter(Player* player) override\n    {\n        // Set temporary entrance\
      \ to the instance's main hub location\n        SetTemporaryEntranceLocation(12345);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Entrance Location Based on Instance State
    code: "class RaidInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    void\
      \ OnInstanceReset() override\n    {\n        // Set different entrance locations\
      \ based on raid difficulty\n        if (GetDifficulty() == DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_HEROIC)\n\
      \            SetTemporaryEntranceLocation(54321);\n        else\n          \
      \  SetTemporaryEntranceLocation(12345);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only updates the internal tracking of the temporary entrance
    location. Actual player teleportation requires separate handling through the core
    systems. The provided worldSafeLocationId must correspond to a valid entry in
    WorldSafeLocs.dbc, otherwise the behavior is undefined. This method should be
    called during instance initialization or reset phases to ensure proper state management.
  warnings: Incorrect worldSafeLocationId values may cause unexpected behavior or
    teleportation failures. Ensure that the specified ID references a legitimate safe
    location in the database. Calling this method after players have already entered
    the instance might lead to inconsistent player positioning.
