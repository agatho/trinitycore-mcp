api:
  class: AuctionEventBus
  method: Unsubscribe
  signature: void AuctionEventBus::Unsubscribe(BotAI * subscriber)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified BotAI subscriber from the auction event bus.
  description: The Unsubscribe method removes a given BotAI instance from the internal
    list of subscribers within the AuctionEventBus. This allows for dynamic management
    of event listeners, ensuring that only active and relevant AI instances receive
    auction-related notifications. The method ensures that the specified subscriber
    is no longer notified of auction events such as item listings, bids, or sales.
    It's typically used when an AI bot is deactivated, removed, or needs to stop receiving
    auction updates. This mechanism supports efficient resource management by preventing
    unnecessary event propagation to inactive subscribers.
  parameters:
  - name: subscriber
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that should be removed from the auction
      event bus subscription list. Must not be null.
  returns: None. The method performs an in-place modification of the internal subscriber
    list.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Unsubscribe Usage
    code: 'BotAI* myBot = new BotAI();

      // Assume bot is already subscribed

      AuctionEventBus::Instance()->Unsubscribe(myBot);

      // myBot will no longer receive auction events'
    language: cpp
  - title: Unsubscribe Before Deletion
    code: 'BotAI* bot = GetActiveBot();

      AuctionEventBus::Instance()->Unsubscribe(bot);

      // Safe to delete the bot now

      delete bot;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The AuctionEventBus maintains a list of active subscribers, and this method
    performs a linear search to find and remove the specified subscriber. It is recommended
    to avoid calling Unsubscribe on already-unsubscribed or null pointers to prevent
    undefined behavior. The implementation likely uses a container like std::vector
    or std::set internally for managing subscribers.
  warnings: Calling Unsubscribe with a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the BotAI instance being unsubscribed was previously subscribed to
    avoid potential logic errors. If multiple threads access the AuctionEventBus,
    synchronization may be required to prevent race conditions during subscription
    changes.
