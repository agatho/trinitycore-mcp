  signature: void TradeSystem::LoadRepairVendorsFromDatabase()
documentation:
  brief: Loads repair vendor data from the database into memory for use in the trade
    system.
  description: The LoadRepairVendorsFromDatabase method initializes and populates
    the internal data structures of the TradeSystem class with repair vendor information
    stored in the game's database. This method is typically called during server startup
    or when the trade system needs to refresh its vendor data. It retrieves all relevant
    repair vendor entries including their IDs, locations, and associated repair costs,
    ensuring that players can interact with these vendors correctly during gameplay.
    The method performs database queries to fetch this information and caches it in
    memory for efficient access during player interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleServerSideInit()\n{\n    sTradeSystem->LoadRepairVendorsFromDatabase();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the database connection is established
    and the TradeSystem has been properly initialized. It is typically invoked during
    server startup or when reloading trade system data. The method may block briefly
    while performing database queries, so it's recommended to call it during low-traffic
    periods or in a background thread if performance is critical.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate entries. Ensure that any existing vendor data is cleared
    before reloading. This method does not handle database connection errors gracefully
    and may throw exceptions if the database is unavailable.
