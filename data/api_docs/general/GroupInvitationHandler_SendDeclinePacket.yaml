  signature: void GroupInvitationHandler::SendDeclinePacket(const std::string & reason)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a group invitation decline packet to the player with an optional reason.
  description: The SendDeclinePacket method is used by the GroupInvitationHandler
    class to notify a player that their group invitation has been declined. This method
    constructs and sends a specific packet to the client indicating the decline, optionally
    including a reason for the rejection. The packet is sent through the player's
    connection and is part of the standard group invitation flow in TrinityCore. This
    method is typically called when a player chooses not to accept a group invitation,
    either by explicitly declining or due to game logic such as being in a group already.
  parameters:
  - name: reason
    description: A string containing the reason for declining the group invitation.
      This may be displayed to the inviting player and can contain localized text
      or game-specific messages.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Decline group invitation with a custom reason
    code: 'GroupInvitationHandler handler;

      std::string declineReason = "I''m already in a group";

      handler.SendDeclinePacket(declineReason);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player's connection is valid and active. It
    should only be called when there is an actual invitation to decline, otherwise
    it may result in unexpected behavior or client-side errors.
