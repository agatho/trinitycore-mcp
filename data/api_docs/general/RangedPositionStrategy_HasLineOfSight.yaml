  method: HasLineOfSight
  signature: bool RangedPositionStrategy::HasLineOfSight(const int & from, const int
    & to) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a ranged attack has line of sight between two positions
    in the game world.
  description: The HasLineOfSight method checks if there is an unobstructed path between
    two points in the game world, typically used by AI to determine if a ranged unit
    can target another unit without obstacles blocking the shot. This method evaluates
    the spatial relationship between the 'from' and 'to' positions, considering environmental
    barriers such as walls, terrain features, or other objects that might impede line
    of sight. It's commonly utilized in combat decision-making for ranged attackers
    to validate targeting eligibility before attempting an attack. The method operates
    on integer-based coordinates representing positions within the game world's coordinate
    system.
  parameters:
  - name: from
    description: The starting position coordinate (integer) from which line of sight
      is being evaluated.
  - name: to
    description: The target position coordinate (integer) to which line of sight is
      being evaluated.
  returns: Returns true if there is an unobstructed line of sight between the 'from'
    and 'to' positions, false otherwise. A return value of false indicates that some
    form of obstruction exists between the two points.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check line of sight for ranged attack
    code: "if (strategy.HasLineOfSight(playerPosition, targetPosition)) {\n    //\
      \ Proceed with ranged attack\n    unit->CastSpell(target, RANGED_SPELL_ID);\n\
      } else {\n    // Find alternative approach or move closer\n    unit->MoveTowards(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using line of sight in AI decision making
    code: "class EnemyAI {\npublic:\n    bool CanAttackRanged(Unit* attacker, Unit*\
      \ target) {\n        Position from = attacker->GetPosition();\n        Position\
      \ to = target->GetPosition();\n        int fromCoord = static_cast<int>(from.GetPositionX());\n\
      \        int toCoord = static_cast<int>(to.GetPositionX());\n        return\
      \ rangedStrategy.HasLineOfSight(fromCoord, toCoord);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using raycasting or similar spatial algorithms
    to test for intersections with environmental obstacles. Performance may be impacted
    by complex terrain or numerous obstacles in the path between positions. The integer
    coordinates are assumed to represent discrete grid points or simplified world
    space coordinates rather than precise floating-point positions.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'from' and 'to' parameters correspond to valid positions
    within the same map instance, otherwise behavior is undefined. This method does
    not account for dynamic objects like moving creatures or temporary environmental
    changes during execution.
