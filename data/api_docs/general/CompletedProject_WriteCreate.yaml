  class: CompletedProject
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void CompletedProject::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player *
    owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes creation data for a completed project to a ByteBuffer for network
    transmission to specified players.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the state and properties of a CompletedProject
    instance into a ByteBuffer format suitable for sending over the network. This
    method is typically invoked when notifying players about the creation or completion
    of a project, ensuring that relevant data such as project identifiers, status
    flags, and associated metadata are properly encoded. The serialized data is intended
    to be sent to both the owner and receiver of the project, allowing them to synchronize
    their local representations with the server state. This method does not perform
    any validation on the input parameters; it assumes that the provided player objects
    are valid and properly initialized.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: A reference to a ByteBuffer object where the serialized project data
      will be written. This buffer is used for network transmission.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the owner of the project.
      Must not be null.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the receiver of the project.
      Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = ...; // Valid player pointer

      Player* receiver = ...; // Valid player pointer

      completedProject.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's object serialization system and
    should only be called during network packet preparation. It is expected that the
    ByteBuffer is cleared or reset before calling this method to avoid data corruption.
  warnings: Ensure that both owner and receiver pointers are valid and not null before
    invoking this method, as dereferencing invalid pointers will lead to undefined
    behavior. The method does not perform any checks on these parameters.
