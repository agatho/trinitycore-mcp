  method: ~BotPopulationManager
  signature: void BotPopulationManager::~BotPopulationManager()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BotPopulationManager instance and cleans up all associated bot
    population data.
  description: The destructor for the BotPopulationManager class is responsible for
    properly cleaning up all resources associated with the bot population management
    system. This includes deallocating memory used for tracking bot instances, clearing
    internal data structures that store bot configurations and states, and ensuring
    no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur when the manager is destroyed. The
    destructor typically gets invoked automatically when the BotPopulationManager
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted, making it an essential part
    of the class's resource management lifecycle.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction at scope end
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    BotPopulationManager manager;\n    // ... use\
      \ manager ...\n} // destructor called automatically here"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of manager instance
    code: 'BotPopulationManager* manager = new BotPopulationManager();

      // ... use manager ...

      delete manager; // triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing memory.
    It is typically invoked by the C++ runtime when objects go out of scope or are
    deleted. Ensure that no other threads are accessing bot data during destruction
    to prevent race conditions.
