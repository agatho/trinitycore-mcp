documentation:
  brief: Sends a LFG boot proposal update to the player's client.
  description: The SendLfgBootProposalUpdate method is responsible for transmitting
    a LFG (Looking For Group) boot proposal update to a specific player's client.
    This method is typically invoked when a player is being voted on for removal from
    a group, such as during a LFG boot vote. The method takes a player GUID and a
    LfgPlayerBoot structure that contains information about the boot vote, including
    the proposer, the target player, and the vote status. It ensures that the client
    receives real-time updates regarding the boot process, allowing players to see
    ongoing votes and their outcomes.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who will receive the boot
      proposal update.
  - name: boot
    description: A reference to a LfgPlayerBoot structure containing details about
      the current boot vote, such as the proposer, target player, and vote status.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending a Boot Proposal Update
    code: 'LfgPlayerBoot boot;

      boot.proposer = 12345;

      boot.target = 67890;

      boot.voteStatus = LFG_BOOT_VOTE_INPROGRESS;


      LFGMgr::instance()->SendLfgBootProposalUpdate(67890, boot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG system and is used in conjunction with other
    LFG-related methods to manage group formation and player voting. It directly interacts
    with the client's LFG UI to display boot vote information.
