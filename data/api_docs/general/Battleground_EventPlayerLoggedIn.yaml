api:
  class: Battleground
  method: EventPlayerLoggedIn
  signature: void Battleground::EventPlayerLoggedIn(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Handles player login events within a battleground, updating internal state
    and notifying relevant systems.
  description: The EventPlayerLoggedIn method is invoked when a player logs into a
    battleground. This function manages the integration of newly logged-in players
    into the battleground's active state, ensuring proper tracking of player participation,
    updating game mechanics such as team assignments, and triggering necessary notifications
    or updates for other subsystems. It typically handles synchronization of player
    data with the battleground context and may perform checks to ensure the player
    is correctly assigned to a team or queue. This method is part of the battleground
    lifecycle management and is essential for maintaining accurate game state during
    player login transitions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who has logged
      into the battleground. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in battleground event handling
    code: "void MyBattleground::HandlePlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    EventPlayerLoggedIn(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom battleground logic
    code: "class CustomBattleground : public Battleground\n{\npublic:\n    void EventPlayerLoggedIn(Player*\
      \ player) override\n    {\n        Battleground::EventPlayerLoggedIn(player);\n\
      \        // Additional custom logic for handling login\n        if (player->GetTeam()\
      \ == ALLIANCE)\n            AddPlayerToAllianceTeam(player);\n        else\n\
      \            AddPlayerToHordeTeam(player);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework upon
    player login to a battleground. Developers should not directly invoke this method
    unless implementing custom battleground logic or extending base functionality.
    The method assumes that the player is already validated and properly initialized
    within the battleground context.
  warnings: Do not call this method with a null player pointer, as it will likely
    cause undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the player object is valid and
    has been correctly associated with the battleground before invoking this function.
