  class: ScopedPerformanceMeasurement
  method: ScopedPerformanceMeasurement
  signature: void ScopedPerformanceMeasurement::ScopedPerformanceMeasurement(uint32_t
    botGuid, const std::string & operation)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a scoped performance measurement for a bot operation
  description: The ScopedPerformanceMeasurement constructor initializes a performance
    monitoring context for a specific bot operation. This mechanism tracks execution
    time and resource usage of bot activities, providing valuable insights for performance
    optimization and debugging. The measurement is automatically managed through RAII
    (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles, ensuring proper cleanup when
    the scope ends. This functionality is particularly useful in TrinityCore's AI
    system where bot behavior and performance monitoring are critical for maintaining
    server stability and responsiveness.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier of the bot instance being measured. This GUID corresponds
      to the bot's entry in the database and is used to associate performance metrics
      with specific AI entities.
  - name: operation
    description: Name or description of the operation being measured. This string
      identifies what specific action or process is being monitored, such as 'Movement',
      'Combat', or 'Questing'.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Performance Measurement Initialization
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    ScopedPerformanceMeasurement perfMeasure(GetBotGuid(),\
      \ \"Movement\");\n    // Bot movement logic here\n    // Performance metrics\
      \ will be automatically logged when perfMeasure goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Nested Performance Measurements
    code: "void BotAI::DoCombat()\n{\n    ScopedPerformanceMeasurement combatPerf(GetBotGuid(),\
      \ \"Combat\");\n    {\n        ScopedPerformanceMeasurement attackPerf(GetBotGuid(),\
      \ \"Attack\");\n        // Attack logic\n    }\n    {\n        ScopedPerformanceMeasurement\
      \ defensePerf(GetBotGuid(), \"Defense\");\n        // Defense logic\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This class implements RAII pattern for automatic performance measurement
    cleanup. The measurements are typically logged to the TrinityCore logging system
    with timestamps and execution durations. Performance data is usually aggregated
    and can be accessed through debugging tools or performance monitoring interfaces.
  warnings: The constructor does not perform any validation on the botGuid parameter,
    so invalid GUIDs may cause issues in the logging system. Ensure that botGuid corresponds
    to an active bot instance to avoid unexpected behavior.
