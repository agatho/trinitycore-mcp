documentation:
  brief: Performs cleanup and shutdown operations for the ExampleManager instance
  description: The OnShutdown method is called during server shutdown to perform necessary
    cleanup operations for the ExampleManager. This method ensures that all resources
    held by the manager are properly released, pending operations are completed, and
    any required finalization steps are executed. The method is typically invoked
    by the core server shutdown sequence to allow managers to gracefully terminate
    their operations before the server process ends. It should not be called manually
    during normal operation as it's designed specifically for shutdown scenarios.

  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'ExampleManager* manager = new ExampleManager();

      // ... manager initialization and usage ...

      manager->OnShutdown();

      delete manager;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically called by the TrinityCore server framework during
    shutdown. Developers should not invoke this method directly unless implementing
    custom shutdown logic. The method is expected to be thread-safe as it may be called
    from different threads during server termination.
  warnings: Do not call this method manually during normal runtime operation as it's
    designed specifically for shutdown scenarios and may leave the manager in an inconsistent
    state if invoked outside of proper shutdown sequences.
