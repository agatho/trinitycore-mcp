documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the area trigger box, resetting its update state.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask of an
    AreaTriggerBox object, effectively marking all fields as having been sent in the
    last update. This is typically used during the update cycle to ensure that only
    changed fields are transmitted to clients. The method does not take any parameters
    and performs no return operations. It is part of the core update mechanism for
    area triggers in TrinityCore's world management system.

  - title: Basic Usage in Update Cycle
    code: "void WorldSession::UpdateAreaTriggers()\n{\n    for (auto& trigger : m_areaTriggers)\n\
      \    {\n        if (trigger->HasChanges())\n        {\n            SendUpdateToClients();\n\
      \            trigger->ClearChangesMask(); // Reset changes mask after sending\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the update system and should
    not typically be invoked directly by custom code unless implementing a custom
    area trigger behavior. It's important to understand that clearing the changes
    mask does not remove the area trigger itself from the world, but rather resets
    its dirty state for updates.
