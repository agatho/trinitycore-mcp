documentation:
  brief: Processes a command string for the VMap manager system
  description: The processCommand method handles incoming command strings to control
    or query the VMap (Virtual Map) system in TrinityCore. This method is typically
    used for administrative commands related to map loading, unloading, or debugging
    VMap data structures. It parses the provided command string and executes appropriate
    actions within the VMap manager subsystem. The method returns true if the command
    was successfully processed, or false if the command is invalid or could not be
    executed.
  parameters:
  - name: pCommand
    description: A null-terminated character string containing the command to be processed.
      Commands are typically simple text-based instructions that control VMap functionality
      such as loading/unloading maps, checking map status, or debugging information.
  returns: Returns true if the command was successfully parsed and executed by the
    VMap manager. Returns false if the command string is invalid, unrecognized, or
    could not be processed due to system errors or invalid parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Command Processing
    code: "char command[] = \"loadmap 0 30\";\nbool result = vmapManager->processCommand(command);\n\
      if (result)\n{\n    // Command was processed successfully\n    printf(\"Map\
      \ loading command executed\\n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Command failed or was\
      \ invalid\n    printf(\"Failed to process map command\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Debug Command Usage
    code: "char debugCommand[] = \"vmapstats\";\nbool success = vmapManager->processCommand(debugCommand);\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Output VMap statistics to console or log\n    printf(\"\
      VMap statistics displayed\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in the TrinityCore server's command system
    and administrative interfaces. It should be called from threads that have appropriate
    access to the VMap subsystem. The method may block during map loading/unloading
    operations depending on implementation details.
  warnings: The pCommand parameter must be a valid null-terminated string, otherwise
    behavior is undefined. Improperly formatted commands may cause the method to return
    false without providing specific error information. This method should not be
    called concurrently with other VMap management functions without proper synchronization.
