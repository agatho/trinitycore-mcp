  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: CallForHelp
  signature: void GroupCoordinator::CallForHelp(Unit * attacker)
documentation:
  brief: Notifies group members of an attack by sending a help request message.
  description: The CallForHelp method is used by the GroupCoordinator to alert all
    group members when a unit within the group is under attack. This method typically
    sends a message or signal through the group's communication system, informing
    other group members that assistance is needed. It is commonly invoked during combat
    scenarios where a group member is being targeted by an enemy unit. The method
    does not directly engage in combat but serves as a coordination mechanism to ensure
    group members are aware of the threat and can respond accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: attacker
    description: A pointer to the Unit object that is attacking a group member. This
      parameter specifies the source of the threat that triggers the help request.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat scenario
    code: "void SomeAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_attacker && m_attacker->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        m_groupCoordinator->CallForHelp(m_attacker);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat updates and should be used
    carefully to avoid spamming group members with unnecessary messages. The actual
    implementation may vary depending on how the GroupCoordinator handles communication
    within the group.
  warnings: Ensure that the attacker parameter is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as passing an invalid Unit pointer could lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes.
