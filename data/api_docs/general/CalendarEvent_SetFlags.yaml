  class: CalendarEvent
  method: SetFlags
  signature: void CalendarEvent::SetFlags(uint32 flags)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the flags for a calendar event, defining its properties and behavior
    in the game.
  description: The SetFlags method assigns a set of bitwise flags to a CalendarEvent
    object, which determine various aspects of how the event is displayed and handled
    within the World of Warcraft calendar system. These flags control permissions,
    event types, and visibility settings. The method directly modifies the internal
    flag storage of the calendar event without returning any value. This functionality
    is essential for properly configuring calendar events to match their intended
    use case within the game's social and organizational systems.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: 'A 32-bit unsigned integer containing bitwise flags that define the
      calendar event''s properties. Common flag values include: 0x01 (invite-only),
      0x02 (locked), 0x04 (raid-wide), 0x08 (guild-event), 0x10 (holiday). These flags
      are combined using bitwise OR operations to set multiple properties simultaneously.'
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a basic calendar event with invite-only and locked flags
    code: 'CalendarEvent event;

      uint32 flags = 0x01 | 0x02; // invite-only and locked

      event.SetFlags(flags);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring a guild raid event with multiple flags
    code: 'CalendarEvent raidEvent;

      uint32 flags = 0x04 | 0x08 | 0x10; // raid-wide, guild-event, holiday

      raidEvent.SetFlags(flags);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the CalendarEvent object.
    The flags parameter should be carefully constructed using predefined constants
    or bitwise operations to ensure correct behavior. Changes made via SetFlags are
    immediately reflected in the event's properties and will affect how the event
    appears in the calendar UI.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting flag values can result in unexpected behavior such
    as events not appearing correctly in the calendar, improper permissions being
    granted to players, or events being displayed with incorrect visual indicators.
    Always validate flag combinations before applying them to ensure they conform
    to expected game mechanics.
