  signature: void BotResourcePool::~BotResourcePool()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BotResourcePool instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotResourcePool class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the pool. This method
    ensures that when a BotResourcePool object goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted, all internal data structures are properly deallocated to prevent memory
    leaks. In the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this cleanup is essential for
    maintaining stable performance and preventing resource exhaustion during extended
    bot operations.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BotResourcePool
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    BotResourcePool pool;\n    // ... use pool\
      \ ...\n    // pool is automatically destroyed here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of BotResourcePool pointer
    code: 'BotResourcePool* pool = new BotResourcePool();

      // ... use pool ...

      delete pool; // Triggers ~BotResourcePool()

      pool = nullptr;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when objects
    go out of scope or are explicitly deleted. Developers should not manually call
    this destructor unless implementing custom memory management patterns.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke this destructor directly unless you're implementing
    a custom allocator or memory pool. Calling it manually on stack-allocated objects
    will result in undefined behavior.
