documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the PlayerbotMigrationMgr class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the PlayerbotMigrationMgr
    class, ensuring that only one instance of this manager exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is typically used to access global player bot migration
    functionality within the TrinityCore server. The returned pointer should be used
    carefully as it represents a globally accessible singleton object that manages
    player bot data migration processes between different versions or configurations
    of the playerbot system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single instance of PlayerbotMigrationMgr. The method never
    returns NULL as it's implemented as a singleton with guaranteed instantiation.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the singleton instance
    code: 'PlayerbotMigrationMgr* migrationMgr = PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance();

      // Use migrationMgr to perform player bot migration operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows standard singleton implementation patterns. The singleton
    instance is typically initialized during server startup and remains valid for
    the entire application lifetime. Developers should be aware that accessing this
    singleton from multiple threads requires proper synchronization if the manager's
    methods are not thread-safe.
