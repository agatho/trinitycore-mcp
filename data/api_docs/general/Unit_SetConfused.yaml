  class: Unit
  method: SetConfused
  signature: void Unit::SetConfused(bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the unit's confused state to apply or remove confusion.
  description: This method controls the confused status of a Unit, which is a game
    mechanic that causes the unit to attack its own allies and prevents it from performing
    normal actions. When applied, the unit enters a confused state where it will randomly
    attack nearby friendly units instead of enemies. When removed, the unit returns
    to normal behavior. This method is typically used in conjunction with other control
    methods like SetFeared or SetFleeing to manage unit behavior during combat.
  parameters:
  - name: apply
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the confused state. When true, the unit enters confused state; when false, it
      removes confusion.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Confusion Application
    code: "Unit* target = GetTarget();\nif (target)\n{\n    target->SetConfused(true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Confusion Removal Example
    code: "Unit* target = GetTarget();\nif (target)\n{\n    target->SetConfused(false);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the unit's behavior during combat and may interact with
    other status effects. The confused state typically causes the unit to attack friendly
    units randomly, which can be useful for certain AI behaviors or in specific game
    scenarios like boss fights where confusion is part of the mechanics.
  warnings: This method should not be used on player characters without proper handling,
    as it may cause unexpected behavior in player-controlled units. Confusion status
    can interfere with normal combat actions and may require additional handling for
    proper gameplay.
