documentation:
  brief: Returns the guild identifier associated with a map's owner.
  description: The GetOwnerGuildId method retrieves the unique identifier of the guild
    that owns or controls a specific map. This method is typically used in World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to determine which guild has ownership over a
    particular zone or instance. The returned value represents the GuildId that controls
    the map, which can be used for various game mechanics such as determining player
    access rights, faction relationships, or instance-specific guild-based content.
    This method does not require any parameters and is purely a getter function.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the guild identifier (GuildId) of the owner
    of the map. If no guild owns the map, this value will be zero. The return value
    can be used to determine which guild has control over the map or to check if a
    specific guild is the owner.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int guildId = map->GetOwnerGuildId();\nif (guildId != 0)\n{\n    // Map\
      \ is owned by a guild\n    // Do something with the guildId\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other map-related functions
    to determine ownership of zones or instances. It may be called from multiple threads
    depending on how the map is accessed, but generally does not require thread synchronization
    as it's a read-only operation.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the map has been properly initialized
    and loaded. If called before map initialization, it may return invalid values
    or cause undefined behavior.
