  class: Unit
  method: SetArmor
  signature: void Unit::SetArmor(int32 val, int32 bonusVal)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the armor value of a unit with specified bonus value.
  description: 'The SetArmor method allows developers to modify the armor value of
    a Unit object, which is a fundamental game mechanic affecting how much physical
    damage a unit can absorb. This method updates the armor stat for the unit, typically
    used in scenarios such as creating custom mob AI, applying buffs/debuffs, or modifying
    creature stats during development. The method takes two parameters: the base armor
    value and a bonus value that gets added to the base armor. It''s important to
    note that this method directly affects the unit''s armor calculation and may influence
    combat mechanics like damage reduction.'
  parameters:
  - name: val
    description: The base armor value to set for the unit. This represents the base
      armor amount before any bonuses are applied.
  - name: bonusVal
    description: The bonus armor value to add to the base armor. This value is typically
      used to apply temporary or permanent buffs that increase armor.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Armor Setting Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SetArmor(100, 50);

      // Sets base armor to 100 with bonus of 50'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Armor Setting Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SetArmor(200, 100);

      // Sets base armor to 200 with bonus of 100

      // This can be used in custom mob AI or during creature stat modification'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other armor-related methods
    and should be carefully considered when modifying unit stats. It affects combat
    calculations and may influence how much damage a unit takes in battle.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect combat mechanics or
    unexpected behavior in game. Care must be taken when setting armor values to ensure
    they align with game balance requirements.
