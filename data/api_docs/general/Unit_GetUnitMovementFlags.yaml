  method: GetUnitMovementFlags
  signature: uint32 Unit::GetUnitMovementFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the movement flags currently set for the unit.
  description: This method retrieves the current movement flags that define how a
    unit (such as a player or creature) is moving. These flags determine the movement
    behavior and can affect how the unit moves through the world, including whether
    it's walking, running, swimming, or flying. The returned value represents a bitmask
    of movement flags that indicate the current state of movement for the unit.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the movement flags currently set for
    the unit. Each bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific movement type
    (e.g., walking, running, swimming, flying).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 movementFlags = unit->GetUnitMovementFlags();\nif (movementFlags\
      \ & MOVE_FLAG_WALKING)\n{\n    // Unit is walking\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "uint32 movementFlags = unit->GetUnitMovementFlags();\nuint32 flags = movementFlags;\n\
      // Check for specific movement types\nif (flags & MOVE_FLAG_FLYING)\n{\n   \
      \ // Unit is flying\n}\nelse if (flags & MOVE_FLAG_SWIMMING)\n{\n    // Unit\
      \ is swimming\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with movement-related logic
    to determine how a unit should behave in the game world. It's important to note
    that movement flags can change dynamically based on the unit's state or actions.
  warnings: Be cautious when interpreting the returned value, as movement flags may
    be modified by various game mechanics (e.g., buffs, debuffs, or environmental
    effects). Also, the bitmask should be interpreted carefully to avoid incorrect
    assumptions about movement behavior.
