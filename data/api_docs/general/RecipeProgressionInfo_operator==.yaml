documentation:
  brief: Compares two RecipeProgressionInfo objects for equality
  description: The operator== method performs a member-wise comparison between this
    RecipeProgressionInfo object and another RecipeProgressionInfo object. It returns
    true if all corresponding members of both objects are equal, and false otherwise.
    This comparison is typically used to determine if two recipe progression states
    are identical, which can be important for synchronization, validation, or determining
    whether a recipe has changed in the player's progression. The method does not
    consider any external state or dynamic factors, focusing purely on the data stored
    within each object.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The RecipeProgressionInfo object to compare against this instance
  returns: True if all members of both objects are equal, false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic equality check between two recipe progression objects
    code: 'RecipeProgressionInfo recipe1;

      RecipeProgressionInfo recipe2;

      // Assume both objects are populated with identical data

      bool areEqual = (recipe1 == recipe2); // Returns true if all members match'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using equality operator in a loop to find matching recipes
    code: "std::vector<RecipeProgressionInfo> playerRecipes;\nRecipeProgressionInfo\
      \ searchRecipe;\n// Populate playerRecipes and searchRecipe\nfor (const auto&\
      \ recipe : playerRecipes) {\n    if (recipe == searchRecipe) {\n        // Found\
      \ a match\n        std::cout << \"Found matching recipe\" << std::endl;\n  \
      \      break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely compares internal data members such as recipe ID, progression
    state, and completion flags. The implementation assumes that all relevant fields
    are properly initialized and that the comparison logic is consistent with how
    the class is intended to be used for recipe progression tracking.
