  class: FollowBehaviorUtils
  method: IsInFollowRange
  signature: bool FollowBehaviorUtils::IsInFollowRange(Player * bot, Player * leader,
    float minDist, float maxDist)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot player is within the specified follow range of a
    leader player.
  description: The IsInFollowRange method evaluates the distance between a bot player
    and a leader player to determine if the bot is within the acceptable follow range.
    This function is commonly used in AI behavior systems where bots need to maintain
    proximity to their leaders. The method takes into account both minimum and maximum
    distance constraints, ensuring that the bot does not get too close or too far
    from the leader. It returns true if the bot's current position satisfies these
    distance criteria, otherwise false. This functionality is essential for maintaining
    proper group dynamics in player-controlled AI systems.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is checking
      its position relative to the leader.
  - name: leader
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the leader whose range
      is being checked against.
  - name: minDist
    description: Minimum allowed distance between the bot and the leader. The bot
      must be at least this far away from the leader.
  - name: maxDist
    description: Maximum allowed distance between the bot and the leader. The bot
      must not exceed this distance from the leader.
  returns: Returns true if the bot is within the specified minimum and maximum distance
    range of the leader; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check follow range
    code: "if (FollowBehaviorUtils::IsInFollowRange(bot, leader, 2.0f, 10.0f)) {\n\
      \    // Bot is within acceptable follow distance\n    bot->MoveTowards(leader);\n\
      } else {\n    // Bot needs to adjust position\n    bot->MoveTo(leader, 5.0f);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with dynamic distance parameters
    code: "float minDist = leader->GetMap()->GetDifficulty() == DIFFICULTY_NORMAL\
      \ ? 3.0f : 5.0f;\nfloat maxDist = minDist * 2.0f;\nbool inRange = FollowBehaviorUtils::IsInFollowRange(bot,\
      \ leader, minDist, maxDist);\nif (!inRange) {\n    bot->SendMoveToPosition(leader->GetPosition(),\
      \ 1.0f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses the 3D Euclidean distance calculation between players. It's
    important to note that this function does not account for obstacles or terrain
    height differences in its distance calculations, which may affect gameplay behavior
    in certain scenarios. The method assumes both player pointers are valid and non-null.
  warnings: Ensure that both bot and leader pointers are properly initialized before
    calling this method; otherwise, the behavior is undefined. Also, be aware that
    using very small minDist values might cause bots to bunch up too closely, potentially
    leading to visual or gameplay issues.
