documentation:
  brief: Updates the passive AI behavior for the creature based on the provided time
    delta.
  description: The UpdateAI method is a core function of the PassiveAI class that
    handles the periodic update logic for creatures using passive AI. It is called
    by the game engine at regular intervals to allow the AI to process its behavior,
    such as maintaining awareness of nearby entities, performing idle actions, or
    executing simple state transitions. This method typically does not perform complex
    decision-making but rather ensures that the creature's passive behaviors remain
    consistent with its current state and environment. The method is part of the standard
    TrinityCore AI update cycle and should not be called manually unless implementing
    custom AI logic.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Time delta in milliseconds since the last update call. This value
      determines how much time has passed since the previous execution, allowing the
      AI to perform time-based actions like movement, animation updates, or state
      checks.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a custom AI implementation
    code: "class MyCustomAI : public PassiveAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(int diff)\
      \ override {\n        PassiveAI::UpdateAI(diff);\n        // Custom passive\
      \ behavior logic here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using UpdateAI for time-sensitive passive actions
    code: "void MyPassiveCreature::UpdateAI(int diff) {\n    if (diff >= 1000) { //\
      \ Every second\n        // Perform periodic checks or actions\n        DoSomething();\n\
      \    }\n    PassiveAI::UpdateAI(diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The UpdateAI method is typically invoked by the core game loop and should
    not be called directly from outside the AI system unless implementing a custom
    AI extension. The parameter 'diff' represents real-world time elapsed, so it's
    important to use this value for accurate timing-based behaviors.
  warnings: Avoid modifying the internal state of PassiveAI objects directly in this
    method without understanding the full implications. Calling UpdateAI recursively
    or with incorrect delta values can lead to unexpected behavior or performance
    issues.
