  class: Unit
  method: SetPlayHoverAnim
  signature: void Unit::SetPlayHoverAnim(bool enable, bool sendUpdate)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the hover animation state for the unit, enabling or disabling the visual
    hover effect.
  description: This method controls whether a unit displays a hover animation, which
    is commonly used for interactive objects like quest givers or NPCs that can be
    interacted with. The method allows toggling of the hover animation state and optionally
    sends an update to the client if enabled. This functionality is primarily used
    in World of Warcraft client-side visual effects and is often tied to object interaction
    mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to enable or disable the hover
      animation. True will activate the hover effect, false will deactivate it.
  - name: sendUpdate
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to send an update to the client.
      If true, the client will receive a visual update for the hover animation state
      change.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetPlayHoverAnim(true, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetPlayHoverAnim(false, false);

      // This disables hover animation without sending update to client'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other unit-related methods
    for managing visual states. Implementation may involve internal client-side updates
    and should be used carefully to avoid performance issues. Thread safety depends
    on the implementation of the underlying unit class.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to visual inconsistencies or client-side
    errors if not properly synchronized with other related methods. Avoid calling
    this method in rapid succession without proper consideration of client update
    timing.
