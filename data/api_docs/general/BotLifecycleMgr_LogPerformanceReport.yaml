documentation:
  brief: Logs a performance report for bot lifecycle management operations.
  description: The LogPerformanceReport method generates and outputs detailed performance
    metrics related to the lifecycle management of AI bots within the TrinityCore
    environment. This includes timing data, resource usage statistics, and operational
    efficiency indicators for bot creation, destruction, and state transitions. The
    method is typically invoked during debugging sessions or performance monitoring
    to identify bottlenecks in bot behavior management. It does not require any specific
    preconditions but should be called when performance data collection is needed
    for analysis.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: BotLifecycleMgr::LogPerformanceReport();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for debugging and performance analysis.
    It may produce verbose output to the log files, so it's recommended to use it
    sparingly in production environments. The logging behavior depends on the TrinityCore
    logging configuration and verbosity settings.
