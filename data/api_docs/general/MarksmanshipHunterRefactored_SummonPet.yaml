  brief: Summons the hunter's pet into the world
  description: The SummonPet method is responsible for bringing a hunter's companion
    pet into the game world. This method typically handles the creation and placement
    of the pet object, ensuring it appears at the appropriate location relative to
    the hunter. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, this
    method likely interacts with the pet system, manages pet spawning logic, and ensures
    proper integration with the hunter's current state and abilities. The method may
    also handle any necessary visual effects or animations associated with pet summoning.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pet Summoning
    code: 'MarksmanshipHunterRefactored hunter;

      hunter.SummonPet();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely requires the hunter to have a valid pet that can be summoned.
    The actual summoning process may depend on the hunter's current state, such as
    whether they are in combat or have sufficient resources. Implementation details
    may involve interaction with the ObjectMgr and Pet system within TrinityCore.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes if the hunter does not have a valid pet or if summoning conditions
    are not met. Ensure that any preconditions for pet summoning are satisfied before
    invoking this method.
