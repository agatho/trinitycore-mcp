documentation:
  brief: Calculates the strength of a market trend based on historical price data
  description: The CalculateTrendStrength method evaluates the magnitude and consistency
    of price movements within the marketplace to determine how strong a particular
    trend is. This calculation typically involves analyzing price fluctuations over
    time, comparing current prices against historical averages, and applying statistical
    measures such as standard deviation or moving averages to quantify trend intensity.
    The result is a normalized float value that represents the relative strength of
    the observed market movement, which can be used for economic forecasting, trade
    strategy optimization, or in-game decision making related to item pricing and
    resource management.
  parameters:
  - name: prices
    description: A reference to an integer representing a collection or sequence of
      historical price values. This parameter is expected to contain at least two
      data points for meaningful trend analysis, though more data generally improves
      accuracy.
  returns: Returns a float value between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 indicates no detectable
    trend strength (flat or random movement) and 1.0 represents maximum trend strength
    (consistent, significant directional movement). Values in between indicate varying
    degrees of trend intensity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analyzer;

      int priceData[] = {100, 120, 130, 145, 160};

      float strength = analyzer.CalculateTrendStrength(priceData);

      // Returns a float value indicating trend strength

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Data
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analyzer;

      std::vector<int> prices;

      prices.push_back(50);

      prices.push_back(65);

      prices.push_back(72);

      prices.push_back(81);

      prices.push_back(90);

      float strength = analyzer.CalculateTrendStrength(prices); // Assumes vector
      is converted to int array internally

      // Strength value can be used to determine if a market is trending strongly
      upward

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the input data contains valid price information
    and that sufficient historical data points exist for reliable trend analysis.
    It may perform better with larger datasets. The exact algorithm implementation
    details are internal to the MarketAnalysis class but likely involve time-series
    analysis techniques.
  warnings: Ensure that the prices parameter contains at least two valid integer values;
    otherwise, the method may produce undefined or unreliable results. Passing an
    empty or invalid dataset could lead to division by zero or other mathematical
    errors during computation.
