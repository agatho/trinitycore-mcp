  method: GetPlayerCount
  signature: uint8 LFGMgr::GetPlayerCount(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of players associated with a given GUID in the LFG system
  description: The GetPlayerCount method is used to determine how many player entries
    are currently registered under a specific GUID within the Looking for Group (LFG)
    manager. This function is typically employed to check the status of player participation
    in groups or queues. It operates within the TrinityCore framework's LFG system,
    which manages player groupings for dungeons, raids, and other organized gameplay
    activities. The method likely accesses internal data structures that track player
    GUIDs and their associated group memberships.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose count is being retrieved.
      This should be a valid player GUID used internally by TrinityCore's LFG system.
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the number of players associated with
    the provided GUID in the LFG system. A return value of 0 typically indicates no
    active group or queue participation, while higher values may indicate multiple
    players or group members.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check player count
    code: "uint8 count = sLFGMgr->GetPlayerCount(12345);\nif (count > 0) {\n    printf(\"\
      Player is part of %d group(s)\\n\", count);\n} else {\n    printf(\"Player is\
      \ not in any group\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal lookups within the LFG manager's data
    structures and should be used carefully in performance-critical sections. The
    exact implementation details may vary depending on how the LFG system tracks player
    associations.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID is valid and corresponds to an actual player
    entry, as invalid GUIDs might lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
    This method may not be thread-safe if used without proper synchronization mechanisms.
