  class: EconomyManager
  method: Initialize
  signature: void EconomyManager::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the EconomyManager system, setting up internal data structures
    and loading configuration settings.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the EconomyManager for operation by
    initializing all internal components, loading required configuration data from
    the database or configuration files, and ensuring that all necessary systems are
    ready to handle economy-related operations such as item pricing, currency management,
    and transaction processing. This method is typically called during server startup
    or when the economy system needs to be reset. It ensures that the manager has
    valid references to core systems like the database connection, configuration manager,
    and any dependent modules.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'EconomyManager economyMgr;

      economyMgr.Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of an EconomyManager
    instance. Reinitialization may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks if
    not properly handled. The method performs blocking operations while loading configuration
    data, so it's recommended to call this during server initialization rather than
    at runtime.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times without proper cleanup can result in
    memory leaks or inconsistent internal state. Ensure that no economy-related operations
    are performed before calling this method.
