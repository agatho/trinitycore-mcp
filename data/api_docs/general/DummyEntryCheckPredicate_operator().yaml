  class: DummyEntryCheckPredicate
  method: operator()
  signature: bool DummyEntryCheckPredicate::operator()(const int & param0) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether a given dummy entry meets specified criteria.
  description: The DummyEntryCheckPredicate::operator() method serves as a predicate
    function that determines if a provided dummy entry (represented by an integer
    parameter) satisfies certain conditions. This method is typically used within
    the TrinityCore framework for filtering or validating dummy entries in game systems
    such as quest handling, spell effects, or object interactions. The implementation
    likely checks against predefined rules or lookup tables to decide whether the
    entry should be considered valid or accepted.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An integer representing the dummy entry ID to evaluate. This value
      typically corresponds to a specific game object, NPC, or item entry from the
      database.
  returns: Returns true if the dummy entry meets the specified criteria; otherwise
    returns false. The exact logic for evaluation depends on the internal implementation
    of the predicate.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Predicate Context
    code: 'DummyEntryCheckPredicate predicate;

      int entryId = 12345;

      bool isValid = predicate(entryId); // Evaluates if entry ID 12345 is valid'
    language: cpp
  - title: Filtering Dummy Entries in a Container
    code: "std::vector<int> dummyEntries = {1001, 1002, 1003, 1004};\nDummyEntryCheckPredicate\
      \ predicate;\nstd::vector<int> validEntries;\nstd::copy_if(dummyEntries.begin(),\
      \ dummyEntries.end(), std::back_inserter(validEntries),\n            [&predicate](int\
      \ entry) { return predicate(entry); });"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended to be used as a callable predicate within STL algorithms
    or other templated contexts where a unary function object is required. It's likely
    part of a larger system for validating dummy entries in the game world, possibly
    related to quest objectives or spell targets.
  warnings: Ensure that the input parameter represents a valid dummy entry ID; invalid
    IDs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect evaluations depending on how the
    predicate is implemented internally.
