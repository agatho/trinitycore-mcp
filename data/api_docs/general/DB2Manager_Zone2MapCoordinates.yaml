  class: DB2Manager
  method: Zone2MapCoordinates
  signature: bool DB2Manager::Zone2MapCoordinates(uint32 areaId, float & x, float
    & y) const
documentation:
  brief: Converts a zone (area) identifier to its corresponding map coordinates.
  description: The Zone2MapCoordinates method translates a given area ID into map
    coordinates (x, y). This is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to
    determine the position of an area on a map. The method retrieves precomputed mapping
    data from internal DB2 files that store zone-to-map coordinate relationships.
    It returns true if the conversion was successful and false if the area ID is invalid
    or not found in the database.
  parameters:
  - name: areaId
    description: The unique identifier of the zone/area to convert. This corresponds
      to the AreaTable.db2 file's ID field.
  - name: x
    description: Reference to a float that will be set to the X coordinate on the
      map if the conversion succeeds.
  - name: y
    description: Reference to a float that will be set to the Y coordinate on the
      map if the conversion succeeds.
  returns: True if the area ID was found and coordinates were successfully retrieved;
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float x, y;\nif (sDB2Manager->Zone2MapCoordinates(1234, x, y)) {\n    printf(\"\
      Coordinates: (%f, %f)\\n\", x, y);\n} else {\n    printf(\"Area ID 1234 not\
      \ found.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Player Location
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 areaId = player->GetAreaId();\nfloat x, y;\n\
      if (sDB2Manager->Zone2MapCoordinates(areaId, x, y)) {\n    // Use coordinates\
      \ for map display or navigation\n    player->SendNotification(\"You are at map\
      \ coordinates (%f, %f)\", x, y);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal DB2 data structures and assumes that the DB2Manager
    has been properly initialized with zone mapping data. The coordinates returned
    are typically normalized to a range between 0 and 100, representing relative map
    positions.
  warnings: Ensure that the area ID passed is valid and corresponds to an actual zone
    in the game database; invalid IDs will cause the method to return false without
    setting x or y values.
