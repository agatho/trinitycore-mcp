  class: GameObject
  method: GetLootForPlayer
  signature: Loot * GameObject::GetLootForPlayer(const int * param0) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the loot associated with the game object for a specific player.
  description: This method returns the Loot object that is associated with the GameObject
    for a given player, allowing access to the loot data and mechanics. It is commonly
    used in conjunction with player loot systems to determine what items a player
    can obtain from a game object's loot table. The method typically involves checking
    if the player has permission to loot the object and retrieving the appropriate
    loot data based on the player's role and the object's loot settings.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Represents the player's GUID (unique identifier) for which the loot
      is being retrieved. This parameter is essential for determining the correct
      loot context and ensuring that the player can access the appropriate loot data.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Loot object associated with the GameObject, which
    contains the loot information for the specified player. If no valid loot exists
    or if the player does not have permission to loot the object, this may return
    nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Loot* loot = gameobject->GetLootForPlayer(&player_guid);\nif (loot != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Process loot\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in the context of player loot systems and requires
    proper handling of player GUIDs. It may involve checking for valid player permissions
    and ensuring that the loot data is correctly retrieved based on the player's role.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it can lead to memory leaks
    or incorrect loot data if not properly handled. Ensure that the player GUID is
    valid and that the loot object is properly managed.
