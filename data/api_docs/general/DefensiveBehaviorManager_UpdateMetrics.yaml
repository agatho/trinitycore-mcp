  class: DefensiveBehaviorManager
  method: UpdateMetrics
  signature: void DefensiveBehaviorManager::UpdateMetrics(int startTime)
documentation:
  brief: Updates defensive behavior metrics based on the provided start time.
  description: The UpdateMetrics method is responsible for recalculating and refreshing
    defensive behavior statistics within the DefensiveBehaviorManager. It processes
    the defensive actions and their effectiveness over time, using the provided start
    time to determine the relevant time window for metric calculation. This method
    typically integrates with the AI system to adjust defensive strategies based on
    recent combat events and player behavior patterns.
  parameters:
  - name: startTime
    description: The timestamp marking the beginning of the evaluation period for
      defensive metrics. This value is used to determine which defensive actions and
      outcomes should be considered in the current metric update cycle.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'DefensiveBehaviorManager manager;

      manager.UpdateMetrics(1634567890); // Update metrics starting from a specific
      timestamp'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles or when defensive
    behavior needs to be recalibrated. It may involve performance-intensive operations
    such as iterating through combat logs or calculating averages over time windows.
