  method: IsAllowedToRun
  signature: bool BehaviorPriorityManager::IsAllowedToRun(Strategy * strategy) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given strategy is allowed to execute within the current
    behavior priority context.
  description: The IsAllowedToRun method evaluates if a specified Strategy object
    can be executed based on internal priority and state management logic. This method
    typically checks against configured rules or conditions that determine strategy
    eligibility, such as player state, environment constraints, or AI decision-making
    parameters. It is commonly used in TrinityCore's AI framework to filter out strategies
    that should not run under current circumstances, ensuring only appropriate behaviors
    are considered during AI decision cycles. The method does not modify any internal
    state and serves purely as a query function for strategy validation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the provided strategy is allowed to run according to current
    priority rules and context; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (behaviorManager.IsAllowedToRun(myStrategy)) {\n    // Execute the strategy\n\
      \    myStrategy->Execute();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Filtering Strategies in AI Loop
    code: "for (auto& strategy : allStrategies) {\n    if (behaviorManager.IsAllowedToRun(strategy))\
      \ {\n        strategy->Execute();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI decision-making loops to validate
    strategy eligibility before execution. It may involve checking player conditions,
    combat state, or other contextual factors that affect which behaviors are appropriate
    at a given moment.
