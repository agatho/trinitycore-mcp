  class: CreatureAI
  method: CanSeeAlways
  signature: bool CreatureAI::CanSeeAlways(const WorldObject * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature can always see a specified WorldObject regardless
    of normal line-of-sight or visibility restrictions.
  description: The CanSeeAlways method checks if a CreatureAI instance has the ability
    to perceive a given WorldObject without being constrained by standard visibility
    rules such as terrain occlusion, invisibility effects, or other environmental
    factors. This functionality is typically used for special AI behaviors where creatures
    need to detect targets or objects that would normally be hidden from view. The
    method evaluates the relationship between the creature's AI and the target object,
    considering factors like detection range, awareness level, and special abilities
    that override normal visual limitations.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A pointer to the WorldObject that the creature is attempting to see.
      This can be any object in the game world such as a player, NPC, item, or environmental
      object.
  returns: Returns true if the creature's AI allows it to always see the specified
    WorldObject, regardless of normal visibility constraints; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    bool CanSeeAlways(const\
      \ WorldObject* target) override {\n        // Custom logic to determine if this\
      \ creature can always see the target\n        return target && target->GetTypeId()\
      \ == TYPEID_PLAYER;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking visibility for special detection
    code: "void CheckSpecialDetection(Creature* creature, Player* player) {\n    if\
      \ (creature->AI()->CanSeeAlways(player)) {\n        // Creature can see the\
      \ player even through invisibility or obstacles\n        creature->AI()->AttackStart(player);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the CreatureAI interface and may be overridden by
    specific AI implementations. It's commonly used in scenarios where creatures have
    special detection abilities, such as those with enhanced vision or supernatural
    awareness. The default implementation likely returns false unless explicitly overridden.
  warnings: Be cautious when overriding this method as it directly affects how creatures
    perceive their environment. Incorrect implementation can lead to unexpected AI
    behavior or exploits related to invisibility detection.
