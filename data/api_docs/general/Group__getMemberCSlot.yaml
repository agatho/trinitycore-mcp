  method: _getMemberCSlot
  signature: member_citerator Group::_getMemberCSlot(int Guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant iterator to the member slot in the group corresponding
    to the specified GUID.
  description: The _getMemberCSlot method is a private helper function within the
    Group class that retrieves a constant iterator pointing to a specific member slot
    identified by its unique identifier (GUID). This method is typically used internally
    by other group methods to locate and access individual group members. The returned
    iterator allows read-only access to the member data structure within the group's
    internal container. It is important to note that this is an internal method, not
    intended for direct public use, and should be accessed only through appropriate
    group APIs. The method assumes the GUID corresponds to a valid member in the group
    and will likely result in undefined behavior if called with an invalid or non-existent
    GUID.
  parameters:
  - name: Guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group member to locate within
      the group's internal container. This should be a valid player or creature GUID
      that exists in the group.
  returns: A constant iterator (member_citerator) pointing to the member slot corresponding
    to the provided GUID. If the GUID does not exist in the group, the behavior is
    undefined and may result in invalid iterator access or program crash.
  examples:
  - title: Finding a Group Member by GUID
    code: "void FindMemberInGroup(Group* group, uint64 guid)\n{\n    // This demonstrates\
      \ internal usage of _getMemberCSlot\n    auto memberIter = group->_getMemberCSlot(guid);\n\
      \    if (memberIter != group->GetMembersEnd())\n    {\n        // Access member\
      \ data through the iterator\n        sLog->outString(\"Found member: %s\", (*memberIter)->GetName().c_str());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a private method and should not be called directly from external
    code. It operates on the internal data structure of the Group class, which may
    change between TrinityCore versions. The method assumes that the provided GUID
    exists in the group; calling it with invalid GUIDs can lead to undefined behavior.
    Performance-wise, this method likely has O(n) complexity as it searches through
    the group's member list.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly with arbitrary GUIDs. It is an internal
    helper function and may be removed or modified in future versions. Using an invalid
    GUID will result in undefined behavior including potential crashes or memory corruption.
    This method should only be used within the Group class implementation or by other
    internal TrinityCore systems.
