  class: FormationManager
  method: GetMemberCount
  signature: uint32 FormationManager::GetMemberCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of members currently in the formation.
  description: The GetMemberCount method retrieves the count of all active members
    within a formation managed by the FormationManager. This includes all creatures
    or units that have been assigned to the formation and are currently participating
    in it. The method provides a quick way to determine the size of the formation
    without needing to iterate through individual members. It is commonly used for
    AI decision-making, group coordination, and ensuring proper formation behavior
    during combat or movement operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of members currently assigned
    to the formation. Returns 0 if the formation is empty or has not been initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Formation Size
    code: "uint32 memberCount = formationManager->GetMemberCount();\nif (memberCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with formation-based logic\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Formation contains %u members\", memberCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Member Count for AI Decision Making
    code: "if (formationManager->GetMemberCount() >= 5)\n{\n    // Trigger advanced\
      \ formation tactics\n    DoAdvancedFormationTactics();\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Use\
      \ basic formation behavior\n    DoBasicFormationBehavior();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple count operation and is generally efficient.
    The returned value reflects only active members in the formation, excluding any
    that may have been removed or despawned. It's important to note that this count
    does not include temporary or pending members that are queued but not yet fully
    integrated into the formation.
  warnings: Ensure that the FormationManager instance is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as calling it on an uninitialized manager could lead to undefined
    behavior. Also, be aware that the member count may change between when you retrieve
    it and when you use it, especially in multi-threaded environments where other
    systems might modify the formation.
