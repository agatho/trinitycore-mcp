  class: LeftAppend
  method: Append
  signature: void LeftAppend::Append(WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify & data)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Appends channel notification data to the specified WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    object.
  description: The LeftAppend::Append method is responsible for populating a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet with data from the LeftAppend instance. This method is typically used in
    the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation to construct
    and send channel-related notifications to clients. It allows for the addition
    of specific channel information such as membership status, permissions, or other
    relevant metadata to the notification packet before it is transmitted. The method
    operates on a const object, indicating that it does not modify the LeftAppend
    instance itself but rather uses its data to fill in the provided packet structure.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: A reference to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify object that
      will be populated with channel notification data. This parameter is modified
      in-place by the method.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of LeftAppend::Append
    code: 'LeftAppend appendInstance;

      WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      appendInstance.Append(notifyPacket);

      // notifyPacket is now populated with channel data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore packet handling system and should
    be used when constructing channel-related notifications for client communication.
    The LeftAppend class likely contains data that needs to be serialized into the
    ChannelNotify packet structure, which follows the standard World of Warcraft packet
    format.
