documentation:
  brief: Moves a unit away from a specified target using flee behavior.
  description: The FleeingMovementGenerator is responsible for generating movement
    patterns that cause a creature or unit to flee away from a designated target.
    This movement generator is typically used in AI systems where mobs need to escape
    from dangerous situations, such as when they are under attack or when their health
    drops below a certain threshold. The generator calculates an appropriate fleeing
    path that avoids the target while maintaining realistic movement behavior within
    the game world.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a Fleeing Movement Generator
    code: 'FleeingMovementGenerator fleeingGen(std::move(targetUnit));

      // This initializes a fleeing movement generator for targetUnit to flee from
      its current position.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's AI framework and integrates with
    the creature's movement system. It should be used in conjunction with other AI
    components such as threat lists and combat state management for full functionality.
