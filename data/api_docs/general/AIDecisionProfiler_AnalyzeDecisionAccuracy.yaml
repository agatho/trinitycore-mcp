  class: AIDecisionProfiler
  method: AnalyzeDecisionAccuracy
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::AnalyzeDecisionAccuracy(uint32_t botGuid, BotAIDecisionProfile
    & profile)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes the accuracy of AI decisions made by a bot and updates its decision
    profile accordingly.
  description: The AnalyzeDecisionAccuracy method evaluates the performance of an
    AI bot's decision-making process by comparing its actual actions against expected
    or optimal outcomes. It takes the GUID of a bot and a reference to its AI decision
    profile, then processes this data to refine the bot's future behavior. This method
    is typically used in conjunction with AI profiling systems to improve bot intelligence
    over time. The method modifies the provided profile in-place, updating metrics
    such as success rates, decision accuracy, and performance indicators based on
    recent actions.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the AI bot whose decision accuracy
      is being analyzed. This value must correspond to a valid bot instance in the
      game world.
  - name: profile
    description: A reference to the BotAIDecisionProfile object that contains the
      current AI decision data for the specified bot. The method updates this profile
      with new accuracy metrics and performance indicators.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      BotAIDecisionProfile profile;

      // Assume profile is populated with previous data

      aiDecisionProfiler.AnalyzeDecisionAccuracy(botGuid, profile);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Management System
    code: "void UpdateBotAI(uint32_t botGuid) {\n    BotAIDecisionProfile profile;\n\
      \    if (GetBotProfile(botGuid, profile)) {\n        aiDecisionProfiler.AnalyzeDecisionAccuracy(botGuid,\
      \ profile);\n        SaveBotProfile(botGuid, profile);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the bot has completed a sufficient
    number of actions to provide meaningful accuracy data. Frequent calls with minimal
    data may lead to inaccurate profiling results. The method assumes that the provided
    profile contains valid historical decision data and that the bot GUID corresponds
    to an active, managed bot instance.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid botGuid or an uninitialized profile
    can result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the bot is properly initialized
    and that all required data fields are populated before invoking this method.
