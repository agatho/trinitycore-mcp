  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: GetOrCreateProfile
  signature: std::shared_ptr<PerformanceProfile> PerformanceOptimizer::GetOrCreateProfile(uint32_t
    botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves or creates a performance profile for the specified bot GUID.
  description: The GetOrCreateProfile method is used to obtain an existing PerformanceProfile
    associated with a given bot GUID, or create a new one if it does not already exist.
    This method ensures that each bot has a dedicated performance profile for tracking
    and optimization purposes within the TrinityCore framework. The returned shared
    pointer provides managed access to the profile, allowing for safe concurrent access
    and automatic memory management. This functionality is particularly useful in
    AI-driven bot systems where individual performance metrics need to be tracked
    per bot instance.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which to retrieve or
      create a performance profile. Must be a valid 32-bit unsigned integer representing
      a bot's unique ID in the game world.
  returns: A std::shared_ptr<PerformanceProfile> pointing to the existing or newly
    created performance profile for the specified bot GUID. Returns a valid pointer
    if successful, or throws an exception if the operation fails due to invalid input
    or system constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      std::shared_ptr<PerformanceProfile> profile = optimizer->GetOrCreateProfile(botGuid);

      // Use the profile for performance tracking

      profile->UpdateMetrics();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Bot Profiles
    code: "std::vector<uint32_t> botGuids = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nfor (uint32_t guid\
      \ : botGuids) {\n    auto profile = optimizer->GetOrCreateProfile(guid);\n \
      \   profile->SetLastActiveTime(time(nullptr));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from multiple threads simultaneously.
    The performance profile objects are stored in an internal map keyed by bot GUID,
    ensuring efficient lookup and creation operations. Memory management is handled
    automatically through shared_ptr semantics.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid parameter is valid and represents an actual bot
    entity in the game world to avoid unexpected behavior or memory leaks. Repeated
    calls with the same GUID will return the same profile instance, so modifications
    to one reference affect all references to that profile.
