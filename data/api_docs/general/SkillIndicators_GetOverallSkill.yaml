  class: SkillIndicators
  method: GetOverallSkill
  signature: float SkillIndicators::GetOverallSkill() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the overall skill level of a player across all trained
    skills.
  description: The GetOverallSkill method computes a weighted average of all currently
    trained skills for a player character. This value represents the player's general
    proficiency across their entire skill set, taking into account both the individual
    skill levels and their relative importance or weighting within the game system.
    The calculation typically considers active professions, secondary skills, and
    other trainable attributes that contribute to a player's overall competence. This
    method is commonly used for UI displays, character progression tracking, and various
    game mechanics that require an aggregate skill measurement.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the overall skill level of the player. This
    value typically ranges from 0.0 (no skills trained) to a maximum value determined
    by the game's skill system, often around 100.0 or higher depending on the specific
    implementation and player progression.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float overallSkill = player->GetSkillIndicators()->GetOverallSkill();\n\
      if (overallSkill > 50.0f)\n{\n    // Player has above average overall skills\n\
      \    SendSystemMessage(\"Your overall skill level is impressive!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparison with Threshold
    code: "float currentSkill = player->GetSkillIndicators()->GetOverallSkill();\n\
      float requiredSkill = 75.0f;\n\nif (currentSkill >= requiredSkill)\n{\n    //\
      \ Player meets overall skill requirement for quest or achievement\n    CompleteQuest(\"\
      AdvancedSkills\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player needs to improve overall skills\n\
      \    SendSystemMessage(\"You need to develop your overall skills further.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform calculations involving multiple skill entries, so
    it should not be called excessively in performance-critical code paths. The exact
    weighting algorithm used for calculating the overall skill may vary between different
    TrinityCore versions or server configurations. The returned value is typically
    cached and updated only when skill changes occur.
  warnings: The method assumes that all relevant skills have been properly initialized
    and trained. Calling this method on a player with no skills trained will return
    0.0, which might not be the intended behavior in all contexts. Ensure proper null
    checks if the SkillIndicators object could be invalid.
