documentation:
  brief: Loads all mount data from the database into memory for the CollectionMgr.
  description: The LoadMounts method initializes and populates the internal collection
    of mounts available to players within the TrinityCore framework. This method is
    typically invoked during server startup or player login to ensure that mount data
    is correctly loaded from the database tables into the in-memory collections used
    by the game logic. It handles the retrieval of mount IDs, their associated flags,
    and other relevant properties necessary for mount display, availability, and usage
    within the game world. The method ensures that all mounts are properly registered
    with the CollectionMgr so they can be accessed and utilized by players through
    various gameplay mechanics such as mount collection tracking and mount unlocking.

    code: 'CollectionMgr* mgr = sCollectionMgr;

      mgr->LoadMounts(); // Loads all mount data from database'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the CollectionMgr constructor
    or during server initialization. It's important to ensure that the database tables
    containing mount data are properly populated before calling this method, otherwise
    it may result in an empty or incomplete mount collection.
