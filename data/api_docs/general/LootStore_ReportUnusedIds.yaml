documentation:
  brief: Reports unused loot IDs from a given set of loot IDs.
  description: The ReportUnusedIds method checks a provided set of loot IDs against
    the internal loot store data to identify and report any IDs that are not currently
    used in the loot system. This method is typically used for debugging or maintenance
    purposes to ensure that no orphaned or invalid loot entries exist in the database.
    It does not modify any data but outputs information about unused IDs, which can
    be useful for identifying stale or misconfigured loot entries in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: lootIdSet
    description: A constant reference to a set of loot IDs (LootIdSet) that should
      be checked against the internal loot store. These IDs represent potential loot
      entries that may or may not exist in the active loot system.
  returns: None. This method returns void and is used purely for reporting purposes.
  examples:

      lootStore->ReportUnusedIds(ids);'
