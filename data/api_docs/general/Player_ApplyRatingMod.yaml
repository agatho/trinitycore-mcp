documentation:
  brief: Applies a rating modification to a player's combat rating.
  description: This method modifies a player's combat rating by applying or removing
    a specified value. It is used in conjunction with various combat-related mechanics
    to adjust player performance in combat situations. The method takes into account
    the type of rating being modified and whether the modification should be applied
    or removed. This functionality is essential for managing player stats during combat
    encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: cr
    description: The combat rating type to modify (e.g., 0 for melee, 1 for ranged,
      2 for spell).
  - name: value
    description: The value to apply or remove from the combat rating. Positive values
      increase the rating, negative values decrease it.
  - name: apply
    description: If true, applies the modification; if false, removes it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->ApplyRatingMod(0, 100, true); // Apply 100 points to melee rating'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      int32 ratingValue = -50;

      player->ApplyRatingMod(2, ratingValue, false); // Remove 50 points from spell
      rating'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore's combat system to
    adjust player stats during combat encounters. The modification affects the player's
    overall combat performance and may influence damage output or accuracy. It should
    be used carefully as it can affect gameplay balance.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect stat calculations and
    potentially unbalanced gameplay. Ensure that values are properly validated before
    applying modifications.
