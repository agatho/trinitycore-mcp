documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the layout of a formation by adjusting unit positions to improve
    group cohesion and tactical positioning.
  description: The OptimizeFormationLayout method recalculates and adjusts the spatial
    arrangement of units within a formation to enhance tactical effectiveness. This
    method typically evaluates the current positions of all units in the formation
    and modifies their placements to reduce overlap, maintain optimal distances between
    members, and ensure better coverage of the battlefield area. It is commonly used
    during combat scenarios or when formations need to adapt to changing environmental
    conditions or enemy movements. The optimization process may consider factors such
    as unit types, movement capabilities, and strategic objectives to determine the
    most effective layout.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: 'FormationManager* manager = player->GetFormationManager();

      manager->OptimizeFormationLayout();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Formation Updates
    code: "void UpdateFormation()\n{\n    FormationManager* fm = GetPlayer()->GetFormationManager();\n\
      \    if (fm)\n    {\n        fm->OptimizeFormationLayout();\n        // Additional\
      \ logic for formation synchronization\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically during combat updates or when
    formation parameters change. It may perform calculations that affect performance,
    especially with large formations. The optimization algorithm considers both static
    and dynamic factors to determine the best layout configuration.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently in rapid succession might cause performance
    degradation. Ensure that it's only called when necessary, such as after significant
    changes to formation composition or positioning.
