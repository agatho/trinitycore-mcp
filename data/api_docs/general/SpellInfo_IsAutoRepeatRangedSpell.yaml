  signature: bool SpellInfo::IsAutoRepeatRangedSpell() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell is an auto-repeat ranged spell.
  description: This method checks if the current spell is classified as an auto-repeat
    ranged spell, which typically applies to spells like shooting arrows or other
    ranged attacks that automatically repeat. The method returns true when the spell
    has the auto-repeat flag set, indicating it will automatically trigger again after
    a certain delay without requiring additional input from the player. This functionality
    is essential for determining the behavior of ranged attacks in World of Warcraft
    combat mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell is an auto-repeat ranged spell, false otherwise.
    The method specifically checks for the presence of the auto-repeat flag in the
    spell's properties, which determines whether it can be triggered repeatedly without
    player input.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spellInfo->IsAutoRepeatRangedSpell()) {\n    // Handle auto-repeat\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with spell handling systems
    to determine if a spell should be treated as an auto-repeat spell. Implementation
    relies on checking the spell's flags and properties, which are defined in the
    SpellInfo class. Performance considerations include checking the spell's flag
    values efficiently.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with other
    spell-related functions, as incorrect handling of auto-repeat spells can lead
    to improper gameplay behavior or unexpected combat results.
