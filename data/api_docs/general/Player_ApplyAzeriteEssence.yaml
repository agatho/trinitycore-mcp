documentation:
  brief: Applies an Azerite essence to a player's item, modifying its properties based
    on the specified parameters.
  description: This method applies an Azerite essence to a player's item, allowing
    for customization of item properties through the Azerite system. It modifies the
    item's stats and effects based on the provided essence ID, rank, and whether it
    is a major or minor essence. The method handles both the application and removal
    of Azerite essences, enabling players to enhance their gear with Azerite-based
    upgrades. This function is typically used during Azerite essence processing within
    the game mechanics, particularly when upgrading items through Azerite-related
    content.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to the item that will receive the Azerite essence. This parameter
      specifies which item will be modified by the essence.
  - name: azeriteEssenceId
    description: The unique identifier of the Azerite essence being applied. This
      determines which specific essence will be used for modification.
  - name: rank
    description: The rank level of the Azerite essence, determining how strong the
      effect is. Higher ranks typically result in more significant stat modifications.
  - name: major
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the essence is a major or minor type.
      Major essences generally provide stronger effects than minor ones.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag determining whether to apply or remove the Azerite essence
      from the item. True applies the essence, false removes it.
  returns: null
  examples:

      player->ApplyAzeriteEssence(item, 12345, 10, true, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove Azerite Essence from Item

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Azerite system implementation and requires proper
    handling of item modifications. It should be used carefully during gameplay to
    avoid unintended stat changes or item corruption.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect item stats or loss of
    Azerite essence functionality, especially if applied incorrectly. The method should
    only be called when the player is in a valid state for Azerite processing.
