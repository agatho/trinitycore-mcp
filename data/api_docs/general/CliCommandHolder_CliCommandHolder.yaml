  class: CliCommandHolder
  method: CliCommandHolder
  signature: void CliCommandHolder::CliCommandHolder(void * callbackArg, const char
    * command, Print zprint, CommandFinished commandFinished)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new CLI command holder with callback arguments, command string,
    print function, and completion handler.
  description: The CliCommandHolder constructor initializes a command holder object
    used in TrinityCore's command-line interface system. This method sets up the necessary
    components to manage a CLI command including its associated callback argument,
    command name, print function for output, and a completion handler that is invoked
    when the command finishes execution. The class serves as a container for command-related
    data and functions within the game server's administrative interface. It is typically
    used internally by the server's command processing system to maintain state and
    execute commands appropriately.
  parameters:
  - name: callbackArg
    description: Pointer to an argument that will be passed to the callback function
      when the command executes. This allows commands to carry context-specific data.
  - name: command
    description: Null-terminated string containing the CLI command name or identifier.
      This is used to match against registered commands in the server's command system.
  - name: zprint
    description: Function pointer to a print callback that handles output formatting
      for command results. This function receives formatted strings to display to
      the user interface.
  - name: commandFinished
    description: Function pointer to a completion handler that is called when the
      command execution finishes. Used to signal completion and perform cleanup or
      follow-up actions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic CLI Command Holder Initialization
    code: "void MyPrintCallback(const char* message) {\n    // Print implementation\n\
      }\n\nvoid MyCompletionCallback() {\n    // Completion handler\n}\n\n// Initialize\
      \ a new command holder\nCliCommandHolder holder(nullptr, \"reload\", MyPrintCallback,\
      \ MyCompletionCallback);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by TrinityCore's command system.
    The parameters are stored as member variables and accessed during command execution.
    Developers should ensure that the callback functions remain valid for the lifetime
    of the CliCommandHolder instance.
  warnings: Improper handling of callback arguments or function pointers can lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure all function pointers are properly initialized
    and that callbackArg remains valid throughout command execution.
