  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: GetBotSpeed
  signature: float ObstacleAvoidanceManager::GetBotSpeed() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current speed of the bot as calculated by the obstacle avoidance
    system.
  description: The GetBotSpeed method retrieves the speed value that has been determined
    by the obstacle avoidance manager for a specific bot. This value is typically
    used to control how fast the bot moves while navigating around obstacles in the
    game world. The returned speed may be adjusted based on various factors such as
    terrain, obstacle proximity, and bot movement behavior settings. This method is
    part of the AI system's pathfinding and movement logic within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current speed of the bot. The value typically
    corresponds to units per second or a normalized speed factor depending on the
    implementation details of the obstacle avoidance system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float currentSpeed = obstacleAvoidanceManager.GetBotSpeed();\nif (currentSpeed\
      \ > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Use the speed value for movement calculations\n    bot->SetSpeed(currentSpeed);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called frequently during AI update cycles, so performance
    should be considered when implementing or using it. The returned speed may vary
    dynamically based on real-time obstacle detection and avoidance calculations.
