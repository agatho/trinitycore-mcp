  class: BotNpcLocationService
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool BotNpcLocationService::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot NPC location service, setting up internal data structures
    and loading required configuration.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the BotNpcLocationService for use by
    initializing internal data structures, loading necessary configuration files,
    and establishing any required connections or resources. This method is typically
    called during the server startup process or when the service needs to be reinitialized
    after a reset. It ensures that all bot NPC locations are properly loaded from
    the database or configuration files and validated before being used by the bot
    management system. The method performs essential setup tasks such as verifying
    data integrity, initializing lookup tables, and preparing caches for efficient
    location retrieval.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initialization was successful and all required resources
    were properly set up; returns false if any critical error occurred during the
    initialization process, such as missing configuration files, database connection
    failures, or invalid data formats.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "BotNpcLocationService* locationService = new BotNpcLocationService();\n\
      if (locationService->Initialize()) {\n    // Service initialized successfully\n\
      \    printf(\"Bot NPC Location Service initialized successfully\\n\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n    printf(\"Failed to initialize\
      \ Bot NPC Location Service\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the service lifecycle. Repeated
    calls may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks. The method performs
    blocking operations that could impact server startup time if the configuration
    data is large or if database queries are slow.
  warnings: Do not call this method from multiple threads simultaneously as it may
    cause race conditions during initialization. Ensure all required configuration
    files and database connections are available before calling this method to avoid
    partial initialization states.
