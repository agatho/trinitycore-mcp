api:
  class: CreatureAI
  method: CheckInRoom
  signature: bool CreatureAI::CheckInRoom()
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the creature is within its designated room boundaries for AI behavior.
  description: The CheckInRoom method determines whether the CreatureAI instance's
    associated creature is currently located within the defined room or area boundaries
    that were set during initialization. This functionality is crucial for creatures
    that are meant to remain within specific zones, such as dungeon bosses or quest-related
    NPCs. The method typically evaluates the creature's current position against stored
    room coordinates or boundary data to make this determination. It is commonly used
    in AI logic to ensure proper behavior and prevent creatures from straying outside
    their intended areas.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is within its designated room boundaries,
    false otherwise. This boolean value indicates whether the current position of
    the creature falls inside the predefined area limits set for this AI instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void BossAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!CheckInRoom())\n    {\n\
      \        // Creature has left its room, handle accordingly\n        DoReset();\n\
      \    }\n    // Continue with normal AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal room boundary data that is set when
    the creature's AI is initialized. The implementation may use spatial coordinates
    or zone information to determine room membership. Performance-wise, this check
    should be relatively lightweight as it typically involves simple coordinate comparisons.
  warnings: Developers should ensure that room boundaries are properly initialized
    before calling this method, otherwise the behavior may be undefined. This method
    should not be called on creatures without proper room setup, as it might lead
    to incorrect AI behavior or potential crashes.
