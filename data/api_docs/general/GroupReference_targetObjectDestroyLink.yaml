documentation:
  brief: Destroys the link between a group reference and its target object.
  description: The GroupReference::targetObjectDestroyLink method is responsible for
    unlinking a GroupReference from its associated target object. This typically occurs
    when the referenced group member is removed from the group, or when the reference
    itself needs to be invalidated. The method ensures proper cleanup of internal
    references and prevents dangling pointers. In the context of TrinityCore's group
    management system, this operation maintains data integrity by ensuring that group
    references are properly detached from their targets before those targets are destroyed
    or modified.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage in group removal
    code: "void RemoveGroupMember(Player* player)\n{\n    GroupReference* ref = player->GetGroupRef();\n\
      \    if (ref)\n    {\n        ref->targetObjectDestroyLink();\n        // Reference\
      \ is now invalid and should not be used\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the group management system
    when members are removed or when references need to be invalidated. It's important
    to note that after calling this method, the GroupReference should no longer be
    used as it will be left in an invalid state.
  warnings: Calling this method on an already destroyed or invalid reference may lead
    to undefined behavior. Always ensure the reference is valid before invoking this
    method.
