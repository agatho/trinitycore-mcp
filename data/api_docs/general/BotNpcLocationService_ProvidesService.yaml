  class: BotNpcLocationService
  method: ProvidesService
  signature: bool BotNpcLocationService::ProvidesService(uint32 creatureEntry, NpcServiceType
    serviceType)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified NPC provides a given service type.
  description: The ProvidesService method checks if a creature entry (NPC) offers
    a specific type of service. This functionality is typically used within the BotNpcLocationService
    class to manage and query NPC service capabilities. It allows the system to determine
    what services are available from particular NPCs, such as vendor items, trainer
    skills, or other interactive services. The method evaluates both the creature
    entry and the service type to return a boolean result indicating whether the service
    is provided.
  parameters:
  - name: creatureEntry
    description: The unique identifier (entry ID) of the NPC creature being queried.
      This corresponds to the creature_template.entry field in the database.
  - name: serviceType
    description: The type of service to check for, represented by the NpcServiceType
      enumeration. Valid values include vendor services, trainer services, and other
      interactive services.
  returns: Returns true if the specified NPC provides the given service type; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an NPC provides vendor services
    code: "if (botNpcLocationService->ProvidesService(12345, NpcServiceType::VENDOR))\
      \ {\n    // Handle vendor service\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Verify trainer service availability for an NPC
    code: "bool isTrainer = botNpcLocationService->ProvidesService(67890, NpcServiceType::TRAINER);\n\
      if (isTrainer) {\n    // Proceed with trainer interaction logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal data structures or database lookups to determine
    service availability. It may cache results for performance optimization in frequently
    accessed scenarios.
