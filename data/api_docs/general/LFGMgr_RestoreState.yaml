  method: RestoreState
  signature: void LFGMgr::RestoreState(int guid, const char * debugMsg)
documentation:
  brief: Restores the LFG (Looking for Group) state for a specific player GUID.
  description: The RestoreState method is responsible for restoring the Looking for
    Group (LFG) state of a player identified by their GUID. This typically involves
    reinitializing or reapplying the player's LFG data, such as queued groups, pending
    requests, or role assignments, after a system reset, server restart, or state
    corruption event. The method may also log debug information using the provided
    message for troubleshooting purposes. It is commonly used during server maintenance
    or when a player reconnects to ensure their LFG status is properly restored.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose LFG state needs
      to be restored. This value must correspond to a valid player in the game world.
  - name: debugMsg
    description: A debug message string that provides context or reason for the state
      restoration. This is typically used for logging and debugging purposes to track
      when and why LFG state was restored.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of RestoreState
    code: LFGMgr::instance()->RestoreState(12345, "Player reconnecting after server
      restart");
    language: cpp
  - title: Using RestoreState with dynamic debug message
    code: 'std::string msg = "Restoring LFG state for player: " + std::to_string(playerGuid);

      LFGMgr::instance()->RestoreState(playerGuid, msg.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely invoked internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    player login or server state recovery. It assumes that the LFG data for the specified
    GUID exists in persistent storage or can be reconstructed from available session
    data.
  warnings: Improper use of this method with invalid GUIDs may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the GUID corresponds to an actual logged-in player before
    calling this function.
