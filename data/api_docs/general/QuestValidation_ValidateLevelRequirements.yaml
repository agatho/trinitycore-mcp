api:
  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateLevelRequirements
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateLevelRequirements(uint32 questId, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player meets the level requirements for a specified quest.
  description: 'The ValidateLevelRequirements method checks if the given player character
    has sufficient level to accept and complete the specified quest. It evaluates
    the player''s current level against the minimum and maximum level constraints
    defined in the quest template. This validation is crucial for ensuring that players
    cannot access quests outside their appropriate level range, maintaining game balance
    and progression integrity. The method returns true if the player meets all level
    criteria, or false otherwise. Precondition: The questId must correspond to a valid
    quest in the database, and the bot parameter must point to a valid Player object.'
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to validate. Must be a valid quest
      ID present in the game's quest database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose level will be checked against
      the quest requirements. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the player's level is within the acceptable range for the
    quest, false otherwise. If the quest does not exist or the player pointer is invalid,
    behavior is undefined.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Level Validation
    code: "if (QuestValidation::ValidateLevelRequirements(12345, player)) {\n    //\
      \ Player can accept and complete this quest\n    player->AddQuest(12345);\n\
      } else {\n    // Player level is not suitable for this quest\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You are not the right level for this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Accept Logic
    code: "bool CanAcceptQuest(Player* player, uint32 questId) {\n    if (!player\
      \ || !sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(questId)) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\
      \    \n    if (QuestValidation::ValidateLevelRequirements(questId, player))\
      \ {\n        return true;\n    }\n    \n    return false;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the quest template's minimum and maximum level fields
    stored in the database. It performs a direct comparison between player's current
    level and these values without considering any temporary modifiers or buffs. The
    method assumes that the player object is fully initialized with valid data including
    level information.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid quest IDs or null player pointers
    as it may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the quest template
    exists in the database before calling this validation. This method does not account
    for quest-specific level modifiers or temporary level adjustments.
