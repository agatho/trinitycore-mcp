documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes instance spawn groups for dynamic creature and game
    object spawning in instances.
  description: The LoadInstanceSpawnGroups method is responsible for loading spawn
    group data from the database for all instances in the world. This method processes
    the spawn group definitions that determine which creatures and game objects should
    spawn together in specific instance scenarios. It reads configuration data from
    the database tables related to spawn groups, validates the group definitions,
    and prepares internal data structures needed for dynamic spawning during instance
    loading. The method is typically called during server startup or when instance
    data needs to be refreshed. This functionality supports World of Warcraft's instance-based
    content where certain mobs or objects should appear together based on predefined
    groupings rather than random spawns.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeWorld() {\n    // This method is typically called internally\
      \ by TrinityCore\n    sObjectMgr->LoadInstanceSpawnGroups();\n    // Other initialization\
      \ code...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the database connection is established
    and the relevant spawn group tables have been populated. The method performs database
    queries to fetch spawn group data, so performance may be affected by database
    load. It's designed to be thread-safe as it's typically invoked during server
    initialization before concurrent access occurs.
  warnings: This method should not be called during active gameplay as it may disrupt
    existing spawn groups. If called after instances are already loaded, it could
    cause inconsistencies in creature and game object spawning behavior. The method
    assumes all required database tables exist and contain valid data.
