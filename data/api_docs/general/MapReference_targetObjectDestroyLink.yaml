  signature: void MapReference::targetObjectDestroyLink()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the link between a map reference and its target object, typically
    used during cleanup or removal of referenced objects.
  description: The MapReference::targetObjectDestroyLink method is responsible for
    breaking the association between a MapReference instance and the object it references.
    This method is typically invoked when a referenced object (such as a player or
    creature) is being destroyed or removed from the map, ensuring proper cleanup
    of reference relationships. The operation usually involves updating internal data
    structures to prevent dangling pointers and maintain consistency in the game world's
    object management system. This method is part of the reference counting mechanism
    used by TrinityCore's map system to manage object lifecycles.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during object destruction
    code: "void Player::RemoveFromMap()\n{\n    // Remove player from map\n    m_mapRef.targetObjectDestroyLink();\n\
      \    // Continue with cleanup...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    object destruction sequences. Developers should not call this method directly
    unless implementing custom reference management logic. The method may perform
    internal bookkeeping to maintain map integrity and prevent memory leaks.
  warnings: Calling this method on an already destroyed reference can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that references are properly managed and only destroyed
    when the target object is no longer valid.
