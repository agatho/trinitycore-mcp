documentation:
  brief: Returns the experience points required to reach the next level for the player.
  description: This method calculates and returns the total amount of experience points
    needed for a player to advance from their current level to the next level. The
    value represents the difference between the current level's experience cap and
    the player's current experience. This is essential for determining progression
    in the game and is used by various systems including level-up notifications, experience
    bars, and character advancement mechanics. The method accounts for the player's
    current level and experience, returning a value that can be zero if the player
    is at maximum level or has reached the experience cap for their current level.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the amount of experience points required to reach the next level,
    which is typically a positive integer value representing the difference between
    the current level's experience cap and the player's current experience. This value
    can be zero if the player has reached maximum level or has already achieved the
    experience cap for their current level.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 xpRequired = player->GetXPForNextLevel();\nif (xpRequired > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Player needs more experience to level up\n    printf(\"Need %u experience\
      \ points to next level\\n\", xpRequired);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player is at max\
      \ level or has reached experience cap\n    printf(\"Player is at maximum level\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other experience-related
    functions to determine player progression. It's important to note that the returned
    value may vary based on game server settings and player's current level, as different
    levels have different experience caps. This method does not account for any experience
    bonuses or modifiers that might affect the actual amount of experience needed.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully in contexts where player progression
    needs to be calculated accurately, as it only returns the difference between current
    and next level experience caps. It does not consider additional experience bonuses
    or modifiers that may affect actual experience requirements.
