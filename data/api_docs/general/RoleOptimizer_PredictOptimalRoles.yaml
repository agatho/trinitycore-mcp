  class: RoleOptimizer
  method: PredictOptimalRoles
  signature: int RoleOptimizer::PredictOptimalRoles(const int & players, uint32 targetContentId)
documentation:
  brief: Predicts and returns the optimal role distribution for a given number of
    players in a specific World of Warcraft content instance.
  description: The PredictOptimalRoles method determines the most efficient assignment
    of player roles (such as tank, healer, and damage dealer) based on the number
    of players participating in a specified World of Warcraft content instance. This
    method is typically used in group planning systems to optimize team composition
    for dungeons, raids, or other organized gameplay scenarios. The method takes into
    account the target content ID to determine appropriate role requirements and player
    distribution. It returns an integer representing the calculated optimal role configuration,
    which may be used by the game's grouping system or player management tools to
    suggest or enforce role assignments.
  parameters:
  - name: players
    description: The number of players in the group. Must be a positive integer representing
      valid player count for the target content.
  - name: targetContentId
    description: Unique identifier for the World of Warcraft content instance (dungeon,
      raid, etc.). This ID determines the role requirements and optimal distribution
      for that specific content.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the predicted optimal role configuration.
    The exact meaning of this value depends on internal implementation but typically
    encodes information about role assignments or group composition. A return value
    of -1 may indicate an error or invalid input parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for a 5-player dungeon
    code: 'RoleOptimizer optimizer;

      int result = optimizer.PredictOptimalRoles(5, 1234);

      // Returns optimal role distribution for 5 players in content ID 1234'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with error handling
    code: "RoleOptimizer optimizer;\nint playerCount = 25;\nuint32 contentId = 5678;\n\
      int roles = optimizer.PredictOptimalRoles(playerCount, contentId);\nif (roles\
      \ < 0) {\n    // Handle error case\n    std::cout << \"Failed to predict optimal\
      \ roles\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Process role distribution\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Optimal roles: \" << roles << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal algorithms that consider content difficulty,
    player levels, and class distributions to determine optimal group composition.
    The implementation may cache results for performance or use predefined configurations
    for common content types. Developers should be aware that role predictions might
    change based on game updates or new content additions.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input parameters. Passing invalid player counts
    or non-existent content IDs may result in undefined behavior or error returns.
    This method is part of a larger system and may require proper initialization or
    context setup before use.
