documentation:
  brief: Sends dungeon difficulty information to the player's client
  description: This method sends the current dungeon difficulty setting to the player's
    client, allowing the player to see the selected difficulty level for dungeons.
    It is typically used during dungeon entry or when a player's difficulty changes,
    such as when entering a raid instance or when the player's difficulty level is
    updated based on their group membership. The method ensures that the client displays
    the correct difficulty information for dungeon content, including normal, heroic,
    and mythic modes.
  parameters:
  - name: forcedDifficulty
    description: The difficulty level to send to the client. This parameter determines
      which difficulty mode (normal, heroic, or mythic) should be displayed for dungeon
      content. Valid values are 0-3, where 0 represents normal mode, 1 represents
      heroic mode, and 2 represents mythic mode. Values of 3 are typically used for
      raid instances.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SendDungeonDifficulty(1); // Send heroic difficulty'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      int32 difficulty = 2;

      // Set to mythic mode

      player->SendDungeonDifficulty(difficulty);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's internal client communication system
    and should be used carefully during dungeon entry or when updating player difficulty
    settings. It does not directly affect the player's actual difficulty level but
    rather sends a message to the client about which difficulty mode should be displayed.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause display issues in the client, such
    as showing incorrect difficulty levels for dungeons. Care should be taken when
    sending different difficulty values to avoid confusion with players who may be
    in groups or raid instances.
