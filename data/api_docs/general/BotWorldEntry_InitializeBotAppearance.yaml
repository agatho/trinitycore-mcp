  method: InitializeBotAppearance
  signature: void BotWorldEntry::InitializeBotAppearance()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the appearance settings for a bot character within the World
    of Warcraft environment.
  description: The InitializeBotAppearance method sets up the visual attributes and
    display properties of a bot character, including race, gender, facial features,
    and other cosmetic elements. This method is typically invoked during the creation
    or initialization phase of a bot instance to ensure that the character's appearance
    is properly configured according to predefined settings or random generation parameters.
    It interacts with the TrinityCore's creature and player appearance systems to
    apply the necessary visual data to the bot entity.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of Bot Appearance
    code: 'BotWorldEntry* botEntry = new BotWorldEntry();

      botEntry->InitializeBotAppearance();

      // The bot''s appearance is now initialized with default settings.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after the bot object has been instantiated but
    before it is added to the world. It may internally call other subsystems such
    as the creature template manager or player appearance system to apply visual data.
  warnings: Calling this method on an already initialized bot may overwrite existing
    appearance settings without warning. Ensure that this method is only invoked once
    per bot instance during setup.
