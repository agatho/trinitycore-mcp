  class: LootDistribution
  method: AnalyzeGroupLootComposition
  signature: void LootDistribution::AnalyzeGroupLootComposition(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes the composition of group loot distribution for a given group.
  description: The AnalyzeGroupLootComposition method evaluates the current state
    of loot distribution within a specified group, determining how items are being
    allocated among group members. This method is typically invoked during loot rolling
    or distribution processes to ensure fair and proper allocation based on group
    settings such as loot rules, player roles, and item quality. It may update internal
    tracking structures or trigger notifications related to loot assignment. The method
    does not directly distribute items but prepares the necessary data for distribution
    logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Loot Distribution Context
    code: "void HandleGroupLootDistribution(Group* group)\n{\n    if (group)\n   \
      \ {\n        LootDistribution lootDist;\n        lootDist.AnalyzeGroupLootComposition(group);\n\
      \        // Proceed with actual loot distribution logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal group loot tracking systems and
    may be called before or during the rolling phase of group loot. It's important
    to ensure that the provided Group pointer is valid and not null before invoking
    this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without a properly initialized group may result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the group contains valid members and
    has active loot settings before calling.
