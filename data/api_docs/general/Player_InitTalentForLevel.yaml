  brief: Initializes player's talent points for the current level
  description: This method initializes the player's talent points allocation for the
    current level, ensuring that the player has the appropriate number of talent points
    available to spend on their talents. It is typically called during character creation
    or when leveling up to ensure proper talent point distribution. The method automatically
    handles the calculation and assignment of talent points based on the player's
    current level and class-specific requirements.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->InitTalentForLevel();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after the player's level has been updated but
    before any talent point allocation occurs. It typically involves internal calculations
    based on player's class and level, and may require synchronization with other
    systems like character creation or leveling mechanics.
