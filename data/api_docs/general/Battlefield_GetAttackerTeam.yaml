documentation:
  brief: Returns the team ID of the attacking faction in a battlefield.
  description: The GetAttackerTeam method retrieves the team identifier of the faction
    currently attacking in a battlefield. This method is typically used within the
    context of World of Warcraft's Battlefield Management System (BMS) to determine
    which faction is initiating combat during a battlefield event such as Warsong
    Gulch or Arathi Basin. The returned value corresponds to either the Alliance (0)
    or Horde (1) team identifiers, allowing the game logic to differentiate between
    the two opposing forces. This method does not modify any internal state and is
    read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'An integer representing the attacking team: 0 for Alliance, 1 for Horde.
    Returns -1 if no attacker team is set or if the battlefield is in an invalid state.'
  examples:
  - title: Check Attacking Team
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(1234);\n\
      if (bf)\n{\n    int attackerTeam = bf->GetAttackerTeam();\n    if (attackerTeam\
      \ == 0)\n        sLog->outString(\"Alliance is attacking.\");\n    else if (attackerTeam\
      \ == 1)\n        sLog->outString(\"Horde is attacking.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the battlefield object has been properly initialized
    and is in a valid state. It should not be called on uninitialized or destroyed
    battlefield instances. The return value of -1 may indicate an error condition
    or that the battlefield has not yet started.
  warnings: Calling this method on a null or invalid battlefield pointer will result
    in undefined behavior. Always verify the validity of the Battlefield pointer before
    invoking this method.
