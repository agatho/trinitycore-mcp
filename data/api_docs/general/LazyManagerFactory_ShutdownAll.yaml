  brief: Shuts down all lazy managers managed by the factory
  description: The ShutdownAll method terminates and cleans up all active lazy managers
    that have been created and managed by this LazyManagerFactory instance. This method
    ensures proper resource deallocation and cleanup of any resources held by the
    managed lazy managers. It is typically called during system shutdown or when cleaning
    up resources before the factory itself is destroyed. The method iterates through
    all registered managers and invokes their shutdown procedures in a controlled
    manner.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'LazyManagerFactory& factory = LazyManagerFactory::Instance();

      factory.ShutdownAll();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when no other threads are actively using
    the lazy managers, as it may cause undefined behavior if managers are in use.
    It is recommended to call this method before destroying the factory instance.
