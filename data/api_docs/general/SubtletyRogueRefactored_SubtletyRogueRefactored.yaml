  class: SubtletyRogueRefactored
  method: SubtletyRogueRefactored
  signature: void SubtletyRogueRefactored::SubtletyRogueRefactored(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a subtlety rogue bot with the specified player object.
  description: This method serves as the constructor-like initializer for the SubtletyRogueRefactored
    class, setting up the internal state of a rogue AI bot based on the provided Player
    object. It configures the bot's behavior, abilities, and combat tactics specific
    to the subtlety specialization. The method ensures that all necessary data structures
    are properly initialized and that the bot is ready to execute subtlety-based rogue
    actions within the TrinityCore framework. This initialization process typically
    involves setting up spell caches, ability priorities, and tactical decision-making
    logic tailored for stealth and assassination gameplay.

  - title: Basic Initialization of Subtlety Rogue Bot
    code: 'Player* botPlayer = ...; // Obtain player reference

      SubtletyRogueRefactored rogueBot;

      rogueBot.SubtletyRogueRefactored(botPlayer);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the bot's initialization phase.
    The Player object passed must be a valid rogue character with subtlety specialization.
    This method does not perform any combat-related operations; it merely prepares
    the internal state for subsequent actions.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method will likely cause undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the Player object represents a valid, initialized rogue
    character before calling this method.
