documentation:
  brief: Destroys the creature's AI system and releases associated resources.
  description: The AIM_Destroy method is responsible for properly cleaning up and
    destroying the AI component of a Creature object within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method ensures that all AI-related data structures, memory allocations, and
    references are safely deallocated to prevent memory leaks. It typically gets called
    during creature destruction or when switching AI types. The method performs cleanup
    operations such as stopping AI threads, clearing AI state variables, and removing
    any AI-specific callbacks or event handlers. This is an essential part of the
    creature lifecycle management system in World of Warcraft server emulation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI destruction process completed successfully, false
    if there were issues during cleanup or if the AI was already destroyed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic AI Destruction Usage
    code: "Creature* creature = ...; // Get a creature instance\nif (creature->AIM_Destroy())\
      \ {\n    // AI successfully destroyed\n    sLog->outString(\"AI destroyed successfully\
      \ for creature %u\", creature->GetEntry());\n} else {\n    // Failed to destroy\
      \ AI\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to destroy AI for creature %u\", creature->GetEntry());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: AI Destruction in Creature Destructor
    code: "class MyCreature : public Creature {\npublic:\n    ~MyCreature() override\
      \ {\n        // Ensure AI is destroyed before base class cleanup\n        if\
      \ (!AIM_Destroy()) {\n            sLog->outError(\"Warning: Failed to destroy\
      \ AI for creature %u during destruction\", GetEntry());\n        }\n       \
      \ // Continue with base destruction\n        Creature::~Creature();\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the creature is no longer needed or
    when transitioning between different AI behaviors. It's important to note that
    calling this method multiple times on the same creature instance may result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. The destruction process is not immediate - it may
    involve asynchronous cleanup operations depending on the AI implementation.
  warnings: Calling AIM_Destroy on a creature whose AI is already destroyed or in
    an inconsistent state can lead to memory corruption or crashes. Always verify
    that the AI system is active before calling this method. Additionally, ensure
    that no other threads are actively using the creature's AI components when this
    method is invoked.
