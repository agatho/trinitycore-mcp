  class: PositionStrategyBase
  method: PositionStrategyBase
  signature: void PositionStrategyBase::PositionStrategyBase(Map * map)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a PositionStrategyBase object with the specified map reference
    for position-based AI calculations.
  description: The PositionStrategyBase constructor initializes the base class for
    position-based strategies used in AI pathfinding and positioning logic within
    the TrinityCore framework. This method sets up internal state to work with a specific
    Map instance, which is essential for calculating positions, paths, and spatial
    relationships in the game world. The map reference allows the strategy to understand
    terrain, object placements, and other spatial constraints relevant to NPC movement
    and behavior. This constructor is typically called during the initialization of
    AI strategies or when assigning a new map context to an existing position strategy
    instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Position Strategy Initialization
    code: 'PositionStrategyBase* strategy = new PositionStrategyBase(map);

      // The strategy is now initialized with the map reference

      // and can be used for position-based calculations'
    language: cpp
  - title: AI Context Setup Using Position Strategy
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    MyAI(Creature* creature)\
      \ : CreatureAI(creature), m_positionStrategy(creature->GetMap()) {}\nprivate:\n\
      \    PositionStrategyBase m_positionStrategy;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or memory allocation.
    It simply stores the map pointer for later use in position calculations. The actual
    strategy implementation will typically override virtual methods to provide specific
    behavior. Developers should ensure that the map pointer remains valid throughout
    the lifetime of the PositionStrategyBase instance.
  warnings: Do not pass a null map pointer to this constructor as it may lead to undefined
    behavior during position calculations. Always verify that the map is properly
    initialized and accessible before creating PositionStrategyBase instances.
