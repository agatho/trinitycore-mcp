  method: RemoveStoredLootItemForContainer
  signature: void LootItemStorage::RemoveStoredLootItemForContainer(uint64 containerId,
    LootItemType type, uint32 itemId, uint32 count, uint32 itemIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a stored loot item from a container based on specified criteria.
  description: The RemoveStoredLootItemForContainer method removes a specific loot
    item from a container within the LootItemStorage system. It identifies and deletes
    an entry matching the provided container ID, loot type, item ID, count, and item
    index. This method is typically used during loot distribution or cleanup processes
    when items need to be removed from containers that are no longer valid or have
    been claimed. The operation ensures that only the exact matching item is removed,
    preventing accidental deletion of other items in the same container.
  parameters:
  - name: containerId
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the container from which the loot
      item should be removed. This typically represents a player's inventory slot
      or a game object like a chest.
  - name: type
    description: The type of loot item to remove, indicating whether it is a normal
      item, quest item, or other loot category. This helps distinguish between different
      types of stored loot within the container.
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the specific item to be removed from the
      container. This corresponds to the ItemTemplate entry in the database.
  - name: count
    description: The quantity of the specified item that should be removed. If multiple
      items exist with the same ID, this parameter ensures only matching quantities
      are deleted.
  - name: itemIndex
    description: The index position of the item within the container's loot list.
      This allows for precise targeting when multiple instances of the same item exist
      in a single container.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a specific item from a player's loot container
    code: LootItemStorage::RemoveStoredLootItemForContainer(playerGuid, LOOT_TYPE_NORMAL,
      12345, 2, 0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Clean up quest items from a game object container
    code: LootItemStorage::RemoveStoredLootItemForContainer(chestGuid, LOOT_TYPE_QUEST,
      67890, 1, 3);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the internal storage structure of loot items and
    is primarily used by the core loot system. It does not directly interact with
    database records but modifies in-memory containers. The method assumes that the
    container and item exist before calling, otherwise behavior may be undefined.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the specified item exists in
    the container can lead to incorrect removals or silent failures. Ensure all parameters
    match exactly what was previously stored to avoid unintended consequences.
