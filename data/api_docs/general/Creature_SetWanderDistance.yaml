  class: Creature
  method: SetWanderDistance
  signature: void Creature::SetWanderDistance(float dist)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the wander distance for a creature, determining how far it can move
    from its initial position.
  description: The SetWanderDistance method configures the maximum distance a creature
    can wander from its original spawn position. This parameter controls the creature's
    movement behavior during AI processing, affecting how far it may travel from its
    initial location while maintaining pathfinding capabilities. The value is typically
    expressed in yards and influences the creature's patrol behavior and AI decision-making
    process. Setting this distance to zero effectively disables wandering, while higher
    values allow for greater movement range.
  parameters:
  - name: dist
    description: The maximum distance in yards that the creature can wander from its
      spawn position. A value of 0 means no wandering allowed, while positive values
      enable wandering within that distance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetWanderDistance(10.0f);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Zero Wander Distance
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetWanderDistance(0.0f);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the creature's AI behavior and should be used carefully
    during runtime. The wander distance is stored internally and influences pathfinding
    calculations, so setting it too high may cause performance issues or unexpected
    movement patterns.
  warnings: Setting this value to zero will disable all wandering behavior for the
    creature, which may affect AI-based quest completion or patrol behavior. Be cautious
    when modifying this value during runtime as it can impact creature's movement
    and potentially cause pathfinding issues.
