  class: SceneObject
  method: ClearUpdateMask
  signature: void SceneObject::ClearUpdateMask(bool remove)
documentation:
  brief: Clears the update mask of the scene object, optionally removing it from updates.
  description: The ClearUpdateMask method resets the internal update mask of a SceneObject,
    which is used to track which fields have been modified and need to be sent to
    clients. When the 'remove' parameter is set to true, the scene object is also
    removed from any active update queues or systems that manage its state changes.
    This method is typically invoked during object destruction, reset operations,
    or when transitioning an object's state in the game world. It ensures that stale
    or outdated field data does not persist in memory and prevents unnecessary network
    traffic by clearing dirty flags.
  parameters:
  - name: remove
    description: If true, removes the scene object from update systems after clearing
      the mask; if false, only clears the mask without removing the object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to clear update mask
    code: 'SceneObject* obj = ...;

      obj->ClearUpdateMask(false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clear update mask and remove from updates
    code: 'SceneObject* obj = ...;

      obj->ClearUpdateMask(true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as clearing the update mask without
    proper handling may lead to inconsistent client state. It's often used internally
    by TrinityCore's core systems during object cleanup or state transitions.
  warnings: Calling ClearUpdateMask with 'remove' set to true on objects still referenced
    elsewhere can cause undefined behavior or crashes if those references attempt
    to access the cleared object afterward.
