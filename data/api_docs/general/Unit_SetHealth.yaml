  class: Unit
  method: SetHealth
  signature: void Unit::SetHealth(uint64 val)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the health value of the unit to the specified amount.
  description: The SetHealth method allows developers to directly modify the health
    points of a Unit object, which can be a player or creature. This method is commonly
    used in game mechanics for setting health values during events, quests, or combat
    scenarios. It updates the unit's current health without any validation checks,
    making it crucial for developers to ensure proper health values are passed to
    prevent game-breaking issues. The method affects the unit's health status and
    can be used to set health to a specific value, including zero or maximum health.
  parameters:
  - name: val
    description: The new health value that the unit should be set to. This value represents
      the current health points of the unit.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Health Setting Example
    code: "Unit* target = GetPlayer();\n target->SetHealth(100);\n // Sets player's\
      \ health to 100"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Health Setting with Conditional Logic
    code: "Unit* target = GetCreature();\n if (target->GetHealth() > 0)\n {\n    \
      \ target->SetHealth(50);\n }\n else\n {\n     target->SetHealth(100);\n }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the unit's health without any internal validation
    or checks. Developers should ensure that the value passed is within valid bounds
    for the unit type (e.g., player, creature) to avoid game-breaking behavior. The
    method is typically used in conjunction with other health-related methods like
    GetHealth or SetMaxHealth.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to invalid health states, which may
    cause unexpected behavior in game mechanics. For example, setting health to zero
    or negative values can cause the unit to die unexpectedly. Developers should always
    validate that the health value is within acceptable limits before calling this
    method.
