  brief: Moves a WheatyExceptionReport instance to another instance using move semantics.
  description: The WheatyExceptionReport constructor is a move constructor that transfers
    ownership of resources from a temporary WheatyExceptionReport object to the newly
    constructed instance. This is part of the C++ standard library's move semantics
    implementation, allowing efficient resource transfer without deep copying. The
    move constructor typically sets the source object's members to a valid but unspecified
    state after the move operation. In the context of TrinityCore, this would be used
    when creating new exception report objects from temporary or rvalue references,
    optimizing memory management and performance during exception handling scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Construction Example
    code: 'WheatyExceptionReport report1;

      // ... populate report1 with data ...

      WheatyExceptionReport report2 = std::move(report1); // Move constructor called
      here'
    language: cpp
  - title: Function Returning Temporary
    code: "WheatyExceptionReport createReport() {\n    WheatyExceptionReport temp;\n\
      \    // ... populate temp ...\n    return temp; // Move constructor used during\
      \ return\n}\n\nWheatyExceptionReport report = createReport();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a regular constructor. After the move operation,
    the source object should not be used in a meaningful way as its state becomes
    undefined but valid. The implementation typically involves transferring pointers
    or handles rather than copying data, making it much more efficient than copy construction.
  warnings: Do not use the source object after moving from it. The moved-from object's
    state is left in a valid but unspecified state, which may cause undefined behavior
    if accessed. This constructor should only be called with rvalue expressions or
    objects explicitly marked for moving using std::move().
