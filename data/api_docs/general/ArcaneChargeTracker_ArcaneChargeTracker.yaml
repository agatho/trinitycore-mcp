documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the ArcaneChargeTracker class.
  description: The ArcaneChargeTracker constructor initializes a new instance of the
    ArcaneChargeTracker class. This class is responsible for tracking arcane charges
    in the context of World of Warcraft's spell mechanics, particularly for abilities
    that consume or generate arcane charges. The constructor likely sets up internal
    state variables and initializes tracking mechanisms for arcane charge accumulation
    and consumption. It is typically invoked when creating a new instance of the tracker
    for a specific player or spell effect.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new ArcaneChargeTracker instance
    code: 'ArcaneChargeTracker tracker;

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track arcane charges'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is likely called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when spell effects that require arcane charge tracking are initialized. Developers
    should not typically call this constructor directly unless implementing custom
    spell mechanics.
