documentation:
  brief: Notifies group members of a loot decision made by a player
  description: The NotifyLootDecision method broadcasts a loot decision to all members
    of a group, including the recipient and reason for the decision. This method is
    typically used in loot coordination systems where one player makes a decision
    about item distribution and needs to inform the rest of the group. The method
    handles sending appropriate messages to group members and updating internal loot
    state. It ensures that all players in the group are aware of the decision, which
    helps maintain transparency and fairness in group loot management.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group receiving the
      loot decision notification
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing information about
      the item being decided upon
  - name: recipient
    description: Pointer to the Player object who made the loot decision and is receiving
      the notification
  - name: reason
    description: String describing the reason for the loot decision, such as 'need',
      'greed', or custom messages
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic loot decision notification
    code: 'Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      LootItem item;

      item.itemid = 12345;

      item.count = 1;

      Player* recipient = player;

      std::string reason = "Need for raid loot";

      LootCoordination::NotifyLootDecision(group, item, recipient, reason);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the loot coordination system in TrinityCore and should
    be called after a loot decision has been made. It's designed to work within the
    context of group looting mechanics where players need to coordinate item distribution.
