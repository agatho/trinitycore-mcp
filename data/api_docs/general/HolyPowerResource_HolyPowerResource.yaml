documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new HolyPowerResource object with default values.
  description: The HolyPowerResource constructor initializes a new instance of the
    HolyPowerResource class. This method sets up the internal state of the resource,
    including default values for holy power accumulation and tracking. In the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, this class likely manages the
    holy power resource for paladins, handling mechanics such as power generation
    from abilities like Judgement, Flash of Light, and other holy power-generating
    spells. The constructor ensures that the resource starts in a valid, initialized
    state with appropriate default parameters.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'HolyPowerResource resource;

      // Initializes a new HolyPowerResource object with default values'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Paladin Class Context
    code: "class Paladin {\nprivate:\n    HolyPowerResource holyPower;\npublic:\n\
      \    void OnSpellCast(Spell* spell) {\n        // Constructor automatically\
      \ called during object creation\n        if (spell->GetSpellInfo()->Id == 20271)\
      \ { // Judgement\n            // Handle holy power generation\n        }\n \
      \   }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called automatically when a HolyPowerResource
    object is instantiated. Developers should be aware that the resource will have
    default values for holy power amount and tracking state, which may need to be
    adjusted based on player class or specific game mechanics. The implementation
    likely handles initialization of internal counters and state variables used for
    tracking holy power accumulation.
  warnings: Since this is a constructor, it should not be called manually unless creating
    a new instance. Be cautious when inheriting from this class as the constructor
    behavior may affect derived class initialization. Ensure that any custom initialization
    logic in derived classes properly calls the base constructor.
