  signature: void GuildBankManager::AutoDepositItems(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Automatically deposits eligible items from a player's inventory into the
    guild bank.
  description: The AutoDepositItems method processes a player's inventory and automatically
    transfers eligible items to the guild bank. This function typically handles item
    validation, checks if the item can be deposited based on guild bank permissions
    and slot restrictions, and performs the actual deposit operation. It is commonly
    used during guild bank operations or when players interact with guild bank interfaces
    to streamline item management. The method operates on a provided player reference
    and modifies the guild bank state accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier (GUID).
      This parameter specifies which player's inventory will be processed for automatic
      deposit.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of AutoDepositItems
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildBankManager bankManager;

      bankManager.AutoDepositItems(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the game engine during player
    interactions with guild banks. It assumes that the player has proper permissions
    and that the guild bank has available slots for the items being deposited.
  warnings: Improper handling of the player ID pointer may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the player exists and is valid before calling this method.
