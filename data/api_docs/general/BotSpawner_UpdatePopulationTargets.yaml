documentation:
  brief: Updates the population targets for bot spawning in the world.
  description: The UpdatePopulationTargets method recalculates and sets the target
    population counts for various bot types within the BotSpawner system. This method
    is typically invoked during server initialization or periodic updates to ensure
    that the number of active bots matches the configured population goals. It evaluates
    current bot counts, compares them against target values, and adjusts spawning
    rates accordingly to maintain desired population levels across different categories
    or zones.

  notes: This method should be called periodically to maintain accurate population
    targets. It may impact performance if invoked too frequently during high-traffic
    server periods.
