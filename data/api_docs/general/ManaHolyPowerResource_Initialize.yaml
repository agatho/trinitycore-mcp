  method: Initialize
  signature: void ManaHolyPowerResource::Initialize(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the mana and holy power resource management for a player bot.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the internal state and configurations
    required for managing a player bot's mana and holy power resources. This includes
    initializing resource tracking variables, setting default values, and preparing
    the resource system for use within the TrinityCore framework. The method ensures
    that the bot's resource management is properly configured before any resource-related
    operations are performed. It typically gets called during the bot's creation or
    activation phase to ensure all necessary data structures are in place.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Player* bot = new Player();

      ManaHolyPowerResource resource;

      resource.Initialize(bot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per bot instance to avoid overwriting
    existing configurations. The initialization process may involve memory allocation
    and setup of internal tracking mechanisms that are essential for proper resource
    management.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times on the same instance may lead to undefined
    behavior or resource leaks. Ensure that the Player pointer is valid and properly
    initialized before calling this method.
