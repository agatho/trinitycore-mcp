documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one SpatialGridManager object to another
  description: The assignment operator for SpatialGridManager performs a deep copy
    of all internal grid data structures and associated spatial information from the
    source object to the target object. This operation ensures that both objects maintain
    independent copies of the grid data, which is essential for maintaining consistent
    spatial indexing in World of Warcraft's game world. The method handles memory
    management automatically and preserves all grid boundaries, cell data, and entity
    associations during the copy process.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source SpatialGridManager object whose contents will be copied
      to this object
  returns: A reference to the current SpatialGridManager object after the assignment
    has been completed, enabling chained assignments
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Example
    code: 'SpatialGridManager grid1;

      SpatialGridManager grid2 = grid1; // Uses copy constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      grid2 = grid1; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'SpatialGridManager grid1, grid2, grid3;

      grid3 = grid2 = grid1; // Chained assignment

      // All three objects now contain identical grid data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator performs a deep copy operation which may have performance implications
    when dealing with large spatial grids containing many entities. The implementation
    ensures thread safety for read operations but requires external synchronization
    for write operations. Memory allocation occurs during the assignment process,
    so frequent assignments should be monitored for potential performance impact.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning very large SpatialGridManager objects as it
    may cause temporary memory spikes. Avoid assigning to self (grid1 = grid1) as
    this could lead to undefined behavior. The assignment operator does not validate
    that the source and destination grids are compatible in terms of spatial dimensions
    or coordinate systems.
