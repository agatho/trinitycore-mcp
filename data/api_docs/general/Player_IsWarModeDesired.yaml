api:
  class: Player
  method: IsWarModeDesired
  signature: bool Player::IsWarModeDesired() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player has war mode enabled.
  description: This method checks if the player is currently in war mode, which is
    a state where the player can engage in PvP combat with other players. The method
    returns true when the player's war mode status is active, indicating they are
    eligible to participate in PvP activities and can be attacked by other players.
    This functionality is crucial for players who want to verify their current PvP
    status or who need to know if they're in a war mode state for game mechanics purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is in war mode, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the player's war mode status is active and they can engage in PvP combat.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsWarModeDesired()) {\n    // Player is in war mode\n    //\
      \ Perform PvP-related actions\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks the player's war mode state flag rather than just
    checking if they're in a specific zone. The implementation may involve checking
    internal game state flags or status indicators that determine if war mode is active.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a player can attack other
    players, as it only indicates whether the player is in war mode state. The actual
    PvP combat eligibility depends on additional factors like zone restrictions and
    player status.
