  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: GetUpdateTime
  signature: uint32 CombatBehaviorIntegration::GetUpdateTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the update interval time in milliseconds for the combat behavior
    integration.
  description: The GetUpdateTime method retrieves the configured update interval for
    the CombatBehaviorIntegration class. This value determines how frequently the
    combat behavior logic should be executed or checked during combat scenarios. The
    returned value is typically expressed in milliseconds and represents the timing
    interval between successive updates of the combat behavior state. This method
    is commonly used within the AI update loop to control the frequency of behavior
    evaluation and decision-making processes for NPCs or creatures with combat behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the update interval time in milliseconds. This
    indicates how often the combat behavior integration should perform its update
    logic during active combat situations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 updateInterval = combatBehavior->GetUpdateTime();\n// Use the updateInterval\
      \ to schedule next AI update\nif (updateInterval > 0)\n{\n    // Schedule next\
      \ behavior update\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Update Loop
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_combatBehavior)\n\
      \    {\n        uint32 updateInterval = m_combatBehavior->GetUpdateTime();\n\
      \        if (m_updateTimer <= diff)\n        {\n            m_combatBehavior->Update();\n\
      \            m_updateTimer = updateInterval;\n        }\n        else\n    \
      \    {\n            m_updateTimer -= diff;\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned value is typically configured through database entries or hardcoded
    defaults in the TrinityCore implementation. This method should be called frequently
    during AI updates to maintain proper timing behavior. The update interval may
    vary between different combat behaviors and can affect performance if set too
    low.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the CombatBehaviorIntegration
    object may result in undefined behavior. Ensure that the object is properly constructed
    before calling GetUpdateTime to avoid potential access violations or incorrect
    timing values.
