  method: IsOnOceanFloor
  signature: bool Unit::IsOnOceanFloor() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is located on an ocean floor.
  description: This method checks if the unit is positioned on the ocean floor, which
    is relevant for determining if a unit is in water or on land. It returns true
    when the unit's position is within the bounds of an ocean floor, and false otherwise.
    This functionality is commonly used in game mechanics to determine whether units
    are submerged in water or on land, particularly for creatures that can interact
    with ocean environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is positioned on an ocean floor, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsOnOceanFloor()) {\n    // Unit is on ocean floor\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include checking the unit's position against ocean
    floor boundaries. Performance considerations involve checking spatial coordinates,
    which may be costly if done frequently.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining whether a unit is submerged
    in water, as it only checks for ocean floor positions and not general water bodies.
