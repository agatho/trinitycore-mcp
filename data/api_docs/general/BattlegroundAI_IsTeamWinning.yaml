  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: IsTeamWinning
  signature: bool BattlegroundAI::IsTeamWinning(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specific team is currently winning the battleground.
  description: The IsTeamWinning method evaluates the current state of the battleground
    to determine if the specified team is in the lead. This method is typically used
    by AI systems and game logic to make decisions based on the progress of the match,
    such as determining when to award victory conditions or trigger end-of-game events.
    The method considers factors like player kills, objectives captured, and team
    scores to assess team performance. It returns true if the team is winning and
    false otherwise. The method may also update a provided pointer to indicate which
    player on the team is contributing most significantly to the win.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer that will be updated with the GUID of the player
      who is contributing most to the winning team's progress. If no player is identified,
      this value may remain unchanged or be set to zero.
  returns: Returns true if the specified team is currently winning the battleground,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BattlegroundAI* bgAI = ...;\nint playerGUID = 0;\nbool isWinning = bgAI->IsTeamWinning(&playerGUID);\n\
      if (isWinning) {\n    // Team is winning, playerGUID contains the leading player's\
      \ ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Winning Team in Game Logic
    code: "void CheckBattlegroundStatus(Battleground* bg) {\n    BattlegroundAI* ai\
      \ = bg->GetBattlegroundAI();\n    int leadingPlayer = 0;\n    if (ai->IsTeamWinning(&leadingPlayer))\
      \ {\n        // Handle winning team logic\n        sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_BG_WINNING,\
      \ leadingPlayer);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground AI system and relies on internal
    state tracking of player actions and objectives. It may not reflect real-time
    changes immediately due to game loop timing. The player parameter is optional
    and can be null if only checking team status without identifying leading players.
  warnings: Ensure that the BattlegroundAI instance is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as it may cause undefined behavior if called on an uninitialized
    or destroyed battleground AI object. Also note that the player pointer should
    be valid to avoid memory corruption.
