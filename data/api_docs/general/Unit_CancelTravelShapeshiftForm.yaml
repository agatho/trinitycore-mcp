  signature: void Unit::CancelTravelShapeshiftForm(int removeMode, bool force)
documentation:
  brief: Cancel travel shapeshift form for a unit, removing any active shape shift
    changes.
  description: This method removes the current travel shapeshift form from a unit,
    effectively ending any active shape shift transformation. It is typically used
    when a unit needs to return to normal form or when traveling in a different form
    than intended. The method handles both the removal of the shape shift and any
    associated effects that may be active during the transformation. This function
    is commonly used in conjunction with other movement-related methods to ensure
    proper form transitions.
  parameters:
  - name: removeMode
    description: The mode of removal to apply, typically indicating how the shape
      shift should be removed (e.g., 0 = normal removal, 1 = forced removal).
  - name: force
    description: When true, forces removal regardless of normal conditions or restrictions.
      When false, removal follows standard behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetSelectedUnit();

      unit->CancelTravelShapeshiftForm(0, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Forced removal example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetSelectedUnit();

      unit->CancelTravelShapeshiftForm(1, true);

      // Forces removal even if the unit is in a different form'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include handling of shape shift effects and associated
    movement restrictions. Performance considerations involve checking for active
    effects before removal to avoid unnecessary processing. Thread safety is generally
    ensured through proper synchronization mechanisms.
  warnings: This method should not be called in situations where the unit is actively
    moving or performing actions, as it may cause unexpected behavior or errors. Avoid
    calling this method during combat or when the unit is in a state that requires
    active form changes.
