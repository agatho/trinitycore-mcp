  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: ExecuteGroupStrategy
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::ExecuteGroupStrategy(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the group quest strategy for the specified player bot, determining
    quest participation and assignment within a group context.
  description: The ExecuteGroupStrategy method is responsible for managing how a player
    bot participates in group quests within the Dynamic Quest System. This method
    evaluates the current group composition, quest availability, and individual player
    capabilities to determine appropriate quest assignments and actions. It ensures
    that bots within a group coordinate their quest activities effectively, adhering
    to game mechanics such as quest sharing, loot distribution, and role-based quest
    participation. The method typically runs during group quest updates or when a
    bot joins a group, ensuring optimal quest progression for the entire group rather
    than individual player advancement.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will execute
      the group strategy. This parameter must be a valid player instance; null pointers
      will result in undefined behavior.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecuteGroupStrategy
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player

      DynamicQuestSystem::ExecuteGroupStrategy(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using ExecuteGroupStrategy in group quest update context
    code: "void OnGroupUpdate(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->GetGroup())\n  \
      \  {\n        for (Group::MemberSlotList::const_iterator itr = player->GetGroup()->GetMemberSlots().begin();\
      \ \n             itr != player->GetGroup()->GetMemberSlots().end(); ++itr)\n\
      \        {\n            Player* member = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(itr->guid);\n\
      \            if (member && member->IsBot())\n            {\n               \
      \ DynamicQuestSystem::ExecuteGroupStrategy(member);\n            }\n       \
      \ }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the Dynamic Quest System when
    group composition changes or during quest update cycles. It assumes that the player
    object passed in has been properly initialized and is part of a valid group. The
    implementation may involve complex logic for evaluating quest prerequisites, player
    levels, and group roles.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the bot parameter will cause undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the Player object is valid and represents an actual bot before calling
    this method. This method should not be called on non-bot players unless explicitly
    designed to handle such cases.
