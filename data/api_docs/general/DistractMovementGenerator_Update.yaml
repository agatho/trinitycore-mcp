  method: Update
  signature: bool DistractMovementGenerator::Update(int * param0, int param1)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the distract movement generator to determine if the distraction behavior
    should continue or stop.
  description: The Update method in DistractMovementGenerator is responsible for managing
    the logic that controls how a creature or unit behaves while under a distraction
    effect. It evaluates whether the distraction should persist based on internal
    state and time conditions. This method is typically called during the AI update
    cycle to ensure the movement behavior remains consistent with the distraction
    mechanics. The method returns true if the distraction continues, or false when
    it should be terminated.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the distract movement generator should continue its behavior;
    returns false if the distraction effect has ended or should be stopped.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "bool result = distractGenerator->Update(nullptr, 0);\nif (!result) {\n\
      \    // Distract effect has ended\n    // Handle cleanup or state change\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the movement generator system in TrinityCore's AI
    framework. It is expected to be called regularly during the creature's update
    loop, typically every tick or frame. The internal logic may involve checking for
    time-based expiration or external interruption conditions.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you are implementing or extending
    AI behavior. Incorrect handling of the return value can lead to inconsistent movement
    states or premature termination of distraction effects.
