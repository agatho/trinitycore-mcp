  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: CanBotTaunt
  signature: bool ThreatCoordinator::CanBotTaunt(int botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot can taunt an enemy target based on current threat
    conditions.
  description: The CanBotTaunt method evaluates if a specific bot (identified by its
    GUID) is allowed to perform a taunt action on a target. This decision is typically
    made based on the bot's current threat level, target's aggro status, and other
    AI-related factors within the ThreatCoordinator system. The method ensures that
    bots do not spam taunts or act in ways that would break game balance or AI logic.
    It is commonly used in conjunction with bot behavior scripts to control when a
    bot should attempt to gain or shift aggro from a target.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that is being evaluated for
      taunting capability. This value must correspond to a valid bot in the current
      world context.
  returns: Returns true if the specified bot is allowed to taunt its target; otherwise,
    returns false. A return value of false may indicate that the bot already has sufficient
    threat, is not targeting an eligible enemy, or that taunting would violate game
    rules or AI constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Taunt Permission Check
    code: "if (threatCoordinator->CanBotTaunt(botGuid)) {\n    // Proceed with taunt\
      \ action\n    bot->Taunt();\n} else {\n    // Do not taunt, possibly move to\
      \ another behavior\n    bot->MoveToTarget();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in Bot AI Loop
    code: "void BotAI::Update() {\n    if (CanBotTaunt(botGuid)) {\n        // Perform\
      \ taunt logic\n        DoTaunt();\n    } else {\n        // Fallback to other\
      \ actions\n        ChooseNextAction();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ThreatCoordinator system, which manages how bots
    interact with threat mechanics in World of Warcraft. It is important to note that
    this check is typically performed frequently during bot AI updates, so performance
    considerations should be taken into account when implementing custom logic around
    this function.
  warnings: Ensure that botGuid corresponds to a valid and active bot entity before
    calling this method. Passing an invalid or inactive GUID may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect return values.
