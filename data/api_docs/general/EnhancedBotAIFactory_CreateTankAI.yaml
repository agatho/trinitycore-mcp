  class: EnhancedBotAIFactory
  method: CreateTankAI
  signature: int EnhancedBotAIFactory::CreateTankAI(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a tank AI for the specified bot player.
  description: The CreateTankAI method is responsible for setting up a specialized
    AI behavior tailored for tanking roles within the EnhancedBot system. It configures
    the bot's AI to prioritize threat generation, defensive abilities, and target
    management appropriate for a tank class. The method typically assigns specific
    AI tactics such as aggro control, shield usage, and taunt mechanics. This function
    is part of the EnhancedBotAIFactory class which manages different AI configurations
    for various roles in World of Warcraft. The method expects a valid Player object
    representing the bot that will be configured with tanking AI behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure status of the
    AI creation process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful creation,
    while negative values may represent specific error codes such as invalid player
    reference or AI system unavailability.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Tank AI Creation
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Get a valid bot player\nint result = factory->CreateTankAI(bot);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // Tank AI successfully created\n    printf(\"Tank AI\
      \ created successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle error\n    printf(\"\
      Failed to create tank AI with code: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed specifically for use with EnhancedBot system and
    requires the bot player to be properly initialized before calling. The AI configuration
    may vary based on the bot's class and level. Performance considerations include
    potential delays during AI initialization which could affect real-time gameplay
    if called frequently.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-bot player or an uninitialized player object
    may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the Player object is valid and properly
    configured before invoking this method. The method does not validate whether the
    bot's class is suitable for tanking, so developers should verify compatibility
    beforehand.
