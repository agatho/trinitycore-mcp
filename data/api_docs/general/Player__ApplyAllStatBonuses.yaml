  brief: Applies all stat bonuses to the player character
  description: This method applies all stat bonuses to the player character, including
    those from equipment, talents, and other sources. It ensures that all stat modifiers
    are properly calculated and applied to the player's attributes. The method is
    typically called during character initialization, level-up, or when changing gear
    to maintain accurate stat calculations. This function handles the internal calculation
    of stat bonuses and their application to the player's current stats.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->_ApplyAllStatBonuses();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called internally by the TrinityCore framework when stat changes
    occur. It should not be called directly in most cases as it's handled automatically
    during gameplay. Performance considerations include potential memory usage during
    stat calculation.
  warnings: This method should not be called manually unless specifically required
    by custom code or debugging purposes. Calling it multiple times without proper
    handling may cause stat calculation issues.
