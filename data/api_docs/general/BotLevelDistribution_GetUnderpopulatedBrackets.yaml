  method: GetUnderpopulatedBrackets
  signature: int BotLevelDistribution::GetUnderpopulatedBrackets(int faction) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the number of underpopulated level brackets for the
    specified faction in the bot distribution system.
  description: The GetUnderpopulatedBrackets method determines how many level brackets
    are currently underpopulated for a given faction within the bot distribution system.
    This method is typically used to identify which level ranges require additional
    bots to maintain balanced player population across different levels. The calculation
    considers the current number of bots in each bracket against a predefined target
    population threshold. It returns an integer value representing the count of brackets
    that fall below this threshold for the specified faction.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of level brackets that are underpopulated
    for the specified faction. Returns zero if all brackets meet or exceed the target
    population threshold, or if the faction parameter is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Check underpopulated brackets for Alliance
    code: "int underpopulated = botLevelDistribution.GetUnderpopulatedBrackets(FACTION_ALLIANCE);\n\
      if (underpopulated > 0) {\n    // Handle underpopulation logic\n    printf(\"\
      %d brackets are underpopulated for Alliance\\n\", underpopulated);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs calculations based on internal data structures
    that track bot distribution across different level brackets. It may involve comparing
    current population counts against target values defined in configuration files
    or game balance settings. The method is probably called periodically by the server
    to maintain optimal bot distribution.
  warnings: The method assumes valid faction parameters and may return unexpected
    results if invalid faction IDs are passed. Ensure proper validation of faction
    values before calling this method in production code.
