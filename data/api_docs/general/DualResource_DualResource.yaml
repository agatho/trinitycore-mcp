  class: DualResource
  method: DualResource
  signature: void DualResource::DualResource(uint32 primaryMax, float primaryRegen,
    uint32 secondaryMax)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes dual resource values for a player or unit with specified maximums
    and regeneration rates.
  description: The DualResource constructor method initializes the primary and secondary
    resource systems for a game entity. This method sets up the maximum values and
    regeneration rates for two distinct resource types, commonly used in World of
    Warcraft for managing resources like Energy and Rage, or Focus and Mana. The initialization
    occurs at object creation or when resetting resource states. It is typically called
    during character creation, class initialization, or when switching between different
    resource management systems within the game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: primaryMax
    description: The maximum value for the primary resource type (e.g., Energy, Rage).
      Must be a positive integer representing the upper limit of the resource.
  - name: primaryRegen
    description: The regeneration rate per second for the primary resource. Can be
      a floating-point number indicating how much resource is restored each second.
  - name: secondaryMax
    description: The maximum value for the secondary resource type (e.g., Focus, Mana).
      Must be a positive integer representing the upper limit of the resource.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize Energy/Rage resources
    code: DualResource::DualResource(100, 5.0f, 100); // Sets up Energy (max 100,
      regen 5/sec) and Rage (max 100)
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialize Focus/Mana resources
    code: DualResource::DualResource(100, 2.5f, 200); // Sets up Focus (max 100, regen
      2.5/sec) and Mana (max 200)
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore's resource management
    system. Developers should ensure that the values passed are valid for their intended
    use case, especially considering game balance and performance implications of
    high regeneration rates.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values may lead to unexpected behavior in combat or
    resource management systems. The primaryRegen value should be carefully considered
    as it directly affects gameplay balance and player experience.
