  method: RemoveDeniedPermission
  signature: void RBACData::RemoveDeniedPermission(uint32 permissionId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a denied permission from the RBAC data structure for a given permission
    ID.
  description: The RemoveDeniedPermission method removes a specific denied permission
    from the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) data associated with a user or account.
    This function is typically used in the context of TrinityCore's permission management
    system, where permissions are either granted or denied to users based on their
    roles. The method operates on the internal storage of denied permissions and ensures
    that the specified permission ID is no longer marked as denied for the entity
    this RBACData instance represents. It does not validate whether the permission
    ID exists in the denied list before attempting removal, so calling it with an
    invalid or non-existent ID will have no effect.
  parameters:
  - name: permissionId
    description: The unique identifier of the permission to be removed from the denied
      list. This value must correspond to a valid permission defined in the TrinityCore
      permission system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a Denied Permission
    code: 'RBACData rbacData;

      // Assume player has been assigned some denied permissions

      rbacData.RemoveDeniedPermission(12345);

      // Permission ID 12345 is now removed from the denied list'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove Multiple Denied Permissions
    code: "RBACData rbacData;\nstd::vector<uint32> deniedPermissions = {1001, 1002,\
      \ 1003};\nfor (uint32 permId : deniedPermissions)\n{\n    rbacData.RemoveDeniedPermission(permId);\n\
      }\n// All specified permissions are removed from the denied list"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the RBACData object directly.
    It is recommended to ensure that permission IDs passed to this method are valid
    and exist in the system before calling it, although no error will occur if they
    do not. The method does not perform any database synchronization or logging; changes
    made here are only reflected in memory.
  warnings: Calling RemoveDeniedPermission with an invalid permission ID will silently
    fail without raising an exception or warning. It is important to validate the
    existence of a permission before attempting to remove it from the denied list,
    especially when dealing with dynamic permission management.
