  signature: bool WorldObject::IsInWorldPvpZone() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the WorldObject is located within a PvP-enabled zone in
    the world.
  description: The IsInWorldPvpZone method checks if the current WorldObject (such
    as a player, creature, or game object) is positioned within a zone that has PvP
    (Player versus Player) combat enabled. This method evaluates the object's current
    map and area flags to determine if PvP rules apply to its location. It is commonly
    used in game logic to enforce PvP restrictions, enable PvP-specific behaviors,
    or disable certain actions based on the zone's PvP status. The method does not
    consider the object's faction or personal PvP status; it only checks the geographical
    zone properties.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the WorldObject is located within a PvP-enabled zone, false
    otherwise. This indicates whether standard PvP rules and mechanics are active
    in the object's current location.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Player is in PvP Zone
    code: "if (player->IsInWorldPvpZone())\n{\n    // Enable PvP-specific behavior\n\
      \    player->SetPvPFlag();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Action Based on PvP Status
    code: "if (unit->IsInWorldPvpZone() && unit->GetTypeId() == TYPEID_PLAYER)\n{\n\
      \    // Apply PvP debuffs or effects\n    unit->AddAura(SPELL_PVP_DEBUFF, unit);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying zone and area flags defined in the game's
    database. It may not account for temporary PvP status changes such as those caused
    by battlegrounds or arenas unless these are reflected in the zone flags. The method
    performs a fast lookup using cached zone information, making it suitable for frequent
    checks during gameplay.
  warnings: This method does not differentiate between various types of PvP zones
    (e.g., open world PvP vs. arena PvP). It only checks if the object is within any
    zone marked as PvP-enabled. Be cautious when using this in performance-critical
    code paths as it may indirectly trigger map or area data lookups.
