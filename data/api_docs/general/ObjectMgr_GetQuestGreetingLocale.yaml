  method: GetQuestGreetingLocale
  signature: const int * ObjectMgr::GetQuestGreetingLocale(int type, uint32 id) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the localized quest greeting text ID for a given quest or NPC.
  description: 'The GetQuestGreetingLocale method fetches the localized quest greeting
    identifier associated with a specific quest or NPC entry. This is used in World
    of Warcraft to determine which localized text should be displayed when a player
    interacts with a quest giver. The returned integer typically corresponds to an
    entry in the quest_greeting_locale table within the database, allowing for different
    greeting messages based on the player''s locale. The method takes two parameters:
    type (indicating whether it''s a quest or NPC) and id (the identifier of the quest
    or NPC). It returns a pointer to an integer representing the localized text ID,
    which may be NULL if no localized entry exists.'
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: An integer indicating the type of object. Typically 0 for quests
      and 1 for NPCs.
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the quest or NPC to retrieve the localized
      greeting for.
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the localized quest greeting text
    ID. Returns NULL if no localized entry exists for the specified type and ID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve localized quest greeting for a specific quest
    code: "const int* greetingId = sObjectMgr->GetQuestGreetingLocale(0, 12345);\n\
      if (greetingId != nullptr) {\n    // Use the greeting ID to fetch localized\
      \ text\n    printf(\"Localized greeting ID: %d\\n\", *greetingId);\n} else {\n\
      \    printf(\"No localized greeting found for quest 12345\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in the context of quest interaction and localization.
    It's important to note that the returned pointer may be NULL, so callers must
    check for null before dereferencing. The method assumes valid input parameters
    and does not perform validation.
  warnings: Ensure that the type parameter correctly distinguishes between quests
    (0) and NPCs (1). Using incorrect types can lead to unexpected behavior or data
    corruption. Also, since this returns a raw pointer, developers must be careful
    about memory management and ensure the pointed-to value remains valid during use.
