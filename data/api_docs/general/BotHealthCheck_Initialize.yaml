  class: BotHealthCheck
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool BotHealthCheck::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot health check system and prepares it for monitoring player
    bot conditions
  description: The Initialize method sets up the internal state and resources required
    for the BotHealthCheck class to perform its monitoring functions. This includes
    initializing data structures, registering necessary event handlers, and preparing
    any required configuration settings. The method should be called once during the
    system startup or when the bot health checking functionality is first needed.
    It ensures that all underlying systems are properly configured before attempting
    to check or monitor bot health conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if initialization was successful and all required resources
    were properly allocated, false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates
    a failure in setting up internal components or acquiring necessary system resources.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "BotHealthCheck healthCheck;\nbool success = healthCheck.Initialize();\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Bot health check system is ready for use\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Bot health check initialized successfully\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle initialization\
      \ failure\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to initialize bot health check system\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of a BotHealthCheck
    instance. Multiple calls may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks. The
    initialization process may involve system resource allocation and configuration
    loading, which could take some time depending on system load.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to memory
    leaks or inconsistent internal state. Ensure that any previous initialization
    is properly cleaned up before calling this method again.
