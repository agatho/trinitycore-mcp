    y, float z, float o, TempSummonType despawnType, int despawnTime, ObjectGuid privateObjectOwner)
documentation:
  brief: Summon a creature with specified entry at given coordinates with defined
    despawn type and time
  description: This method summons a creature with the specified entry at the given
    coordinates (x, y, z) with orientation o. The creature will be summoned as a temporary
    summon with the specified despawn type and time. It allows for precise control
    over creature spawning behavior including duration and type of summoning. The
    summoned creature is tied to the WorldObject that calls this method, making it
    useful for controlling creature behavior in various game mechanics contexts.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The creature entry ID to summon. This defines what creature will
      be created and must match valid NPC entries in the database.
  - name: x
    description: X coordinate where the creature will be summoned. Must be within
      map boundaries.
  - name: y
    description: Y coordinate where the creature will be summoned. Must be within
      map boundaries.
  - name: z
    description: Z coordinate where the creature will be summoned. Must be within
      map boundaries.
  - name: o
    description: Orientation angle for creature facing direction. This is typically
      in radians and controls the creature's rotation.
  - name: despawnType
    description: Type of temporary summoning behavior. Controls how long the creature
      will exist before despawning.
  - name: despawnTime
    description: Time in milliseconds before creature despawns. Only applicable for
      certain summon types like timed summons.
  - name: privateObjectOwner
    description: The GUID of the object that owns this summoned creature. Used to
      track ownership and control behavior.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the TempSummon object created by this method, which
    represents the summoned creature with its specific summoning behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic creature summoning example
    code: TempSummon* summon = SummonCreature(12345, 100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f, 0.0f,
      TEMPSUMMON_TIMED_DESPAWN, 60000);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced creature summoning with owner
    code: TempSummon* summon = SummonCreature(12345, 100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f, 0.0f,
      TEMPSUMMON_TIMED_DESPAWN, 60000, GetGUID());
    language: cpp
  notes: The method requires valid coordinates and orientation values. The summoned
    creature will be tied to the calling WorldObject for ownership tracking. This
    method is commonly used in quest scripts and AI behavior for creating temporary
    creatures.
  warnings: This method should not be called during map loading or when the world
    object is not initialized. It may cause memory issues if used improperly, especially
    with invalid entry IDs or coordinates outside map boundaries.
