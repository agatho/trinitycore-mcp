  method: LoadAsyncSafeStatements
  signature: void StatementClassifier::LoadAsyncSafeStatements()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads asynchronous safe SQL statements for database operations
    within the TrinityCore server.
  description: The LoadAsyncSafeStatements method is responsible for preparing and
    loading a set of SQL statements that are designed to be executed asynchronously
    without blocking the main game thread. This method typically initializes statement
    objects that can safely be used in background database operations, ensuring thread
    safety and preventing potential deadlocks or race conditions during concurrent
    database access. It is commonly invoked during server startup or initialization
    phases when database connectivity and statement preparation are required before
    normal gameplay operations begin.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'StatementClassifier classifier;

      classifier.LoadAsyncSafeStatements();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the server's initialization
    phase. It is typically invoked by internal TrinityCore systems and not meant to
    be called directly by custom modules unless specifically required for database
    statement management.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in duplicate statement loading
    or memory leaks. Ensure that this method is not invoked after database connections
    have been established with active transactions, as it may interfere with existing
    operations.
