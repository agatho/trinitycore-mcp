  class: BattlefieldMgr
  method: ~BattlefieldMgr
  signature: void BattlefieldMgr::~BattlefieldMgr()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BattlefieldMgr instance and cleans up all associated battlefield
    data and resources.
  description: The BattlefieldMgr destructor is responsible for properly cleaning
    up all battlefield-related data structures, removing active battlefields from
    memory, and ensuring no dangling references or memory leaks occur when the manager
    is destroyed. This method is automatically invoked when a BattlefieldMgr object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. The destructor ensures that all battlefield
    instances are gracefully shut down, their resources released, and any pending
    operations are terminated before the manager itself is destroyed. In the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this cleanup is essential for maintaining
    server stability during shutdown sequences or when battlefield systems need to
    be reinitialized.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BattlefieldMgr instance
    code: "void CleanupBattlefieldManager()\n{\n    // BattlefieldMgr is created on\
      \ stack\n    BattlefieldMgr mgr;\n    // Destructor automatically called here\
      \ when mgr goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of BattlefieldMgr pointer
    code: "void ShutdownBattlefieldSystem()\n{\n    BattlefieldMgr* mgr = new BattlefieldMgr();\n\
      \    // ... perform operations with mgr ...\n    delete mgr; // Destructor called\
      \ here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor performs critical cleanup operations including calling destructors
    on all active battlefield instances, releasing memory allocated for battlefield
    data structures, and ensuring thread-safe shutdown of any concurrent battlefield
    operations. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor as it's automatically
    called during object destruction.
  warnings: Never manually call the BattlefieldMgr destructor directly unless you're
    certain about the object lifecycle. Improper handling can lead to memory leaks
    or undefined behavior. The destructor assumes all battlefield operations have
    been properly terminated before cleanup begins.
