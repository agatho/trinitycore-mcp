documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum number of runes available for the player's class
  description: The GetMax method retrieves the maximum count of runes that a player
    can have active at any given time based on their character's class and level.
    In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, this value is determined by
    the player's specialization and class-specific rune configurations. This method
    is typically used to manage rune systems for Death Knights and other classes that
    utilize rune mechanics. The returned value represents the total capacity of runes
    that can be generated or consumed during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of runes that can be active
    for this player's class. This typically ranges from 0 to 6 depending on the character's
    class and specialization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 maxRunes = player->GetRuneSystem()->GetMax();\n// Returns the maximum\
      \ number of runes for the current player\nif (maxRunes > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed\
      \ with rune management logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Rune Capacity
    code: "RuneSystem* runeSys = player->GetRuneSystem();\nuint32 maxRunes = runeSys->GetMax();\n\
      uint32 currentRunes = runeSys->GetCount();\n\nif (currentRunes < maxRunes)\n\
      {\n    // Player can generate more runes\n    // Implement rune regeneration\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the RuneSystem class which manages the rune mechanics
    for classes that utilize runes, primarily Death Knights. The maximum number of
    runes is determined by game balance and class design rather than being configurable
    at runtime. This method should be called frequently during gameplay to maintain
    accurate rune state.
  warnings: Do not use this value directly for rune regeneration calculations without
    considering cooldowns and class-specific mechanics. The returned value may change
    based on player level-ups or specialization changes, so caching this value without
    proper invalidation can lead to incorrect behavior.
