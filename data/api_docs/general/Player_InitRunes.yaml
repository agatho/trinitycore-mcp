  brief: Initializes player's rune system, setting up the basic framework for rune
    management and cooldowns.
  description: The InitRunes method initializes a player's rune system by setting
    up the basic framework required for managing runes. This method is typically called
    during player initialization or when a player's character is created. It establishes
    the foundation for rune-based abilities, including setting up cooldowns and initializing
    rune states. The method ensures that players can properly use their rune abilities
    and maintain proper cooldown management for these abilities. This method is crucial
    for maintaining game balance and ensuring that players have access to their rune-based
    capabilities.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during player creation or initialization
    process. It may be invoked automatically by the core system when a player's character
    is created. The implementation involves setting up internal structures for tracking
    rune cooldowns and states, which are essential for game mechanics involving rune-based
    abilities.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly in most cases as it's usually
    handled by the core system during player initialization. Calling this method multiple
    times can lead to improper rune state management and potentially cause issues
    with rune cooldowns.
