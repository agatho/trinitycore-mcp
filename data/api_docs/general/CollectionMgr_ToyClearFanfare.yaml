documentation:
  brief: Triggers a fanfare effect when a toy is cleared from the player's collection.
  description: The ToyClearFanfare method plays a visual and auditory fanfare animation
    when a specific toy item is removed from a player's collection. This method is
    typically invoked internally by the game engine when a toy is no longer available
    to the player, such as when it is sold, destroyed, or otherwise removed from their
    inventory. The fanfare serves as feedback to the player that an item has been
    cleared from their toy collection, enhancing user experience with visual effects
    and sound cues. This method does not directly modify any data structures but rather
    triggers a presentation layer effect.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the toy item being cleared from the player's
      collection. This ID must correspond to a valid toy entry in the game's database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Triggering a Toy Clear Fanfare
    code: 'CollectionMgr* collectionMgr = player->GetCollectionMgr();

      collectionMgr->ToyClearFanfare(12345); // Triggers fanfare for toy with ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other collection management
    functions to provide a complete user experience when toys are modified. It may
    be called automatically by the server upon certain events like item removal or
    player actions.
