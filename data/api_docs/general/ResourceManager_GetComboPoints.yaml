api:
  class: ResourceManager
  method: GetComboPoints
  signature: uint32 ResourceManager::GetComboPoints()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current number of combo points for the resource manager's associated
    unit.
  description: The GetComboPoints method returns the number of combo points currently
    accumulated by the unit managed by this ResourceManager instance. Combo points
    are a core game mechanic in World of Warcraft used primarily by rogues and other
    classes that utilize combo point systems. These points are typically generated
    through specific actions such as finishing moves, certain abilities, or auto-attacks.
    The returned value represents how many combo points are currently available for
    use with combo-point-consuming abilities. This method does not modify any internal
    state and is read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of combo points currently possessed
    by the associated unit. Valid values range from 0 to 5, where 0 indicates no combo
    points and 5 represents the maximum possible combo points.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 comboPoints = resourceManager->GetComboPoints();\nif (comboPoints\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Perform combo-point consuming action\n    player->AddComboPoints(comboPoints);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Maximum Combo Points
    code: "uint32 comboPoints = resourceManager->GetComboPoints();\nif (comboPoints\
      \ >= 5)\n{\n    // Execute finisher ability\n    player->CastSpell(target, FINISHER_SPELL_ID);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with combo point management
    systems. It's important to note that the returned value may change frequently
    during gameplay as combo points are gained and spent. The ResourceManager class
    likely maintains internal state tracking of combo points, which this method exposes.
  warnings: Be aware that combo points can be consumed or reset by various game events
    such as combat ending, switching targets, or using certain abilities. Always verify
    the current combo point count before performing actions that consume them to avoid
    incorrect behavior.
