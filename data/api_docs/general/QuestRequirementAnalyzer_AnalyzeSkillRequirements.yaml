  class: QuestRequirementAnalyzer
  method: AnalyzeSkillRequirements
  signature: void QuestRequirementAnalyzer::AnalyzeSkillRequirements(const Quest *
    quest, Player * bot, int & issues)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes skill requirements for a quest and updates the issue count for a
    player bot.
  description: The AnalyzeSkillRequirements method evaluates whether a player bot
    meets the necessary skill level requirements to accept and complete a given quest.
    It checks the bot's current skill levels against the quest's defined skill prerequisites,
    such as profession or secondary skill requirements. This method is typically used
    in automated questing systems or quest analysis tools within TrinityCore. The
    method modifies the issues parameter to reflect any skill-related problems that
    prevent the bot from taking the quest.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object containing the skill requirements to
      be analyzed. Must not be null.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose skills are
      being evaluated against the quest requirements. Must not be null.
  - name: issues
    description: Reference to an integer that will be incremented if skill-related
      issues are found. The value is modified by this method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of AnalyzeSkillRequirements
    code: "Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\nPlayer* bot = ...;\
      \ // Assume valid player object\nint issues = 0;\nquestAnalyzer.AnalyzeSkillRequirements(quest,\
      \ bot, issues);\nif (issues > 0) {\n    // Handle skill requirement issues\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the quest and bot objects are valid and properly
    initialized. It does not perform any validation on these parameters beyond checking
    for null pointers. The method is typically part of a larger quest analysis system
    and may be called in conjunction with other requirement checks.
  warnings: Ensure that both the quest and bot parameters are valid before calling
    this method, as passing null pointers will likely result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. This method modifies the issues parameter directly, so ensure proper
    handling of its value after the call.
