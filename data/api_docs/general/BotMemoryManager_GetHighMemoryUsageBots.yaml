    count) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of bot GUIDs that are using high amounts of memory.
  description: The GetHighMemoryUsageBots method returns a vector containing the unique
    identifiers (GUIDs) of bots that have been identified as consuming excessive memory.
    This functionality is typically used by the TrinityCore server to monitor and
    manage bot resource usage, particularly in environments where many bots are active.
    The method does not take any parameters and internally determines which bots qualify
    as having high memory usage based on predefined thresholds or heuristics. It's
    important to note that this method may be called periodically by system maintenance
    routines or during memory pressure situations to identify and potentially terminate
    or optimize high-memory bots.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector<uint32_t> containing the GUIDs of bots with high memory usage.
    Each element in the vector represents a unique identifier for a bot that has been
    flagged as consuming excessive memory resources.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "std::vector<uint32_t> highMemoryBots = botMemoryManager.GetHighMemoryUsageBots(0);\n\
      for (uint32_t guid : highMemoryBots) {\n    std::cout << \"Bot GUID with high\
      \ memory usage: \" << guid << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger bot management system and may be used
    in conjunction with other memory monitoring or cleanup routines. The actual definition
    of 'high memory usage' is implementation-specific but typically involves comparing
    current memory consumption against average usage or configurable limits.
