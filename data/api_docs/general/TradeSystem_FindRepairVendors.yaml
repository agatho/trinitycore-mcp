  class: TradeSystem
  method: FindRepairVendors
  signature: int TradeSystem::FindRepairVendors(Player * player, float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the number of repair vendors within a specified radius
    for the given player.
  description: The FindRepairVendors method searches for all NPC vendors in the game
    world that are capable of repairing items and are located within the specified
    radius from the player's current position. This method is typically used by the
    trade system to locate nearby repair facilities for the player. The method iterates
    through the game's NPC database, filtering those with repair capabilities and
    checking their proximity to the player. It returns an integer representing the
    count of valid repair vendors found within range. The radius parameter determines
    how far from the player's location the method will search for vendors.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object for which to find repair vendors.
      This must be a valid player instance, otherwise the method may cause undefined
      behavior or return incorrect results.
  - name: radius
    description: The maximum distance (in yards) from the player's current position
      to search for repair vendors. Must be a positive value; negative values are
      typically treated as zero or ignored.
  returns: An integer representing the number of repair vendors found within the specified
    radius. Returns 0 if no vendors are found or if the input parameters are invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player instance\nint vendorCount\
      \ = TradeSystem::FindRepairVendors(player, 50.0f);\nif (vendorCount > 0) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with repair logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Player's Current Position
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nfloat radius = player->GetMap()->GetVisibilityDistance();\n\
      int vendorCount = TradeSystem::FindRepairVendors(player, radius);\nif (vendorCount\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Inform player about nearby repair vendors\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal game world traversal mechanisms to locate
    NPCs. Performance may vary depending on the number of NPCs in the area and the
    radius specified. The method does not modify the player's state or interact with
    the game world beyond searching for vendors.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'player' will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the player object is valid and in a loaded map before calling this
    method. Large radius values may impact performance due to increased NPC scanning.
