  signature: void PlayerSocial::SetFriendNote(const int & guid, const std::string
    & note)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the note associated with a friend in the player's social list.
  description: The SetFriendNote method allows a player to assign or update a custom
    note for a specific friend in their social list. This note is displayed alongside
    the friend's name and can be used to store personal information, reminders, or
    other relevant details about the relationship. The method takes a GUID to identify
    the friend and a string note that will be stored and associated with that friend.
    Changes made using this method are typically persisted in the database and synchronized
    across the player's session.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the friend whose note is being set.
      This value must correspond to a valid friend in the player's social list, otherwise
      the operation may fail silently or have no effect.
  - name: note
    description: A string containing the custom note to associate with the specified
      friend. The note can be empty or contain up to 48 characters depending on game
      limitations. This value is stored in the database and will persist across sessions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Friend Note
    code: 'PlayerSocial* social = player->GetSocial();

      uint32 friendGuid = 123456;

      std::string note = "Close ally";

      social->SetFriendNote(friendGuid, note);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating an Existing Friend Note
    code: 'PlayerSocial* social = player->GetSocial();

      uint32 friendGuid = 789012;

      std::string newNote = "Needs help with quest";

      social->SetFriendNote(friendGuid, newNote);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other social list management
    functions such as AddFriend or RemoveFriend. The note string is stored in the
    database and retrieved when the player logs in or when the social list is accessed.
    It's recommended to validate that the GUID corresponds to an existing friend before
    calling this function.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID actually refers to a friend in the player's
    social list, otherwise the operation may not behave as expected. Also, be aware
    of potential character limits for the note string which may vary by game version
    or client implementation.
