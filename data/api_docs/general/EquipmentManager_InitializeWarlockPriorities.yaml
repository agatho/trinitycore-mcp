  brief: Initializes the equipment priorities for warlock class specializations.
  description: The InitializeWarlockPriorities method sets up the default equipment
    priority configurations specific to warlock characters in the TrinityCore framework.
    This method is responsible for defining which items should be prioritized when
    a warlock character equips gear, taking into account the unique gameplay mechanics
    and stat preferences of warlocks such as spell power, mastery, and critical strike.
    It typically runs during character initialization or when loading class-specific
    configurations to ensure proper itemization behavior.

  notes: This method is generally called internally by the core system during character
    creation or load processes. Developers should not typically invoke this directly
    unless implementing custom class-specific logic.
