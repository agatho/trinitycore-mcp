  method: RefreshAI
  signature: void Unit::RefreshAI()
documentation:
  brief: Reinitializes the AI behavior for the unit, resetting its AI state and re-evaluating
    current conditions.
  description: The RefreshAI method is used to forcefully reset and reinitialize the
    artificial intelligence behavior of a Unit in TrinityCore. This function ensures
    that the unit's AI system is refreshed, clearing any existing AI state and allowing
    it to re-evaluate its current situation, targets, and behaviors. It is commonly
    used when an AI-related condition changes or when the AI needs to be reset after
    certain events such as being stunned, feared, or when a new AI script is applied.
    The method does not take any parameters and performs no direct return value operations,
    but it affects the internal AI state machine of the unit.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Reset AI
    code: "Unit* target = ...; // some unit\nif (target)\n{\n    target->RefreshAI();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage After AI State Change
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nCreature* npc = ...;\n\n// When a player interacts\
      \ with an NPC, potentially changing its AI state\nif (player && npc)\n{\n  \
      \  // Reset the AI to re-evaluate the new conditions\n    npc->RefreshAI();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the core engine when certain
    AI-related events occur, but can also be called manually during custom script
    development. It may cause a temporary pause in AI processing while the state is
    being reset.
  warnings: Calling RefreshAI too frequently or without proper consideration may lead
    to performance degradation or unexpected behavior in AI-driven units. Ensure that
    this method is only used when necessary to avoid unnecessary overhead.
