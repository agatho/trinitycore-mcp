  class: MountManager
  method: Initialize
  signature: void MountManager::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the MountManager system, setting up internal data structures
    and loading mount-related configurations.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the MountManager for use by initializing
    its internal state, loading configuration settings, and preparing any necessary
    data structures for managing player mounts. This method is typically called during
    server startup or when the mount system needs to be reinitialized. It ensures
    that all mount-related systems are properly configured before players can interact
    with mounts. The initialization process may include loading mount templates, setting
    up event handlers, and validating existing mount data.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: MountManager::Initialize();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the server's lifecycle. Reinitialization
    may cause unexpected behavior or data corruption. The method is typically invoked
    automatically by the core system during startup, but can also be manually called
    if mount system state needs to be reset.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or inconsistent internal states. Do not call this method from within
    active gameplay loops as it may block or cause performance issues.
