  method: GetWorldRotation
  signature: QuaternionData GameObject::GetWorldRotation() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the world rotation quaternion of the GameObject.
  description: This method returns the rotational orientation of the GameObject in
    world space as a QuaternionData object. The quaternion represents the object's
    rotation in 3D space, which is essential for calculating positions, directions,
    and orientations within the game world. It is commonly used in conjunction with
    other transformation methods to determine the GameObject's absolute orientation
    relative to the world coordinate system. This method is particularly important
    for handling spatial transformations and maintaining accurate positioning during
    gameplay mechanics involving rotations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a QuaternionData object representing the world rotation of the
    GameObject. The quaternion contains four components (w, x, y, z) that define the
    rotation in 3D space, with w being the scalar component and x, y, z being the
    vector components. This value can be used to compute rotations or orientations
    relative to world coordinates.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'QuaternionData rotation = go->GetWorldRotation();

      float w = rotation.w;

      float x = rotation.x;

      float y = rotation.y;

      float z = rotation.z;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and does not require any special considerations
    for usage. It returns a copy of the quaternion data, so modifications to the returned
    value will not affect the original GameObject's rotation.
  warnings: No significant warnings. However, developers should be aware that this
    method returns a copy of the quaternion data, so modifying the returned value
    will not change the actual rotation of the GameObject.
