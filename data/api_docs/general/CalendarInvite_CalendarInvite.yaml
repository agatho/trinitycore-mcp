documentation:
  brief: Moves a calendar invite object to another calendar invite object, transferring
    ownership of its resources.
  description: The CalendarInvite move constructor transfers the internal state and
    resources from one CalendarInvite object to another. This operation is typically
    used when creating new objects from temporary or existing instances, allowing
    efficient resource management without unnecessary copying. In the context of TrinityCore's
    calendar system, this constructor enables the seamless transfer of invite data
    between calendar invite objects during event creation or manipulation. The source
    object becomes invalid after the move operation and should not be used afterward.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to another CalendarInvite object whose resources
      will be moved into this instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing a Calendar Invite
    code: 'CalendarInvite invite1;

      // ... populate invite1 with data ...

      CalendarInvite invite2 = std::move(invite1); // Move constructor invoked

      // invite1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, which means it's designed to efficiently transfer
    ownership of resources rather than copy them. It should only be called with rvalue
    expressions or explicitly with std::move(). After the move, the source object
    must not be used unless re-assigned.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after a move operation results in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that any references to the original object are not used afterward.
    This constructor is typically not called directly but rather through implicit
    move operations or explicit std::move() calls.
