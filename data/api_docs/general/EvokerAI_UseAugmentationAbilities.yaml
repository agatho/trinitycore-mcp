  class: EvokerAI
  method: UseAugmentationAbilities
  signature: void EvokerAI::UseAugmentationAbilities(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes augmentation abilities for the evoker AI, targeting specified units.
  description: The UseAugmentationAbilities method is responsible for managing and
    executing the augmentation-based spells and abilities of an Evoker AI. This method
    typically selects appropriate augmentation spells based on the current combat
    state, target conditions, and resource availability. It handles spell selection
    logic, cooldown management, and targeting for evoker-specific augmentation mechanics
    such as Augment, Convoke the Spirits, and other class-specific abilities. The
    method operates within the context of the TrinityCore AI framework and integrates
    with the broader evoker AI decision-making process.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target index or identifier
      for the augmentation ability. This parameter determines which unit will be targeted
      by the augmentation spell being executed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of UseAugmentationAbilities
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        int targetIndex = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n       \
      \ UseAugmentationAbilities(&targetIndex);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should be
    used in conjunction with other evoker AI methods to maintain proper spell rotation
    and targeting. The target parameter may need to be validated before use, as invalid
    targets can cause unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before passing it to this method.
    Passing a null or invalid target can lead to undefined behavior or crashes in
    the AI system. This method assumes proper initialization of the evoker's spell
    and ability state.
