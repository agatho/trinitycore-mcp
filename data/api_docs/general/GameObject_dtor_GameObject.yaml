documentation:
  brief: Destroys a GameObject instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~GameObject destructor is automatically invoked when a GameObject
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of all resources allocated to the game object, including memory deallocation,
    removal from world objects lists, and notification of related systems such as
    the map manager and grid managers. The destructor handles the finalization of
    the GameObject's lifecycle, ensuring that no dangling references or memory leaks
    occur. It is important to note that this method should not be called directly
    by developers unless explicitly managing object lifetime in custom code.

  - title: Automatic destruction of GameObject
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    GameObject* go = new GameObject();\n   \
      \ // ... use the GameObject ...\n    delete go; // Triggers ~GameObject destructor\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: GameObject lifecycle in WorldManager
    code: "void HandleGameObjectRemoval()\n{\n    // When a GameObject is removed\
      \ from the world,\n    // its destructor is automatically called by the container\n\
      \    // that manages its lifetime\n    GameObject* go = sObjectMgr->GetGameObject(guid);\n\
      \    if (go)\n    {\n        // Object will be destroyed when it goes out of\
      \ scope or is deleted\n        delete go;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor performs critical cleanup operations including removal from
    the world's object lists, notifying grid managers, and releasing any allocated
    memory. It is implemented as a virtual destructor to ensure proper inheritance
    behavior when derived GameObject types are destroyed.
  warnings: Developers should never explicitly call the ~GameObject destructor. Doing
    so may lead to undefined behavior or double-free errors. The destructor is meant
    to be invoked automatically by the C++ runtime during object destruction.
