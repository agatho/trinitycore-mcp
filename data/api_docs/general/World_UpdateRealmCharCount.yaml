  class: World
  method: UpdateRealmCharCount
  signature: void World::UpdateRealmCharCount(uint32 accountId)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the character count for a specific account in the realm.
  description: The UpdateRealmCharCount method updates the total number of characters
    associated with a given account within the realm. This function is typically invoked
    when a character is created, deleted, or transferred between realms to ensure
    that the realm's character statistics remain accurate. The method likely interacts
    with the database to persist the updated count and may trigger internal realm
    management operations. It is an essential part of maintaining data consistency
    in TrinityCore's character management system.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: The unique identifier of the account for which the character count
      should be updated. This value must correspond to a valid account entry in the
      database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Character Count for an Account
    code: World::Instance()->UpdateRealmCharCount(12345);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the character creation and deletion
    processes. It may involve database transactions to ensure consistency. The implementation
    might be optimized for performance since it's frequently invoked during character
    management operations.
