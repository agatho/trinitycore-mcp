  class: ResourceEventBus
  method: ClearUnitEvents
  signature: void ResourceEventBus::ClearUnitEvents(int unitGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Clears all registered events for a specified unit GUID from the resource
    event bus.
  description: The ClearUnitEvents method removes all event subscriptions associated
    with a given unit identifier (GUID) from the ResourceEventBus. This is typically
    used when a unit is destroyed, despawned, or needs its event handlers cleaned
    up to prevent memory leaks or dangling references. The method ensures that no
    further events will be dispatched to any callbacks registered for this specific
    unit GUID. It operates on the assumption that the provided GUID uniquely identifies
    a unit within the game world context.
  parameters:
  - name: unitGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the unit whose events should be cleared
      from the event bus. This value must correspond to a valid unit in the current
      game world state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clear Events for a Player Unit
    code: ResourceEventBus::instance()->ClearUnitEvents(playerGuid);
    language: cpp
  - title: Clear Events During Unit Destruction
    code: "void OnUnitDeath(Unit* unit)\n{\n    ResourceEventBus::instance()->ClearUnitEvents(unit->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core systems when units
    are removed from the game world. Developers should ensure that no event handlers
    are still referencing the cleared unit GUID after calling this method to avoid
    potential crashes or undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling ClearUnitEvents with an invalid or non-existent unit GUID may
    result in undefined behavior if the underlying data structures aren't properly
    validated. Always verify that the GUID corresponds to a valid unit before invoking
    this method.
