documentation:
  brief: Destroys a HunterAI instance and performs necessary cleanup operations.
  description: The HunterAI destructor is responsible for cleaning up resources associated
    with a hunter's AI behavior. It ensures that any dynamically allocated memory,
    active targets, or AI-related state information is properly released when the
    AI object is destroyed. This method is automatically invoked when a hunter AI
    instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. The destructor typically
    handles cleanup tasks such as releasing references to creatures, clearing AI state
    variables, and ensuring no dangling pointers remain in the system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Automatic destruction of HunterAI instance
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    HunterAI* ai = new HunterAI();\n    // ...\
      \ AI usage ...\n    delete ai; // Destructor is automatically called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The HunterAI destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing
    memory. It's important to ensure that all references to the AI object are properly
    cleared before deletion to prevent access violations. The destructor may also
    trigger cleanup of associated AI state in the game world.
