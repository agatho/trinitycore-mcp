  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: HandleObstacles
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::HandleObstacles(Player * bot, int & path)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and navigates around obstacles in the path for a bot following
    a leader.
  description: The HandleObstacles method is responsible for detecting and managing
    navigation obstacles that may impede a bot's ability to follow its leader. This
    method evaluates the current path and identifies any environmental or positional
    barriers that would prevent smooth movement. It modifies the path index to bypass
    these obstacles, ensuring that the bot can continue following the leader without
    getting stuck. The method is typically invoked during the bot's movement logic
    as part of the leader-following AI behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is following
      the leader. This parameter is used to access the bot's current position, movement
      state, and path data.
  - name: path
    description: Reference to an integer variable that represents the current index
      in the path array. The method modifies this value to adjust the bot's navigation
      when obstacles are encountered.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within a leader-following AI loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (m_leader)\n    {\n        int pathIndex\
      \ = m_currentPathIndex;\n        m_leaderFollowBehavior.HandleObstacles(m_bot,\
      \ pathIndex);\n        m_currentPathIndex = pathIndex;\n        // Continue\
      \ with movement logic using updated path index\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot's path data is already computed and valid.
    It does not perform pathfinding itself but rather adjusts the current path index
    to avoid obstacles. Performance is optimized by checking only nearby obstacles
    and avoiding unnecessary computations.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot's position and path data are valid before calling
    this method, as invalid data may lead to incorrect path adjustments or movement
    errors. The path index modification should be synchronized with other movement
    logic to prevent conflicts.
