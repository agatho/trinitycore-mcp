  signature: void Creature::UpdateLevelDependantStats()
documentation:
  brief: Updates a creature's stats based on its current level and other level-dependent
    factors.
  description: The UpdateLevelDependantStats method recalculates and applies various
    stat values for a Creature instance based on its current level. This includes
    updating health, mana, damage ranges, armor, and other combat-related attributes
    that scale with the creature's level. The method ensures that the creature's statistics
    are properly adjusted to match its level, which is essential for maintaining game
    balance and proper combat mechanics. It typically gets called during creature
    creation, level-up events, or when a creature's level changes dynamically.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in creature initialization
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetLevel(10);

      creature->UpdateLevelDependantStats();

      // Stats are now updated for level 10'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating stats after level change
    code: "if (player->GetLevel() > creature->GetLevel()) {\n    creature->SetLevel(player->GetLevel());\n\
      \    creature->UpdateLevelDependantStats();\n    creature->SaveToDB();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the core when a creature's
    level changes, but can also be manually called when needed. It relies on creature
    template data and level scaling factors defined in the database or core configuration
    files.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper level validation may result in incorrect
    stat calculations. Ensure that the creature's level is set before calling this
    method to avoid unexpected behavior.
