documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the creature that is charmed by this unit.
  description: The GetCharmedGUID method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of
    the creature that is currently charmed by this unit. This method is typically
    used in the context of controlled creatures or pets that are under player control,
    such as summoned creatures or pets. It provides access to the GUID of the charmed
    entity which can be useful for tracking and managing the relationship between
    the unit and its charmer. The method returns an integer value representing the
    GUID of the charmed creature, which is essential for identifying and manipulating
    the controlled creature in game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the GUID of the charmed creature. This
    value can be used to identify or manipulate the controlled creature in various
    game scenarios, including tracking the creature's state, managing its behavior,
    or accessing its properties.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* unit = player->GetPet();\nint charmedGUID = unit->GetCharmedGUID();\n\
      if (charmedGUID != 0)\n{\n    // Do something with the charmed GUID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other methods that manage
    the relationship between units and their charmers. It's important to note that
    this method only returns valid GUID values when the unit is actually charmed by
    another entity, otherwise it will return 0.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a unit is charmed, as it
    will return 0 even when the unit is not charmed. Care must be taken to ensure
    that the unit being queried is indeed charmed before calling this method.
