  class: Minion
  method: SetFollowAngle
  signature: void Minion::SetFollowAngle(float angle)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the follow angle for a minion to control its positioning relative to
    its target.
  description: The SetFollowAngle method configures the angular offset at which a
    minion will position itself while following its target. This is commonly used
    in AI behavior to create more natural or strategic positioning during movement.
    The angle is typically expressed in radians and affects how the minion maintains
    its relative orientation to the unit it is following. This method does not directly
    control movement speed or pathfinding, but rather influences the rotational aspect
    of the follow behavior. The change takes effect immediately if the minion is already
    following a target.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set minion to follow at 45 degree angle
    code: "Minion* pet = player->GetPet();\nif (pet)\n{\n    pet->SetFollowAngle(M_PI\
      \ / 4); // 45 degrees in radians\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset minion follow angle to default
    code: "Minion* guardian = player->GetGuardian();\nif (guardian)\n{\n    guardian->SetFollowAngle(0.0f);\
      \ // Follow directly behind\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: "This method is primarily used in pet and guardian AI systems within TrinityCore.\
    \ The angle parameter represents the offset from the forward direction of the\
    \ minion's facing, where 0 radians means directly behind the target. Values are\
    \ typically between -\u03C0 and \u03C0 radians."
  warnings: Setting extreme angles may cause unexpected positioning behavior or clipping
    issues with terrain or other objects. Ensure that the specified angle allows for
    valid movement paths to avoid stuck states.
