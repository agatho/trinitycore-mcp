  signature: void WorldSession::SendCalendarRaidLockoutRemoved(const InstanceLock
    * lock)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a calendar raid lockout removal message to the player's client.
  description: This method is responsible for notifying the connected player's client
    that a specific raid instance lockout has been removed. It is typically invoked
    when a player's raid lockout expires or is manually cleared, allowing them to
    participate in the same raid content again. The method serializes the lockout
    data and transmits it through the network to update the client's calendar UI and
    raid availability status. This functionality is integral to World of Warcraft's
    raid locking system, which prevents players from entering certain raid instances
    multiple times within a specified time frame.
  parameters:
  - name: lock
    description: A pointer to an InstanceLock object containing the lockout information
      to be sent to the client. This parameter must not be null and should represent
      a valid raid instance lockout that has been removed or expired.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in raid lockout clearing
    code: "void ClearExpiredLockout(Player* player, const InstanceLock* lock)\n{\n\
      \    if (lock && player->GetSession())\n    {\n        player->GetSession()->SendCalendarRaidLockoutRemoved(lock);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the client's calendar system and should
    only be called when a lockout is actually removed. The InstanceLock object passed
    must contain valid data or the client may display incorrect information. This
    method does not perform any validation on the lockout itself, so callers should
    ensure the lockout is in a proper state before invoking this function.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method will likely cause a crash or undefined
    behavior. Always verify that the InstanceLock parameter is valid and properly
    initialized before calling this function. Additionally, calling this method without
    proper synchronization may lead to race conditions if lockouts are being modified
    concurrently.
