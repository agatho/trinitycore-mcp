  signature: void AuctionManager::AuctionManager(Player * bot, BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and manages auction activities for a bot player within the TrinityCore
    AI system.
  description: The AuctionManager method serves as the primary entry point for handling
    auction-related operations for a bot player in the TrinityCore framework. It takes
    a Player object representing the bot and a BotAI object that provides the artificial
    intelligence context for decision-making. This method orchestrates various auction
    behaviors such as bidding, listing items, and managing the bot's auction house
    interactions based on its AI configuration. The method operates within the game's
    auction house system and integrates with the broader AI subsystem to make intelligent
    decisions about when and how to participate in auctions.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will perform
      auction activities. This player must be properly initialized and connected to
      the game world.
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI object that contains the artificial intelligence
      logic and configuration for the bot's auction behavior. This includes bidding
      strategies, item preferences, and auction participation rules.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Auction Manager Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Bot player object

      BotAI* botAI = ...;   // AI configuration object

      AuctionManager auctionMgr;

      auctionMgr.AuctionManager(myBot, botAI);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot AI System
    code: "void BotAuctionBehavior(Player* bot, BotAI* ai) {\n    AuctionManager manager;\n\
      \    manager.AuctionManager(bot, ai);\n    // Additional bot logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the bot's update cycle or when auction-related
    events occur. It assumes that both the Player and BotAI objects are valid and
    properly initialized. The method may perform multiple sub-operations including
    checking inventory, evaluating market conditions, and executing auction actions
    based on AI decisions.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player object passed is a valid bot instance and not a
    regular player character. Improper initialization of the BotAI object can lead
    to undefined behavior or incorrect auction decisions. This method should only
    be called when the bot is connected to the game world and has proper auction house
    access.
