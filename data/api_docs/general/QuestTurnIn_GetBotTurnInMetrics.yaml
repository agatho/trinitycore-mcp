  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: GetBotTurnInMetrics
  signature: TurnInMetrics::Snapshot QuestTurnIn::GetBotTurnInMetrics(uint32 botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves snapshot metrics for bot quest turn-ins associated with a specific
    bot GUID.
  description: The GetBotTurnInMetrics method retrieves a snapshot of quest turn-in
    statistics for a specified bot character identified by its unique global identifier
    (GUID). This function is typically used in automated questing systems or botting
    frameworks within the TrinityCore environment to monitor and analyze the performance
    and behavior of scripted characters during quest completion. The returned TurnInMetrics::Snapshot
    contains detailed data about how many quests were turned in, success rates, time
    taken, and other relevant metrics for the specified bot. It is important to note
    that this method assumes the bot character exists and has performed at least one
    quest turn-in; otherwise, it may return default or empty snapshot values.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique global identifier (GUID) of the bot character for which
      to retrieve quest turn-in metrics. This value must correspond to a valid bot
      entry in the database.
  returns: A TurnInMetrics::Snapshot object containing aggregated statistics and performance
    data related to quest turn-ins performed by the specified bot, including counts,
    timing, success rates, and other relevant metrics.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Quest Turn-In Metrics for a Bot
    code: 'uint32 botGuid = 12345;

      TurnInMetrics::Snapshot snapshot = questTurnIn->GetBotTurnInMetrics(botGuid);

      // Use snapshot data to analyze bot performance

      printf("Total quests turned in: %u\n", snapshot.totalTurnIns);

      printf("Success rate: %.2f%%\n", snapshot.successRate * 100);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal tracking systems maintained by the QuestTurnIn
    class to gather real-time or cached statistics. Ensure that the bot GUID provided
    corresponds to an active bot in the game world, otherwise results may be unreliable
    or empty. The snapshot returned is a point-in-time view and might not reflect
    live updates unless explicitly refreshed.
  warnings: Using this method with invalid or non-existent bot GUIDs could result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect data being returned. Avoid calling this method
    excessively in performance-critical sections of code due to potential database
    or memory overhead involved in generating the snapshot.
