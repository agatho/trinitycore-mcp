  method: GetMageDefensiveCooldowns
  signature: int PvPCombatAI::GetMageDefensiveCooldowns(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the cooldown time for a player's defensive mage abilities.
  description: The GetMageDefensiveCooldowns method calculates and returns the remaining
    cooldown duration for a player's defensive mage abilities. This method is typically
    used within the PvPCombatAI system to manage spell usage timing and ensure proper
    cooldown handling during player versus player combat scenarios. The returned value
    represents the time in milliseconds until the next defensive ability can be used,
    which helps maintain game balance and strategic gameplay by preventing excessive
    use of defensive spells.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the cooldown time in milliseconds for the
    player's defensive mage abilities. A return value of 0 indicates that the abilities
    are currently available for use, while a positive value indicates the remaining
    time until they become available again.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int cooldown = pvpCombatAI->GetMageDefensiveCooldowns(nullptr);\nif (cooldown\
      \ == 0) {\n    // Defensive abilities are available\n    // Cast defensive spell\
      \ here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PvPCombatAI system and should only be called during
    active PvP combat scenarios. The implementation likely considers factors such
    as player class, talent specialization, and current game state to determine appropriate
    cooldown values.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called outside of proper PvP combat contexts,
    as it may return unexpected values or cause undefined behavior. The method signature
    includes a parameter that appears unused (int * player), which might be reserved
    for future implementation or debugging purposes.
