  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: ShouldSpread
  signature: bool AdaptiveBehaviorManager::ShouldSpread() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the adaptive behavior manager should spread its current
    behavior to nearby units.
  description: The ShouldSpread method evaluates the internal state and conditions
    of the AdaptiveBehaviorManager to decide if the current behavior pattern should
    be propagated or shared with surrounding entities in the game world. This decision
    is typically based on factors such as proximity to other units, behavior cooldowns,
    or specific AI thresholds defined for the manager. The method serves as a core
    decision point in adaptive AI systems where behaviors are dynamically adjusted
    and disseminated across multiple agents. It is commonly used within TrinityCore's
    AI framework to enable intelligent spreading of actions like movement patterns,
    targeting strategies, or combat behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the behavior should be spread to nearby units based on
    internal logic and conditions; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (adaptiveManager.ShouldSpread()) {\n    // Spread current behavior to\
      \ nearby units\n    adaptiveManager.SpreadBehavior();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI update loop
    code: "void AIUpdate(Unit* unit) {\n    if (adaptiveManager.ShouldSpread()) {\n\
      \        // Broadcast behavior to nearby friendly units\n        for (auto&\
      \ target : GetNearbyUnits(10.0f)) {\n            if (target->IsFriendlyTo(unit))\
      \ {\n                adaptiveManager.ApplyBehavior(target);\n            }\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles and should be lightweight
    to avoid performance degradation. The decision logic may involve randomization
    or probabilistic thresholds that make behavior spreading non-deterministic in
    some cases.
  warnings: Ensure that the AdaptiveBehaviorManager is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as uninitialized state could lead to undefined behavior.
    Also, excessive use of behavior spreading can cause performance issues if not
    controlled by appropriate cooldowns or distance checks.
