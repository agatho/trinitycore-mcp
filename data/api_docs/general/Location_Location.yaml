  class: Location
  method: Location
  signature: void Location::Location(const Vector3 & v, float o)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Location object with the specified position vector and orientation.
  description: The Location constructor initializes a Location object using a Vector3
    for positional coordinates and a float for orientation. This method sets up the
    internal state of the Location object to represent a specific point in the game
    world with both spatial position and directional orientation. The constructor
    is typically used when creating new location instances for pathfinding, teleportation,
    or object placement within TrinityCore's game world mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: v
    description: Vector3 representing the x, y, z coordinates in the game world
  - name: o
    description: Float value representing the orientation (heading) in radians
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Location Initialization
    code: 'Location playerLoc(Vector3(100.0f, 200.0f, 50.0f), 1.57f);

      // Creates a location at coordinates (100, 200, 50) with 90-degree orientation'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Location for NPC Spawn
    code: 'Position npcSpawnPos(1234.5f, 6789.2f, 100.0f);

      Location spawnLoc(npcSpawnPos, M_PI / 2);

      // Initializes a location for spawning an NPC at specific coordinates with eastward
      orientation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the Location class which is commonly used in
    TrinityCore's pathfinding and movement systems. The orientation parameter should
    typically be in radians, where 0 represents facing east, M_PI/2 faces north, M_PI
    faces west, and 3*M_PI/2 faces south.
