documentation:
  brief: Updates the hunter's buffs and aura states based on current combat conditions
    and talent selections.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and applying various
    buff effects to a Marksmanship Hunter character within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method evaluates the hunter's current state, including active auras, cooldowns,
    and talent-based abilities, to determine which buffs should be applied or removed
    from the player. It ensures that the hunter maintains optimal performance during
    combat by dynamically adjusting their buff status according to game mechanics
    such as Hunter's Mark, Rapid Fire, and other class-specific enhancements. The
    method typically runs during each update cycle of the AI system and integrates
    with the core TrinityCore event handling to maintain real-time buff synchronization.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MarksmanshipHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI\
      \ logic\n    if (m_updateBuffsTimer <= diff)\n    {\n        m_updateBuffsTimer\
      \ = 1000; // Update every second\n        me->ToCreature()->GetAI()->UpdateBuffs();\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        m_updateBuffsTimer -= diff;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the AI system during combat updates and
    should not be called manually unless implementing custom behavior. The implementation
    relies heavily on the TrinityCore aura system and may interact with various subsystems
    including cooldown management, spell casting, and combat state tracking.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of its intended update cycle may cause unexpected
    behavior or performance issues. Ensure that all buffs are properly initialized
    before calling this method to avoid null reference exceptions.
