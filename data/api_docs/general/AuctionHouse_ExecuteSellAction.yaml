documentation:
  brief: Processes the sale of an item through the auction house system
  description: The ExecuteSellAction method handles the core logic for listing an
    item for sale on the auction house. It validates the player's ability to sell
    the item, checks item ownership and restrictions, processes the auction creation
    with specified price and stack count, and updates the auction house database accordingly.
    This method is typically invoked when a player attempts to sell an item via the
    auction house interface or through game commands.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object attempting to sell the item. Must be
      a valid player instance with proper authentication and auction house access.
  - name: itemGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the item being sold. This must correspond
      to an existing item in the player's inventory that is eligible for auction.
  - name: stackCount
    description: Number of items from the stack to sell. Must be a positive integer
      not exceeding the total quantity of the item in the player's possession.
  - name: price
    description: Bid price for the auction in copper coins. Must be a valid positive
      amount that meets the minimum auction house pricing requirements.
  returns: Returns true if the auction was successfully created and processed, false
    otherwise. Failure conditions include invalid player, item not found, insufficient
    stack count, or pricing violations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Auction Creation
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Valid player instance\nuint32 itemGuid = 12345;\n\
      uint32 stackCount = 1;\nuint32 price = 100000; // 10 gold\nbool result = auctionHouse->ExecuteSellAction(&player,\
      \ itemGuid, stackCount, price);\nif (result) {\n    // Auction created successfully\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle failure case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs internal validation and database updates. It assumes
    the calling code has already verified player permissions and item eligibility.
    The method may trigger additional events such as auction notifications or mail
    system updates upon successful execution.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly with invalid parameters; it may cause
    database inconsistencies or crash the server. Always validate inputs before calling,
    especially itemGuid and stackCount values.
