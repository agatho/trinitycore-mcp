  brief: Deletes a game object from the world
  description: The GameObject::Delete method removes a game object from the world,
    ensuring it is no longer accessible to players and other game entities. This method
    typically triggers the removal of the object from the map's object list and sets
    its visibility state to inactive. The operation is usually performed when the
    object needs to be destroyed or when it is no longer needed in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic GameObject deletion
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->Delete();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other game object operations
    such as despawning or destruction. The actual deletion process may involve multiple
    steps including removing from the map, clearing references, and notifying clients
    about the removal.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to memory leaks or invalid memory
    access if the object is still referenced elsewhere in code. Always ensure that
    all references to the object are cleared before calling Delete.
