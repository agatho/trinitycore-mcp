  method: IsDefensiveAvailable
  signature: bool DefensiveBehaviorManager::IsDefensiveAvailable(uint32 spellId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a defensive behavior is available for the specified spell ID.
  description: The IsDefensiveAvailable method determines whether a specific defensive
    behavior, typically associated with a spell, is currently available for use by
    the unit. This method is commonly used in AI logic to evaluate when defensive
    actions such as defensive stance, shield block, or healing spells can be executed.
    The check considers factors like cooldowns, resource availability, and game state
    conditions that might prevent the defensive behavior from being usable. It returns
    true if the defensive behavior is available and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the defensive behavior associated with the specified spell
    ID is currently available for use; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (defensiveBehaviorManager.IsDefensiveAvailable(SPELL_ID_SHIELD_BLOCK))\n\
      {\n    // Execute defensive stance or shield block\n    unit->CastSpell(unit,\
      \ SPELL_ID_SHIELD_BLOCK, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Defensive Behavior Execution
    code: "if (defensiveBehaviorManager.IsDefensiveAvailable(SPELL_ID_DIVINE_SHIELD))\n\
      {\n    if (unit->GetHealthPct() < 30)\n    {\n        unit->CastSpell(unit,\
      \ SPELL_ID_DIVINE_SHIELD, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within the context of AI decision-making loops
    where defensive actions are evaluated. It may internally check spell cooldowns,
    mana/resource requirements, and unit state conditions to determine availability.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell ID passed to this method corresponds to a valid
    defensive behavior spell; otherwise, the result may be unpredictable or misleading.
