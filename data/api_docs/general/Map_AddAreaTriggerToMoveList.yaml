  class: Map
  method: AddAreaTriggerToMoveList
  signature: void Map::AddAreaTriggerToMoveList(AreaTrigger * at, float x, float y,
    float z, float ang)
documentation:
  brief: Adds an area trigger to the map's movement list for processing.
  description: The AddAreaTriggerToMoveList method registers an AreaTrigger object
    with the Map instance, preparing it for movement processing within the game world.
    This function is typically invoked when an area trigger needs to be moved or updated
    in its position relative to the map's coordinate system. The method accepts the
    area trigger pointer along with new x, y, z coordinates and angular orientation
    to update its position. It integrates the trigger into the map's internal movement
    tracking system, ensuring that the trigger's state is synchronized with the game
    world's physics and collision systems.
  parameters:
  - name: at
    description: Pointer to the AreaTrigger object that will be added to the movement
      list. Must not be null.
  - name: x
    description: The new X coordinate for the area trigger's position in the game
      world.
  - name: y
    description: The new Y coordinate for the area trigger's position in the game
      world.
  - name: z
    description: The new Z coordinate for the area trigger's position in the game
      world.
  - name: ang
    description: The angular orientation (in radians) of the area trigger, used for
      rotation calculations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = new AreaTrigger();

      Map* map = player->GetMap();

      map->AddAreaTriggerToMoveList(trigger, 100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f, 1.57f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Map's internal movement management system and
    should only be called when an area trigger's position needs to be updated in the
    game world. The method does not perform any validation on the input parameters,
    so it's the caller's responsibility to ensure that all values are valid before
    calling.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'at' will likely result in undefined behavior
    or a crash. Ensure that the AreaTrigger object is properly initialized and managed
    before adding it to the movement list.
