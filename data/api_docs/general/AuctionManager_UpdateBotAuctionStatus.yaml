  class: AuctionManager
  method: UpdateBotAuctionStatus
  signature: void AuctionManager::UpdateBotAuctionStatus(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the auction status for a specified bot player, managing their active
    auctions and inventory.
  description: The UpdateBotAuctionStatus method is responsible for maintaining the
    auction activity of a bot player within the auction house system. It processes
    the bot's current auction listings, updates their inventory based on auction outcomes,
    and ensures that the bot's auction behavior aligns with configured parameters.
    This method typically runs periodically or in response to auction events to keep
    the bot's auction presence synchronized with game mechanics. The method operates
    on a single Player object representing the bot, ensuring that all auction-related
    data for that specific bot is properly maintained.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose auction status
      needs to be updated. Must not be null and must represent a valid bot player
      with active auction behavior configured.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Update auction status for a bot player
    code: "Player* myBot = sObjectAccessor->FindPlayer(ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345));\n\
      if (myBot)\n{\n    sAuctionMgr->UpdateBotAuctionStatus(myBot);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the auction house system or bot management
    logic. It may perform database operations to update auction listings and player
    inventory. The method assumes that the provided Player object has been properly
    initialized as a bot with valid auction configuration.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer or a non-bot Player object to this method can lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the Player object represents an
    actual bot with configured auction behavior before calling this method.
