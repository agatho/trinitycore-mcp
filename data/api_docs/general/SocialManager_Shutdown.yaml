documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the social manager, cleaning up all social related data and connections.
  description: The Shutdown method is responsible for gracefully terminating all active
    social functionalities within the SocialManager class. This includes disconnecting
    from social networks, clearing cached friend lists, removing pending requests,
    and freeing any allocated memory or resources used for social interactions. The
    method ensures that no dangling references or active connections remain after
    execution. It should typically be called during server shutdown or when a player
    logs out to prevent data corruption or memory leaks. This method is part of the
    core game mechanics that manage player relationships, guild communications, and
    other social features in TrinityCore.

  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = sSocialMgr;

      socialMgr->Shutdown();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be thread-safe as it may be called from different
    threads during server shutdown. It's recommended to call this method before destroying
    the SocialManager instance to ensure proper cleanup.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown on a SocialManager that is already shut down or in an
    inconsistent state might lead to undefined behavior. Ensure all social operations
    are completed before invoking this method.
