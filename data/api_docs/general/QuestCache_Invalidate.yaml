documentation:
  brief: Clears all cached quest data from the QuestCache instance, forcing subsequent
    quest requests to fetch fresh data from the database.
  description: The Invalidate method clears all cached quest data within the QuestCache
    instance. This ensures that any subsequent quest-related operations will retrieve
    up-to-date information directly from the database rather than relying on potentially
    stale cached values. The method is typically invoked when quest data has been
    modified or when a complete cache refresh is required to maintain data consistency.
    This operation does not affect other caching mechanisms or database connections,
    and it is generally safe to call during runtime without disrupting ongoing gameplay
    operations.

  - title: Basic Cache Invalidation
    code: 'QuestCache* cache = sObjectMgr->GetQuestCache();

      cache->Invalidate();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a complete cache clear and should be used judiciously
    as it may impact performance if called frequently. The invalidated cache will
    be automatically repopulated on subsequent quest requests.
