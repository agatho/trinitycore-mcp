  signature: int Group::GetLootThreshold() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the loot threshold setting for the group.
  description: The GetLootThreshold method retrieves the current loot threshold value
    assigned to the group. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, the loot threshold
    determines the minimum item quality required for players to be able to loot items
    from a creature or object. This value is typically set by the group leader and
    affects all members of the group. The returned value corresponds to the standard
    item quality levels used in the game, such as 0 (Poor), 1 (Common), 2 (Uncommon),
    3 (Rare), 4 (Epic), and 5 (Legendary). This method is commonly used to determine
    whether a player can loot an item based on their group's configured threshold.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the minimum item quality level required for looting.
    Valid values are typically 0 through 5, where 0 represents 'Poor' quality and
    5 represents 'Legendary' quality. A value of -1 may indicate an error or default
    state if no threshold is set.
  examples:
  - title: Check Group Loot Threshold
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    int threshold =\
      \ group->GetLootThreshold();\n    std::cout << \"Current loot threshold: \"\
      \ << threshold << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Group class and relies on the internal state of
    the group's loot settings. The returned value should be interpreted in the context
    of the game's item quality system, where higher numbers represent rarer items.
    This method does not perform any validation or modification of the group's settings.
  warnings: The return value may be -1 if the group has no valid loot threshold set,
    which could indicate an error state. Always check for valid return values before
    using them in conditional logic. The method assumes that the group object is valid
    and properly initialized.
