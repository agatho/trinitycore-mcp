documentation:
  brief: Preloads vendor data for nearby merchants within a player's interaction range.
  description: The PreloadNearbyVendors method initializes and caches vendor information
    for all merchants located within the specified interaction distance of the given
    player. This preloading mechanism improves performance by reducing database queries
    when players interact with vendors, as it ensures that vendor item data is already
    loaded into memory. The method typically executes during player login or when
    entering a new zone, and it may also be triggered manually to refresh vendor data
    if needed. It operates on the principle of lazy loading combined with proactive
    caching to optimize game performance while maintaining up-to-date vendor inventories.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Login
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterWorld(Player* player)\n{\n    TradeSystem::PreloadNearbyVendors(player);\n\
      \    // Vendor data is now preloaded for nearby merchants\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Preloading for Specific Player
    code: "void ReloadPlayerVendors(Player* player)\n{\n    // Clear existing vendor\
      \ cache if needed\n    // ...\n    TradeSystem::PreloadNearbyVendors(player);\n\
      \    // Refresh vendor data for current zone\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during player initialization and zone transitions.
    It may perform database queries to fetch vendor information, so frequent calls
    could impact performance. The preloaded data is usually stored in a temporary
    cache that persists until the player leaves the area or the server performs cleanup
    operations.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper caching logic can lead
    to unnecessary database load. Ensure that vendor data is only preloaded when necessary,
    such as during zone entry or after significant player movement.
