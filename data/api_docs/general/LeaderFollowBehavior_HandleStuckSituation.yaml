documentation:
  brief: Handles stuck situations for a bot AI by evaluating movement and positioning
    to prevent getting trapped.
  description: The HandleStuckSituation method in LeaderFollowBehavior is responsible
    for detecting and resolving scenarios where a bot AI becomes stuck or unable to
    progress in its current position. This typically occurs when the bot's movement
    path is blocked, it has reached a dead end, or it cannot navigate around obstacles.
    The method evaluates the bot's current state, checks for potential blockages,
    and attempts to resolve the situation by either repositioning the bot, changing
    its movement behavior, or triggering fallback actions such as sitting or waiting.
    This functionality is crucial for maintaining smooth gameplay and preventing bots
    from becoming permanently stuck in the game world.

  - title: Basic usage within AI update loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    leaderFollowBehavior.HandleStuckSituation(this);\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the bot's AI update cycle and may
    involve checking for collision detection, pathfinding status, or movement state.
    It's designed to be lightweight to avoid performance issues during frequent AI
    updates.
  warnings: Improper handling of stuck situations can lead to bots becoming permanently
    blocked in the game world, which may cause unexpected behavior or client-side
    issues. The method should not be called excessively without proper cooldowns or
    state checks.
