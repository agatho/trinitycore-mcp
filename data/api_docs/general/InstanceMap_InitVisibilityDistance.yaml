  signature: void InstanceMap::InitVisibilityDistance()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the visibility distance settings for the instance map.
  description: The InitVisibilityDistance method sets up the default visibility distances
    used by the instance map for determining which objects and players are visible
    to each other. This method is typically called during map initialization to configure
    the visibility system based on the map's specific requirements, such as dungeon
    sizes, raid configurations, or world environment settings. It ensures that the
    client receives appropriate updates about nearby entities and maintains performance
    by limiting the number of objects processed in visibility calculations.

  - title: Basic Usage During Map Initialization
    code: "void MyInstanceMap::Initialize()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n\
      \    InitVisibilityDistance();\n    // Continue with other setup\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically during the map loading process
    and should not typically be called manually unless implementing custom visibility
    logic. The visibility distance values are often derived from the map's configuration
    or instance settings.
