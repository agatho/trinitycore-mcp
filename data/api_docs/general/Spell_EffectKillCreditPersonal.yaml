documentation:
  brief: Triggers personal kill credit for the spell's target.
  description: This method is used to award kill credit to a player when a spell successfully
    kills an NPC or player. It typically occurs during quest completion or when a
    player's kill count is incremented in relation to a specific spell effect. The
    method ensures that the correct player receives credit for the kill, rather than
    just any player who participated in the combat. This is particularly useful for
    spells that require specific targeting or when the spell needs to be linked to
    a particular player's actions.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void Spell::EffectKillCreditPersonal() {\n    // Implementation would handle\
      \ credit assignment\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the spell's target is a player or
    NPC that can be credited with kills. It may require specific conditions to be
    met for proper execution, such as valid target selection or correct spell mechanics.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may result in incorrect kill credit assignment,
    potentially leading to quest completion issues or incorrect player rewards.
