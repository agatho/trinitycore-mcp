documentation:
  brief: Initializes the role definitions specific to hunter class in the TrinityCore
    framework.
  description: The InitializeHunterRoles method sets up and configures all role-related
    definitions and behaviors specific to the hunter class within the TrinityCore
    game server. This includes defining hunter-specific abilities, talents, pet behaviors,
    and combat roles that are essential for proper gameplay mechanics. The method
    is typically invoked during server initialization or when loading class-specific
    configurations to ensure that hunters have their correct role assignments and
    capabilities available. It establishes the foundational role structure necessary
    for hunter players to function correctly within the game's dynamic role-based
    systems.

  notes: This method should only be called once during server startup or class configuration
    loading. It modifies internal role definition structures and must not be invoked
    concurrently with other role initialization methods to prevent race conditions.
  warnings: Invoking this method multiple times may lead to undefined behavior or
    memory corruption. Ensure that no hunter-related gameplay elements are active
    before calling this method.
