  method: SatisfyQuestConditions
  signature: bool Player::SatisfyQuestConditions(const Quest * qInfo, bool msg) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player satisfies the quest conditions for a given quest.
  description: The SatisfyQuestConditions method checks if a player meets all the
    prerequisites required to accept and complete a specific quest. This includes
    verifying that the player has the necessary level, quest completion status, quest
    objectives, and other requirements. The method returns true if all conditions
    are met, false otherwise. It is commonly used in quest handling logic to validate
    whether a player can proceed with a quest or not. This method plays a crucial
    role in maintaining game balance and ensuring proper quest progression.
  parameters:
  - name: qInfo
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that contains the quest information to
      be checked against the player's current state. This parameter is essential for
      determining if the player meets all required conditions.
  - name: msg
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to display messages to the player
      when quest conditions are not met. If true, relevant messages will be shown;
      if false, no messages are displayed.
  returns: Returns true if all quest conditions are satisfied by the player, false
    otherwise. This indicates whether the player can proceed with the quest or not.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: bool result = player->SatisfyQuestConditions(quest, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "if (player->SatisfyQuestConditions(quest, false)) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ quest\n} else {\n    // Do not proceed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related functions
    to determine whether a player can accept or complete a quest. It may involve checking
    player's level, quest completion status, and other game mechanics. The method
    does not modify any state of the player; it only evaluates current conditions.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it may affect quest progression
    and player experience. Incorrect usage could lead to players being unable to proceed
    with quests or receiving incorrect messages.
