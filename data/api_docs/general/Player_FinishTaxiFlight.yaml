  brief: Completes a player's taxi flight journey and updates their position
  description: The FinishTaxiFlight method is responsible for finalizing a player's
    taxi flight by removing them from the taxi system and updating their position
    to the destination. This method typically occurs when a player reaches their designated
    taxi destination, and it ensures that the player's movement state is properly
    reset. The method handles the cleanup of taxi-related data and updates the player's
    location in the game world, effectively ending the taxi flight process.

  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when a player
    reaches their taxi destination. It's important to note that this method does not
    directly teleport the player but rather updates their position to reflect the
    end of the taxi journey.
