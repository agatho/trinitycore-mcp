  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: UpdateStabilityMetrics
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::UpdateStabilityMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal threat stability metrics for all active units in the coordinator.
  description: The UpdateStabilityMetrics method recalculates and refreshes the threat
    stability data used by the ThreatCoordinator to manage and balance threat distribution
    among units. This method is typically invoked during combat updates or when significant
    changes occur in unit positioning or threat levels. It ensures that the threat
    system maintains accurate and up-to-date information for proper mob behavior,
    aggro management, and player interaction within the game world.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update Loop
    code: "void CombatUpdate()\n{\n    // ... other combat logic ...\n    threatCoordinator.UpdateStabilityMetrics();\n\
      \    // ... continue with other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is performance-sensitive and should be called judiciously during
    active combat scenarios. It may trigger internal recalculations of threat deltas,
    unit positioning factors, and stability thresholds that affect mob AI behavior.
