  class: NullGameObjectAI
  method: UpdateAI
  signature: void NullGameObjectAI::UpdateAI(uint32 param0)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the AI state of a null game object, performing no operations.
  description: The UpdateAI method in NullGameObjectAI is a placeholder implementation
    that does not perform any meaningful actions. It serves as a default AI behavior
    for game objects that do not require active AI logic. This method is typically
    invoked by the game engine's update loop to maintain consistent AI interface compliance
    without executing any specific game object behaviors. The method accepts a time
    parameter but ignores it, making it suitable for objects that are static or do
    not require periodic updates.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A uint32 value representing the elapsed time in milliseconds since
      the last update call. This parameter is unused in the current implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Object Update Loop
    code: "void GameObject::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_AI)\n        m_AI->UpdateAI(diff);\n\
      }\n\n// For a NullGameObjectAI instance, this call performs no operation."
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI system architecture in TrinityCore and ensures
    that all game objects have a valid UpdateAI implementation. It's commonly used
    for objects that are not intended to have any active behavior, such as decorative
    or static elements.
