    time) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the previous transport rotation entry based on the provided time
    value.
  description: The GetPrevAnimRotation method is used to retrieve a TransportRotationEntry
    that corresponds to the previous animation rotation state for a transport object,
    given a specific time value. This method is typically employed in the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation where transports (such
    as boats or zeppelins) have defined animation sequences. The method likely performs
    a lookup or interpolation within a sequence of rotation data to determine the
    appropriate previous state at the specified time. It is part of the internal transport
    animation system that manages how objects move and rotate during transport travel.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a TransportRotationEntry object representing the previous
    animation rotation at the given time, or nullptr if no valid entry exists for
    the provided time value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GetPrevAnimRotation
    code: "TransportAnimation* transportAnim = ...;\nconst TransportRotationEntry*\
      \ prevRotation = transportAnim->GetPrevAnimRotation(1000);\nif (prevRotation\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the previous rotation data\n    std::cout << \"\
      Previous rotation time: \" << prevRotation->Time << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of an internal animation system and may be used
    in conjunction with other transport-related methods to manage movement and orientation.
    The implementation might involve time-based interpolation or lookup within a sorted
    sequence of rotation entries.
  warnings: Ensure that the TransportAnimation object is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as accessing an uninitialized or invalid object could lead
    to undefined behavior. Also note that the returned pointer should be checked for
    null before use.
