  class: ArenaPillar
  method: ArenaPillar
  signature: void ArenaPillar::ArenaPillar(int pos, float r)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an arena pillar at the specified position with the given radius.
  description: The ArenaPillar constructor method sets up an arena pillar object at
    a specific location in the world with a defined radius. This method is typically
    used during arena initialization or map loading to create visual and functional
    pillars that define the boundaries or structure of an arena battleground. The
    position parameter determines where the pillar is placed, while the radius controls
    its size. This method likely interacts with the game's collision detection system
    and may be involved in determining valid player movement areas within the arena.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: Position identifier or index that specifies where the pillar should
      be placed in the arena. Valid values are typically integers representing predefined
      positions or coordinates within the arena's coordinate system.
  - name: r
    description: Radius of the arena pillar, determining its size. This value is usually
      a positive floating-point number representing the distance from the center to
      the edge of the pillar in world units.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Arena Pillar Initialization
    code: 'ArenaPillar pillar(0, 5.0f);

      // Creates a pillar at position 0 with radius 5.0 units'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Arena Pillars Setup
    code: "ArenaPillar pillars[4];\nfor (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i)\n{\n    pillars[i]\
      \ = ArenaPillar(i, 3.5f);\n}\n// Creates four pillars at positions 0-3 with\
      \ radius 3.5 units each"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger arena battleground system and may
    be called during map initialization or arena creation. The position parameter
    might correspond to predefined anchor points in the arena, while the radius determines
    how much space the pillar occupies. Implementation details may involve collision
    geometry, visual rendering, and possibly AI pathfinding restrictions.
  warnings: The method signature suggests this is a constructor, so calling it on
    an already initialized object could lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the
    position parameter corresponds to valid arena locations and that the radius doesn't
    conflict with other arena elements or player movement zones.
