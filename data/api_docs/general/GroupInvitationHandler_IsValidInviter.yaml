  signature: bool GroupInvitationHandler::IsValidInviter(Player * inviter) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player is authorized to invite others to a group
  description: The IsValidInviter method checks if the specified player has the necessary
    permissions and conditions to invite other players to a group. This validation
    typically ensures the inviter is either the group leader, assistant leader, or
    has sufficient privileges based on the group's leadership structure. The method
    performs several checks including whether the inviter is in a group, whether they
    hold appropriate leadership roles, and whether the player meets any additional
    game mechanics requirements for inviting members. It serves as a core validation
    step in the group invitation system to maintain proper group management and prevent
    unauthorized invitations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is a valid inviter with proper group leadership
    permissions; returns false otherwise, indicating the player cannot invite others
    to the group
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Group Invitation Logic
    code: "if (groupInvitationHandler.IsValidInviter(player)) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ invitation logic\n    group->AddMember(invitedPlayer);\n} else {\n    // Send\
      \ error message to player\n    player->SendGroupOperationResult(false, \"You\
      \ do not have permission to invite players.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Group Management System
    code: "class GroupManager {\npublic:\n    bool HandleInviteRequest(Player* inviter,\
      \ Player* invited) {\n        if (!groupInvitationHandler.IsValidInviter(inviter))\
      \ {\n            return false;\n        }\n        \n        if (inviter->GetGroup()\
      \ != invited->GetGroup()) {\n            // Proceed with invitation\n      \
      \      return true;\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against the player's current group membership,
    leadership status (leader/assistant), and possibly server configuration settings.
    It may also validate that the inviter is not in a restricted state such as being
    in combat or having certain debuffs that would prevent group actions. The implementation
    should be efficient as it's called frequently during group operations.
  warnings: Do not use this method alone for complete group permission validation
    - ensure other game-specific conditions are also checked. Be aware that the method
    may return false even if a player is in a group, if they lack proper leadership
    roles or if server rules restrict their invitation privileges.
