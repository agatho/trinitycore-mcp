  method: GetAvailableRunesOfType
  signature: uint32 RuneSystem::GetAvailableRunesOfType(RuneType type) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of available runes of a specified type for the player.
  description: The GetAvailableRunesOfType method retrieves the number of runes that
    are currently available (not on cooldown) for a specific rune type, such as Blood,
    Unholy, Frost, or Death. This method is typically used in the context of World
    of Warcraft's Death Knight class mechanics, where players have a limited set of
    runes that regenerate over time. The returned value indicates how many runes of
    the given type can be consumed immediately for abilities like Death Strike or
    Obliterate without waiting for cooldowns to expire.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of available runes of the specified
    type. Returns 0 if no runes are available or if an invalid rune type is provided.
  examples:
  - title: Check Available Blood Runes
    code: "uint32 bloodRunes = player->GetRuneSystem()->GetAvailableRunesOfType(RUNE_TYPE_BLOOD);\n\
      if (bloodRunes > 0)\n{\n    // Player can use a Blood rune immediately\n   \
      \ player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_DEATH_STRIKE, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine Rune Usage for Rotation
    code: "RuneSystem* runeSys = player->GetRuneSystem();\nuint32 totalRunes = runeSys->GetAvailableRunesOfType(RUNE_TYPE_FROST)\
      \ + \n                   runeSys->GetAvailableRunesOfType(RUNE_TYPE_UNHOLY);\n\
      if (totalRunes >= 2)\n{\n    // Can cast two-rune abilities\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_FROST_STRIKE, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method reflects the current state of rune regeneration and cooldowns.
    It does not account for runes that are about to be consumed by an ability in progress.
    The implementation relies on internal rune tracking and cooldown management within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns only currently available runes, not
    the total number of runes a player possesses. Always check the return value before
    using runes to avoid invalid operations or game state inconsistencies.
