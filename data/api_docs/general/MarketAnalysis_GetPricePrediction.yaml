  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: GetPricePrediction
  signature: float MarketAnalysis::GetPricePrediction(uint32 itemId, uint32 hoursAhead)
documentation:
  brief: Predicts the future price of an item based on market analysis data.
  description: The GetPricePrediction method calculates and returns a predicted price
    for a specified item in the game's economy. This prediction is derived from historical
    market data, supply and demand trends, and other economic factors within the TrinityCore
    environment. The method takes into account the item identifier and the number
    of hours ahead for which the prediction is required. It is primarily used by in-game
    systems or external tools that require forecasting of item prices to assist players
    with trading decisions or economic planning.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item for which the price prediction
      is requested. This corresponds to the item's entry in the game's database.
  - name: hoursAhead
    description: The number of hours into the future for which the price prediction
      is calculated. Valid values are typically between 1 and 168 (one week).
  returns: A floating-point value representing the predicted price of the item in
    copper. Returns 0.0 if the item is not found or if no prediction data is available
    for the specified time frame.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float predictedPrice = marketAnalysis->GetPricePrediction(18732, 24); //
      Predict price of item ID 18732 in 24 hours

      std::cout << "Predicted price: " << predictedPrice << " copper" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "uint32 itemId = 18732;\nuint32 hours = 48;\nfloat price = marketAnalysis->GetPricePrediction(itemId,\
      \ hours);\nif (price > 0.0f)\n{\n    printf(\"Item %u will cost approximately\
      \ %f copper in %u hours.\\n\", itemId, price, hours);\n}\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"\
      No prediction data available for item %u.\\n\", itemId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal market data that may be updated periodically
    or based on in-game events. The accuracy of predictions decreases the further
    into the future the hoursAhead parameter extends. It is recommended to cache results
    for frequently queried items to reduce computational overhead.
  warnings: Do not rely solely on predicted prices for critical trading decisions,
    as real-time market fluctuations can significantly alter actual prices. The method
    may return zero if insufficient data exists for the requested item or time frame.
