  signature: void SmartAI::ReturnToLastOOCPos()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the AI controller to its last Out of Combat position.
  description: The ReturnToLastOOCPos method instructs the SmartAI instance to move
    back to the last known position where it was out of combat. This is typically
    used in scripted AI behaviors to restore the creature's original location after
    performing actions or engaging in combat. The method utilizes internal state tracking
    to remember the last OOC position and initiates a movement path back to that location.
    It is commonly called during AI event handling when returning to a neutral state
    after combat or other scripted activities.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in SmartAI event
    code: "void OnCombatEnd()\n{\n    // Return to last OOC position when combat ends\n\
      \    ReturnToLastOOCPos();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the AI maintaining internal state tracking of OOC positions.
    It may not work correctly if the creature's position has been manually altered
    or if the AI has not yet established a valid OOC position. The movement behavior
    depends on the underlying movement system and may be affected by terrain, obstacles,
    or pathfinding limitations.
  warnings: Calling this method without prior OOC positioning may result in undefined
    behavior or no movement action. Ensure that the AI has been in an OOC state at
    least once before calling this method to maintain expected functionality.
