  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the InstanceEventBus class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the InstanceEventBus
    class, providing global access to a single instance of the event bus used for
    handling instance-related events in TrinityCore. This method ensures that only
    one InstanceEventBus object exists throughout the application lifecycle, allowing
    various subsystems to register for and dispatch instance-specific events without
    creating multiple redundant instances. The returned pointer is guaranteed to be
    valid and should not be deleted by callers.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton InstanceEventBus instance. Never returns nullptr
    under normal operation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InstanceEventBus* eventBus = InstanceEventBus::instance();

      // Use eventBus to register for events or dispatch events'
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering an Event Handler
    code: "InstanceEventBus* bus = InstanceEventBus::instance();\nbus->RegisterHandler(InstanceEventType::INSTANCE_EVENT_STARTED,\
      \ [](const InstanceEvent& event) {\n    // Handle instance start event\n});"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it uses a static local variable approach for
    singleton creation. The InstanceEventBus singleton is typically initialized during
    server startup and remains valid throughout the application lifetime.
