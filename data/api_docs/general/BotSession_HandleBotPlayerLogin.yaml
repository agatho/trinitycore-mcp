documentation:
  brief: Processes the login query results for a bot player, initializing their session
    and character data.
  description: The HandleBotPlayerLogin method is responsible for processing the login
    query results obtained from the database for a bot player. It initializes the
    bot's session state, loads character information, and prepares the player for
    gameplay within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically follows a database
    query operation that retrieves player data such as account details, character
    stats, inventory, and other relevant information needed to establish a functional
    bot session. The method ensures that all necessary data structures are properly
    populated and that the bot is ready to interact with the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Session Initialization
    code: "void MyBotManager::InitializeBotSession(uint32 accountId)\n{\n    BotLoginQueryHolder\
      \ holder(accountId);\n    holder.FillQueries();\n    botSession->HandleBotPlayerLogin(holder);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BotLoginQueryHolder has been properly filled
    with database queries before being passed. It is designed to be called within
    a thread-safe context where database operations are completed and results are
    available. The method may perform multiple internal operations including character
    loading, inventory setup, and session validation.
  warnings: Calling this method without properly initializing the BotLoginQueryHolder
    may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all required database
    queries have been executed and their results are valid before invoking this method.
