  signature: void BattlegroundAI::ExecuteKotmoguStrategy(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the Kotmogu strategy for a player in the battleground.
  description: The ExecuteKotmoguStrategy method implements a specific AI behavior
    pattern used by the BattlegroundAI class to handle strategic decisions related
    to the Kotmogu event or mechanic within World of Warcraft battlegrounds. This
    method likely modifies player state, triggers specific actions, or coordinates
    with other battleground systems to ensure proper execution of Kotmogu-related
    gameplay elements such as objectives, rewards, or tactical positioning. The method
    operates on a provided player reference and may influence the overall battleground
    strategy based on current game conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier or index
      within the battleground context. This parameter is used to determine which player's
      state should be modified or evaluated during strategy execution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecuteKotmoguStrategy
    code: 'int playerId = 5;

      bgAI->ExecuteKotmoguStrategy(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal battleground AI system and should only
    be called from within the appropriate battleground context. The exact behavior
    may vary depending on the current battleground type and game state.
  warnings: Ensure that the player parameter points to a valid player index or identifier;
    passing an invalid reference could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
