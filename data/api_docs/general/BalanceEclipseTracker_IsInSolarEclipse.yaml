documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is currently in Solar Eclipse state.
  description: The IsInSolarEclipse method checks the current eclipse status of the
    Balance Druid player and returns true if they are in Solar Eclipse, false otherwise.
    This method is part of the Eclipse system mechanics in World of Warcraft's Balance
    Druid class, where players can be in either Lunar Eclipse or Solar Eclipse states
    depending on their spell casting sequence. The eclipse state affects the behavior
    of certain spells like Starfire and Wrath, providing different bonuses and effects
    based on which eclipse is active. This check is typically used in spell handling
    logic to determine appropriate spell modifications or visual effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently in Solar Eclipse state, false if
    they are in Lunar Eclipse or no eclipse state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Logic
    code: "if (player->GetSpellHistory()->IsInSolarEclipse()) {\n    // Apply Solar\
      \ Eclipse specific effects to Starfire\n    spell->SetPowerCost(spell->GetPowerCost()\
      \ * 0.8f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Eclipse State Check for UI Display
    code: "void UpdateEclipseIndicator(Player* player) {\n    if (player->GetSpellHistory()->IsInSolarEclipse())\
      \ {\n        // Update UI to show Solar Eclipse indicator\n        ui->SetEclipseState(ECLIPSE_SOLAR);\n\
      \    } else if (player->GetSpellHistory()->IsInLunarEclipse()) {\n        //\
      \ Update UI to show Lunar Eclipse indicator\n        ui->SetEclipseState(ECLIPSE_LUNAR);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal eclipse tracking system of the Balance
    Druid class. The eclipse state is updated automatically when specific spells are
    cast in sequence, and this method provides a simple way to query the current state
    without needing to manually track spell casting order. The method is thread-safe
    as it only reads from existing state variables.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine spell eligibility directly;
    instead, use the appropriate spell system methods that handle eclipse states internally.
    Be aware that eclipse states can change rapidly during combat, so caching this
    value may lead to outdated information in fast-paced scenarios.
