  class: ArenaTeam
  method: SaveToDB
  signature: void ArenaTeam::SaveToDB(bool forceMemberSave)
documentation:
  brief: Saves the arena team data to the database, optionally saving member information.
  description: The SaveToDB method persists the current state of an ArenaTeam object
    to the database. It serializes all relevant team data including team statistics,
    member roster, and ranking information. The forceMemberSave parameter controls
    whether individual member data should also be updated in the database. This method
    is typically called during arena team updates or when the team is being destroyed
    to ensure data consistency. The operation involves database transactions and may
    impact performance if called frequently without proper batching.
  parameters:
  - name: forceMemberSave
    description: When true, forces individual member data to be saved to the database.
      When false, only team-level data is saved. This parameter allows for selective
      saving of member information to optimize performance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Arena Team Save
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\nif (team)\n\
      {\n    team->SaveToDB(false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Force Member Save for Arena Team
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\nif (team)\n\
      {\n    // Force save of both team and member data\n    team->SaveToDB(true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database I/O operations which can be expensive. It's
    recommended to batch multiple saves together or use it sparingly during high-frequency
    operations. The method internally handles database transaction management and
    ensures data integrity.
  warnings: Calling this method with forceMemberSave=true will result in multiple
    database queries for each team member, which can significantly impact performance
    if the team has many members. Avoid calling this method in tight loops or frequently
    during gameplay.
