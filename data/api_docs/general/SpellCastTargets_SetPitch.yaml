  method: SetPitch
  signature: void SpellCastTargets::SetPitch(float pitch)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the pitch angle for the spell cast target orientation.
  description: The SetPitch method configures the vertical orientation angle (pitch)
    of the spell casting target. This angle determines how the spell is directed vertically
    in the game world, affecting the trajectory and targeting direction. The pitch
    value is typically expressed in radians and influences the spell's launch angle
    from the caster's perspective. This method is commonly used when setting up targeted
    spells that require specific vertical orientation, such as projectiles or area-of-effect
    spells with directional components.

  examples:
  - title: Setting a 45-degree pitch for spell targeting
    code: 'SpellCastTargets targets;

      targets.SetPitch(M_PI / 4); // 45 degrees in radians'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using SetPitch with dynamic angle calculation
    code: 'float targetHeight = 10.0f;

      float distance = 20.0f;

      float pitch = atan2(targetHeight, distance);

      SpellCastTargets targets;

      targets.SetPitch(pitch);'
    language: cpp
  notes: "The pitch angle is typically stored internally as a float value in radians.\
    \ Values outside the typical range of -\u03C0 to \u03C0 may produce unexpected\
    \ behavior. This method does not validate input values, so developers should ensure\
    \ proper angle normalization if needed."
  warnings: "Setting extreme pitch values (close to \xB1\u03C0/2) can cause spells\
    \ to behave unexpectedly or fail to cast properly. The method does not perform\
    \ any automatic validation of the pitch value, so invalid angles may lead to client-side\
    \ visual glitches or server-side targeting issues."
