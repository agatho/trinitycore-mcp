  class: BotPacketRelay
  method: BroadcastToGroup
  signature: void BotPacketRelay::BroadcastToGroup(BotSession * botSession, const
    WorldPacket * packet, bool ignoreBot)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a packet to all members of the bot's group, optionally excluding the
    originating bot session.
  description: The BroadcastToGroup method is responsible for transmitting a WorldPacket
    to all players within the same group as the specified bot session. This functionality
    is commonly used in bot systems to synchronize actions or messages across group
    members. The method allows for an optional exclusion of the sending bot itself,
    which can be useful when the bot needs to broadcast a message without echoing
    it back to itself. The implementation likely leverages internal TrinityCore group
    management and packet handling mechanisms to ensure proper delivery to all relevant
    players in the group.
  parameters:
  - name: botSession
    description: Pointer to the BotSession object representing the bot that is initiating
      the broadcast. This parameter determines the group context for the broadcast
      operation.
  - name: packet
    description: Pointer to the WorldPacket object containing the data to be broadcasted
      to the group members. The packet should be properly constructed before being
      passed to this method.
  - name: ignoreBot
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the originating bot session should
      be excluded from receiving the broadcast. If true, the bot will not receive
      its own broadcast message; if false, it may receive the packet depending on
      internal logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Broadcast
    code: 'BotSession* session = GetBotSession();

      WorldPacket packet(SMSG_CHAT_MESSAGE, 100);

      // ... populate packet with data ...

      broadcastRelay->BroadcastToGroup(session, &packet, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Broadcast Including Self
    code: 'BotSession* session = GetBotSession();

      WorldPacket packet(SMSG_GROUP_ACTION_RESULT, 50);

      // ... populate packet with data ...

      broadcastRelay->BroadcastToGroup(session, &packet, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates within the context of a bot management system
    where individual bots are part of player groups. It may internally use group iterators
    or session managers to identify and send packets to all relevant players. Performance
    considerations include avoiding unnecessary packet duplication when ignoreBot
    is true, and ensuring thread safety if called from multiple concurrent bot threads.
  warnings: Ensure that the WorldPacket passed to this method is properly constructed
    and valid before calling, as invalid packets may cause client-side errors or disconnections.
    Be cautious with broadcast frequency to avoid flooding group members with too
    many messages in a short time period.
