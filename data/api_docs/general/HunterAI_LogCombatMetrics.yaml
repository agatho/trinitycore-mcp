documentation:
  brief: Logs combat metrics for the hunter's current combat session
  description: The LogCombatMetrics method records detailed performance data during
    a hunter's combat interactions. This includes tracking shot accuracy, damage dealt,
    critical hits, and other relevant statistics. The method is typically invoked
    at the end of a combat encounter or when specific combat events occur to maintain
    accurate performance logging for the AI system. It helps in analyzing hunter behavior
    patterns and optimizing AI decision-making during combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat End
    code: "void HunterAI::OnCombatEnd()\n{\n    LogCombatMetrics();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal logging systems and may be called
    automatically by the AI framework during combat events. Performance impact should
    be minimal as it's designed for periodic metric collection rather than real-time
    processing.
