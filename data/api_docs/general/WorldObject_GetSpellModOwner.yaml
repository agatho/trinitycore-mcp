documentation:
  brief: Returns the Player object that owns the spell modification for this WorldObject.
  description: The GetSpellModOwner method retrieves the Player instance that is responsible
    for applying spell modifications to this WorldObject. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    implementation, spell modifiers can be applied by players through various means
    such as enchantments, talents, or buffs. This method allows the system to identify
    which player's influence is currently affecting the spell properties of the object.
    The returned Player pointer may be nullptr if no player is actively modifiying
    spells on this object, or if the object itself is not a type that supports spell
    modifications. This functionality is crucial for maintaining accurate spell behavior
    and ensuring proper application of player-based spell modifications within the
    game's combat and ability systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Player object that owns the spell modification, or nullptr
    if no such owner exists. The returned pointer should be used carefully as it may
    become invalid if the player logs out or is removed from the world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for spell modifier owner
    code: "Player* spellOwner = worldObject->GetSpellModOwner();\nif (spellOwner !=\
      \ nullptr)\n{\n    // Process spell modification logic\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Spell modifier owner found: %s\", spellOwner->GetName().c_str());\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    sLog->outString(\"No spell modifier owner found.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using spell modifier owner to apply custom logic
    code: "Player* owner = unit->GetSpellModOwner();\nif (owner && owner->HasAura(12345))\
      \ // Check if owner has specific aura\n{\n    // Apply additional spell effect\
      \ based on owner's state\n    float bonus = owner->GetFloatValue(PLAYER_FIELD_MOD_DAMAGE_DONE_POS);\n\
      \    // Modify spell damage calculation\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in spell processing systems where player-specific
    modifications need to be tracked and applied. The returned Player pointer should
    not be stored long-term as the player may disconnect or be destroyed. Performance-wise,
    this operation is generally fast but should be avoided in high-frequency loops
    without caching.
  warnings: Be cautious when storing the returned Player pointer beyond the scope
    of a single function call, as the player object may be deleted or become invalid.
    Always check for nullptr before dereferencing the returned pointer to prevent
    segmentation faults.
