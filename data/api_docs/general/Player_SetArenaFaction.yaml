documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's arena faction to the specified value.
  description: This method configures the player's arena faction, which determines
    their relationship with arena teams and their faction status in the game world.
    The faction is typically used to control how players interact with other players
    in arena matches, including their ability to join different arena teams and their
    overall faction reputation. This method directly modifies the player's faction
    settings without requiring additional checks or validations.
  parameters:
  - name: arenaFaction
    description: The faction value to set for the player. Valid values are typically
      0-2, representing different arena faction states (0 = neutral, 1 = alliance,
      2 = horde). This parameter is used to determine which faction the player will
      be associated with in arena matches.
  returns: null

  notes: This method is typically used during arena match setup or when changing player
    faction status. It directly affects how the player interacts with other players
    in arena, and should be used carefully as it may impact gameplay mechanics related
    to faction reputation and team joining.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause issues with faction reputation and
    team joining in arena matches. Care should be taken when setting faction values
    to ensure they align with the intended game behavior.
