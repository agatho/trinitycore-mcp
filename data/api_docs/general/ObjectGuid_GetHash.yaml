  class: ObjectGuid
  method: GetHash
  signature: std::size_t ObjectGuid::GetHash() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a hash value for the ObjectGuid instance.
  description: The GetHash method computes a unique hash code for the ObjectGuid object,
    which is typically used in hash-based data structures such as std::unordered_map
    or std::unordered_set for efficient lookup and storage. This hash function ensures
    that two ObjectGuid instances with the same underlying GUID values will produce
    identical hash codes, enabling proper functioning of hash tables. The implementation
    uses a standard hashing algorithm suitable for GUIDs, ensuring good distribution
    across the hash space to minimize collisions. In the context of TrinityCore, this
    method supports efficient management of game objects, players, and other entities
    identified by GUIDs within collections that require fast access patterns.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::size_t value representing the computed hash code for this ObjectGuid
    instance. This value is suitable for use as a key in hash-based containers like
    std::unordered_map or std::unordered_set.
  examples:
  - title: Using GetHash to insert into an unordered_map
    code: 'ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345);

      std::unordered_map<std::size_t, std::string> guidMap;

      guidMap[guid.GetHash()] = "Player12345";'
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing hash values of equivalent GUIDs
    code: 'ObjectGuid guid1 = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Creature>(98765);

      ObjectGuid guid2 = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Creature>(98765);

      assert(guid1.GetHash() == guid2.GetHash());'
    language: cpp
  notes: The hash function is designed to be consistent across different runs of the
    application, assuming the same GUID values. It's important to note that while
    hash codes are unique for distinct GUIDs, there may be collisions (different GUIDs
    producing the same hash), though this is statistically rare with a good hash implementation.
