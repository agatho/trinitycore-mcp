  signature: bool BrewmasterStaggerTracker::IsModerateStagger() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player has moderate stagger status.
  description: The IsModerateStagger method checks if the Brewmaster monk currently
    has a moderate amount of stagger damage applied to them. Stagger is a damage mitigation
    mechanic in World of Warcraft where incoming damage is temporarily stored and
    then released over time. This method specifically evaluates whether the stagger
    level has reached the 'moderate' threshold, which typically corresponds to a certain
    percentage of maximum health being affected by stagger. The method returns true
    if the current stagger state is classified as moderate, and false otherwise. This
    functionality is primarily used for determining appropriate visual effects, combat
    feedback, or triggering specific abilities based on stagger levels.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player's current stagger level is classified as moderate;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Logic
    code: "if (player->GetBrewmasterStaggerTracker()->IsModerateStagger()) {\n   \
      \ // Trigger visual effect or play sound for moderate stagger\n    player->SendPlaySpellVisual(12345);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Ability Activation Based on Stagger Level
    code: "BrewmasterStaggerTracker* tracker = player->GetBrewmasterStaggerTracker();\n\
      if (tracker->IsModerateStagger()) {\n    // Activate ability that benefits from\
      \ moderate stagger\n    player->CastSpell(player, 123456, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state tracking of stagger damage. The
    exact percentage thresholds for 'moderate' stagger may vary based on game updates
    or class balance changes. The method should only be called when a Brewmaster monk
    is in combat or has active stagger effects.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat context where stagger effects
    are active, as it may return unexpected results. Ensure that the BrewmasterStaggerTracker
    instance is valid before calling this method to prevent null pointer exceptions.
