documentation:
  brief: Adds permissions from one RBAC permission container to another
  description: The AddPermissions method copies all permissions from a source RBACPermissionContainer
    (permsFrom) into a destination RBACPermissionContainer (permsTo). This operation
    is typically used during role-based access control initialization or when merging
    user permissions. The method performs a deep copy of the permission data, ensuring
    that the destination container receives all permissions without modifying the
    source container. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, this method
    supports the RBAC system that controls player access to game features and commands
    based on assigned roles.
  parameters:
  - name: permsFrom
    description: The source RBACPermissionContainer containing permissions to be copied
  - name: permsTo
    description: The destination RBACPermissionContainer where permissions will be
      added
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Permission Addition
    code: 'RBACPermissionContainer sourcePerms;

      RBACPermissionContainer targetPerms;

      // Add some permissions to sourcePerms

      sourcePerms.insert(1); // Add permission ID 1

      sourcePerms.insert(2); // Add permission ID 2


      // Transfer all permissions from source to target

      RBACData::AddPermissions(sourcePerms, targetPerms);

      // targetPerms now contains permissions 1 and 2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Permissions During Role Assignment
    code: "void AssignRoleToPlayer(Player* player, const std::string& roleName) {\n\
      \    RBACPermissionContainer rolePermissions;\n    // Load permissions for the\
      \ specified role\n    if (LoadRolePermissions(roleName, rolePermissions)) {\n\
      \        // Get current player's permissions\n        RBACData* playerRBAC =\
      \ player->GetRBACData();\n        RBACPermissionContainer& currentPerms = playerRBAC->GetPermissions();\n\
      \        \n        // Add new role permissions to existing ones\n        RBACData::AddPermissions(rolePermissions,\
      \ currentPerms);\n        \n        // Update player's access rights\n     \
      \   playerRBAC->UpdatePermissions();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation or deduplication of permissions.
    If duplicate permission IDs exist in both containers, they will be added to the
    destination container without removal of duplicates. The method operates on the
    RBACPermissionContainer type which is a set-like structure that stores unique
    permission identifiers.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with large permission sets as it performs
    a full copy operation. Ensure proper synchronization if used in multi-threaded
    contexts where permissions might be modified concurrently.
