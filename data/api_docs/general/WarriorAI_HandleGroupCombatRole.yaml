documentation:
  brief: Updates the warrior's combat role based on group dynamics and target conditions.
  description: The HandleGroupCombatRole method is responsible for dynamically adjusting
    a warrior's combat behavior within a group setting. It evaluates the current group
    composition, target threat levels, and player roles to determine the most effective
    combat stance or action. This method typically integrates with the AI decision-making
    system to ensure optimal performance during group encounters, such as dungeons
    or raids. The implementation considers factors like whether the player is in a
    tanking, DPS, or support role, and modifies behavior accordingly.

    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n\
      \    HandleGroupCombatRole();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and may influence
    stance switching, spell selection, or ability prioritization based on group context.
    It's designed to be lightweight and non-blocking.
