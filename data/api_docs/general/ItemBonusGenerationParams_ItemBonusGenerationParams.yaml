  signature: void ItemBonusGenerationParams::ItemBonusGenerationParams(ItemContext
    context, int mythicPlusKeystoneLevel, int pvpTier)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an ItemBonusGenerationParams object with context, mythic plus
    keystone level, and PvP tier values.
  description: The ItemBonusGenerationParams constructor initializes a structure used
    for generating item bonuses in World of Warcraft. This structure holds contextual
    information including the item's context (such as dungeon difficulty or PvP tier),
    the mythic plus keystone level (for Mythic+ dungeons), and the PvP tier (for PvP
    content). The parameters are stored internally to influence how item bonuses are
    calculated during item generation. This method is typically used when creating
    items with specific bonus properties based on player progression or game mode.
  parameters:
  - name: context
    description: The item context indicating the game mode or difficulty level (e.g.,
      normal, heroic, mythic plus, PvP). Valid values are defined by ItemContext enum.
  - name: mythicPlusKeystoneLevel
    description: The level of the Mythic+ keystone used to determine bonus scaling.
      Values typically range from 2 to 10 for standard progression, with higher levels
      providing stronger bonuses.
  - name: pvpTier
    description: The PvP tier level which affects item bonus generation for PvP content.
      Valid values are usually integers representing the tier (e.g., 1-6 for different
      PvP seasons or brackets).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize ItemBonusGenerationParams with Mythic+ context
    code: 'ItemBonusGenerationParams params(ItemContext::MYTHIC_PLUS, 8, 0);

      // Initializes parameters for a Mythic+ item with keystone level 8 and no PvP
      tier.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialize ItemBonusGenerationParams with PvP context
    code: 'ItemBonusGenerationParams params(ItemContext::PVP, 0, 4);

      // Initializes parameters for a PvP item with tier 4 and no Mythic+ keystone.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the item generation pipeline in TrinityCore.
    It's important to ensure that the provided context values align with valid enums
    to prevent undefined behavior during bonus calculation. The parameters are typically
    used in conjunction with other item generation APIs.
