documentation:
  brief: Loads vehicle template accessories from the database into memory for use
    in game object management.
  description: The LoadVehicleTemplateAccessories method initializes and populates
    internal data structures with vehicle accessory information retrieved from the
    database. This method is typically called during server startup or reload operations
    to ensure that all vehicle templates have their associated accessories properly
    loaded and available for use when vehicles are spawned or interacted with in the
    game world. It processes entries from the vehicle_template_accessory table, linking
    accessory data to specific vehicle templates based on entry IDs. The method does
    not return any value but modifies internal state within the ObjectMgr class.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeServer()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n    sObjectMgr->LoadVehicleTemplateAccessories();\n\
      \    // Continue with other initialization tasks\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectMgr's database loading sequence and should
    only be called after the database connection is established. It's typically invoked
    automatically during server startup process, but may also be triggered manually
    during hot-reloading scenarios.
