  class: CalendarEvent
  method: GetDate
  signature: time_t CalendarEvent::GetDate() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the date and time when the calendar event is scheduled to occur.
  description: The GetDate method returns the Unix timestamp representing the date
    and time of the calendar event. This value is stored internally as a time_t type
    and corresponds to the moment in time when the event is set to take place. The
    returned value can be used to determine if an event has passed, is upcoming, or
    is currently active. In World of Warcraft's context, this method allows addons
    or core systems to query when a specific calendar event is scheduled for execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: A time_t value representing the Unix timestamp of the calendar event's
    scheduled date and time. This value is typically in UTC and can be converted to
    local time using standard C++ time functions such as localtime() or gmtime().
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Event Time
    code: "CalendarEvent* event = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(12345);\nif (event)\n{\n\
      \    time_t eventTime = event->GetDate();\n    time_t currentTime = time(nullptr);\n\
      \    if (eventTime > currentTime)\n        printf(\"Event is in the future.\\\
      n\");\n    else if (eventTime < currentTime)\n        printf(\"Event has already\
      \ passed.\\n\");\n    else\n        printf(\"Event is happening now.\\n\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Convert Timestamp to Readable Format
    code: "CalendarEvent* event = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(12345);\nif (event)\n{\n\
      \    time_t eventTime = event->GetDate();\n    struct tm* timeInfo = localtime(&eventTime);\n\
      \    char buffer[80];\n    strftime(buffer, sizeof(buffer), \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"\
      , timeInfo);\n    printf(\"Event scheduled for: %s\\n\", buffer);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned time_t value represents UTC time. When displaying times to players,
    it's recommended to convert this to the player's local timezone using appropriate
    time conversion functions. The method does not perform any validation on the internal
    date value and assumes it is correctly initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that the CalendarEvent object is valid before calling GetDate(),
    as calling it on a null or improperly initialized event may result in undefined
    behavior. Be cautious when comparing timestamps across different time zones without
    proper conversion.
