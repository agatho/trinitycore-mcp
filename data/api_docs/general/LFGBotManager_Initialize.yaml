  method: Initialize
  signature: void LFGBotManager::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the LFG bot manager system, setting up internal data structures
    and registering necessary callbacks for group finding functionality.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the LFGBotManager class for operation
    by initializing all required internal components, such as data containers, event
    handlers, and configuration settings. This method is typically called during server
    startup or when the LFG bot system needs to be activated. It ensures that all
    necessary resources are allocated and that the manager is ready to handle LFG
    (Looking For Group) requests from players. The initialization process may involve
    loading default configurations, setting up timers, and registering with the core
    game systems to receive LFG-related events. This method must be called before
    any other LFGBotManager methods can be safely invoked.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'LFGBotManager* lfgBotManager = new LFGBotManager();

      lfgBotManager->Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of the LFGBotManager
    instance. Repeated calls may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. The
    initialization process is not thread-safe and should be performed on the main
    server thread.
  warnings: Calling Initialize after the manager has already been initialized may
    cause memory corruption or inconsistent state. Ensure that all dependencies are
    properly loaded before invoking this method.
