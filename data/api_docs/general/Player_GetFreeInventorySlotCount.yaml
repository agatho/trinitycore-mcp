  class: Player
  method: GetFreeInventorySlotCount
  signature: uint32 Player::GetFreeInventorySlotCount(int location) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of free inventory slots available for the player.
  description: This method calculates and returns the count of empty inventory slots
    that are currently available to the player. It takes into account the player's
    current inventory state, including equipped items and bag slots, and provides
    a precise count of how many slots remain free for new items. The method is essential
    for determining inventory capacity and managing item placement within the game
    mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of free inventory slots
    available. This value can be zero if all slots are occupied, or higher values
    when slots remain free.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 freeSlots = player->GetFreeInventorySlotCount();\nif (freeSlots\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Player can add items to inventory\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with item management systems
    and inventory checks. It may be affected by the player's equipped items, bag slots,
    and other inventory-related factors. Performance-wise, it's a lightweight operation
    that does not require significant computational resources.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when checking inventory capacity,
    as incorrect usage can lead to failed item placements or unexpected behavior in
    game mechanics. Ensure proper handling of return values to avoid logic errors.
