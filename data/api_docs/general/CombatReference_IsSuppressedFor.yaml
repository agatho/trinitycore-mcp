  class: CombatReference
  method: IsSuppressedFor
  signature: bool CombatReference::IsSuppressedFor(const Unit * who) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the combat reference is suppressed for a specified unit.
  description: The IsSuppressedFor method checks if a combat reference (typically
    representing an attack or ability) is currently suppressed for a given unit. This
    suppression can occur due to various game mechanics such as spell effects, buffs,
    debuffs, or environmental conditions that prevent the combat action from being
    processed or having its normal effects applied. The method evaluates the internal
    state of the combat reference against the provided unit's current condition and
    returns true if suppression is active, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: who
    description: A pointer to the Unit object for which to check combat suppression
      status. This parameter must not be null; passing a null pointer will result
      in undefined behavior or a crash.
  returns: Returns true if the combat reference is suppressed for the specified unit,
    indicating that the combat action should not proceed or have its effects applied.
    Returns false if no suppression is active for the unit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Handler
    code: "if (combatRef->IsSuppressedFor(targetUnit)) {\n    // Skip applying damage\
      \ or effects\n    return;\n}\n// Proceed with normal combat logic"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Suppression Before Applying Effects
    code: "void ApplyCombatEffect(CombatReference* ref, Unit* target) {\n    if (!ref->IsSuppressedFor(target))\
      \ {\n        // Normal effect application\n        target->DealDamage(ref->GetAttacker(),\
      \ ref->GetDamage());\n    } else {\n        // Handle suppressed case (e.g.,\
      \ send message or log)\n        sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_COMBAT, \"Combat effect\
      \ suppressed for %s\", target->GetName().c_str());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal suppression flags or aura states
    stored within the combat reference and unit objects. It may be called frequently
    during combat processing, so performance is important. The implementation should
    consider thread safety if used across multiple threads.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'who' parameter is a valid non-null pointer to avoid crashes.
    This method might not account for all possible suppression conditions in complex
    scenarios involving multiple overlapping effects or custom mechanics.
