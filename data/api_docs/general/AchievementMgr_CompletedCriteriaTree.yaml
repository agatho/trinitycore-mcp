  signature: void AchievementMgr::CompletedCriteriaTree(const CriteriaTree * tree,
    Player * referencePlayer)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and completes all criteria associated with a given achievement
    tree for the specified player.
  description: The CompletedCriteriaTree method is responsible for handling the completion
    of all criteria entries within a specified achievement tree for a given player.
    This method is typically invoked when an achievement's criteria are met, ensuring
    that all related criteria in the tree are marked as completed and that appropriate
    rewards or notifications are triggered. It serves as a core part of the achievement
    system's logic, maintaining consistency between the player's progress and the
    achievement data structures. The method operates on a CriteriaTree object which
    represents a hierarchical structure of criteria required for an achievement, and
    it uses a reference player to determine the context and update the player's achievement
    progress accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: tree
    description: A pointer to the CriteriaTree object that defines the set of criteria
      to be completed. This tree structure contains all the individual criteria entries
      associated with a specific achievement.
  - name: referencePlayer
    description: A pointer to the Player object for whom the criteria completion is
      being processed. This player's progress and achievement data will be updated
      based on the criteria in the provided tree.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Completing an Achievement Tree
    code: 'CriteriaTree* myTree = sAchievementMgr->GetCriteriaTree(12345);

      Player* targetPlayer = player;

      sAchievementMgr->CompletedCriteriaTree(myTree, targetPlayer);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal achievement processing pipeline and should
    not typically be called directly by external code. It's designed to work in conjunction
    with other achievement-related systems such as criteria tracking, progress updates,
    and reward distribution.
