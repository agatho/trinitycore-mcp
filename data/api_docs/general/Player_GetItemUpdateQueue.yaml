  method: GetItemUpdateQueue
  signature: int & Player::GetItemUpdateQueue()
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the player's item update queue identifier.
  description: The GetItemUpdateQueue method retrieves a reference to an integer identifier
    that represents the current state of the player's item update queue. This queue
    is used internally by TrinityCore to manage pending updates for items in the player's
    inventory, such as changes to stack sizes, durability, or other item properties.
    The returned reference allows direct access to this identifier, which may be used
    for synchronization purposes or to determine if item updates are pending. This
    method is typically used within the core game loop and item management systems
    to ensure proper handling of inventory modifications.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to an integer representing the current item update queue identifier.
    This value is used internally by TrinityCore to track the state of item updates
    for the player's inventory.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Item Update Queue Identifier
    code: "int& queueId = player->GetItemUpdateQueue();\n// Use queueId for synchronization\
      \ or debugging purposes\nif (queueId != 0)\n{\n    // Process pending item updates\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a reference to an internal member variable. Modifying
    the returned value directly may affect the player's item update state and should
    be done with caution. The queue identifier is managed automatically by the core
    system and typically reflects the current synchronization state of item updates.
  warnings: Direct modification of the returned integer reference can lead to inconsistent
    inventory states or synchronization issues. This method should only be used for
    reading the current queue state, not for modifying it directly.
