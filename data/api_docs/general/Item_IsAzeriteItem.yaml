  class: Item
  method: IsAzeriteItem
  signature: bool Item::IsAzeriteItem() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the item is an Azerite item.
  description: This method checks if the current item is an Azerite item, which are
    items that contain Azerite power and are typically found in the player's inventory
    or equipment slots. Azerite items are part of the Battle for Azeroth expansion
    content and are characterized by their unique Azerite-based properties and mechanics.
    The method returns true if the item is an Azerite item, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item is an Azerite item, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the item has Azerite power and can be used for Azerite-related gameplay
    mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(0, 0);\nif (item && item->IsAzeriteItem())\
      \ {\n    // Process Azerite item\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other Azerite-related APIs
    to determine if an item can be used for Azerite power operations or if it supports
    Azerite-based gameplay mechanics. Performance considerations are minimal as this
    is a simple check.
  warnings: This method should only be used when the item object is valid and not
    null, as calling it on a null item will result in undefined behavior.
