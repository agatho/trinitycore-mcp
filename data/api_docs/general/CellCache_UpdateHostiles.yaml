documentation:
  brief: Updates the list of hostile units within the cell cache.
  description: The UpdateHostiles method is responsible for maintaining an up-to-date
    list of hostile units (such as enemy players or creatures) that are currently
    within the cached cell boundaries. This method is typically called during game
    loop updates to ensure that the cell's hostile unit list reflects the current
    state of the world. It helps in optimizing AI behavior, threat detection, and
    combat-related logic by keeping track of nearby enemies. The method operates on
    the assumption that hostiles are already properly registered or unregistered from
    the cell cache.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::UpdateCellCache()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    cellCache.UpdateHostiles(std::move(hostileList));\n    // ... continue\
      \ with AI updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal sorting or indexing of hostile units
    for efficient access during AI decision-making. It may also trigger callbacks
    or notifications to registered observers when the list changes.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without proper registration of hostiles can
    lead to outdated or incorrect threat detection. Ensure that all hostile entities
    are correctly added to the cell before calling this method.
