documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot performance monitoring system
  description: The Initialize method sets up and prepares the BotPerformanceMonitor
    class for tracking and analyzing bot performance metrics. This method typically
    configures internal data structures, initializes logging mechanisms, and establishes
    necessary connections or resources required for performance monitoring. It should
    be called once during system startup or when the monitoring system needs to be
    activated. The method performs validation checks to ensure all prerequisites are
    met before enabling monitoring functionality.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if initialization was successful and all components were properly
    set up, false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates a failure
    in resource allocation, configuration errors, or prerequisite validation failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: "BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;\nbool success = monitor.Initialize();\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Monitoring system is ready\n    LOG_INFO(\"Performance\
      \ monitor initialized successfully\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle initialization\
      \ failure\n    LOG_ERROR(\"Failed to initialize performance monitor\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the application lifecycle.
    Repeated calls may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks. The initialization
    process may involve file system access, memory allocation, and thread creation
    which could impact startup time.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to memory
    leaks or corrupted internal state. Ensure that any previous monitoring sessions
    are properly shut down before calling this method again.
