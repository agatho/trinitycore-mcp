  class: BotDatabasePool
  method: IsHealthy
  signature: bool BotDatabasePool::IsHealthy() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the bot database connection pool is healthy and operational.
  description: The IsHealthy method determines whether the BotDatabasePool is currently
    in a functional state, meaning that it can successfully communicate with the underlying
    database. This method typically checks the status of active connections within
    the pool, ensuring that they are not stale or broken. It's commonly used by the
    TrinityCore framework to validate database connectivity before executing queries
    or transactions. The result of this check helps prevent operations from failing
    due to an unhealthy database connection.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all connections in the bot database pool are healthy and
    operational; otherwise, returns false if any connection is broken or the pool
    is not initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Health Check
    code: "if (BotDatabasePool::Instance().IsHealthy()) {\n    // Proceed with database\
      \ operations\n    LOG_INFO(\"server\", \"Bot database pool is healthy.\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle unhealthy state\n    LOG_ERROR(\"server\", \"Bot database\
      \ pool is not healthy!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform lightweight checks on connection status without executing
    heavy operations. It's designed to be efficient and safe for regular use in performance-critical
    code paths.
