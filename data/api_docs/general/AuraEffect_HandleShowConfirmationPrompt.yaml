  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleShowConfirmationPrompt(const AuraApplication *
    aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Displays a confirmation prompt to the player when an aura effect is applied
    or removed.
  description: The HandleShowConfirmationPrompt method is responsible for showing
    a confirmation dialog to the player when an aura effect is about to be applied
    or removed from them. This method is typically invoked during the application
    or removal of auras that require explicit user consent, such as certain debuffs
    or buffs that may have significant consequences. The method takes into account
    the aura application context, the mode of operation (application or removal),
    and whether the effect is being applied or removed to determine the appropriate
    prompt to display. It ensures that players are aware of the implications of applying
    or removing specific auras.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. This parameter provides context about which aura effect
      is triggering the confirmation prompt.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation indicating how the aura is being handled. This
      value typically determines the type of confirmation message or action to be
      presented to the player.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the aura effect is being applied
      (true) or removed (false). This parameter controls the direction of the operation
      and affects the prompt's wording and behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in aura application handling
    code: "void MyAuraEffect::HandleShowConfirmationPrompt(const AuraApplication*\
      \ aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const {\n    if (apply)\n        SendConfirmationDialog(aurApp,\
      \ \"Apply this debuff?\");\n    else\n        SendConfirmationDialog(aurApp,\
      \ \"Remove this buff?\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the aura handling system in TrinityCore and is typically
    called internally by the core engine during aura application/removal processes.
    Developers should ensure that any custom implementations respect the existing
    game flow and do not interfere with standard confirmation mechanisms.
  warnings: Improper implementation of this method may lead to incorrect UI prompts
    or player confusion. Ensure that the mode parameter accurately reflects the operation
    being performed, as incorrect values can result in misleading confirmation messages.
