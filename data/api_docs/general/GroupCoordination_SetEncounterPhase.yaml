  class: GroupCoordination
  method: SetEncounterPhase
  signature: void GroupCoordination::SetEncounterPhase(EncounterPhase phase)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the encounter phase for group coordination, controlling which phase
    of an encounter is active.
  description: The SetEncounterPhase method updates the current phase state of an
    encounter within a group coordination context. This method is typically used in
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to manage encounter states such as pre-combat,
    combat, post-combat, or any custom phase defined by the encounter logic. The phase
    value determines what actions are allowed, which NPCs are active, and how the
    group interacts with the encounter. This method is essential for managing complex
    encounters where multiple phases need to be synchronized across all group members.
  parameters:
  - name: phase
    description: The EncounterPhase enum value representing the new phase state to
      set for the encounter. Valid values typically include PHASE_PRE_COMBAT, PHASE_COMBAT,
      PHASE_POST_COMBAT, and custom phases defined by the encounter script.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a combat phase
    code: 'GroupCoordination* coordination = GetGroupCoordination();

      coordination->SetEncounterPhase(EncounterPhase::PHASE_COMBAT);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Transitioning to post-combat phase
    code: "if (boss->IsDead()) {\n    GroupCoordination* coordination = GetGroupCoordination();\n\
      \    coordination->SetEncounterPhase(EncounterPhase::PHASE_POST_COMBAT);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal state updates and may broadcast phase
    changes to all group members. The implementation should be thread-safe if used
    in concurrent environments, though TrinityCore typically handles synchronization
    internally for encounter-related operations.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper encounter initialization may lead to
    undefined behavior or incorrect encounter progression. Ensure that the phase value
    is valid and corresponds to a supported encounter state before calling.
