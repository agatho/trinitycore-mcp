  method: GetVendorItems
  signature: int VendorInteractionManager::GetVendorItems(Creature * vendor) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the list of items available for purchase from a vendor creature.
  description: The GetVendorItems method fetches all items currently offered by a
    specified vendor creature. It returns an integer representing the number of items
    in the vendor's inventory. This method is commonly used during vendor interaction
    events to determine what goods are available for sale. The method operates on
    the Creature object passed as a parameter and accesses the vendor's item list
    stored within the game's database or internal structures. It does not modify any
    data but instead provides read-only access to the vendor's inventory.
  parameters:
  - name: vendor
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the vendor whose items
      are being retrieved. Must be a valid pointer to a creature with vendor functionality
      enabled.
  returns: Returns an integer indicating the total count of items available for purchase
    from the specified vendor. A return value of zero indicates that no items are
    currently available, while a positive integer represents the number of items in
    the vendor's inventory.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vendor Item Retrieval
    code: "Creature* vendor = ...; // Assume this is initialized\nint itemCount =\
      \ vendorInteractionManager.GetVendorItems(vendor);\nif (itemCount > 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Proceed with displaying or processing vendor items\n    printf(\"Vendor\
      \ has %d items for sale\\n\", itemCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Vendor Items in a Trade Event
    code: "void OnGossipHello(Player* player, Creature* vendor)\n{\n    int itemLimit\
      \ = vendorInteractionManager.GetVendorItems(vendor);\n    if (itemLimit > 0)\n\
      \    {\n        // Build gossip menu based on vendor items\n        for (int\
      \ i = 0; i < itemLimit; ++i)\n        {\n            // Add item options to\
      \ gossip menu\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve database lookups or cached data access depending
    on the TrinityCore implementation. It is recommended to cache results when iterating
    through multiple vendor interactions to avoid repeated calls. The method assumes
    that the provided Creature pointer is valid and has been properly initialized
    with vendor data.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the vendor parameter will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crash. Always validate that the Creature object represents an actual
    vendor before calling this method. Additionally, the returned item count may not
    reflect real-time inventory changes if caching is enabled.
