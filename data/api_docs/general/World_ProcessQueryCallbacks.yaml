documentation:
  brief: Processes pending database query callbacks in the world context
  description: The ProcessQueryCallbacks method handles execution of deferred database
    query results that have been queued for processing. This method is typically invoked
    during the game loop to ensure asynchronous database operations complete and their
    results are properly handled. It manages callback execution for various world-related
    database queries such as player data retrieval, configuration loading, and other
    background database tasks. The method ensures thread safety by processing callbacks
    in a controlled manner within the main game thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void World::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    ProcessQueryCallbacks();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the main game loop to prevent query
    callback queues from growing indefinitely. It's designed to be lightweight and
    non-blocking, processing only ready callbacks without waiting for database operations
    to complete.
