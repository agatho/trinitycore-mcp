  class: BotMovementUtil
  method: MoveToPosition
  signature: bool BotMovementUtil::MoveToPosition(int * bot, const int & destination,
    int pointId, float minDistanceChange)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a bot movement to a specified position with optional point ID and
    minimum distance threshold.
  description: The MoveToPosition method instructs a bot to navigate towards a given
    destination coordinate. It utilizes internal pathfinding and movement logic to
    guide the bot from its current location to the target position. The method supports
    specifying a point identifier for waypoint-based navigation and allows setting
    a minimum distance change threshold to determine when the bot has reached the
    destination. This function is typically used in AI scripts or bot control systems
    within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot's identifier or handle.
      Must be a valid reference to an active bot instance.
  - name: destination
    description: Reference to an integer representing the destination coordinate or
      target point ID. Should correspond to a valid location in the game world.
  - name: pointId
    description: Integer identifier for a specific navigation point or waypoint. May
      be used for path following or complex movement patterns.
  - name: minDistanceChange
    description: Floating-point value indicating the minimum distance threshold (in
      yards) required to consider the bot as having reached its destination.
  returns: Returns true if the bot successfully begins movement towards the specified
    position; otherwise returns false if movement initiation fails due to invalid
    parameters or other errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Movement
    code: "int botId = 12345;\nint destPoint = 67890;\nbool success = BotMovementUtil::MoveToPosition(&botId,\
      \ destPoint, 0, 1.0f);\nif (success) {\n    // Movement started successfully\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Waypoint Navigation
    code: "int botId = 54321;\nint waypointId = 98765;\nfloat threshold = 0.5f;\n\
      bool result = BotMovementUtil::MoveToPosition(&botId, waypointId, 10, threshold);\n\
      if (result) {\n    // Bot will move to waypoint with a precision of 0.5 yards\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot is already initialized and active within
    the TrinityCore environment. The destination parameter should map to valid coordinates
    or point identifiers in the game world. Movement behavior may be affected by terrain,
    obstacles, or AI settings.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot pointer is valid before calling this function to prevent
    undefined behavior. Passing invalid destination values or negative threshold values
    might lead to unexpected movement behavior or failure.
