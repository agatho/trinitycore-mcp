  class: AzeriteItem
  method: GetSelectedAzeriteEssences
  signature: const int * AzeriteItem::GetSelectedAzeriteEssences() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the array of selected Azerite essences associated with the item.
  description: The GetSelectedAzeriteEssences method returns a constant pointer to
    an array of integers representing the IDs of Azerite essences currently selected
    on the Azerite item. This method provides access to the active essence configuration
    for the item, which affects the item's properties and abilities in World of Warcraft.
    The returned array is managed internally by the AzeriteItem class and should not
    be modified directly. The method does not perform any validation or sanity checks
    on the data, so callers should ensure that the AzeriteItem instance is valid before
    calling this method.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to an array of integers representing the IDs of selected
    Azerite essences. Returns nullptr if no essences are selected or if the item is
    not a valid Azerite item.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and iterate over selected Azerite essences
    code: "AzeriteItem* item = player->GetItemByEntry(12345);\nif (item)\n{\n    const\
      \ int* essences = item->GetSelectedAzeriteEssences();\n    if (essences)\n \
      \   {\n        for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) // Assuming max 5 essences\n    \
      \    {\n            if (essences[i] != 0)\n                std::cout << \"Essence\
      \ ID: \" << essences[i] << std::endl;\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned array is not a copy but a direct reference to internal data.
    Modifying the contents of this array will directly affect the Azerite item's state.
    The method assumes that the AzeriteItem instance has been properly initialized
    and contains valid essence data.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned array as it directly references internal data.
    Calling this method on an invalid or uninitialized AzeriteItem may result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the item is a valid Azerite item before calling this method
    to avoid potential crashes or incorrect data access.
