  class: InstanceLock
  method: GetDifficultyId
  signature: Difficulty InstanceLock::GetDifficultyId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the difficulty identifier associated with the instance lock.
  description: The GetDifficultyId method returns the Difficulty enumeration value
    that represents the difficulty level of the locked instance. This is typically
    used in World of Warcraft's instance locking system to determine what difficulty
    mode a player is locked into when entering a dungeon or raid. The returned value
    corresponds to standard WoW difficulty levels such as Normal, Heroic, Mythic,
    etc., and is essential for determining access permissions and loot distribution
    within locked instances.
  parameters: []
  returns: A Difficulty enumeration value representing the difficulty level of the
    instance lock. Possible values include DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_NORMAL, DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_HEROIC,
    DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_MYTHIC, etc., depending on the game's current difficulty settings
    and instance type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "InstanceLock* lock = player->GetInstanceLock();\nDifficulty diff = lock->GetDifficultyId();\n\
      if (diff == DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_HEROIC)\n{\n    // Handle heroic difficulty logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Difficulty Before Access
    code: "InstanceLock* lock = player->GetInstanceLock();\nDifficulty diff = lock->GetDifficultyId();\n\
      switch (diff)\n{\n    case DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_NORMAL:\n        // Allow normal\
      \ difficulty access\n        break;\n    case DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_HEROIC:\n \
      \       // Check if player has heroic key\n        break;\n    default:\n  \
      \      // Handle unknown difficulty\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called on instance lock objects that have already
    been initialized and contain valid difficulty data. The returned Difficulty value
    should not be modified directly as it's a read-only property of the lock. In TrinityCore,
    this value is usually set during the initial instance creation or when a player
    enters a locked instance.
  warnings: Ensure that the InstanceLock object is valid before calling this method,
    as calling it on an uninitialized or destroyed lock may result in undefined behavior.
    The Difficulty enumeration values are dependent on the game's current difficulty
    settings and may vary between different TrinityCore builds or custom configurations.
