documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of combo points last consumed by the player
  description: The GetLastConsumedPoints method retrieves the count of combo points
    that were most recently consumed by the player's actions. This value is typically
    updated when a player spends combo points on abilities such as finishers or other
    combo point-consuming skills. The returned value represents the quantity of combo
    points used in the last successful consumption event, which can be useful for
    tracking player progression, validating actions, or implementing game mechanics
    that depend on recent combo point usage.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of combo points consumed in the
    most recent action. Returns 0 if no combo points have been consumed yet or if
    the system has not recorded a consumption event.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Recent Combo Point Consumption
    code: "uint32 lastConsumed = player->GetComboPointSystem()->GetLastConsumedPoints();\n\
      if (lastConsumed > 0)\n{\n    // Player recently consumed combo points\n   \
      \ ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"You consumed %u combo\
      \ points.\", lastConsumed);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with combo point tracking systems
    and should be called after a combo point-consuming action has occurred. The value
    may reset or update depending on the game's internal logic for handling combo
    point consumption events.
