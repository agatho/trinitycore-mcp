  brief: Initializes adaptive difficulty settings for the game world
  description: The AdaptiveDifficulty::AdaptiveDifficulty constructor initializes
    the adaptive difficulty system within the TrinityCore framework. This method sets
    up internal configurations and data structures necessary for dynamically adjusting
    enemy difficulty based on player performance, group composition, and other gameplay
    factors. The system typically monitors player levels, experience gains, and kill
    counts to modify mob stats, loot drops, and encounter challenges in real-time.
    It integrates with the core WorldObject and Player systems to ensure seamless
    difficulty scaling without disrupting normal gameplay flow.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'AdaptiveDifficulty adaptiveDiff;

      // Constructor automatically initializes the system

      adaptiveDiff.AdaptiveDifficulty(); // No parameters required'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during server startup or world initialization.
    The adaptive difficulty system requires proper configuration files and database
    entries to function correctly. It's designed to be thread-safe as it's usually
    initialized once during server boot.
  warnings: Improper initialization may lead to unexpected difficulty scaling behavior
    or performance issues. Ensure that all required configuration settings are properly
    loaded before calling this constructor.
