documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the player in the who list
  description: The GetGuid method retrieves the globally unique identifier associated
    with a specific player entry within the WhoListPlayerInfo class. This GUID is
    used internally by TrinityCore to uniquely identify game objects, including players,
    across the entire world. The returned value represents the player's database ID
    and is essential for various game mechanics such as tracking player status, managing
    relationships between entities, and performing lookups in the server's object
    manager. This method is typically called when processing who list responses or
    when iterating through online player information.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the player.
    This GUID corresponds to the player's entry in the database and serves as a stable
    reference for identifying the player throughout the game session.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve GUID from WhoListPlayerInfo
    code: 'WhoListPlayerInfo playerInfo;

      // Assume playerInfo has been populated with valid data

      int guid = playerInfo.GetGuid();

      std::cout << "Player GUID: " << guid << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned GUID is typically a 32-bit integer that maps directly to the
    player's entry in the database. This method does not perform any validation or
    error checking on the internal state of the WhoListPlayerInfo object, so it should
    only be called when the object is guaranteed to contain valid data.
