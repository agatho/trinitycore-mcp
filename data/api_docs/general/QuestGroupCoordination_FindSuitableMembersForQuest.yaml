api:
  class: QuestGroupCoordination
  method: FindSuitableMembersForQuest
  signature: int QuestGroupCoordination::FindSuitableMembersForQuest(uint32 questId,
    uint32 requesterLevel)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the number of group members suitable for a specified quest
    based on level requirements.
  description: The FindSuitableMembersForQuest method evaluates the current group
    members to determine how many are eligible to accept and complete a given quest.
    It takes into account the requester's level and compares it against the quest's
    level requirements, ensuring that only players whose levels fall within the acceptable
    range for the quest are considered suitable. This method is typically used in
    quest coordination systems where group dynamics affect quest availability or rewards.
    The method does not modify any state but returns a count of qualifying members.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to check eligibility for. Must
      correspond to a valid quest in the database.
  - name: requesterLevel
    description: The level of the player requesting the quest. Used as a reference
      point to determine if group members meet the quest's level requirements.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of group members who are suitable
    for accepting and completing the specified quest. A value of zero indicates no
    suitable members were found, while a positive integer reflects the count of eligible
    players.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check group eligibility
    code: "uint32 questId = 12345;\nuint32 requesterLevel = 60;\nint suitableMembers\
      \ = groupCoordination->FindSuitableMembersForQuest(questId, requesterLevel);\n\
      if (suitableMembers > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with quest assignment\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group context is already established and that
    the QuestGroupCoordination object has access to the current player's group information.
    It relies on internal quest and player level validation logic, which may vary
    depending on TrinityCore's version and configuration.
  warnings: Ensure that the questId provided corresponds to an existing quest in the
    database; otherwise, behavior is undefined. Also, this method should not be called
    outside of a valid group context as it depends on group member data.
