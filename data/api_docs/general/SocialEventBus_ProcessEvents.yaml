  class: SocialEventBus
  method: ProcessEvents
  signature: uint32 SocialEventBus::ProcessEvents(uint32 diff, uint32 maxEvents)
documentation:
  brief: Processes pending social events in the event bus up to a specified limit
  description: The ProcessEvents method iterates through queued social events and
    executes them based on their type and timing. It is typically called during the
    game loop to handle time-based social interactions such as friend requests, guild
    invitations, or other player-to-player communications. The method respects a maximum
    event count to prevent performance degradation by limiting how many events are
    processed per tick. Events are removed from the queue after successful processing.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: Time elapsed since last call in milliseconds, used to determine event
      timing and execution
  - name: maxEvents
    description: Maximum number of events to process in this invocation; prevents
      excessive processing overhead
  returns: Returns the actual number of events processed during this call, which may
    be less than maxEvents if fewer were queued or if processing was limited by internal
    constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: 'uint32 processed = sSocialEventBus->ProcessEvents(diff, 100);

      // Processes up to 100 events with time delta ''diff'''
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance-Conscious Event Handling
    code: "uint32 diff = getMSTime();\nuint32 processed = sSocialEventBus->ProcessEvents(diff,\
      \ 50);\nif (processed > 40) {\n    // Log warning: high event load detected\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called regularly from the main game loop. It's
    important to pass accurate time deltas (diff) for proper event timing. The internal
    queue management ensures that events are not duplicated or skipped unless explicitly
    handled by the event system.
  warnings: Do not call this method with a maxEvents value of zero, as it may cause
    unexpected behavior or infinite loops in certain implementations. Also, ensure
    diff is always non-negative to avoid incorrect event scheduling.
