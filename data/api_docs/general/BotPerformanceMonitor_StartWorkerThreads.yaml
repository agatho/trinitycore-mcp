  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: StartWorkerThreads
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::StartWorkerThreads()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and starts worker threads for monitoring bot performance in the
    TrinityCore server.
  description: The StartWorkerThreads method initializes and launches background worker
    threads that are responsible for collecting, processing, and reporting performance
    metrics related to AI-controlled bots within the World of Warcraft emulation environment.
    This method typically sets up thread pools or individual threads that monitor
    various aspects such as bot response times, resource usage, and gameplay behavior.
    The monitoring is essential for maintaining server stability and ensuring that
    bot behaviors do not negatively impact overall game performance. It should be
    called during server initialization or when enabling bot performance monitoring
    functionality.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      monitor.StartWorkerThreads();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked once during server startup or when enabling
    bot monitoring features. It may spawn multiple threads depending on configuration
    settings and system resources. The worker threads are designed to run asynchronously
    to avoid blocking the main game loop.
