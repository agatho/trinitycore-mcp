documentation:
  brief: Returns the source item count for a quest
  description: This method retrieves the number of items required to complete a specific
    quest. It is used to determine how many of a particular item are needed to be
    collected or consumed during quest completion. The method is typically called
    when checking quest requirements or when handling quest-related item interactions
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework. This information is essential for
    proper quest progression and validation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Represents the count of source items required for the quest, which can
    be zero if no items are needed or a positive integer if items are required. Returns
    0 when the quest has no source item requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 itemCount = quest->GetSrcItemCount();\nif (itemCount > 0)\n{\n \
      \   // Quest requires items\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No items required for quest\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely accesses internal quest data
    structures to retrieve item count information. Performance considerations: The
    method should be fast as it''s typically called during quest validation and processing,
    but may involve database lookups depending on how the quest data is stored.'
  warnings: This method should not be used directly in quest completion logic without
    proper validation. It's important to understand that the returned value represents
    the required count of items needed for quest completion, not necessarily the actual
    inventory count.
