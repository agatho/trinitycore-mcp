documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell effect is positive.
  description: This method checks if a specific spell effect is classified as positive,
    which affects how the spell interacts with target's buffs and debuffs. It evaluates
    the effect type based on the spell's properties and returns true if the effect
    is considered positive, false otherwise. The method is commonly used in spell
    handling logic to determine whether an effect should be applied to a target or
    if it should be treated as a negative effect.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell effect is positive, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (spellInfo->IsPositiveEffect(0)) {\n    // Effect is positive\n}\nelse\
      \ {\n    // Effect is negative\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spell data structures and may not be directly
    accessible in all contexts. The implementation typically checks against predefined
    effect types and their classification as positive or negative.
  warnings: This method should only be used when the spell effect index is valid;
    using invalid indices can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
