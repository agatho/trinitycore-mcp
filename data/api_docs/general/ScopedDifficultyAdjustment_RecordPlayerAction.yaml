  class: ScopedDifficultyAdjustment
  method: RecordPlayerAction
  signature: void ScopedDifficultyAdjustment::RecordPlayerAction(bool successful,
    float reactionTime)
documentation:
  brief: Records a player's action with success status and reaction time for difficulty
    adjustment calculations.
  description: The RecordPlayerAction method logs a player's interaction within the
    game world, capturing whether the action was successful and the time taken to
    react. This data is used by the ScopedDifficultyAdjustment class to dynamically
    adjust game difficulty based on player performance. The method does not return
    any value but updates internal tracking mechanisms that influence future difficulty
    scaling decisions. It is typically called during gameplay events such as combat
    encounters, quest completions, or other interactive scenarios where player response
    time and success rate are relevant metrics.
  parameters:
  - name: successful
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the player's action was successful
      (true) or failed (false). This determines how the difficulty adjustment algorithm
      weights the player's performance.
  - name: reactionTime
    description: Float value representing the time in seconds between when an event
      occurred and when the player responded. Used to calculate performance metrics
      for dynamic difficulty adjustment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Scenario
    code: "void Player::HandleCombatAction(bool isSuccessful)\n{\n    float reactionTime\
      \ = GetReactionTime();\n    difficultyAdjustment.RecordPlayerAction(isSuccessful,\
      \ reactionTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple Actions
    code: "void Player::ProcessPlayerActions()\n{\n    // Record multiple actions\
      \ during a complex encounter\n    for (const auto& action : playerActions)\n\
      \    {\n        difficultyAdjustment.RecordPlayerAction(action.successful, action.reactionTime);\n\
      \    }\n    // Apply difficulty adjustments based on cumulative data\n    difficultyAdjustment.ApplyAdjustments();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a dynamic difficulty system that adjusts game challenges
    in real-time. It's important to note that reaction times are measured from the
    moment an event occurs to when the player responds, which may include input lag
    and processing delays. The class likely maintains internal statistics for calculating
    average reaction times and success rates over time windows.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect difficulty adjustments.
    Ensure that reactionTime values are accurate and that successful flags reflect
    true player performance rather than artificial manipulation. Calling this method
    too frequently without proper batching may impact performance in high-frequency
    scenarios.
