  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: IsPositionAccessible
  signature: bool LineOfSightManager::IsPositionAccessible(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given position is accessible within the game world's
    line of sight system.
  description: The IsPositionAccessible method evaluates whether a specified position
    in the game world is reachable and visible from the current perspective, taking
    into account obstacles such as walls, terrain, and other solid objects. This function
    is commonly used by AI systems, pathfinding algorithms, and gameplay mechanics
    that require checking if an object or character can see or reach a particular
    location. It performs a raycast or similar visibility check to determine if there
    are any blocking elements between the reference point and the target position.
    The method typically returns true if the position is accessible (i.e., no solid
    obstacles block the path) and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: A reference to an integer representing a position identifier or index
      within the LineOfSightManager's internal data structure. This parameter likely
      refers to a specific location in the world, such as a node in a navigation mesh
      or a coordinate pair encoded into an integer value.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is accessible and unobstructed by
    solid objects; returns false if there is an obstacle blocking access to that position.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (lineOfSightManager.IsPositionAccessible(targetPositionId)) {\n    //\
      \ Proceed with attack or movement toward target\n    player->MoveTo(targetPosition);\n\
      } else {\n    // Find alternative path or wait\n    player->WaitForClearPath();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking multiple positions for accessibility
    code: "std::vector<int> potentialTargets = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nfor (int posId\
      \ : potentialTargets) {\n    if (lineOfSightManager.IsPositionAccessible(posId))\
      \ {\n        std::cout << \"Position \" << posId << \" is accessible\\n\";\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve performance-intensive calculations depending on the
    underlying implementation, especially when dealing with complex terrain or numerous
    obstacles. It should be used judiciously in performance-critical sections of code
    such as AI update loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the position identifier passed to this function is valid and
    corresponds to a known location within the LineOfSightManager's data structures;
    invalid identifiers may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
