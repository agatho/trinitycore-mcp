  class: Unit
  method: GetMinPower
  signature: int32 Unit::GetMinPower(int power) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the minimum power value for a specified power type.
  description: This method retrieves the minimum power value associated with a specific
    power type for the unit. It is commonly used to determine the minimum amount of
    power required to perform actions or spells, particularly in relation to mana,
    rage, energy, or other power types. The method returns an integer value representing
    the minimum power threshold for the specified power type, which can vary based
    on the unit's level, class, and other game mechanics. This functionality is essential
    for determining valid power requirements in gameplay contexts such as spell casting
    or ability usage.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int32 value representing the minimum power required for the
    specified power type. The value can be zero or positive, depending on the unit's
    characteristics and power type. A return value of zero indicates no minimum power
    requirement exists for that power type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int32 minPower = unit->GetMinPower(PowerType::POWER_MANA);\nif (minPower\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Perform actions requiring mana\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other power-related functions
    to determine whether a unit has sufficient power to perform certain actions. It
    is often part of the broader power management system within TrinityCore's game
    mechanics.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method, as incorrect power values
    may lead to invalid gameplay behavior or unexpected results during spell casting
    or ability usage.
