  class: ComplaintTicket
  method: SetReportType
  signature: void ComplaintTicket::SetReportType(ReportType reportType)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the report type for a complaint ticket, defining the category of the
    issue being reported.
  description: The SetReportType method assigns a specific report type to a ComplaintTicket
    instance, determining the nature of the complaint being filed. This method is
    typically used within the TrinityCore framework to categorize player-reported
    issues such as cheating, harassment, or game bugs. The report type influences
    how the ticket is processed and routed within the game's support system. This
    method does not validate the input value against predefined constants but directly
    assigns the provided ReportType enum value to the internal ticket state.
  parameters:
  - name: reportType
    description: The ReportType enum value indicating the category of the complaint
      being reported. Valid values typically include types like CHEATING, HARASSMENT,
      GAME_BUG, or OTHER.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a cheating report type
    code: 'ComplaintTicket* ticket = new ComplaintTicket();

      ticket->SetReportType(ReportType::CHEATING);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Assigning a game bug report type
    code: "ComplaintTicket* ticket = sComplaintMgr->GetTicket(playerGuid);\nif (ticket)\n\
      {\n    ticket->SetReportType(ReportType::GAME_BUG);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the ComplaintTicket object
    and should be called before the ticket is submitted or processed. The ReportType
    enum values are defined within the TrinityCore codebase and may vary depending
    on the specific version and configuration.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the ticket object
    may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the reportType parameter is a valid
    enum value from the ReportType enumeration to avoid unexpected issues in the complaint
    handling system.
