  class: AuraEffect
  method: HandleAuraModRegenInterrupt
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleAuraModRegenInterrupt(const AuraApplication *
    aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the rate at which a unit's power regenerates during spell casting
    interrupts.
  description: The HandleAuraModRegenInterrupt method adjusts how quickly a unit's
    power (such as mana or energy) regenerates while casting spells, particularly
    when those casts are interrupted. This functionality is commonly used by effects
    that modify regeneration rates during combat or specific magical states. The method
    is invoked internally by the aura application system and modifies the target's
    power regeneration behavior based on the provided aura application context and
    activation mode. It ensures that the change in regeneration rate is applied or
    removed according to whether the aura is being applied or removed from the unit.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. This provides context about which aura and target are affected.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation, typically indicating whether the effect is
      being applied (1) or removed (0). Controls the direction of the power regeneration
      adjustment.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the aura is being applied (true) or removed
      (false). Used to determine the direction of the modification.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying a Regen Interrupt Aura Effect
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication app;

      uint8 mode = 1;

      bool apply = true;

      effect->HandleAuraModRegenInterrupt(&app, mode, apply);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing a Regen Interrupt Aura Effect
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication app;

      uint8 mode = 0;

      bool apply = false;

      effect->HandleAuraModRegenInterrupt(&app, mode, apply);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal aura handling system in TrinityCore and
    should not be called directly by external code. It interacts with the unit's power
    regeneration system to adjust rates during spell casting interruptions, which
    can significantly affect gameplay balance for abilities that rely on power management.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method may lead to incorrect power regeneration
    behavior or unexpected interactions with other auras. This function modifies core
    game mechanics and should only be used within the context of aura application
    logic.
