  method: StartRapidFire
  signature: void MarksmanshipCastManager::StartRapidFire()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the Rapid Fire ability for a marksman character, applying damage
    and speed bonuses to their ranged attacks.
  description: The StartRapidFire method activates the Rapid Fire spell effect for
    a marksman class player. This ability increases the attack speed of ranged weapons
    and grants a temporary damage boost to all ranged attacks. The method typically
    handles the application of necessary buffs, updates combat state, and manages
    cooldowns associated with the ability. It is designed to be called during the
    execution of a marksman's spell casting sequence when the Rapid Fire ability is
    triggered. The effect usually lasts for a fixed duration and may stack with other
    similar effects depending on game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat
    code: 'MarksmanshipCastManager* castManager = player->GetSpellManager();

      castManager->StartRapidFire();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies the player's attack speed and damage multipliers
    for ranged weapons during its active duration. It may also trigger visual effects
    or particle systems to indicate the ability activation. The implementation might
    involve checking if the player has sufficient mana or meets other prerequisites
    before applying the effect.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context (e.g., outside of combat or
    without a valid marksman class) may lead to undefined behavior or failed spell
    execution. Ensure that the player character is properly initialized and in a valid
    state before invoking this function.
