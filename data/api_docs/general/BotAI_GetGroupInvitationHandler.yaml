  class: BotAI
  method: GetGroupInvitationHandler
  signature: const GroupInvitationHandler * BotAI::GetGroupInvitationHandler() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the group invitation handler associated with this bot AI instance.
  description: The GetGroupInvitationHandler method retrieves a constant pointer to
    the GroupInvitationHandler object that manages group invitations for the bot AI.
    This handler is responsible for processing incoming group invitations, managing
    invitation states, and coordinating bot participation in groups. The returned
    pointer is valid only during the lifetime of the BotAI instance and should not
    be stored or used beyond its scope. This method is typically used internally by
    the AI system to determine how to respond to group-related events or to access
    group invitation logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to the GroupInvitationHandler object associated with
    this bot AI. Returns nullptr if no handler has been initialized or if the bot
    AI instance is in an invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const GroupInvitationHandler* handler = botAI->GetGroupInvitationHandler();\n\
      if (handler)\n{\n    // Use the handler to manage group invitations\n    handler->HandleInvitation(inviteData);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Handler Validity
    code: "const GroupInvitationHandler* handler = botAI->GetGroupInvitationHandler();\n\
      if (handler != nullptr)\n{\n    // Proceed with group invitation logic\n   \
      \ LOG_DEBUG(\"ai.bot\", \"Bot AI has group invitation handler: {}\", handler);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case where no handler is available\n    LOG_ERROR(\"\
      ai.bot\", \"No group invitation handler found for bot AI\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned GroupInvitationHandler pointer should not be deleted or modified
    directly. It's managed by the BotAI instance and represents a component of the
    broader AI system's invitation handling infrastructure.
  warnings: Do not store the returned pointer beyond the lifetime of the BotAI object,
    as it may become invalid. Accessing the handler after the BotAI has been destroyed
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
