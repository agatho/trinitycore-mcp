  class: Battleground
  method: _ProcessPlayerPositionBroadcast
  signature: void Battleground::_ProcessPlayerPositionBroadcast(int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and broadcasts updated player positions within the battleground.
  description: The _ProcessPlayerPositionBroadcast method handles the internal logic
    for updating and synchronizing player positions across all clients in a battleground.
    This method is typically invoked during battleground updates to ensure that player
    locations are accurately reflected in real-time. It processes positional data
    differences and sends relevant updates to maintain synchronization between server
    state and client views. The method operates on a time-based diff parameter to
    determine how much position data needs updating, making it an essential part of
    the battleground's real-time mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: Time difference in milliseconds since last update, used to calculate
      position interpolation and update frequency.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Battleground Update Loop
    code: "void Battleground::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other updates ...\n\
      \    _ProcessPlayerPositionBroadcast(diff);\n    // ... more updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is an internal helper function and should not be called directly
    by external code. It's designed to work in conjunction with the battleground's
    main update loop and relies on proper initialization of player data structures.
    The method performs position interpolation based on the diff value to maintain
    smooth client-side movement.
