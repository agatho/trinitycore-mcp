  class: PlayerbotResultSet
  method: PlayerbotResultSet
  signature: void PlayerbotResultSet::PlayerbotResultSet(int * result)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a PlayerbotResultSet object with the provided result integer
    value.
  description: The PlayerbotResultSet constructor initializes an instance of the PlayerbotResultSet
    class using an integer result parameter. This class is typically used within the
    TrinityCore AI system to encapsulate and manage the results of player bot actions
    or decisions. The constructor sets up internal state based on the input result,
    which may represent various outcomes such as success, failure, or specific action
    codes. The initialization process ensures that the object is properly configured
    for subsequent operations within the bot's decision-making framework.
  parameters:
  - name: result
    description: Pointer to an integer value representing the result of a player bot
      operation. This integer typically encodes specific outcomes or status codes
      that the bot system uses to determine next steps in its behavior logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Constructor Usage
    code: 'int botResult = 1;

      PlayerbotResultSet resultSet(&botResult);

      // Initializes a PlayerbotResultSet with result value 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Bot Action Results
    code: 'int actionResult = 0;

      PlayerbotResultSet* result = new PlayerbotResultSet(&actionResult);

      // Creates a result set for a successful bot action (0 typically means success)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely performs minimal initialization and relies on the
    integer pointed to by 'result' for its core functionality. The parameter is passed
    as a pointer, suggesting that the internal state may be updated or referenced
    later rather than copied immediately.
  warnings: The method accepts a pointer to an integer, so developers must ensure
    that the memory pointed to remains valid throughout the lifetime of the PlayerbotResultSet
    object. Passing a null pointer will likely cause undefined behavior.
