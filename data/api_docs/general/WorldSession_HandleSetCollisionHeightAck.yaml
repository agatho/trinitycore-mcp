documentation:
  brief: Processes a client's acknowledgment of a collision height change for a moving
    object
  description: The HandleSetCollisionHeightAck method is invoked when the client acknowledges
    a change in collision height for a moving object, typically used during movement
    updates. This method serves as a synchronization point between the client and
    server to confirm that the new collision height has been applied correctly. It
    ensures that the server's understanding of an object's physical dimensions matches
    what the client is rendering. The method does not perform any direct actions but
    rather acts as a confirmation handler for previously issued collision height adjustments.
  parameters:
  - name: setCollisionHeightAck
    description: A packet containing the acknowledgment data from the client about
      a previous collision height change request. This includes information about
      which object's collision height was modified and the new height value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in WorldSession
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSetCollisionHeightAck(WorldPackets::Movement::MoveSetCollisionHeightAck&\
      \ setCollisionHeightAck)\n{\n    // Acknowledge the client's receipt of collision\
      \ height change\n    // No additional processing required as this is a confirmation\
      \ only\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the movement synchronization system in TrinityCore.
    It is typically called automatically by the packet handling system when a MoveSetCollisionHeightAck
    packet is received from a client. The actual collision height change logic would
    have been executed prior to this acknowledgment.
