  class: SnapshotManager
  method: TakeSnapshot
  signature: void SnapshotManager::TakeSnapshot(uint32 spellId, int * target, int
    * caster)
documentation:
  brief: Captures a snapshot of spell-related target and caster values for processing.
  description: The TakeSnapshot method records the current state of target and caster
    parameters associated with a specific spell ID. This functionality is typically
    used in spell handling systems to preserve critical data points at the moment
    a spell is cast or processed. The captured values are stored internally for potential
    use in subsequent calculations, effects, or conditional logic within the spell's
    execution flow. The method does not directly modify the spell state but prepares
    data for later retrieval or application.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell being processed. This ID is used
      to associate the snapshot with a specific spell definition within the game's
      spell system.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target value associated with
      the spell. This could be a health value, position coordinate, or other relevant
      data point for the spell's target.
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the caster value associated with
      the spell. This might represent the caster's power level, attribute value, or
      other relevant data point for the spell's caster.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Snapshot Usage
    code: "void MySpellHandler::HandleSpellCast(uint32 spellId, Unit* target, Unit*\
      \ caster)\n{\n    int targetValue = target->GetHealth();\n    int casterValue\
      \ = caster->GetPower(POWER_MANA);\n    SnapshotManager::TakeSnapshot(spellId,\
      \ &targetValue, &casterValue);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger snapshot system that allows for consistent
    data capture during spell processing. It's important to ensure the target and
    caster pointers are valid before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the target and caster values pointed to by the parameters
    remain valid until the snapshot is fully processed. Invalid pointer access can
    lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.
