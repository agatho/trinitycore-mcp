  class: Quest
  method: GetQuestPackageID
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetQuestPackageID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the package ID associated with the quest.
  description: The GetQuestPackageID method retrieves the unique identifier that corresponds
    to a quest's package, which is used to categorize and organize quests within the
    game's quest system. This package ID helps determine how quests are grouped and
    displayed in the player's quest log, particularly for quests that belong to specific
    quest givers or quest lines. The method is typically used during quest processing
    and can be essential for understanding quest relationships and dependencies.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the quest package ID. This value corresponds
    to a unique identifier used by the game engine to categorize quests within the
    quest system, typically indicating which quest package or group the quest belongs
    to.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 packageID = quest->GetQuestPackageID();\nif (packageID > 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Process the package ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Quest class and is typically used in conjunction
    with other quest-related methods to determine quest relationships. It should be
    noted that package IDs may vary depending on the quest's source, and it's important
    to understand that this value does not necessarily represent a unique identifier
    for the quest itself but rather for its package.
  warnings: This method should only be used in contexts where quest package information
    is needed; using it without understanding the broader quest system can lead to
    incorrect assumptions about quest relationships. Also, if the quest has no package
    ID (i.e., returns 0), it may indicate that the quest is not part of a specific
    package group.
