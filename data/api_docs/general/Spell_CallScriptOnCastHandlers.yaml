  signature: void Spell::CallScriptOnCastHandlers()
documentation:
  brief: Invokes all registered script handlers for the spell's cast event.
  description: The CallScriptOnCastHandlers method executes all script callbacks that
    have been registered to handle the casting phase of a spell. This method is typically
    called during the spell execution process to allow custom scripts (such as those
    defined in SpellScripts or AI scripts) to modify or react to the spell being cast.
    It ensures that any scripted behavior associated with the spell's casting event
    is properly invoked, enabling modders and developers to extend default spell functionality
    through scripting without modifying core game logic. This method does not take
    any parameters and does not return a value.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Script
    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnCast()\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Custom logic here\n        GetSpell()->CallScriptOnCastHandlers();\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked internally by the core spell system during
    spell casting, but can also be manually called from custom scripts if needed.
    It should only be called when the spell object is fully initialized and has active
    script handlers registered.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a proper spell execution context may lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all required spell data and script
    handlers are initialized before invoking this method.
