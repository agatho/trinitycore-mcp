  method: Initialize
  signature: void HolyPowerSystem::Initialize(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the Holy Power system for a bot character
  description: The Initialize method sets up the Holy Power system state for a specified
    bot character. This method prepares the internal data structures and configurations
    needed for managing holy power mechanics, including initializing power values,
    setting up event listeners, and configuring system parameters. The method ensures
    that the bot is ready to utilize holy power abilities and maintain proper power
    tracking during gameplay. It should be called once during bot initialization before
    any holy power operations are performed.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot identifier or index in
      the system. This parameter specifies which bot instance should have its Holy
      Power system initialized.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'int botId = 5;

      HolyPowerSystem holyPowerSystem;

      holyPowerSystem.Initialize(&botId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization with Error Handling
    code: "int* botPtr = nullptr;\nHolyPowerSystem holyPowerSystem;\nif (botPtr !=\
      \ nullptr) {\n    holyPowerSystem.Initialize(botPtr);\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ invalid bot pointer\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per bot instance during initialization.
    Repeated calls may result in undefined behavior or system instability. The method
    assumes that the bot identifier is valid and corresponds to an existing bot in
    the system.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the bot parameter will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the bot pointer points to a valid, initialized
    bot structure before calling this method.
