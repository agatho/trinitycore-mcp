documentation:
  brief: Loads quest greeting locale data from the database into memory for localization
    support.
  description: The LoadQuestGreetingLocales method retrieves localized quest greeting
    text entries from the database and stores them in memory for use during quest
    interactions. This method is typically called during server startup or database
    reload operations to ensure that quest greetings are properly localized based
    on the player's locale settings. It processes data from the quest_greeting_locale
    table, which contains localized versions of quest start and end greeting messages.
    The loaded data is used by the core quest system when displaying quest-related
    text to players, enabling proper internationalization of quest content.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadDatabaseData()\n{\n    sObjectMgr->LoadQuestGreetingLocales();\n\
      \    // Other loading operations...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectMgr's database loading sequence and should
    only be called after the database connection is established. The loaded locale
    data is stored in internal lookup tables for fast access during quest interactions.
    This method does not perform any validation on the loaded data, relying on database
    constraints for data integrity.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    memory leaks or duplicate entries. It should only be invoked during initialization
    phases or when reloading localization data from the database.
