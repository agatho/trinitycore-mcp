  class: Battleground
  method: GetPvpStatIds
  signature: const int * Battleground::GetPvpStatIds() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns an array of PvP stat IDs associated with this battleground.
  description: The GetPvpStatIds method retrieves a constant pointer to an array of
    integer identifiers that represent various PvP statistics tracked during battleground
    sessions. These stat IDs are used internally by the TrinityCore framework to map
    and retrieve specific performance metrics for players participating in battlegrounds.
    The returned array is managed by the battleground instance and should not be modified
    or freed by callers. This method provides access to statistical data that can
    be used for reporting, scoring, or gameplay analytics within the context of PvP
    encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to an array of integers representing PvP stat IDs. The
    caller must not modify or free the memory pointed to by this return value. Returns
    nullptr if no PvP stats are defined for this battleground type.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing PvP Stat IDs for Logging
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);\nconst int*\
      \ statIds = bg->GetPvpStatIds();\nif (statIds != nullptr)\n{\n    for (int i\
      \ = 0; i < 10; ++i) // Assuming max 10 stats\n    {\n        if (statIds[i]\
      \ == 0) break;\n        std::cout << \"Stat ID: \" << statIds[i] << std::endl;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned array is guaranteed to be null-terminated or have a fixed size
    known to the caller. The method is thread-safe as it only reads from immutable
    data members of the battleground instance.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify or free the memory pointed to by the returned
    pointer. The array contents are managed internally and may change between calls
    if the battleground's configuration changes.
