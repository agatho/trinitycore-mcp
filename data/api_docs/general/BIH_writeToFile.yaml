documentation:
  brief: Writes the BIH (Bounding Interval Hierarchy) data structure to a file.
  description: The writeToFile method serializes the internal bounding interval hierarchy
    data structure to a specified file stream. This functionality is typically used
    for debugging, saving spatial data structures for later use, or exporting collision
    detection information. The method performs a binary write of the BIH's internal
    representation to the provided file handle. It returns true on successful write
    operation, false otherwise. The file must be opened in a mode that allows writing
    (e.g., 'wb' for binary write). This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's map
    and terrain loading systems where spatial data structures need to be persisted
    or analyzed.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the BIH data was successfully written to the file, false if the
    operation failed due to file I/O errors or other issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "FILE* file = fopen(\"bih_data.bin\", \"wb\");\nif (file && bih.writeToFile(file))\
      \ {\n    printf(\"BIH data written successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"\
      Failed to write BIH data\\n\");\n}\nclose(file);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct binary serialization of the internal BIH structure.
    The file must be opened in write mode before calling this method. The method assumes
    that the FILE pointer is valid and properly opened for writing. It's typically
    used during map loading or debugging sessions where spatial data needs to be preserved.
  warnings: Ensure that the FILE pointer passed to this method is valid and opened
    in write mode. Failure to do so will result in undefined behavior or file I/O
    errors. The method does not perform any validation on the file handle, so it's
    the caller's responsibility to ensure proper file handling.
