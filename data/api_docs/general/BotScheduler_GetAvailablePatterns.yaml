documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of available bot scheduling patterns configured in the
    system
  description: The GetAvailablePatterns method returns an integer value representing
    the total number of bot scheduling patterns that are currently available for use
    within the TrinityCore instance. This method is typically used by the BotScheduler
    class to determine how many different scheduling configurations can be applied
    to bot behavior. The returned count reflects the number of predefined patterns
    stored in memory, which may be loaded from configuration files or database entries.
    This value is essential for determining the range of scheduling options available
    when assigning patterns to specific bots or bot groups.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of available bot scheduling patterns.
    Returns 0 if no patterns are configured or loaded, and a positive integer indicating
    the count of valid patterns otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int patternCount = scheduler.GetAvailablePatterns();\nif (patternCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Available patterns: \" << patternCount << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Pattern Validation Example
    code: "BotScheduler scheduler;\nint available = scheduler.GetAvailablePatterns();\n\
      if (available > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with pattern assignment logic\n    for\
      \ (int i = 0; i < available; ++i)\n    {\n        // Use pattern index 'i' for\
      \ scheduling\n    }\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case where no patterns are available\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"No bot scheduling patterns configured\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple count operation and should have minimal performance
    impact. The returned value is typically cached or computed once during initialization,
    making repeated calls efficient. The method assumes that all patterns are already
    loaded into memory by the BotScheduler instance.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotScheduler instance has been properly initialized with
    patterns before calling this method. Calling this method on an uninitialized scheduler
    may return unexpected results or zero if no patterns have been loaded yet.
