  class: CreatureTemplate
  method: GetFirstValidModel
  signature: const CreatureModel * CreatureTemplate::GetFirstValidModel() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the first valid creature model associated with this creature template.
  description: The GetFirstValidModel method retrieves the initial creature model
    from a creature template's list of available models. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    each creature template can have multiple possible models defined in the database.
    This method returns the first model that is considered valid for use, which may
    be used for rendering the creature in-game or determining its visual appearance.
    The returned model pointer can be null if no valid models exist for the creature
    template. This functionality is essential for proper creature instantiation and
    visual representation within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the first valid CreatureModel associated with this creature
    template, or nullptr if no valid models are defined.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "CreatureTemplate* creatureTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetCreatureTemplate(12345);\n\
      const CreatureModel* model = creatureTemplate->GetFirstValidModel();\nif (model)\n\
      {\n    // Use the model for rendering or other operations\n    printf(\"First\
      \ valid model ID: %u\\n\", model->modelid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during creature creation and initialization.
    The returned CreatureModel pointer should not be modified directly as it's managed
    by the game's internal systems. Performance-wise, this operation is generally
    fast as it simply returns a cached or pre-processed model reference.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned pointer without checking for null
    values, as some creature templates may not have any valid models defined in the
    database. This can lead to crashes if not properly handled.
