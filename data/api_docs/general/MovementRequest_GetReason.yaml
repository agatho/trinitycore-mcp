  class: MovementRequest
  method: GetReason
  signature: const std::string & MovementRequest::GetReason() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the reason string associated with the movement request
  description: The GetReason method retrieves the descriptive reason why a movement
    request was initiated. This string typically contains information about the cause
    or purpose of the movement, such as 'player movement', 'NPC pathing', or 'teleportation'.
    The returned reference provides direct access to the internal reason string stored
    within the MovementRequest object, allowing callers to understand the context
    behind the movement operation without modifying the underlying data. This method
    is commonly used in debugging and logging scenarios to provide meaningful information
    about why a character or object is moving.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the reason for the movement
    request. The string is guaranteed to be valid and non-empty as long as the MovementRequest
    object has been properly initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MovementRequest request;

      // ... initialize request with some reason ...

      const std::string& reason = request.GetReason();

      std::cout << "Movement reason: " << reason << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Debug Logging
    code: "void LogMovement(const MovementRequest& req) {\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"movement\"\
      , \"Processing movement request: {}\", req.GetReason());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned string reference is valid only as long as the MovementRequest
    object remains in scope and has not been modified. This method does not perform
    any copying of the internal string data, making it efficient for read-only access.
    The reason string should be treated as immutable after construction.
