  brief: Dumps all registered aura event subscribers to the system log for debugging
    purposes.
  description: The DumpSubscribers method outputs a list of all currently registered
    subscribers to the AuraEventBus. This utility function is primarily used for debugging
    and development to inspect which components or systems are listening to aura-related
    events. The output includes information about each subscriber, such as their type,
    identifier, and registration details. It does not modify any state and is typically
    called during development or diagnostic sessions when examining event handling
    behavior in the TrinityCore framework.

    code. The output is directed to the system log, which may vary depending on the
    TrinityCore build configuration. It's useful when investigating unexpected aura
    behavior or event propagation issues.
