  class: BloodBoneShieldTracker
  method: NeedsRefresh
  signature: bool BloodBoneShieldTracker::NeedsRefresh() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the blood bone shield effect requires a refresh or update.
  description: The NeedsRefresh method evaluates the current state of the blood bone
    shield buff to determine if it needs to be refreshed or re-applied. This typically
    occurs when the shield's duration is nearing expiration, its visual effects need
    updating, or its underlying mechanics require reapplication. The method checks
    internal timers, buff states, and game mechanics to make this determination. It
    is commonly used in combat systems where buffs have limited durations and must
    be periodically renewed to maintain their effectiveness.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the blood bone shield effect requires a refresh or update;
    otherwise returns false if the effect is still active and valid.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if Shield Needs Refresh
    code: "if (bloodBoneShieldTracker.NeedsRefresh()) {\n    // Apply or refresh the\
      \ blood bone shield effect\n    player.ApplyBloodBoneShield();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Combat Loop
    code: "void UpdateCombatState() {\n    if (bloodBoneShieldTracker.NeedsRefresh())\
      \ {\n        bloodBoneShieldTracker.Refresh();\n        // Log shield refresh\
      \ event\n        LOG_DEBUG(\"Player shield refreshed at {}\", GetGameTime());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat updates or periodic tick events.
    The implementation likely involves checking internal cooldown timers, buff expiration
    times, and visual effect states to make the determination.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat update contexts as it may cause
    unnecessary performance overhead. The return value should be used to conditionally
    refresh effects rather than refreshing unconditionally.
