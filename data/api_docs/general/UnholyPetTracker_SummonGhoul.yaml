documentation:
  brief: Summons a ghoul pet for the player's unholy death knight specialization.
  description: The SummonGhoul method creates and activates a ghoul pet associated
    with the player's unholy death knight class. This pet is summoned as part of the
    death knight's ability to command undead minions. The method typically handles
    the creation of the pet object, its placement in the world, and its initial state
    within the player's control. It is generally invoked when the player uses the
    Unholy Death Knight's ghoul summoning spell or ability. The summoned ghoul will
    follow standard behavior patterns for death knight pets, including attacking targets
    and providing support during combat.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "UnholyPetTracker* petTracker = player->GetUnholyPetTracker();\nif (petTracker)\n\
      {\n    petTracker->SummonGhoul();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's pet system and may require
    the player to be in an appropriate state (e.g., not already having a ghoul summoned).
    The actual pet creation process may involve server-side logic for spawning the
    creature, setting up AI behavior, and linking it to the player's control.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper checks may result in duplicate pet
    summoning or undefined behavior. Ensure that the player has the appropriate specialization
    and resources before invoking this method.
