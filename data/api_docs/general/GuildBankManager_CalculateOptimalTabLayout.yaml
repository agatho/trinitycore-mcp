  signature: void GuildBankManager::CalculateOptimalTabLayout(int * guild, int & layout)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the optimal layout for guild bank tabs based on item distribution
    and storage efficiency.
  description: The CalculateOptimalTabLayout method determines the most efficient
    arrangement of guild bank tabs to maximize storage utilization and minimize item
    fragmentation. This method analyzes the current item distribution within the guild
    bank, considering factors such as item types, stack sizes, and tab capacities.
    It computes an optimal configuration that minimizes the number of tabs required
    while ensuring all items can be stored efficiently. The result is typically used
    to optimize the guild bank's tab structure for better organization and access.
    This method may be invoked during guild bank initialization or when significant
    changes occur in the guild's item inventory.
  parameters:
  - name: guild
    description: Pointer to an integer array representing the guild's current bank
      tab configuration. The array contains tab-specific data including item counts,
      types, and storage states.
  - name: layout
    description: Reference to an integer variable that will store the calculated optimal
      tab layout configuration. This value represents the computed arrangement strategy
      for organizing items across guild bank tabs.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int guildTabs[10];

      int optimalLayout;

      // Initialize guildTabs with current bank data

      GuildBankManager bankManager;

      bankManager.CalculateOptimalTabLayout(guildTabs, optimalLayout);

      // Use optimalLayout to reorganize guild bank tabs'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal calculations involving item sorting
    algorithms and tab capacity optimization. It may be computationally intensive
    for large guild banks with many items. The method assumes valid input data in
    the guild parameter array and does not perform validation checks.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the guild parameter
    may lead to undefined behavior. The layout result should only be used after verifying
    that the current guild bank state matches the expected input format.
