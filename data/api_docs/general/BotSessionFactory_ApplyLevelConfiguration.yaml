  class: BotSessionFactory
  method: ApplyLevelConfiguration
  signature: void BotSessionFactory::ApplyLevelConfiguration(std::shared_ptr<BotSession>
    session, uint8 level)
documentation:
  brief: Configures a bot session's level and associated attributes based on the provided
    level value.
  description: The ApplyLevelConfiguration method adjusts a bot session's character
    properties, such as health, mana, stats, and abilities, to match the specified
    level. This ensures that the bot behaves appropriately for its designated level
    within the game environment. The method likely modifies internal session data
    structures to reflect the new level constraints and may trigger updates to the
    bot's AI behavior or combat capabilities. It is typically invoked during bot creation
    or level-up scenarios to maintain consistency with World of Warcraft's leveling
    mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: A shared pointer to the BotSession object that will have its configuration
      updated based on the provided level.
  - name: level
    description: The target level for the bot session, typically ranging from 1 to
      80 in World of Warcraft. Valid values are constrained by the game's maximum
      character level.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Level Configuration
    code: 'std::shared_ptr<BotSession> session = std::make_shared<BotSession>(playerGuid);

      botSessionFactory.ApplyLevelConfiguration(session, 60);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Level Adjustment
    code: 'uint8 newLevel = player->GetLevel();

      botSessionFactory.ApplyLevelConfiguration(botSession, newLevel);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal bot configuration tables or templates
    that define how character stats scale with level. It may also update the session's
    AI decision-making parameters to align with the new level range. Ensure that the
    provided level is valid and within acceptable bounds to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing an invalid level (e.g., below 1 or above maximum allowed level)
    may result in corrupted bot behavior or crashes. Always validate input levels
    before calling this method.
