  class: Player
  method: SetTitle
  signature: void Player::SetTitle(const CharTitlesEntry * title, bool lost)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's title to the specified CharTitlesEntry.
  description: The SetTitle method allows a player to change their current title to
    a new one by providing a reference to a CharTitlesEntry structure. This method
    is used primarily for managing player titles within the game, including both active
    and inactive titles. The method updates the player's title information in the
    database and sends appropriate updates to the client. When lost parameter is set
    to true, it indicates that the title has been lost or removed from the player's
    collection, which may affect how the title is displayed or handled internally.
  parameters:
  - name: title
    description: Pointer to a CharTitlesEntry structure that defines the new title
      to be set. This structure contains information about the title including its
      ID, name, and other relevant properties.
  - name: lost
    description: Boolean value indicating whether the title is being lost or removed
      from the player's collection. If true, the title is considered lost; if false,
      it is considered active.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a new title
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      CharTitlesEntry const* title = sCharTitlesStore.LookupEntry(10);

      player->SetTitle(title, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing a title
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      CharTitlesEntry const* title = sCharTitlesStore.LookupEntry(5);

      player->SetTitle(title, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method updates the player's title in both database and client-side data.
    It is important to note that this method does not directly update the title display
    on the client side; instead, it triggers a change in how the title is handled
    internally. The implementation may involve multiple internal calls to ensure proper
    title handling.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it can affect player's title display
    and potentially cause issues if title entries are not properly validated or if
    the lost parameter is incorrectly set. Improper use could lead to title inconsistencies
    in game data.
