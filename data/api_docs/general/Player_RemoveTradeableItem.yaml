documentation:
  brief: Removes a tradeable item from the player's inventory and updates the trade
    status.
  description: This method removes a tradeable item from the player's inventory, effectively
    removing it from the trade process. It is typically used when a player is trading
    items with another player or when an item is no longer available for trading.
    The method ensures that the item is properly removed from the player's inventory
    and updates the trade status accordingly. This function is crucial for maintaining
    proper game mechanics during trading operations and prevents potential exploits
    related to item trading.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: A pointer to the Item object that needs to be removed from the player's
      inventory. This parameter must not be null, as passing a null pointer would
      result in undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nItem* item = player->GetItemByGUID(12345);\n\
      if (item)\n{\n    player->RemoveTradeableItem(item);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the item is actually in the player's
    inventory and is marked as tradeable. It is recommended to check if the item exists
    before calling this function to avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method on an item that is not in the player's inventory may
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also, ensure that the item is properly
    marked as tradeable before calling this method.
