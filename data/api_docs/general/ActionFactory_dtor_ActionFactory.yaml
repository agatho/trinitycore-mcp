documentation:
  brief: Destroys an ActionFactory instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ActionFactory destructor is responsible for cleaning up any dynamically
    allocated memory or resources held by the ActionFactory instance. In TrinityCore's
    AI system, this typically involves releasing action objects, clearing internal
    data structures, and ensuring no memory leaks occur when the factory is no longer
    needed. This method is automatically invoked when an ActionFactory object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. The destructor ensures proper cleanup of
    any actions or resources that were created through this factory instance.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of ActionFactory
    code: 'ActionFactory* factory = new ActionFactory();

      // ... use the factory ...

      delete factory; // Triggers ~ActionFactory()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic destruction via stack allocation
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    ActionFactory factory;\n    // ... use factory\
      \ ...\n    // ~ActionFactory() called automatically when function exits\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a critical part of the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
    pattern in TrinityCore. It ensures that all resources allocated by the ActionFactory
    are properly released, preventing memory leaks. Developers should not manually
    call this destructor unless explicitly managing object lifetime.
  warnings: Do not call this destructor directly unless you're implementing custom
    memory management. The destructor should only be invoked through normal object
    destruction mechanisms (stack allocation, delete operator). Calling it manually
    can lead to undefined behavior or double-free errors.
