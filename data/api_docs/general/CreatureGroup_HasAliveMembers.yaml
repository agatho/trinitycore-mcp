  signature: bool CreatureGroup::HasAliveMembers() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the creature group contains any alive members.
  description: The HasAliveMembers method determines if there are any creatures within
    the creature group that are currently alive. This is a crucial utility function
    for AI behavior and group management in TrinityCore's creature system. The method
    iterates through all members of the group and evaluates their current health status
    to determine if at least one member remains alive. This functionality is commonly
    used in scripted creature behaviors, such as when deciding whether to continue
    a group attack, initiate a retreat, or trigger specific events based on group
    composition.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if at least one creature member in the group is alive, false
    otherwise. If the group contains no members at all, the method will return false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check group status
    code: "if (creatureGroup->HasAliveMembers())\n{\n    // Proceed with group-based\
      \ actions\n    creatureGroup->DoSomething();\n}\nelse\n{\n    // All members\
      \ are dead, handle accordingly\n    creatureGroup->HandleDeath();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI decision making
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override\n    {\n        if (me->GetGroup() && me->GetGroup()->HasAliveMembers())\n\
      \        {\n            // Continue group-based behavior\n            DoGroupBehavior();\n\
      \        }\n        else\n        {\n            // Group is depleted, switch\
      \ to solo behavior\n            DoSoloBehavior();\n        }\n    }\n};"

  notes: This method performs a linear scan of all group members and checks their
    health status. For groups with many members, this operation may have performance
    implications in high-frequency AI updates. The method does not account for creatures
    that are temporarily incapacitated but not dead - only those with zero or negative
    health are considered dead.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns false for empty groups (no members),
    which might be unexpected if you're checking for the presence of alive members
    in a group that was never populated. Always validate group membership before calling
    this method if your logic depends on non-empty groups.
