  class: BotCharacterSelector
  method: RecordSelection
  signature: void BotCharacterSelector::RecordSelection(uint64 durationMicroseconds,
    bool cacheHit)
documentation:
  brief: Records a character selection event with timing and cache hit information
    for bot behavior analysis.
  description: The RecordSelection method logs character selection data including
    the duration of the selection process and whether the selection was served from
    cache. This method is used within the BotCharacterSelector class to track performance
    metrics and caching effectiveness for bot character selection routines. The recorded
    data helps in optimizing bot behavior by identifying slow selections or frequently
    cached results. This method does not directly affect gameplay but provides valuable
    telemetry for debugging and performance tuning of automated character selection
    systems.
  parameters:
  - name: durationMicroseconds
    description: The time taken to complete the character selection process, measured
      in microseconds. This value indicates how long the bot took to select a character
      from the available options.
  - name: cacheHit
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the character selection was served
      from cache (true) or required a fresh lookup (false). This helps track caching
      efficiency of the selection system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage recording a character selection
    code: 'BotCharacterSelector selector;

      uint64 duration = 1500; // 1.5 milliseconds

      bool isCached = false;

      selector.RecordSelection(duration, isCached);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording a cached selection with timing data
    code: 'BotCharacterSelector selector;

      uint64 duration = 200; // 0.2 milliseconds

      bool isCached = true;

      selector.RecordSelection(duration, isCached);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the bot selection system after
    a character has been chosen. The recorded data may be used for statistical analysis
    or to adjust bot behavior based on performance patterns.
