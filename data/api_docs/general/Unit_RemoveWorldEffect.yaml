  signature: void Unit::RemoveWorldEffect(int32 worldEffectId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a world effect from the unit.
  description: This method removes a specific world effect identified by its worldEffectId
    from the Unit. It is used to manage the application and removal of various game
    effects such as buffs, debuffs, or visual effects that are applied to units. The
    method ensures that the specified world effect is properly removed from the unit's
    effect list, which may involve updating internal state tracking and potentially
    notifying clients about the change. This functionality is essential for managing
    game mechanics involving world effects in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: worldEffectId
    description: The unique identifier of the world effect to be removed. This value
      corresponds to a specific effect in the WorldEffect database table, typically
      representing a unique ID for buffs, debuffs, or visual effects applied to units.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetUnit();

      unit->RemoveWorldEffect(12345);

      // Removes world effect with ID 12345 from the unit'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include ensuring that the effect is properly removed
    from internal tracking systems and potentially updating visual state for clients.
    Performance considerations involve checking if the effect exists before attempting
    removal to avoid unnecessary processing.
  warnings: The method should be used carefully as removing world effects may affect
    gameplay mechanics, especially when dealing with buffs or debuffs that have specific
    conditions or durations. Incorrect usage could lead to unexpected behavior in
    game mechanics.
