  class: WarriorAI
  method: ConsumeResource
  signature: void WarriorAI::ConsumeResource(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes the specified resource required for a warrior's spell or ability.
  description: The ConsumeResource method is responsible for deducting the necessary
    resources (such as rage, energy, or focus) from a warrior's resource pool when
    executing a specific spell or ability. This method ensures that the warrior has
    sufficient resource levels before allowing the action to proceed, and it updates
    the internal state of the AI to reflect the consumed resources. It is typically
    invoked internally by the AI system when determining whether a warrior can perform
    an action based on their current resource availability.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell or ability for which the resource
      consumption is to be applied. This ID determines the specific resource cost
      and type required for the action.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Consumption
    code: "void WarriorAI::ExecuteSpell(uint32 spellId)\n{\n    if (CanCastSpell(spellId))\n\
      \    {\n        ConsumeResource(spellId);\n        DoCast(spellId);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the WarriorAI's internal resource management system
    and should be called before attempting to cast a spell or use an ability that
    requires resources. It assumes that the spell ID corresponds to a valid warrior
    ability with defined resource costs.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the warrior has sufficient
    resources may lead to incorrect behavior or errors in gameplay logic. Ensure that
    resource checks are performed prior to calling ConsumeResource.
