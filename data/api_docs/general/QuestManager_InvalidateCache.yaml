  signature: void QuestManager::InvalidateCache()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the internal quest cache to ensure subsequent quest queries reflect
    updated data.
  description: The InvalidateCache method clears the internal cache used by the QuestManager
    to store quest-related data. This ensures that any subsequent calls to quest retrieval
    methods will fetch fresh data from the database instead of using potentially stale
    cached values. This is particularly important in World of Warcraft TrinityCore
    when quest states, objectives, or rewards might have changed due to player actions,
    server updates, or quest progression modifications. The method does not take any
    parameters and performs no return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cache Invalidation
    code: 'QuestManager* questMgr = player->GetQuestManager();

      questMgr->InvalidateCache();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Cache Invalidation After Quest Completion
    code: "void OnQuestComplete(Player* player, uint32 questId) {\n    // Perform\
      \ quest completion logic\n    player->GetQuestManager()->InvalidateCache();\n\
      \    // Subsequent quest queries will now reflect updated state\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called sparingly as it forces a full cache refresh,
    which may impact performance if invoked frequently. It's typically used after
    significant quest modifications or when transitioning between different quest
    states.
  warnings: Calling InvalidateCache repeatedly in rapid succession can cause performance
    degradation due to unnecessary database reloads. It should only be used when absolutely
    necessary to ensure data consistency.
