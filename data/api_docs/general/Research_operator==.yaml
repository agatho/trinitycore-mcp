documentation:
  brief: Compares two Research objects for equality based on their internal data members.
  description: The operator== method performs a member-wise comparison between this
    Research object and another Research object provided as a parameter. It evaluates
    whether both objects contain identical data, typically used to determine if two
    research entries represent the same research item or have the same properties.
    This comparison is essential in scenarios where research data needs to be validated
    or matched against existing records. The method returns true if all relevant fields
    are equal and false otherwise. This functionality supports game mechanics such
    as preventing duplicate research entries or verifying research completion status.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The Research object to compare against this instance. Must be a valid
      Research object; passing an invalid or uninitialized object may lead to undefined
      behavior.
  returns: Returns true if all data members of the two Research objects are equal,
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Comparing Two Research Objects
    code: "Research research1;\nResearch research2;\n// Assume both objects are populated\
      \ with data\nbool isEqual = (research1 == research2);\nif (isEqual) {\n    //\
      \ Handle case where research entries are identical\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Equality in Research Validation
    code: "std::vector<Research> researchList;\nResearch newResearch;\n// Populate\
      \ newResearch with data\nbool exists = std::find(researchList.begin(), researchList.end(),\
      \ newResearch) != researchList.end();\nif (!exists) {\n    // Add new research\
      \ to list since it doesn't exist yet\n    researchList.push_back(newResearch);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented using member-wise comparison, which
    means that the equality check depends on how each data member of the Research
    class defines equality. If any data member uses a custom comparison (e.g., floating-point
    values with tolerance), those rules apply here as well.
  warnings: Ensure that the Research class properly implements the equality operator
    for all its members to avoid unexpected behavior during comparisons. When dealing
    with floating-point numbers or complex objects, consider potential precision issues
    that might affect equality checks.
