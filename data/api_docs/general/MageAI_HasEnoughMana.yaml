  class: MageAI
  method: HasEnoughMana
  signature: bool MageAI::HasEnoughMana(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the MageAI has sufficient mana to cast a spell with the specified
    mana cost.
  description: The HasEnoughMana method evaluates whether the current mage AI instance
    possesses enough mana to execute a spell requiring a specific amount of mana.
    This method is typically used during AI decision-making processes to determine
    spell viability before attempting to cast. It considers the AI's current mana
    pool and compares it against the required mana amount. The method does not modify
    any state and is purely a query operation.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The required mana amount needed to cast the spell. Must be a non-negative
      integer representing the mana cost in game units.
  returns: Returns true if the MageAI's current mana is greater than or equal to the
    specified amount, otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (mageAI->HasEnoughMana(50)) {\n    // Cast a spell that costs 50 mana\n\
      \    mageAI->CastSpell(SPELL_FIREBALL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spell Casting
    code: "uint32 requiredMana = GetSpellManaCost(SPELL_FROST_NOVA);\nif (mageAI->HasEnoughMana(requiredMana))\
      \ {\n    mageAI->CastSpell(SPELL_FROST_NOVA);\n} else {\n    // Switch to a\
      \ lower mana spell or wait\n    mageAI->CastSpell(SPELL_MAGIC_MISSILE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the MageAI instance has valid mana information and
    is properly initialized. It does not account for mana regeneration or temporary
    mana boosts from buffs or items.
  warnings: Ensure that the mana amount passed to this method is validated before
    calling, as negative values may lead to unexpected behavior in comparison logic.
