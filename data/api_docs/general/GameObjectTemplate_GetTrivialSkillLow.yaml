  method: GetTrivialSkillLow
  signature: uint32 GameObjectTemplate::GetTrivialSkillLow() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the low trivial skill requirement for the game object.
  description: The GetTrivialSkillLow method retrieves the minimum skill level required
    for a player to interact with or use the game object. This value is typically
    used in conjunction with the trivial skill high value to define a skill range.
    It's commonly associated with objects like mining nodes, herbalism plants, or
    other gatherable resources where players must meet certain skill thresholds to
    successfully interact with them. The returned value represents the lower bound
    of this skill requirement range.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the minimum skill level required to interact
    with this game object. Returns 0 if no trivial skill requirement is set for the
    object.
  examples:
  - title: Check Skill Requirement Before Interaction
    code: "GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(176234);\n\
      uint32 minSkill = goTemplate->GetTrivialSkillLow();\nif (minSkill > 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Player must have at least this skill level\n    sLog->outString(\"This\
      \ object requires at least %u skill to use.\", minSkill);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the GameObjectTemplate class and provides read-only
    access to a cached value from the database. The trivial skill values are typically
    defined in the gameobject_template table in the database, specifically in the
    'skill' column which represents the minimum skill level needed for interaction.
  warnings: The returned value may be zero, indicating no skill requirement exists
    for this object. Always check if the returned value is greater than zero before
    enforcing skill checks in gameplay logic.
