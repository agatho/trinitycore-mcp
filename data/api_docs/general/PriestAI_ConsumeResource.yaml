  class: PriestAI
  method: ConsumeResource
  signature: void PriestAI::ConsumeResource(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes resource associated with a specified spell for the priest AI.
  description: The ConsumeResource method is responsible for managing the resource
    consumption logic within the PriestAI class. It handles the deduction of mana
    or other resources required to cast a specific spell, ensuring proper resource
    management during AI-driven spell casting. This method typically interacts with
    the underlying player or creature's resource system to reduce available resources
    after a spell is cast. The implementation may include checks for sufficient resource
    levels and could trigger resource-related events or callbacks within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell for which resources should be
      consumed. This ID corresponds to entries in the Spell.dbc file and determines
      the specific resource cost and type.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Consumption
    code: "void MyPriestAI::OnSpellCast(int spellId)\n{\n    // Consume resources\
      \ for the cast spell\n    ConsumeResource(spellId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Resource Consumption
    code: "void PriestAI::HandleCombatAction()\n{\n    if (HasEnoughMana(spellId))\n\
      \    {\n        ConsumeResource(spellId);\n        CastSpell(spellId);\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system when a spell
    is about to be cast. Developers should ensure that the spell ID passed corresponds
    to an actual valid spell in the database, otherwise undefined behavior may occur.
    The method assumes proper initialization of the AI context and resource tracking
    systems.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying spell validity or sufficient resources
    may lead to incorrect resource depletion or game state inconsistencies. Ensure
    that all preconditions for resource consumption are met before invoking this method.
