  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: MoveToObjective
  signature: bool BattlegroundAI::MoveToObjective(int * player, const BGObjective
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Moves a player to a specified battleground objective position.
  description: The MoveToObjective method is used by BattlegroundAI to control player
    movement toward specific objectives within a battleground. This method typically
    handles pathfinding and positioning logic to ensure players are correctly placed
    relative to objectives such as flags, capture points, or other interactive elements.
    It may be invoked during battleground start-up, objective capture, or respawn
    scenarios. The method returns true if the movement was successfully initiated
    or completed, false otherwise. This functionality is critical for maintaining
    proper gameplay flow and ensuring that player actions align with battleground
    mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or index
      within the battleground context.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a BGObjective object that defines the target objective
      for movement, including its position and type.
  returns: Returns true if the player movement to the objective was successfully initiated
    or completed; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in battleground AI
    code: "if (bgAI->MoveToObjective(&playerId, objective)) {\n    // Movement successful\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Player moved to objective.\");\n} else {\n    // Movement\
      \ failed\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to move player to objective.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using MoveToObjective during objective capture
    code: "void BattlegroundAV::HandleObjectiveCapture(Player* player, uint32 objectiveId)\
      \ {\n    BGObjective* obj = GetObjective(objectiveId);\n    if (obj && !player->IsInWorld())\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    int playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      \    if (!MoveToObjective(&playerId, *obj)) {\n        sLog->outError(\"Failed\
      \ to move player %u to objective %u\", playerId, objectiveId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal pathfinding systems and may involve
    coordination with the game's movement engine. It is expected to be called from
    within the battleground AI update loop or in response to specific events like
    objective captures or player spawns.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer and objective reference are valid before
    calling this method, as invalid references can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    Also, note that this function may not guarantee immediate movement completion;
    it might initiate a movement sequence that occurs asynchronously.
