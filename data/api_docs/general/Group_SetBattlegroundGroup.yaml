  class: Group

  signature: void Group::SetBattlegroundGroup(Battleground * bg)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns a battleground to the group for coordination during battleground
    participation.
  description: The SetBattlegroundGroup method associates a Battleground object with
    the current group, enabling proper group management and coordination during battleground
    instances. This method is typically called when a player joins a battleground
    and needs to be grouped with other players for objective completion, scoring,
    and rewards. The group's battleground reference allows the game system to track
    group participation, handle loot distribution, manage team assignments, and ensure
    proper group synchronization during battleground events. This method does not
    validate whether the group is already assigned to another battleground; it simply
    sets the new battleground reference.
  parameters:
  - name: bg
    description: Pointer to the Battleground object that the group should be associated
      with. Must be a valid battleground instance or nullptr to clear the association.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Assigning a Group to a Battleground
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);\nif (bg)\n\
      {\n    group->SetBattlegroundGroup(bg);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing Group's Battleground Assignment
    code: group->SetBattlegroundGroup(nullptr);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the battleground system. It does
    not perform any validation on the battleground pointer and does not modify the
    group's state beyond setting the reference. The method should be called after
    a group has been properly initialized for battleground participation.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null pointer will clear the battleground association,
    which may cause issues if the group is still participating in a battleground.
    Ensure that the battleground pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid
    undefined behavior.
