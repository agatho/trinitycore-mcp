  class: PlayerDumpWriter
  method: WriteDumpToFile
  signature: DumpReturn PlayerDumpWriter::WriteDumpToFile(const std::string & file,
    int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Writes a player's dump data to a specified file.
  description: The WriteDumpToFile method serializes and saves a player's character
    data, including inventory, stats, and other relevant information, into a structured
    file format. This functionality is typically used for debugging, character backups,
    or migration purposes within the TrinityCore emulator. The method requires a valid
    file path and player GUID to locate and serialize the appropriate character data.
    It performs necessary checks to ensure the player exists and that the target file
    can be written to.
  parameters:
  - name: file
    description: The absolute or relative path to the output file where the player
      dump will be saved. Must be a valid filesystem path with write permissions.
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose data is to be dumped.
      Must correspond to an existing character in the database.
  returns: Returns a DumpReturn enum value indicating success or failure of the dump
    operation. Possible values include DUMP_SUCCESS, DUMP_FILE_ERROR, DUMP_PLAYER_NOT_FOUND,
    and others depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "PlayerDumpWriter dumpWriter;\nDumpReturn result = dumpWriter.WriteDumpToFile(\"\
      /home/user/dumps/player123.dump\", 123456);\nif (result == DUMP_SUCCESS) {\n\
      \    printf(\"Player dump saved successfully.\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"\
      Failed to save player dump. Error code: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method may block during file I/O operations, so it should not be called
    from performance-critical threads. Ensure that the target directory exists and
    has sufficient permissions for writing files.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid GUID or non-writable file path will
    result in a failure return code but will not throw exceptions. Always validate
    inputs before calling this function.
