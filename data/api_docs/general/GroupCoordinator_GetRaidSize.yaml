  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: GetRaidSize
  signature: uint32 GroupCoordinator::GetRaidSize() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current size of the raid group managed by the GroupCoordinator.
  description: The GetRaidSize method returns the total number of players currently
    in the raid group that is being coordinated by this GroupCoordinator instance.
    This value includes all members of the raid, including the raid leader and all
    regular members. The method provides a read-only view of the raid's composition
    at the time of the call and does not account for any pending joins or leaves that
    might occur immediately after the method returns. It is commonly used in raid
    management systems to determine whether a raid has reached its maximum capacity,
    or to display the current raid status to players.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of players currently in the raid
    group. Returns 0 if the raid is empty or has not been initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GroupCoordinator* coordinator = GetGroupCoordinator();\nuint32 raidSize\
      \ = coordinator->GetRaidSize();\nif (raidSize > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Current\
      \ raid size: %u\\n\", raidSize);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Raid Capacity
    code: "GroupCoordinator* coordinator = GetGroupCoordinator();\nuint32 raidSize\
      \ = coordinator->GetRaidSize();\nconst uint32 MAX_RAID_SIZE = 40;\nif (raidSize\
      \ >= MAX_RAID_SIZE)\n{\n    printf(\"Raid is full. No more players can join.\\\
      n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"Raid has %u/%u slots filled.\\n\", raidSize,\
      \ MAX_RAID_SIZE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a constant function and does not modify the state of the GroupCoordinator
    object. It is safe to call from any thread context as long as access to the underlying
    group data is synchronized. The returned size may not reflect real-time changes
    if the group is actively being modified by other threads.
  warnings: Be aware that the raid size returned by this method can change immediately
    after the call, especially in a multi-threaded environment where players are joining
    or leaving the raid. For critical logic involving raid capacity checks, consider
    using locking mechanisms to ensure consistency.
