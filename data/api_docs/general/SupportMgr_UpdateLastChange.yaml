documentation:
  brief: Updates the last change timestamp for support ticket records in the database.
  description: The UpdateLastChange method is responsible for updating the timestamp
    of the last modification made to support tickets within the TrinityCore database.
    This ensures that all support-related data reflects the most recent activity and
    helps maintain consistency between the server's internal state and the persistent
    storage. The method typically gets invoked when a ticket is modified, replied
    to, or otherwise updated by either players or staff members. It plays a crucial
    role in tracking ticket lifecycle and ensuring accurate audit trails for administrative
    purposes.

    be used judiciously to avoid unnecessary overhead. It may also trigger internal
    synchronization mechanisms within the SupportMgr class.
