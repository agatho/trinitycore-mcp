documentation:
  brief: Resets all passenger-related data in the PassengerInfo object to its default
    state.
  description: The Reset method clears and initializes all internal passenger information
    stored within the PassengerInfo class instance. This typically involves clearing
    any cached passenger data, resetting counters or flags, and preparing the object
    for reuse or a new passenger session. The method ensures that subsequent operations
    on the PassengerInfo object start with a clean slate, which is essential when
    handling multiple passengers or reusing passenger containers in game logic such
    as vehicle management or passenger transfer systems.

  notes: This method should be called before reusing a PassengerInfo object to avoid
    carrying over stale data from previous operations. It is commonly used in vehicle
    management systems when passengers are removed or transferred between vehicles.
