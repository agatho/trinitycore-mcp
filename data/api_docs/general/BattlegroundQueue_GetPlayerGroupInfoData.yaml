  class: BattlegroundQueue
  method: GetPlayerGroupInfoData
  signature: bool BattlegroundQueue::GetPlayerGroupInfoData(int guid, GroupQueueInfo
    * ginfo)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves group queue information for a specified player GUID.
  description: The GetPlayerGroupInfoData method fetches the queue information associated
    with a specific player's group in the battleground system. It retrieves details
    such as the group's queue status, expected wait time, and other relevant data
    needed for managing player participation in battlegrounds. This method is typically
    used by the battleground queue system to track and update player group states
    during queue processing. The method requires a valid GUID to retrieve the corresponding
    group information, and returns false if no matching group is found in the queue.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose group information
      is being requested. This should be a valid player GUID within the battleground
      system.
  - name: ginfo
    description: Pointer to a GroupQueueInfo structure where the retrieved group queue
      information will be stored. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the group information was successfully retrieved for the
    specified player GUID, false otherwise. The method returns false if no matching
    group exists in the queue or if the provided parameters are invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve group info for a player
    code: "GroupQueueInfo groupInfo;\nif (bgQueue.GetPlayerGroupInfoData(playerGuid,\
      \ &groupInfo)) {\n    // Successfully retrieved group info\n    printf(\"Group\
      \ queued for BG: %d, Wait time: %d seconds\\n\", \n           groupInfo.BgTypeId,\
      \ groupInfo.WaitTime);\n} else {\n    // No queue information found for the\
      \ player\n    printf(\"Player not in any battleground queue.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal battleground queue management system
    and should only be called from within the context of battleground queue operations.
    The GroupQueueInfo structure contains important data about group queue state,
    including wait times, battleground type, and queue position. Ensure that the provided
    GUID is valid and corresponds to an actual player in the queue.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in
    undefined behavior or access violations. Always validate the return value before
    using the retrieved GroupQueueInfo data. This method should not be used outside
    of the battleground queue subsystem as it relies on internal queue state management.
