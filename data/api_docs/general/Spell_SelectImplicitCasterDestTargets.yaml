documentation:
  brief: Selects implicit caster destination targets for spell effects
  description: This method determines and sets the target destinations for spell effects
    based on the provided spell effect information and target type. It handles the
    selection of appropriate targets for spells that require multiple targets or specific
    targeting mechanics, such as area-of-effect spells or spells with complex target
    selection rules. The method is crucial for proper spell execution and target validation
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: spellEffectInfo
    description: Contains information about the spell effect being processed, including
      effect type, radius, and other parameters that influence target selection
  - name: targetType
    description: Defines the implicit target type for the spell effect, determining
      how targets are selected based on game mechanics and spell properties
  - name: targetIndex
    description: Specifies which target index is being processed, allowing for multiple
      target selection within a single spell effect
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic target selection example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(player, spellInfo);

      spell->SelectImplicitCasterDestTargets(spellEffectInfo, targetType, targetIndex);

      // This would be called during spell cast initialization'
    language: cpp
  - title: Complex target selection example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(player, spellInfo);

      spell->SelectImplicitCasterDestTargets(spellEffectInfo, targetType, 0);

      // Handles multiple targets for AoE spells

      // Example: selecting targets for a fireball spell with radius'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core spell execution logic and should be called
    during spell initialization. It requires proper target validation before execution
    to ensure correct targeting mechanics are applied.
  warnings: Improper handling of target selection can lead to incorrect spell targeting,
    potentially causing spells to miss targets or apply effects to wrong targets.
    This method should not be called outside of spell processing context.
