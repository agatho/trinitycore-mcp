  method: ~SuggestionTicket
  signature: void SuggestionTicket::~SuggestionTicket()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a SuggestionTicket object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~SuggestionTicket destructor is automatically invoked when a SuggestionTicket
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory, internal data structures, and handles
    related to the ticket. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server
    implementation, suggestion tickets are used by players to submit feedback or suggestions
    to the game developers. The destructor guarantees that all resources tied to the
    ticket are freed appropriately, preventing memory leaks and ensuring system stability.
    No explicit parameters are required as this is a destructor method.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of SuggestionTicket
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    SuggestionTicket ticket;\n    // ... use\
      \ ticket ...\n    // ticket is automatically destroyed here when going out of\
      \ scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of SuggestionTicket pointer
    code: "void AnotherExample()\n{\n    SuggestionTicket* ticket = new SuggestionTicket();\n\
      \    // ... use ticket ...\n    delete ticket; // Triggers ~SuggestionTicket\
      \ destructor\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when objects are destroyed.
    Developers should not manually invoke destructors unless performing low-level
    memory management. The implementation ensures that all internal references and
    allocated memory are properly released.
