documentation:
  brief: Adds a game teleport location to the database and internal teleports list
  description: The AddGameTele method inserts a new GameTele object into the game's
    teleport system. It validates the provided teleport data and ensures it is properly
    registered in both the database and the in-memory collection of available teleports.
    This method is typically used by admin commands or scripts to dynamically add
    new teleport locations during runtime. The method returns true if the teleport
    was successfully added, or false if validation failed or the teleport already
    exists.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a GameTele structure containing the teleport location
      details including name, map ID, X, Y, Z coordinates, and orientation. The name
      must be unique across all teleports.
  returns: True if the teleport was successfully added to the system; false if the
    teleport data is invalid or if a teleport with the same name already exists.
  examples:
  - title: Add a new teleport location
    code: "GameTele tele;\ntele.name = \"new_teleport\";\ntele.mapId = 0;\ntele.x\
      \ = 1234.5f;\ntele.y = 6789.0f;\ntele.z = 100.0f;\ntele.o = 1.57f;\nbool result\
      \ = sObjectMgr->AddGameTele(tele);\nif (result)\n    ChatHandler(ch).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Teleport added successfully.\");"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies both the database and in-memory data structures. It
    is thread-safe when used with proper locking mechanisms in multi-threaded environments.
    The GameTele structure must be fully initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with duplicate teleport names will result in failure.
    Ensure that all teleport coordinates are valid for the target map to avoid unexpected
    behavior during teleportation. This operation may cause performance impact on
    large databases if called frequently.
