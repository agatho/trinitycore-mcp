  signature: void WarriorAI::UpdateSpecialization()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the warrior's specialization-specific AI behavior and abilities.
  description: The UpdateSpecialization method is responsible for adjusting the AI
    behavior of a warrior class based on their current specialization. This includes
    updating ability priorities, targeting logic, and combat strategies according
    to the warrior's chosen specialization (Arms, Fury, or Protection). The method
    typically gets called during AI update cycles to ensure that the warrior's actions
    align with their selected playstyle and role in combat. It may also handle switching
    between different combat states or adjusting threat generation patterns based
    on specialization.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateSpecialization())\n\
      \        return;\n    // ... rest of AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the warrior's class-specific AI system
    and may modify internal state variables such as ability cooldowns, target selection
    criteria, or combat stance. It should be called regularly during the AI update
    cycle to maintain proper specialization behavior.
