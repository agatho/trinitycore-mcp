documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a new Druid AI instance for a bot character
  description: The CreateDruidAI method is responsible for instantiating a Druid-specific
    AI behavior for a bot character within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    allocates memory for the AI component, sets up the appropriate druid-specific
    behaviors such as spell casting, movement patterns, and combat strategies tailored
    for druid class mechanics. It typically integrates with the bot management system
    to assign the newly created AI to a specified bot entity. The method may perform
    validation checks on the input parameters and ensure proper initialization of
    all druid AI subsystems including mana management, form switching logic, and ability
    usage.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot identifier or handle.
      This parameter is expected to be a valid reference to a bot entity within the
      TrinityCore system.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure status of the
    AI creation process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful creation,
    while non-zero values may represent various error conditions such as invalid bot
    handle, insufficient memory, or failed initialization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Druid AI Creation
    code: "int botId = 12345;\nint result = factory->CreateDruidAI(&botId);\nif (result\
      \ == 0) {\n    printf(\"Druid AI created successfully for bot %d\\n\", botId);\n\
      } else {\n    printf(\"Failed to create Druid AI for bot %d with error code\
      \ %d\\n\", botId, result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot AI system and should only be called when a
    bot character has been properly initialized. The method assumes that the bot parameter
    points to a valid bot entity within the TrinityCore world state. Implementation
    may involve memory allocation and could potentially block if resource constraints
    are encountered.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or uninitialized bot pointer may result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the bot identifier is valid and
    corresponds to an existing bot before invoking this method. This method does not
    perform automatic cleanup of previously allocated AI components.
