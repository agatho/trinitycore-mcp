  signature: bool MovementValidator::IsSafeFall(Player * bot, float fallDistance)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can safely fall from a given height without taking
    damage.
  description: The IsSafeFall method evaluates if a player can fall a specified distance
    without sustaining damage. This method is typically used in bot AI logic to determine
    safe movement patterns, particularly when navigating terrain or avoiding hazards.
    It considers factors such as the player's current position, fall height, and game
    mechanics like fall damage thresholds. The method returns true if the fall is
    considered safe, false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for pathfinding
    algorithms in automated players (bots) to prevent unnecessary damage during movement.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is evaluating
      the fall. Must not be null.
  - name: fallDistance
    description: The vertical distance (in yards) the player would fall. Must be a
      non-negative value representing the height difference.
  returns: Returns true if the fall is considered safe for the player, false otherwise.
    A safe fall means the player will not take damage from the fall based on game
    mechanics and thresholds.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a fall is safe
    code: "Player* myBot = ...;\nfloat distance = 10.0f;\nif (MovementValidator::IsSafeFall(myBot,\
      \ distance)) {\n    // Proceed with the fall\n    printf(\"Safe to fall %.2f\
      \ yards\\n\", distance);\n} else {\n    // Avoid falling or find an alternative\
      \ path\n    printf(\"Fall is not safe\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in bot movement logic
    code: "class MyBotAI {\npublic:\n    bool SafePathToPosition(Player* bot, float\
      \ targetX, float targetY, float targetZ) {\n        float currentZ = bot->GetPositionZ();\n\
      \        float fallDistance = currentZ - targetZ;\n        \n        if (fallDistance\
      \ > 0 && !MovementValidator::IsSafeFall(bot, fallDistance)) {\n            //\
      \ Find alternative path to avoid dangerous fall\n            return false;\n\
      \        }\n        return true;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely incorporates game-specific thresholds for fall damage
    calculation. It may also account for player equipment, buffs, or abilities that
    reduce fall damage. The implementation might be part of a larger movement validation
    system that ensures bots make realistic and safe decisions when navigating the
    game world.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid undefined behavior. The fallDistance parameter should always be non-negative;
    negative values may produce unexpected results or indicate incorrect usage.
