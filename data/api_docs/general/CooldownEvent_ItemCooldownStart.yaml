api:
  class: CooldownEvent
  method: ItemCooldownStart
  signature: CooldownEvent CooldownEvent::ItemCooldownStart(int caster, uint32 itemId,
    uint32 cooldownMs)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new cooldown event for a specified item.
  description: The ItemCooldownStart method initializes a new CooldownEvent object
    that represents the start of a cooldown period for a specific item. This method
    is typically used within the TrinityCore framework to manage item cooldowns, such
    as those for consumables, weapons, or quest items. The event will track when the
    cooldown begins and how long it lasts, allowing the game engine to prevent the
    item from being used again until the cooldown expires. It is commonly invoked
    when a player uses an item that has a cooldown period, ensuring proper game balance
    and mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: The GUID of the player or creature that is using the item. This identifies
      who initiated the cooldown.
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item for which the cooldown is being
      started. This must correspond to a valid item in the game database.
  - name: cooldownMs
    description: The duration of the cooldown in milliseconds. This determines how
      long the item will be unavailable after use.
  returns: A new CooldownEvent object representing the start of the specified item's
    cooldown period.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: CooldownEvent event = CooldownEvent::ItemCooldownStart(playerGuid, 12345,
      30000);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Player Object
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player object

      uint32 itemId = 67890;

      uint32 cooldownTime = 15000; // 15 seconds

      CooldownEvent event = CooldownEvent::ItemCooldownStart(player->GetGUID().GetRawValue(),
      itemId, cooldownTime);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's cooldown management system. The
    returned CooldownEvent object should be properly stored and managed to ensure
    that the cooldown logic functions correctly throughout the game session. It is
    recommended to use this method in conjunction with other cooldown-related APIs
    for full functionality.
  warnings: Ensure that the itemId parameter corresponds to a valid item in the database,
    otherwise the cooldown may not behave as expected. Also, be cautious about using
    large cooldown values, as they could impact gameplay balance or performance if
    overused.
