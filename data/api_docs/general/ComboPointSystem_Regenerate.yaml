  signature: void ComboPointSystem::Regenerate(uint32 param0)
documentation:
  brief: Regenerates combo points for the player character based on internal timing
    and game mechanics.
  description: The ComboPointSystem::Regenerate method is responsible for restoring
    or updating the number of combo points a player has available. This typically
    occurs at regular intervals or in response to specific game events such as attacking
    enemies or using certain abilities. The regeneration process follows World of
    Warcraft's combat system rules where combo points are consumed during attacks
    and gradually restored over time. This method does not take any parameters and
    operates internally based on the player's current state, class specialization,
    and active abilities that affect combo point generation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Regeneration Call
    code: 'ComboPointSystem* system = player->GetComboPointSystem();

      system->Regenerate(0); // Triggers combo point regeneration'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the game's internal update loop or triggered
    by combat events. It should not be called manually in most cases as it's handled
    automatically by the system. The regeneration rate may vary depending on the player's
    class, talents, and equipped items.
  warnings: Calling this method directly may interfere with normal gameplay mechanics
    if done outside of appropriate contexts. It is recommended to use this only when
    implementing custom game logic or debugging systems.
