  class: BeastMasteryHunterRefactored
  method: GetPetInfo
  signature: int BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::GetPetInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves and returns the current pet's information identifier for a Beast
    Mastery hunter.
  description: The GetPetInfo method is designed to fetch the unique identifier or
    status information associated with the hunter's current beast pet in the context
    of the Beast Mastery talent specialization. This method typically retrieves data
    such as the pet's GUID, health, or other relevant state information that is used
    for managing and tracking the pet during gameplay. It serves as a core utility
    for the Beast Mastery hunter's pet management system within TrinityCore's framework.
    The method is const, indicating it does not modify any internal state of the class
    instance. This function is commonly invoked when the game logic requires access
    to the active pet's data for actions like pet commands, combat decisions, or UI
    updates.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the pet's information identifier.
    The specific meaning of this integer depends on the implementation but typically
    corresponds to the pet's GUID or a status code indicating the pet's current state
    (e.g., alive, dead, summoned). A return value of 0 may indicate no pet is active
    or an error occurred.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in pet management
    code: "int petInfo = hunter.GetPetInfo();\nif (petInfo != 0) {\n    // Pet is\
      \ active, proceed with pet-specific logic\n    HandlePetAction(petInfo);\n}\
      \ else {\n    // No active pet or error occurred\n    SendErrorMessage(\"No\
      \ pet available.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the hunter has an active pet. If no pet is summoned,
    the return value may be zero or another sentinel value indicating an inactive
    state. The exact integer representation of pet info should be verified against
    TrinityCore's internal pet management system to ensure correct interpretation.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-zero return value always indicates a valid pet;
    verify with additional checks such as pet existence or summon status before performing
    actions based on the returned value.
