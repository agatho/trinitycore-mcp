  class: UnitAura
  method: AddStaticApplication
  signature: void UnitAura::AddStaticApplication(Unit * target, uint32 effMask)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a static application of an aura to the specified target unit.
  description: The AddStaticApplication method is used to apply an aura effect to
    a target unit in a static manner, meaning the application is not dependent on
    dynamic updates or periodic ticks. This method typically handles the initial application
    state and setup for auras that are meant to be persistent or have specific non-periodic
    behavior. The method uses the provided effective mask (effMask) to determine which
    effects of the aura should be applied. It's commonly used during aura creation
    or activation phases where immediate application is required without delay.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that will receive the aura application.
      This represents the target unit affected by the aura.
  - name: effMask
    description: A bitmask representing which effects of the aura should be applied.
      Each bit corresponds to a specific aura effect index, allowing selective application
      of aura effects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Aura Application
    code: 'UnitAura* aura = new UnitAura(caster, target, spellInfo);

      aura->AddStaticApplication(target, 0x01); // Apply first effect only'
    language: cpp
  - title: Selective Effect Application
    code: 'UnitAura* aura = new UnitAura(caster, target, spellInfo);

      uint32 effectMask = 0x07; // Apply effects 0, 1, and 2

      aura->AddStaticApplication(target, effectMask);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during aura initialization or activation.
    The effMask parameter allows for granular control over which effects are applied
    immediately. This method does not trigger periodic updates or tick-based effects
    - it only handles the initial static application of the aura.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit pointer is valid before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. The effMask should be
    carefully constructed to avoid applying unintended effects.
