  method: IsEchoExpired
  signature: bool EchoController::IsEchoExpired(const Echo & echo) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a given echo has expired based on its timestamp and configured
    timeout duration.
  description: 'The IsEchoExpired method determines if a specified Echo object has
    exceeded its allowed lifetime. It compares the echo''s creation timestamp against
    the current time, taking into account the server''s configured echo timeout value.
    This mechanism is typically used to manage temporary data structures or messages
    that should not persist beyond a certain period. The method performs a simple
    time-based comparison and does not modify any internal state. Precondition: The
    Echo object must be valid and contain a properly initialized timestamp. Postcondition:
    Returns true if the echo has expired, false otherwise.'
  parameters:
  - name: echo
    description: The Echo object to check for expiration. Must be a valid instance
      with a populated timestamp field.
  returns: True if the echo's lifetime has exceeded the configured timeout threshold;
    false if it is still active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (controller.IsEchoExpired(myEcho)) {\n    // Handle expired echo\n \
      \   std::cout << \"Echo has expired!\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Echo Management
    code: "void ProcessEchoQueue() {\n    for (auto& echo : activeEchos) {\n     \
      \   if (controller.IsEchoExpired(echo)) {\n            // Remove expired echo\
      \ from queue\n            echo = activeEchos.back();\n            activeEchos.pop_back();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the system's current time and assumes that the Echo
    object's timestamp is maintained correctly. The timeout value is typically configurable
    via server settings or constants defined in the EchoController class. Performance
    is O(1) as it only performs a simple time comparison.
  warnings: Ensure that the Echo object passed to this method has been properly initialized
    with a valid timestamp. Passing an uninitialized or invalid Echo may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect results.
