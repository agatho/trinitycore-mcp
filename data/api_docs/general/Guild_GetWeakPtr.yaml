documentation:
  brief: Returns the weak pointer identifier for the guild object
  description: The GetWeakPtr method retrieves a unique integer identifier that represents
    a weak reference to the guild object. This identifier is typically used internally
    by TrinityCore's object management system to track and reference guild instances
    without creating strong references that could prevent garbage collection. The
    returned value serves as a handle for locating the guild in memory and is often
    utilized in event handling, callback systems, or when interfacing with the core
    game loop. This method does not perform any operations on the guild itself but
    simply returns an internal identifier used for object tracking.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the weak pointer identifier of the guild
    object. This identifier is unique within the context of active guild objects and
    can be used to reference the guild without maintaining a strong ownership relationship.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve guild weak pointer
    code: 'Guild* guild = ...; // Assume guild is already initialized

      int weakPtr = guild->GetWeakPtr();

      // Use weakPtr for object tracking or reference purposes'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the TrinityCore framework for
    object management and should not typically be called directly by custom scripts
    or modules unless specifically required for low-level object tracking. The returned
    value is not guaranteed to be stable across different server sessions or restarts.
