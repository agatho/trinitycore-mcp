  class: PositionManager
  method: GenerateCandidatePositions
  signature: int PositionManager::GenerateCandidatePositions(const MovementContext
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a set of candidate positions for movement validation based on the
    provided movement context.
  description: The GenerateCandidatePositions method computes and populates a list
    of potential destination positions that a unit might move to, using the data contained
    within the MovementContext parameter. This method is typically used in pathfinding
    and movement validation logic to determine valid movement options for units such
    as NPCs or players. It evaluates various factors like terrain, obstacles, and
    movement constraints defined in the context to produce a set of viable candidates.
    The generated positions are usually consumed by subsequent methods that perform
    final validation or path calculation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of candidate positions successfully
    generated. A negative value may indicate an error during position generation,
    while zero indicates no valid candidates were produced.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Movement Logic
    code: "MovementContext context;\n// ... populate context with movement data ...\n\
      int count = positionManager.GenerateCandidatePositions(context);\nif (count\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with pathfinding or validation\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core movement system and should be called before
    any pathfinding or obstacle checking. It may perform expensive calculations depending
    on the complexity of the movement context, so it's recommended to cache results
    when possible.
  warnings: Ensure that the MovementContext passed to this method is properly initialized
    with valid data; otherwise, the generated candidate positions may be invalid or
    cause unexpected behavior in downstream systems.
