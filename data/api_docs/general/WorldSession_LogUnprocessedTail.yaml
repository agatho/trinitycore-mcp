  signature: void WorldSession::LogUnprocessedTail(const WorldPacket * packet)
documentation:
  brief: Logs unprocessed tail data from a WorldPacket for debugging purposes.
  description: The LogUnprocessedTail method is used to output debug information about
    the remaining data in a WorldPacket that has not yet been processed. This function
    is typically invoked when packet handling encounters an issue or when debugging
    packet parsing logic. It helps developers identify incomplete or malformed packet
    data by logging the raw bytes of the unprocessed portion of the packet. The method
    does not modify the packet itself but rather provides diagnostic output for troubleshooting
    network communication issues within the TrinityCore framework.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet handling
    code: "void HandleSomePacket(WorldSession* session, WorldPacket& packet)\n{\n\
      \    // Process some data from packet\n    // ...\n    \n    // Log any unprocessed\
      \ tail for debugging\n    session->LogUnprocessedTail(&packet);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for development and debugging purposes.
    It may produce verbose output in debug builds but is typically disabled in release
    builds. The logging behavior depends on the server's debug level configuration.
  warnings: The method should not be called in performance-critical code paths as
    it may involve string formatting and I/O operations. It's recommended to only
    use this during development or when debugging specific packet handling issues.
