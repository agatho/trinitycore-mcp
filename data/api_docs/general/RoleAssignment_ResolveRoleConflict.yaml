  class: RoleAssignment
  method: ResolveRoleConflict
  signature: void RoleAssignment::ResolveRoleConflict(Group * group, GroupRole role)
documentation:
  brief: Resolves role conflicts within a group by assigning appropriate roles to
    members based on group settings and member permissions.
  description: The ResolveRoleConflict method is responsible for handling situations
    where there are inconsistencies or conflicts in role assignments within a World
    of Warcraft group. This typically occurs when group members have conflicting roles,
    such as multiple players being assigned the same role (e.g., two main tanks),
    or when a player's role cannot be determined due to missing permissions or invalid
    configurations. The method evaluates the current state of the group and reassigns
    roles accordingly to ensure optimal group composition and adherence to group leadership
    rules. It is commonly invoked during group updates, member joins, or when explicit
    role changes occur within the group.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object for which role conflicts need to be resolved.
      This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid group instance.
  - name: role
    description: The specific GroupRole that is being considered for conflict resolution.
      This value determines how the method processes and resolves potential role conflicts
      within the group.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Role Conflict Resolution
    code: "Group* myGroup = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(12345);\nif (myGroup)\n{\n   \
      \ RoleAssignment roleAssign;\n    roleAssign.ResolveRoleConflict(myGroup, GROUP_ROLE_TANK);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resolving Conflicts for All Roles
    code: "Group* group = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(67890);\nif (group)\n{\n    RoleAssignment\
      \ roleAssign;\n    roleAssign.ResolveRoleConflict(group, GROUP_ROLE_TANK);\n\
      \    roleAssign.ResolveRoleConflict(group, GROUP_ROLE_HEALER);\n    roleAssign.ResolveRoleConflict(group,\
      \ GROUP_ROLE_DAMAGE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the group's internal role assignment system and may
    modify member roles directly. It is recommended to call this function only after
    ensuring that the group is in a stable state and not during active combat or rapid
    membership changes. The method does not guarantee immediate consistency across
    all clients; synchronization might require additional updates.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the group exists and is valid before invoking this function.
    Additionally, frequent calls to this method without proper state checks may lead
    to performance degradation or inconsistent role assignments.
