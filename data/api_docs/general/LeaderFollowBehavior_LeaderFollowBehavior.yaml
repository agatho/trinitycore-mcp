  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::LeaderFollowBehavior()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the LeaderFollowBehavior class for managing
    AI behavior in leader-follow scenarios.
  description: The LeaderFollowBehavior constructor initializes the necessary internal
    state and data structures required for handling AI behaviors where a creature
    follows a designated leader. This includes setting up default values for follow
    parameters, initializing behavior flags, and preparing the object for integration
    with the TrinityCore AI system. The method ensures that the behavior is properly
    configured to respond to leader movement, combat states, and other relevant events
    within the game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new LeaderFollowBehavior instance
    code: 'LeaderFollowBehavior* behavior = new LeaderFollowBehavior();

      // The behavior is now initialized and ready to be attached to an AI

      // This typically occurs during creature AI initialization in TrinityCore'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore AI system
    when creating AI behaviors for creatures that should follow a leader. Developers
    should not directly instantiate this class unless implementing custom AI behavior
    logic. The constructor does not perform any complex initialization beyond basic
    object setup.
