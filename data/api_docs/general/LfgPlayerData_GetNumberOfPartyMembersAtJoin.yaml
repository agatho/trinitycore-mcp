  class: LfgPlayerData
  method: GetNumberOfPartyMembersAtJoin
  signature: uint8 LfgPlayerData::GetNumberOfPartyMembersAtJoin()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of party members that were present when the player joined
    a LFG (Looking for Group) instance.
  description: The GetNumberOfPartyMembersAtJoin method retrieves the count of party
    members that existed at the time the player joined a Looking for Group (LFG) dungeon
    or scenario. This value is typically set when the player initially joins the LFG
    queue and represents the party composition at that moment. It's used internally
    by TrinityCore to manage group dynamics, loot distribution, and other mechanics
    that depend on knowing the original party size during LFG operations. The method
    does not account for any changes in party membership that may have occurred after
    joining the group.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the number of party members present when the
    player joined the LFG instance. This value is typically 1 for solo players or
    greater than 1 for players who joined a pre-formed party.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "LfgPlayerData* playerData = sLFGMgr->GetPlayerData(playerGuid);\nuint8\
      \ memberCount = playerData->GetNumberOfPartyMembersAtJoin();\nif (memberCount\
      \ > 1)\n{\n    // Player joined a group with multiple members\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      lfg\", \"Player joined LFG with %u party members.\", memberCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in LFG-related systems and should only be called
    after the player has successfully joined an LFG group. The returned value is cached
    at join time and will not reflect any subsequent changes to the party composition.
