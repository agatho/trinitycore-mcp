    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the upper bound index for game object quest involved relations
    associated with a specified quest ID.
  description: This method returns the maximum index value for the reverse lookup
    of game object quest involved relations. In TrinityCore's database, quest-related
    game objects are stored in a table that maps quest IDs to game object entries
    and their respective indices. This function provides the upper limit of valid
    indices for a given quest ID, which is typically used when iterating through or
    accessing related game object entries. The method is part of the ObjectMgr class,
    which manages various game object and quest data structures within the core. It's
    commonly used in quest handling systems to determine how many game objects are
    involved in a specific quest.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the upper bound index for game object quest involved
    relations associated with the specified quest ID. This value indicates the maximum
    valid index that can be used to access related game object entries. If no relations
    exist for the quest, it typically returns 0 or a negative value depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 questId = 12345;\nint upperBound = sObjectMgr->GetGOQuestInvolvedRelationReverseBounds(questId);\n\
      if (upperBound > 0)\n{\n    for (int i = 0; i < upperBound; ++i)\n    {\n  \
      \      // Access game object entries using index i\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal database caches or lookup tables that
    store quest-to-game-object mappings. It's important to understand that the returned
    value represents an upper bound, not necessarily a count, and may require additional
    validation before use in loops or array access operations.
  warnings: The return value should never be directly used as an array size without
    proper validation, as it might represent an index rather than a count. Also, calling
    this method with invalid quest IDs could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    results.
