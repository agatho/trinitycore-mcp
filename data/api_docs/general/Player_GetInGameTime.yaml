  class: Player
  method: GetInGameTime
  signature: uint32 Player::GetInGameTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total in-game time elapsed since the player logged in.
  description: The GetInGameTime method retrieves the total amount of time (in seconds)
    that has passed since the player's character was created and logged into the game.
    This value represents the cumulative gameplay time for the player, including time
    spent in both online and offline states. The method is commonly used in various
    game mechanics such as tracking player activity, calculating rewards, or determining
    player progression. It provides a consistent measure of time that can be used
    for comparison across different sessions and server environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the total seconds elapsed since the
    player logged in. This value increases continuously while the player is online
    and stops incrementing when the player logs out or disconnects from the game server.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'uint32 playTime = player->GetInGameTime();

      // playTime now contains the total seconds elapsed since login'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other time-related functions
    like GetPlayedTime() or GetOnlineTime() to provide a complete picture of player
    activity. The value returned by GetInGameTime is not affected by server restarts
    or maintenance periods, making it a reliable measure for long-term tracking.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with GetPlayedTime(), which returns
    the total played time across all sessions, or GetOnlineTime() which returns the
    time spent online. The value returned by GetInGameTime is only valid while the
    player is logged in and may reset upon logout.
