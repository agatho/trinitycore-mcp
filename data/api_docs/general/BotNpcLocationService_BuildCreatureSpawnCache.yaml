  class: BotNpcLocationService
  method: BuildCreatureSpawnCache
  signature: void BotNpcLocationService::BuildCreatureSpawnCache()
documentation:
  brief: Populates the internal cache with creature spawn locations from the database.
  description: The BuildCreatureSpawnCache method initializes or updates an internal
    data structure that stores information about where creatures are spawned in the
    game world. This cache is typically used by bot AI systems to locate and interact
    with NPCs efficiently. The method queries the database for creature spawn points
    and caches this data in memory for fast access during bot operations. It ensures
    that all relevant creature spawn locations are loaded into memory, improving performance
    when bots need to reference NPC positions without repeatedly querying the database.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotNpcLocationService* service = BotNpcLocationService::instance();

      service->BuildCreatureSpawnCache();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during server startup or when new
    creature data is added to the database. The cache is not automatically updated
    when new creatures are spawned dynamically in the game world, so it may need to
    be rebuilt periodically if dynamic spawns occur frequently.
