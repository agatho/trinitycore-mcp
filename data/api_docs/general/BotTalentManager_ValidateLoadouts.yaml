  class: BotTalentManager
  method: ValidateLoadouts
  signature: void BotTalentManager::ValidateLoadouts()
documentation:
  brief: Validates and corrects bot talent loadouts to ensure they conform to game
    rules and restrictions.
  description: The ValidateLoadouts method performs integrity checks on all active
    bot talent loadouts within the TrinityCore system. It ensures that each bot's
    talent specialization adheres to valid class-specific constraints, prevents invalid
    talent point allocations, and maintains consistency with the game's talent tree
    structure. This method is typically invoked during bot initialization, talent
    changes, or periodic maintenance to prevent corrupted or exploitable talent configurations.
    The validation process includes checking for out-of-bounds talent points, ensuring
    proper prerequisite fulfillment, and verifying that no invalid combinations are
    present in the loadout data.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotTalentManager* talentManager = sObjectMgr->GetBotTalentManager();

      talentManager->ValidateLoadouts();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called periodically or after any significant bot talent
    modification to maintain data integrity. It may perform database updates if invalid
    loadouts are detected and corrected.
  warnings: Invoking this method during active gameplay sessions might cause temporary
    performance degradation due to validation overhead. Ensure that loadout corrections
    do not disrupt ongoing player interactions or quest states.
