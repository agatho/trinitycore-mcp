  signature: CombatEvent CombatEvent::SpellCastGo(int caster, int target, uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a combat event for a spell cast action
  description: The SpellCastGo method creates and returns a new CombatEvent instance
    representing a spell casting action in the game. This method is typically used
    to log or process spell casts during combat, capturing essential information about
    the caster, target, and spell being cast. The returned CombatEvent can then be
    used for further processing such as damage calculation, effect application, or
    event logging within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the entity casting the spell. This
      is typically a player or creature GUID.
  - name: target
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target entity receiving the spell.
      This can be a player, creature, or game object.
  - name: spellId
    description: The numeric ID of the spell being cast. This corresponds to entries
      in the Spell.dbc database file.
  returns: A new CombatEvent instance initialized with the provided caster, target,
    and spell information. The event can be further processed or dispatched for combat
    handling.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Cast Event Creation
    code: 'CombatEvent event = CombatEvent::SpellCastGo(12345, 67890, 1234);

      // Creates a combat event for a spell cast by player 12345 on target 67890 with
      spell ID 1234'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Spell Cast Event in Combat Handler
    code: "void HandlePlayerSpellCast(Player* caster, Unit* target, uint32 spellId)\
      \ {\n    CombatEvent event = CombatEvent::SpellCastGo(caster->GetGUID().GetRawValue(),\
      \ target->GetGUID().GetRawValue(), spellId);\n    // Process the combat event\n\
      \    event.Process();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not actually cast the spell; it only creates a representation
    of the spell cast for processing. The actual spell casting logic should be handled
    separately using appropriate TrinityCore APIs such as Spell::SendCastResult or
    Spell::Prepare(). The CombatEvent returned by this method should be properly managed
    to avoid memory leaks.
  warnings: Ensure that both caster and target GUIDs are valid before calling this
    method, as invalid GUIDs may cause undefined behavior. This method assumes the
    spell ID exists in the database; otherwise, the event processing might fail or
    produce unexpected results.
