documentation:
  brief: Initiates the Demon Hunter's Havoc Metamorphosis ability, transforming the
    hunter into a powerful demonic form.
  description: The CastMetamorphosisHavoc method triggers the Demon Hunter's Havoc
    specialization's Metamorphosis ability. This ability transforms the Demon Hunter
    into a demonic form that significantly increases their damage output and provides
    unique gameplay mechanics. The method typically handles the casting logic, including
    checking for valid targets, ensuring the ability is not on cooldown, and applying
    the necessary visual effects and stat modifications. In the context of TrinityCore's
    AI system, this method would be called by the DemonHunterAI class to execute the
    Havoc specialization's core transformation ability during combat scenarios.

    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->GetVictim() &&\
      \ !me->IsNonMeleeSpellCast(false))\n    {\n        // Cast Havoc Metamorphosis\
      \ when appropriate\n        CastMetamorphosisHavoc();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves cooldown management, target validation, and state
    changes. The AI should ensure that the ability is only cast when beneficial for
    combat effectiveness. Implementation may include checking for existing metamorphosis
    effects to prevent overlapping.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper cooldown or target validation may result
    in unexpected behavior or performance issues. Ensure that the Demon Hunter has
    sufficient mana and that the ability isn't already active before invoking this
    method.
