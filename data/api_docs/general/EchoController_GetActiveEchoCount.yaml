  signature: int EchoController::GetActiveEchoCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of active echoes managed by the EchoController instance
  description: The GetActiveEchoCount method retrieves the number of currently active
    echo instances within the EchoController. This method is typically used to monitor
    or control the number of echoes in gameplay mechanics such as spell effects, aura
    applications, or environmental interactions. The returned count represents all
    echoes that are currently active and have not yet expired or been removed from
    the system. This value can be used for various purposes including limiting the
    number of concurrent echoes, triggering events based on echo thresholds, or debugging
    echo-related systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total count of active echoes managed by this
    EchoController instance. Returns zero if no echoes are currently active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Active Echoes
    code: "int activeCount = echoController.GetActiveEchoCount();\nif (activeCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process active echoes\n    printf(\"Currently %d echoes are\
      \ active\\n\", activeCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Echo Count for Game Logic
    code: "class SpellHandler\n{\npublic:\n    void ApplyEchoEffect(EchoController&\
      \ controller)\n    {\n        int currentEchoCount = controller.GetActiveEchoCount();\n\
      \        if (currentEchoCount < MAX_ECHO_LIMIT)\n        {\n            // Create\
      \ new echo\n            controller.CreateNewEcho();\n        }\n        else\n\
      \        {\n            // Handle echo limit reached\n            SendErrorMessage(\"\
      Maximum echoes reached\");\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple count operation on active echoes and should
    have minimal performance impact. The method is marked as const, indicating it
    does not modify the EchoController state. Implementation likely involves iterating
    through an internal collection of active echoes or maintaining a counter variable.
  warnings: The returned count may change between calls if echoes are actively created
    or destroyed during execution. This method should not be used for real-time echo
    management decisions without considering potential race conditions in multi-threaded
    environments.
