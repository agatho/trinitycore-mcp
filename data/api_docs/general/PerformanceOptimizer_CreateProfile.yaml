  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: CreateProfile
  signature: void PerformanceOptimizer::CreateProfile(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a performance profile for the specified bot GUID.
  description: The CreateProfile method initializes a new performance profile for
    a bot identified by its unique global identifier (GUID). This function is typically
    used in TrinityCore's AI and performance monitoring systems to track resource
    usage, execution times, and other metrics for individual bots. The method likely
    sets up internal data structures or logging mechanisms specific to the given bot
    instance. It is designed to be called during bot initialization or when performance
    tracking is required for a particular bot instance.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique global identifier (GUID) of the bot for which to create
      a performance profile. This value should correspond to a valid bot entity within
      the TrinityCore system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      optimizer.CreateProfile(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves internal data structure initialization and may
    have performance implications if called frequently. It should only be invoked
    for valid bot GUIDs to prevent undefined behavior.
