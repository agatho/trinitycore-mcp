  class: InteractionManager
  method: SmartRepair
  signature: bool InteractionManager::SmartRepair(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to repair all equipment on the specified player character using
    smart repair logic.
  description: The SmartRepair method evaluates the player's inventory and attempts
    to repair any damaged items using available resources such as gold or repair NPCs.
    It prioritizes repairing items based on their value and durability, ensuring optimal
    resource usage. The function checks if the player has sufficient funds or access
    to a repair facility before proceeding with repairs. If no suitable repair options
    are found or if the player lacks necessary resources, the method returns false.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if at least one item was successfully repaired; otherwise
    returns false if no items could be repaired due to lack of funds, availability,
    or other constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is a valid player pointer\nbool success\
      \ = sInteractionManager->SmartRepair(bot);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Items were\
      \ repaired successfully\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No items could be repaired\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's current location and available repair
    facilities. It may interact with the game's economy system to determine affordability
    of repairs.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is valid and not null, as passing
    an invalid pointer can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
