documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Vengeance Demon Hunter should use Soul Cleave based
    on current pain resource level.
  description: This method evaluates the current pain resource level of a Vengeance
    Demon Hunter to decide if using the Soul Cleave ability is beneficial. In World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, this logic typically considers the player's
    pain threshold and combat state to optimize spell usage for maximum damage output
    or resource efficiency. The method does not take any parameters and returns a
    boolean value indicating whether the ability should be used.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current pain level meets or exceeds the threshold required
    to justify using Soul Cleave, otherwise false. This decision is based on internal
    game mechanics related to Demon Hunter vengeance specialization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (player->GetAI()->ShouldUseSoulCleave()) {\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_SOUL_CLEAVE, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Logic
    code: "void VengeanceDemonHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (ShouldUseSoulCleave())\
      \ {\n        DoCast(SPELL_SOUL_CLEAVE);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Vengeance Demon Hunter's AI logic and assumes
    that the player has sufficient pain resources to cast Soul Cleave. The exact pain
    threshold for activation may vary based on game balance updates or class-specific
    mechanics.
