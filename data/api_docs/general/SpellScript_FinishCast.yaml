  class: SpellScript
  method: FinishCast
  signature: void SpellScript::FinishCast(int result, int * param1, int * param2)
documentation:
  brief: Completes the spell cast process by applying the final result and parameters
    to the spell's execution context.
  description: The FinishCast method is used within the SpellScript framework to finalize
    a spell's casting sequence. It applies the specified result code and optional
    parameters to complete the spell's execution flow. This method is typically invoked
    during spell script callbacks when the spell cast needs to be concluded, either
    successfully or with an error condition. The method allows for proper cleanup
    and state management of the spell being cast, ensuring that any associated effects,
    visual components, and target handling are properly executed or aborted based
    on the provided result code.
  parameters:
  - name: result
    description: The result code indicating the outcome of the spell cast. Valid values
      typically include success codes (0), failure codes (negative values), or specific
      error conditions defined by the spell system.
  - name: param1
    description: Optional pointer to an integer parameter that can be used to pass
      additional data related to the spell result. Can be nullptr if no extra data
      is needed.
  - name: param2
    description: Optional pointer to a second integer parameter for passing additional
      data. Can be nullptr if no extra data is required.
  returns: void

    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleAfterCast()\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Complete the spell cast with success result\n\
      \        FinishCast(0);\n    }\n};"

  - title: Spell Cast Completion with Parameters
    code: "class HealingSpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleAfterCast()\
      \ override\n    {\n        int healAmount = 1000;\n        int criticalHit =\
      \ 1;\n        // Complete the spell cast with result and parameters\n      \
      \  FinishCast(0, &healAmount, &criticalHit);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called within the context of a SpellScript callback
    where the spell cast is actively being processed. Calling FinishCast outside of
    this context may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The result parameter directly
    affects how the spell's effects are applied and whether targets receive damage,
    healing, or other consequences.
  warnings: Never call FinishCast multiple times for the same spell cast as it may
    cause double-application of effects or memory corruption. Ensure that param1 and
    param2 point to valid memory locations before passing them to this method, especially
    when dealing with dynamic allocation.
