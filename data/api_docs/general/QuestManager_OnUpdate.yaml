  class: QuestManager
  method: OnUpdate
  signature: void QuestManager::OnUpdate(uint32 elapsed)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the quest manager's internal state based on elapsed time.
  description: The OnUpdate method is responsible for processing and updating the
    state of active quests within the QuestManager. It handles time-based quest progression,
    checks for quest completion conditions, and manages quest-related timers. This
    method is typically called by the game loop at regular intervals to ensure that
    quests progress correctly according to their defined rules and time constraints.
    The method takes an elapsed time parameter to determine how much time has passed
    since the last update, which is essential for accurate quest progression and timing.
  parameters:
  - name: elapsed
    description: The amount of time (in milliseconds) that has passed since the last
      update call. This value is used to calculate time-based quest progress and determine
      when quest timers should expire or trigger events.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic quest manager update
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 elapsed = GetElapsedMilliseconds();\n  \
      \  sQuestMgr->OnUpdate(elapsed);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with player update system
    code: "class Player\n{\npublic:\n    void Update(uint32 diff)\n    {\n       \
      \ // ... other player updates ...\n        sQuestMgr->OnUpdate(diff);\n    \
      \    // ... other player updates ...\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game loop or update system.
    It's important to note that quest progression logic may depend on accurate timing,
    so passing correct elapsed time values is crucial. The implementation likely handles
    various quest states including active, completed, failed, and timed-out quests.
  warnings: Ensure that the elapsed parameter represents actual game time and not
    wall clock time, as incorrect timing can cause quest progression issues. This
    method should not be called from multiple threads simultaneously without proper
    synchronization.
