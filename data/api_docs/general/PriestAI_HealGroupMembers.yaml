  signature: void PriestAI::HealGroupMembers()
documentation:
  brief: Heals group members within the PriestAI's current target range using appropriate
    healing spells.
  description: The HealGroupMembers method is responsible for identifying and healing
    injured group members within the PriestAI's effective range. This method typically
    evaluates the health status of nearby group members and applies the most suitable
    healing spell based on the priest's available abilities, mana availability, and
    current combat situation. It ensures that low-health allies are prioritized for
    healing while maintaining optimal resource usage. The method operates as part
    of the AI's general healing behavior and is usually invoked during combat or when
    the priest detects group members requiring assistance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void PriestAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n  \
      \  {\n        HealGroupMembers();\n        // Other combat logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AI has access to a valid group context and that
    the priest's target is within an appropriate range for healing. It may internally
    use spell selection logic based on player health percentages, mana costs, and
    cooldowns.
  warnings: Ensure that the PriestAI instance has proper access to group data and
    that healing spells are properly initialized before calling this method. Failure
    to do so may result in no healing being performed or unexpected behavior.
