  signature: uint32 EssenceResource::GetAvailable() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current amount of essence resources available for use.
  description: The GetAvailable method returns the quantity of essence resources currently
    accessible to the player or entity. In World of Warcraft's context, essence resources
    are typically associated with class-specific abilities, such as those used by
    the Shadowlands' Soulbind system or other resource-based mechanics. This value
    represents the actual usable amount and may be affected by various game states,
    cooldowns, or temporary modifiers. The method is read-only and does not alter
    any internal state of the resource manager.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total available essence resources that
    can be consumed or used in current gameplay context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Available Essence
    code: "uint32 available = player->GetPlayer()->GetEssenceResource()->GetAvailable();\n\
      if (available > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with essence-based ability usage\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other resource management
    functions to determine whether an action requiring essence can be performed. It's
    important to note that the returned value may change dynamically during gameplay
    due to consumption, regeneration, or external effects.
