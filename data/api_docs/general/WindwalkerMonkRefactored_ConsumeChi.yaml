  class: WindwalkerMonkRefactored
  method: ConsumeChi
  signature: void WindwalkerMonkRefactored::ConsumeChi(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes the specified amount of chi from the Windwalker Monk's chi resource.
  description: The ConsumeChi method reduces the current chi resource of a Windwalker
    Monk by the specified amount. This method is typically used during ability execution
    to spend chi for various abilities such as Tiger Palm, Blackout Kick, or other
    chi-consuming skills. The method ensures that the chi consumption does not result
    in a negative value, and may trigger visual feedback or game state updates related
    to chi management. It is an integral part of the Windwalker Monk's gameplay mechanics
    and resource management system.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of chi to consume from the monk's current chi resource.
      Must be a non-negative integer value representing the amount of chi to deduct.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chi Consumption
    code: 'WindwalkerMonkRefactored* monk = ...;

      monk->ConsumeChi(10); // Consumes 10 chi from the monk''s resource'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Chi Consumption
    code: "WindwalkerMonkRefactored* monk = ...;\nif (monk->GetChi() >= 5) {\n   \
      \ monk->ConsumeChi(5); // Only consume if sufficient chi is available\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called only when the monk has sufficient chi to avoid
    unintended behavior. The implementation likely includes checks to prevent chi
    from going below zero, and may trigger events or updates related to chi resource
    changes.
  warnings: Calling this method with an amount greater than the current chi will not
    result in negative chi values due to internal clamping, but it may still cause
    unexpected behavior if not properly validated. Ensure that chi consumption is
    only performed when appropriate for game balance and mechanics.
