documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the stat value associated with a specific aura group for this unit.
  description: This method returns the stat value that is associated with a particular
    aura group for the current unit. It is commonly used to determine how various
    auras affect the unit's stats, such as strength, agility, or intellect. The method
    operates on the unit's mod type and can be used to retrieve stat values for different
    aura groups within the unit's mod system. This functionality is essential for
    understanding how auras impact gameplay mechanics in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the stat value associated with the specified
    aura group. If no valid aura group exists or if the unit does not have the stat,
    this method may return zero or a negative value depending on the context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int statValue = unit->GetStatByAuraGroup(UnitMods::UNIT_MOD_STAT_STRENGTH);\n\
      if (statValue > 0)\n{\n    // Do something with the stat value\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Unit class's mod system and requires a valid aura
    group to function properly. It may return zero or negative values if no stat is
    associated with the specified aura group.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it might not always return meaningful
    values depending on the aura group being queried. Ensure that the unitMod parameter
    is valid before calling this method.
