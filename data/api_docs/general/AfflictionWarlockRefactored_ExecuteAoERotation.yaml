  class: AfflictionWarlockRefactored
  method: ExecuteAoERotation
  signature: void AfflictionWarlockRefactored::ExecuteAoERotation(int * target, uint32
    enemyCount)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the affliction warlock's AoE rotation strategy based on target count
    and enemy proximity.
  description: The ExecuteAoERotation method implements the core logic for an affliction
    warlock's area-of-effect combat rotation. It evaluates the current combat scenario,
    including the number of enemies present and their positioning, to determine the
    optimal sequence of spells and abilities to cast. This method typically prioritizes
    high-damage AoE spells like Rain of Fire or Seed of Corruption when multiple targets
    are present, while also managing DoT application and resource management. The
    implementation considers factors such as spell cooldowns, mana efficiency, and
    enemy health pools to maximize damage output in group combat situations.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an array of target identifiers (GUIDs) representing the
      current enemies in combat. The array should contain valid World of Warcraft
      unit identifiers.
  - name: enemyCount
    description: Integer value indicating the total number of enemies currently engaged
      in combat. This determines the rotation strategy and spell selection for AoE
      execution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AoE Rotation Execution
    code: "void MyWarlockAI::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    // Assuming we have a list of\
      \ targets\n    int targets[5] = {12345, 12346, 12347, 12348, 12349};\n    int\
      \ enemyCount = 5;\n    \n    // Execute the AoE rotation with 5 enemies\n  \
      \  ExecuteAoERotation(targets, enemyCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Target Count Handling
    code: "void MyWarlockAI::Update()\n{\n    // Get current targets from the AI system\n\
      \    std::vector<int> currentTargets = GetNearbyEnemies();\n    int enemyCount\
      \ = static_cast<int>(currentTargets.size());\n    \n    if (enemyCount > 0)\n\
      \    {\n        // Execute AoE rotation with variable target count\n       \
      \ ExecuteAoERotation(currentTargets.data(), enemyCount);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the warlock is in combat and has valid targets. It does
    not handle movement or positioning logic directly, but rather focuses on spell
    selection and execution timing. The implementation may vary based on the specific
    version of TrinityCore and the warlock's talent build.
  warnings: Ensure that the target array contains valid GUIDs before calling this
    method, as invalid targets could cause undefined behavior. This method should
    only be called during active combat situations to avoid unnecessary spell casting.
