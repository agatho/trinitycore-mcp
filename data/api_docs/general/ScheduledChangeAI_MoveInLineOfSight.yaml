  signature: void ScheduledChangeAI::MoveInLineOfSight(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Handles AI behavior when a unit detects an enemy within line of sight.
  description: The MoveInLineOfSight method is invoked by the ScheduledChangeAI class
    to process enemy detection logic. When an enemy enters the AI's line of sight,
    this method triggers the appropriate combat behaviors such as engaging the target,
    initiating movement toward the enemy, or updating the AI state. This method typically
    integrates with the core TrinityCore AI system to ensure proper reaction timing
    and coordination with other AI components. The method is part of the standard
    AI event handling mechanism and should not be called directly unless implementing
    custom AI logic.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit's ID or index
      within the AI's detection range. This parameter allows the AI to identify which
      specific unit has entered line of sight.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Enemy Detection
    code: "void ScheduledChangeAI::MoveInLineOfSight(int* targetId)\n{\n    if (targetId\
      \ && *targetId != 0)\n    {\n        // Set the target and initiate combat behavior\n\
      \        SetTarget(*targetId);\n        StartCombat();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Custom AI Reaction
    code: "void ScheduledChangeAI::MoveInLineOfSight(int* targetId)\n{\n    if (targetId\
      \ && *targetId != 0)\n    {\n        // Custom logic for different enemy types\n\
      \        Unit* target = GetUnit(*targetId);\n        if (target && target->IsPlayer())\n\
      \        {\n            // Player-specific behavior\n            SendChatMessage(\"\
      You dare challenge me?\");\n            MoveToTarget(target);\n        }\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the TrinityCore core when
    an AI unit's line of sight is triggered. Developers should not override this method
    unless implementing custom behavior that requires specific handling of enemy detection
    events.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target ID parameter may lead to null pointer
    dereferences or incorrect AI behavior. Ensure that the target exists and is valid
    before performing operations on it.
