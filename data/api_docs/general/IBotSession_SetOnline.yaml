  class: IBotSession
  method: SetOnline
  signature: void IBotSession::SetOnline(bool online)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the online status of the bot session to the specified value.
  description: The SetOnline method is used to control whether a bot session is marked
    as online or offline within the TrinityCore framework. This method updates the
    internal state of the bot session, which can affect how the bot interacts with
    the game world, including its visibility to other players and its ability to receive
    and process game events. When set to true, the bot is considered active and operational;
    when set to false, it is marked as inactive or disconnected. This method is typically
    used in conjunction with other session management functions to properly initialize
    or terminate bot operations.
  parameters:
  - name: online
    description: Boolean value indicating the desired online status. True sets the
      session to online, false sets it to offline.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage - Set Bot Online
    code: 'IBotSession* session = GetBotSession();

      session->SetOnline(true); // Mark the bot as online'
    language: cpp
  - title: Basic Usage - Set Bot Offline
    code: 'IBotSession* session = GetBotSession();

      session->SetOnline(false); // Mark the bot as offline'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal flags or state variables within the IBotSession
    class. It may trigger additional actions such as sending status notifications
    to the game server or updating related subsystems. The exact implementation details
    are not visible from the signature alone.
