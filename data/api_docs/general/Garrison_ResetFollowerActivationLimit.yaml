  method: ResetFollowerActivationLimit
  signature: void Garrison::ResetFollowerActivationLimit()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the follower activation limit for the garrison.
  description: The ResetFollowerActivationLimit method resets the activation limit
    counter for followers within the garrison. This allows players to activate additional
    followers beyond their normal limit, typically used during special events or when
    specific conditions are met. The method operates on the current garrison instance
    and modifies internal state related to follower activation tracking. It is commonly
    invoked during game mechanics that temporarily increase or reset follower capabilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset follower activation limit for current garrison
    code: "Garrison* garrison = player->GetGarrison();\nif (garrison)\n{\n    garrison->ResetFollowerActivationLimit();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal game state variables related to follower
    activation counts. It should only be called when the garrison is properly initialized
    and accessible. The reset operation may have cooldowns or conditions based on
    game events or player progress.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the garrison exists may lead
    to undefined behavior. Ensure proper null checks are performed before invocation,
    especially in event-driven code paths.
