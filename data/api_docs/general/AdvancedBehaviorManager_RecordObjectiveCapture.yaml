documentation:
  brief: Records the capture of an objective within the advanced behavior manager
    system.
  description: The RecordObjectiveCapture method is used to log and track the successful
    capture of a game objective within the AdvancedBehaviorManager framework. This
    method typically updates internal state or triggers associated events when an
    objective has been captured by a player or faction. It may be invoked during quest
    progression, battleground activities, or other scripted events where capturing
    objectives is part of the gameplay mechanics. The method does not return any value
    and operates as a void function, focusing solely on recording the event for further
    processing or logging.

  - title: Basic Usage in Behavior Tree
    code: "void MyCustomAI::OnObjectiveCaptured()\n{\n    m_behaviorManager->RecordObjectiveCapture();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger behavior management system that tracks
    player actions and objective states. It may interact with database logging or
    event systems to persist capture data for achievements, quest tracking, or battleground
    statistics.
