documentation:
  brief: Destroys a CorpsePreventionManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the CorpsePreventionManager class is responsible
    for releasing any memory or resources that were allocated during the object's
    lifetime. This method ensures proper cleanup of internal data structures related
    to corpse prevention mechanics in TrinityCore. The destructor is automatically
    invoked when a CorpsePreventionManager instance goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted. It does not take any parameters and performs no direct game logic operations,
    but rather focuses on resource management within the context of the server's memory
    handling.

  returns: void

  - title: Automatic destruction of CorpsePreventionManager instance
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    CorpsePreventionManager manager;\n    //\
      \ manager is automatically destroyed when going out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is typically invoked by the C++ runtime during object destruction.
    Developers should not manually call this destructor unless implementing custom
    memory management patterns. The cleanup performed by this destructor is essential
    for preventing memory leaks in long-running server instances.
