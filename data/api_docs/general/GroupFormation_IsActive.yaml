  brief: Checks whether the group formation is currently active.
  description: The IsActive method determines if a group formation process is currently
    in progress or active. This functionality is typically used within the context
    of player groups and their organizational structures, such as when players are
    forming parties or guilds. The method returns true if the formation is active
    and false otherwise. It does not modify any internal state and can be called at
    any time to query the current status of group formation.
  parameters: []

    active. True indicates that the formation process is ongoing, while false indicates
    it is not.
