documentation:
  brief: 'Checks if a target has the Shadow Word: Pain debuff applied.'
  description: 'The HasShadowWordPain method determines whether a specific target,
    identified by their GUID, currently has the Shadow Word: Pain spell effect active
    on them. This method is typically used in spell processing or aura management
    systems within the TrinityCore framework to track the state of debuffs applied
    by the Shadow Priest class. The method performs a lookup in an internal data structure
    that maintains information about active DoTs (Damage over Time) on targets. It
    returns true if the target has the Shadow Word: Pain debuff, and false otherwise.'
  parameters: []
  returns: 'Returns true if the target with the specified GUID currently has the Shadow
    Word: Pain debuff applied; otherwise, returns false.'
  examples:
  - title: 'Checking for Shadow Word: Pain on a target'
    code: "if (shadowDotTracker.HasShadowWordPain(targetGuid)) {\n    // Target is\
      \ affected by Shadow Word: Pain\n    // Apply additional effects or logic here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the internal tracking mechanism for DoTs has been
    properly initialized and updated with relevant spell data. The GUID parameter
    should be a valid target identifier from the game world. Performance is optimized
    through efficient lookup mechanisms, but frequent calls may impact performance
    in high-frequency scenarios.
