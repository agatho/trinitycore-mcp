  class: Unit
  method: GetHealthGain
  signature: int64 Unit::GetHealthGain(int64 dVal)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total health gain value for the unit, including all modifiers
    and adjustments.
  description: The GetHealthGain method retrieves the accumulated health gain value
    for a Unit object, which represents the total amount of health points that have
    been added to the unit's current health. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with health-related calculations and can be influenced by various factors such
    as buffs, debuffs, item bonuses, or other game mechanics. It serves as a key component
    in determining how much health a unit has gained overall, particularly during
    combat situations or when applying healing effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int64 value representing the total health gain amount accumulated
    by the unit. This value may include positive or negative adjustments depending
    on the context and can be used to calculate final health values after applying
    modifiers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* target = new Unit;

      int64 healthGain = target->GetHealthGain(0);

      std::cout << "Health gain: " << healthGain << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Unit class and should be used carefully when dealing
    with health calculations. It may return different values depending on whether
    the unit is currently being healed or damaged, and it's important to understand
    that this value represents a cumulative gain rather than individual changes.
  warnings: The method may not behave consistently across different game states or
    contexts; ensure that any usage of this method is within proper game mechanics
    boundaries. Also, be cautious when using this method in scenarios involving multiple
    health adjustments or complex calculations.
