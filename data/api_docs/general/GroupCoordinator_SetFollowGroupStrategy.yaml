  signature: void GroupCoordinator::SetFollowGroupStrategy(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the follow group strategy for the GroupCoordinator.
  description: The SetFollowGroupStrategy method configures whether the GroupCoordinator
    should enforce a follow group behavior. When enabled, the coordinator will manage
    group members to maintain a specific formation or following pattern, typically
    used in scenarios such as escort quests, scripted events, or controlled group
    movement. This method does not validate the current group state or membership,
    and its effects are applied immediately to the coordinator's internal strategy
    flags. The change affects all subsequent group operations managed by this coordinator
    instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Follow Group Strategy
    code: 'GroupCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.SetFollowGroupStrategy(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Follow Group Strategy
    code: 'GroupCoordinator* coord = GetGroupCoordinator();

      coord->SetFollowGroupStrategy(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state flags only. It does not trigger any immediate
    group updates or send network messages to clients. The strategy change takes effect
    on the next group operation that checks for this setting.
