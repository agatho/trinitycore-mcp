  class: ComplaintTicket
  method: GetNote
  signature: const int & ComplaintTicket::GetNote() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the note associated with the complaint ticket.
  description: The GetNote method returns a constant reference to an integer representing
    the note value stored within the ComplaintTicket object. This note typically corresponds
    to a specific identifier or code related to the complaint, such as a player's
    GUID or a system-generated ticket ID. The method provides read-only access to
    this internal value and does not modify the ticket's state. It is commonly used
    in conjunction with other ticket management functions to retrieve detailed information
    about a specific complaint entry.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer that represents the note value stored
    in the complaint ticket. This value usually corresponds to a unique identifier
    or system code related to the complaint, such as a player's account ID or a ticket
    number.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Display Complaint Note
    code: "ComplaintTicket* ticket = sComplaints->GetTicketByGUID(ticketGuid);\nif\
      \ (ticket)\n{\n    const int& note = ticket->GetNote();\n    std::cout << \"\
      Complaint note value: \" << note << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a constant reference, meaning the returned value should
    not be modified. The note value is typically initialized when the ticket is created
    and may represent different data depending on the complaint type. This implementation
    follows standard C++ best practices for returning references to internal data
    members.
  warnings: Since this method returns a const reference, modifying the returned value
    will result in undefined behavior. Ensure that any operations performed on the
    returned reference are read-only to maintain data integrity.
