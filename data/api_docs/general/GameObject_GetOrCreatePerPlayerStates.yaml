api:
  class: GameObject
  method: GetOrCreatePerPlayerStates
  signature: int & GameObject::GetOrCreatePerPlayerStates()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves or creates per-player state tracking for a game object.
  description: This method returns a reference to an integer that tracks per-player
    states for the GameObject, allowing developers to monitor and manage player-specific
    interactions with the object. The method ensures that each player has a unique
    state identifier associated with the object, which is essential for maintaining
    game mechanics such as quest progress, loot states, or other player-specific behaviors.
    It is commonly used in conjunction with other methods that require per-player
    tracking to ensure proper synchronization of game events.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a reference to an integer representing the per-player state identifier
    for the GameObject. This value can be used to track and manage player-specific
    interactions, such as quest progress or loot states, with the object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'int& state = gameObject->GetOrCreatePerPlayerStates();

      // Use state to track player-specific behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other per-player tracking
    mechanisms and may be called multiple times during a player's interaction with
    the object. Performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary calls if the
    state already exists, as this method may involve some overhead.
  warnings: This method should not be used for tracking non-player-specific states
    unless explicitly required by game design. Misuse can lead to incorrect state
    management and potential synchronization issues in multiplayer environments.
