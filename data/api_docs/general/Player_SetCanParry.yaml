  class: Player
  method: SetCanParry
  signature: void Player::SetCanParry(bool value)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the player can parry attacks.
  description: This method controls the player's ability to parry incoming melee attacks.
    When enabled, the player will have a chance to parry weapons, which affects combat
    mechanics and damage reduction. The method directly modifies the player's parry
    chance stat and is typically used in conjunction with other combat-related methods
    or during specific game events.
  parameters:
  - name: value
    description: A boolean value indicating whether the player can parry attacks.
      True enables parry, false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetCanParry(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with conditional logic
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nif (player->GetCanParry()) {\n    player->SetCanParry(false);\n\
      }\nelse {\n    player->SetCanParry(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the player's parry chance calculation and may be overridden
    by other game mechanics such as talents or buffs. It should be used carefully
    during combat scenarios to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Setting this value to true when the player does not have a valid parry
    chance can lead to incorrect combat calculations. Always ensure that the player's
    parry chance is properly initialized before calling this method.
