  class: CreatureAI
  method: JustUnregisteredAreaTrigger
  signature: void CreatureAI::JustUnregisteredAreaTrigger(AreaTrigger * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Called when a creature's AI unregisters an area trigger.
  description: This method is invoked by the TrinityCore framework when a CreatureAI
    instance unregisters an AreaTrigger from its internal tracking system. It typically
    occurs during the cleanup or deactivation of an area trigger associated with the
    creature, such as when the trigger expires, is removed, or the creature is destroyed.
    This method allows the AI implementation to perform any necessary cleanup or state
    management related to the unregistered area trigger. The method serves as a callback
    mechanism for the AI to react to changes in area trigger registration status.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the AreaTrigger object that has been unregistered from
      the creature's AI system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Implementation Override
    code: "void MyCreatureAI::JustUnregisteredAreaTrigger(AreaTrigger* trigger)\n\
      {\n    // Perform cleanup or state changes when area trigger is unregistered\n\
      \    if (trigger && trigger->GetCaster() == me)\n    {\n        // Handle specific\
      \ logic for triggers cast by this creature\n        DoSomethingWithUnregisteredTrigger(trigger);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the CreatureAI callback system and is automatically
    invoked by the core framework. Developers should ensure that any cleanup or state
    management performed in this method does not introduce race conditions or performance
    bottlenecks, especially if multiple triggers are involved.
  warnings: Do not modify or delete the AreaTrigger pointer directly within this method
    unless you are certain of the ownership semantics. The framework may still reference
    the trigger after this call, and improper handling can lead to memory corruption
    or undefined behavior.
