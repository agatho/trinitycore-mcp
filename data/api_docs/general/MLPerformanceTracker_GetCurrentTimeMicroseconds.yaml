  method: GetCurrentTimeMicroseconds
  signature: uint64_t MLPerformanceTracker::GetCurrentTimeMicroseconds() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current time in microseconds for performance tracking purposes.
  description: The GetCurrentTimeMicroseconds method returns the current system time
    expressed as a 64-bit unsigned integer representing microseconds since an unspecified
    epoch. This method is typically used within the MLPerformanceTracker class to
    measure elapsed time between events, such as function execution duration or frame
    rendering times. The returned value can be used for high-resolution timing measurements
    required in performance monitoring and optimization tasks. It's important to note
    that the exact epoch reference point is implementation-defined and may vary depending
    on the underlying platform and system configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the current time in microseconds
    since an unspecified epoch. This value increases monotonically over time and can
    be used to calculate time differences between two measurements for performance
    analysis.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Performance Measurement
    code: 'MLPerformanceTracker tracker;

      uint64_t start = tracker.GetCurrentTimeMicroseconds();

      // Perform some operation

      uint64_t end = tracker.GetCurrentTimeMicroseconds();

      uint64_t elapsed = end - start;

      TC_LOG_INFO("performance", "Operation took %llu microseconds", elapsed);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Function Execution Time
    code: "void SomeImportantFunction() {\n    MLPerformanceTracker tracker;\n   \
      \ uint64_t start = tracker.GetCurrentTimeMicroseconds();\n    \n    // Critical\
      \ section of code\n    DoSomethingExpensive();\n    \n    uint64_t end = tracker.GetCurrentTimeMicroseconds();\n\
      \    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"performance\", \"Function executed in %llu microseconds\"\
      , (end - start));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the system's high-resolution timer and is suitable
    for performance measurements requiring microsecond precision. The implementation
    may use platform-specific APIs such as QueryPerformanceCounter on Windows or clock_gettime
    on Unix-like systems. The returned values are not guaranteed to be synchronized
    with wall-clock time, but they provide consistent monotonic increments for measuring
    intervals.
  warnings: Be aware that the epoch reference point is not standardized and may differ
    between platforms. For cross-platform compatibility, always use time differences
    rather than absolute values when comparing measurements across different systems
    or builds.
