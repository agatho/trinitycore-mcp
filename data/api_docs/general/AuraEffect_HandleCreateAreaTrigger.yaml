  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleCreateAreaTrigger(const AuraApplication * aurApp,
    uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Creates an area trigger effect for the aura application.
  description: This method handles the creation of area triggers associated with aura
    applications. It is invoked during aura application processing to generate visual
    effects or game mechanics related to area triggers, such as spell effects that
    create temporary areas of influence. The method operates on the aura application
    object and determines whether to apply or remove the area trigger based on the
    mode parameter. This functionality is essential for implementing effects like
    'Create Area Trigger' spells in World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object that contains the aura data
      and application information. This determines which specific aura is being processed.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode parameter specifies whether the area trigger should be applied
      (true) or removed (false). It typically corresponds to the aura effect index
      or action type.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply or remove the area trigger.
      This is used for determining the direction of the operation.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void AuraEffect::HandleCreateAreaTrigger(const AuraApplication * aurApp,\
      \ uint8 mode, bool apply) const {\n    // Implementation logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during aura application processing and may
    involve complex interactions with area trigger systems. It requires careful handling
    of the aura application context to ensure correct behavior.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to incorrect area trigger visual
    effects or game mechanics, potentially causing gameplay issues or crashes.
