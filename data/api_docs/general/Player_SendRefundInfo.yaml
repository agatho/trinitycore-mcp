documentation:
  brief: Sends refund information for a specific item to the player's client.
  description: The SendRefundInfo method is used to transmit refund-related data for
    a given item back to the player's client. This functionality is typically invoked
    when processing item refunds, such as during item destruction, disenchantment,
    or when a player returns an item for a refund. The method ensures that the client
    receives proper feedback regarding the refund status and any associated monetary
    or resource adjustments. It is part of the core communication system between the
    server and the client for handling item transactions.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to the Item object for which refund information is being
      sent. This parameter must be a valid pointer to an existing item in the player's
      inventory or associated with a transaction.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Item* refundItem = player->GetItemByGuid(itemGuid);\nif (refundItem)\n\
      {\n    player->SendRefundInfo(refundItem);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Refund Processing in Transaction Context
    code: "void ProcessItemRefund(Player* player, uint64 itemGuid)\n{\n    Item* item\
      \ = player->GetItemByGuid(itemGuid);\n    if (item && item->IsInWorld())\n \
      \   {\n        // Perform refund logic here\n        player->SendRefundInfo(item);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the client's UI to display refund information.
    It should only be called when the item is valid and accessible to the player,
    otherwise it may cause client-side errors or inconsistencies.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null or invalid item pointer can lead to undefined
    behavior or client crashes. Ensure that the item exists and is properly initialized
    before invoking this function.
