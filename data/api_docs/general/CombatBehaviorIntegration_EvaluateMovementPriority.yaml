  method: EvaluateMovementPriority
  signature: ActionUrgency CombatBehaviorIntegration::EvaluateMovementPriority()
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the urgency level of a character's movement action
    within combat.
  description: The EvaluateMovementPriority method determines the priority level of
    a character's movement behavior during combat scenarios. It assesses various factors
    such as threat level, target distance, available cover, and current combat state
    to assign an ActionUrgency value. This urgency rating helps the AI system prioritize
    between different movement actions like fleeing, chasing, or positioning. The
    method is typically called by the CombatBehaviorIntegration class to make dynamic
    decisions about when and how a character should move during encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an ActionUrgency enum value indicating the priority level of movement
    actions. Possible values include LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, or CRITICAL, representing
    increasing levels of urgency for immediate movement execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "ActionUrgency urgency = combatBehavior.EvaluateMovementPriority();\nif\
      \ (urgency >= ActionUrgency::HIGH)\n{\n    // Execute high-priority movement\n\
      \    character->MoveToTarget();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core combat decision-making system and should
    be called frequently during combat updates. The evaluation considers real-time
    combat data including health status, threat distribution, and environmental factors.
    Performance is optimized to run within a single frame update cycle.
  warnings: The method assumes valid combat state and may produce undefined behavior
    if called outside of active combat scenarios. Ensure that the character has a
    valid target and threat context before invoking this method.
