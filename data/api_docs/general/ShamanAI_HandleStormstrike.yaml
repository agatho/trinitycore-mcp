  class: ShamanAI
  method: HandleStormstrike
  signature: bool ShamanAI::HandleStormstrike(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the stormstrike ability execution for a shaman AI unit, determining
    if the ability can be cast and executing it.
  description: The HandleStormstrike method is responsible for managing the execution
    of the Stormstrike spell within the ShamanAI class. This method evaluates whether
    the shaman unit can perform the stormstrike ability based on various conditions
    such as mana availability, target validity, and cooldown status. It returns true
    if the ability was successfully executed or is in a state where it should proceed
    with the next action, and false otherwise. The method integrates with the core
    AI logic to ensure proper spell casting behavior according to shaman class mechanics
    and game rules.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target ID for the stormstrike
      ability. This parameter is used to identify which unit will be affected by the
      spell.
  returns: Returns true if the stormstrike ability was successfully executed or if
    the AI should continue processing other actions; returns false if the ability
    cannot be cast due to invalid conditions such as insufficient mana, invalid target,
    or cooldown restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "ShamanAI* shaman = reinterpret_cast<ShamanAI*>(unit->GetAI());\nint targetId\
      \ = 12345;\nbool result = shaman->HandleStormstrike(&targetId);\nif (result)\
      \ {\n    // Stormstrike was executed successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Logic
    code: "ShamanAI* shaman = reinterpret_cast<ShamanAI*>(unit->GetAI());\nUnit* target\
      \ = shaman->GetVictim();\nif (target && shaman->IsSpellReady(SPELL_STORMSTRIKE))\
      \ {\n    int targetId = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n    if (!shaman->HandleStormstrike(&targetId))\
      \ {\n        // Handle case where stormstrike could not be cast\n        shaman->DoNextAction();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the shaman AI behavior system and should only be called
    when the shaman unit has a valid target and sufficient resources. The method assumes
    that the target parameter points to a valid unit ID within the game world context.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer passed to this method is properly initialized
    and refers to a valid unit in the game world, otherwise the behavior may be undefined
    or cause crashes. This method does not perform any validation on the target itself
    beyond checking if it's a valid integer ID.
