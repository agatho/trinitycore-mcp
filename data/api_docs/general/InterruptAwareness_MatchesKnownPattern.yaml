  method: MatchesKnownPattern
  signature: bool InterruptAwareness::MatchesKnownPattern(int casterGuid, uint32 spellId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given caster GUID and spell ID match a known interrupt
    pattern.
  description: The MatchesKnownPattern method evaluates if a specific combination
    of caster GUID and spell ID corresponds to a predefined set of interruptible spells
    or abilities within the TrinityCore framework. This functionality is typically
    used in combat systems to determine if an incoming spell or ability should be
    interrupted by another action, such as a player's interrupt ability or a mob's
    interrupt mechanics. The method performs a lookup against internal data structures
    that define which spells are considered interruptible and under what conditions
    they can be interrupted.
  parameters:
  - name: casterGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the entity casting the spell. This
      value is used to identify the source of the spell for pattern matching.
  - name: spellId
    description: The ID of the spell being cast. This value identifies the specific
      spell for which interruptibility is being evaluated.
  returns: Returns true if the combination of caster GUID and spell ID matches a known
    interrupt pattern, indicating that the spell can potentially be interrupted. Returns
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a spell can be interrupted
    code: "if (interruptAwareness.MatchesKnownPattern(casterGuid, spellId)) {\n  \
      \  // Spell is interruptible\n    // Handle interrupt logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using within combat system to determine interrupt eligibility
    code: "bool canBeInterrupted = interruptAwareness.MatchesKnownPattern(playerGuid,\
      \ spellId);\nif (canBeInterrupted && player->HasAuraType(SPELL_AURA_INTERRUPT_CAST))\
      \ {\n    // Apply interrupt effect\n    player->CastSpell(target, INTERRUPT_SPELL_ID,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal data structures that define which spells are
    interruptible. These definitions may be loaded from database tables or hardcoded
    configurations depending on the implementation. The performance of this method
    depends on how efficiently the pattern matching is implemented internally, typically
    using hash maps or similar fast lookup structures.
  warnings: Ensure that both casterGuid and spellId are valid before calling this
    method to avoid unexpected behavior. Incorrectly matched patterns could lead to
    unintended interrupt mechanics in combat.
