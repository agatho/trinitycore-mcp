  class: Guild

  signature: void Guild::SwapItems(Player * player, uint8 tabId, uint8 slotId, uint8
    destTabId, uint8 destSlotId, uint32 splitedAmount)
documentation:
  brief: Swaps items between two slots within a guild's inventory.
  description: The SwapItems method facilitates the movement of items within a guild's
    inventory by swapping the contents of two specified slots. This operation occurs
    within the context of a guild's bank, where players can manage their guild's stored
    items. The method handles the logic for moving items between different tabs and
    slots, including cases where items are split into multiple stacks during the swap
    process. It ensures proper synchronization of inventory changes with the game
    state and updates related data structures accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object initiating the swap operation. This
      player must be a member of the guild and have appropriate permissions to access
      the guild bank.
  - name: tabId
    description: The source tab identifier (0-6) from which the item will be swapped.
      Each tab represents a different category or section of the guild bank inventory.
  - name: slotId
    description: The source slot identifier (0-63) within the specified tab where
      the item currently resides.
  - name: destTabId
    description: The destination tab identifier (0-6) to which the item will be moved.
      Can be the same as tabId for swapping within the same tab.
  - name: destSlotId
    description: The destination slot identifier (0-63) within the specified destination
      tab where the item will be placed.
  - name: splitedAmount
    description: The number of items to split and move during the swap operation.
      If 0, the entire stack is swapped; otherwise, only the specified quantity is
      moved.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic item swap within same tab
    code: 'Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();

      guild->SwapItems(player, 0, 5, 0, 10, 0); // Swap items between slot 5 and 10
      in tab 0'
    language: cpp
  - title: Partial item split during swap
    code: 'Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();

      guild->SwapItems(player, 1, 3, 2, 7, 5); // Move 5 items from slot 3 in tab
      1 to slot 7 in tab 2'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked when a player interacts with the guild bank
    interface and attempts to rearrange items. The implementation handles validation
    of permissions, item stack limits, and ensures that the swap operation does not
    violate any game rules or constraints. It may trigger updates to the guild's bank
    tab configuration and inventory state.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method with splitedAmount values, as
    incorrect usage can lead to inconsistent inventory states or item loss. The player
    parameter must be validated to ensure they have proper access rights to the guild
    bank before calling this method.
