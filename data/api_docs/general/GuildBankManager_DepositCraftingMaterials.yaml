documentation:
  brief: Deposits crafting materials from a player's inventory into the guild bank.
  description: The DepositCraftingMaterials method transfers all applicable crafting
    materials owned by a specified player into the guild's bank storage. This function
    is typically invoked when a player wishes to contribute their collected crafting
    resources to the guild's shared supply. The method handles validation of item
    types, ensures sufficient quantities exist in the player's inventory, and updates
    both the player's inventory and the guild bank accordingly. It operates within
    the context of World of Warcraft's guild banking system, where players can store
    and retrieve items using guild permissions and restrictions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) in the game world. This value is used to locate and access the specific
      player's inventory and guild bank data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildBankManager bankManager;

      bankManager.DepositCraftingMaterials(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has appropriate permissions to access
    the guild bank and that the guild bank is properly initialized. The function may
    perform internal checks for item validity and inventory capacity before proceeding
    with the deposit operation.
  warnings: Improper handling of the player GUID pointer could lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the player exists in the game world and has a valid session
    before calling this method.
