  class: PlayerAI
  method: DoAutoAttackIfReady
  signature: void PlayerAI::DoAutoAttackIfReady()
documentation:
  brief: Performs an auto attack if the player is ready to attack.
  description: The DoAutoAttackIfReady method checks whether the player's current
    weapon is ready to perform an auto attack, considering factors such as attack
    speed and combat state. If the conditions are met, it initiates the auto attack
    sequence. This method is typically called during the AI update cycle to handle
    automatic melee attacks for player characters in combat. It ensures that the player
    does not attack faster than their weapon's attack speed allows and only performs
    attacks when in a valid combat state.

  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void PlayerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n  \
      \      DoAutoAttackIfReady();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core combat system and integrates with the player's
    attack speed calculations. It should only be called when the player is in a valid
    combat state to avoid unnecessary processing.
