  class: DefensiveBehaviorManager
  method: Reset
  signature: void DefensiveBehaviorManager::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the defensive behavior manager to its default state, clearing all
    active defensive actions and restoring initial configuration.
  description: The Reset method initializes or reinitializes the DefensiveBehaviorManager
    by clearing any existing defensive behaviors, resetting internal counters, and
    preparing the manager for a fresh set of defensive actions. This method is typically
    invoked when a creature's combat state changes, such as when entering or exiting
    combat, or during AI initialization. It ensures that all defensive behavior flags
    and timers are cleared and reset to their default values, allowing the AI to properly
    evaluate new defensive strategies based on current conditions.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: "void OnEnterCombat(Unit* target)\n{\n    m_defensiveBehaviorManager.Reset();\n\
      \    // Defensive behaviors are now reset and ready for new combat evaluation\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before applying new defensive behavior configurations
    to ensure clean state. It does not directly affect the creature's health or target,
    but rather prepares the AI manager for subsequent behavior updates.
