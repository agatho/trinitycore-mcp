  signature: void Battlefield::SendWarning(int id, const int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a warning message to players in the battlefield.
  description: The SendWarning method is used to broadcast a warning message to all
    players participating in a specific battlefield. This method typically handles
    the communication of important game events, such as timer warnings, objective
    changes, or other critical information that players need to be aware of during
    battlefield operations. The method takes an identifier for the warning type and
    an optional target array which may specify which players or entities should receive
    the warning. It is part of the battlefield management system in TrinityCore and
    integrates with the game's messaging infrastructure.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: An integer identifier that specifies the type or category of the
      warning message to be sent. This ID maps to a predefined warning message in
      the game's localization system.
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to an array of integers representing target identifiers
      (such as player GUIDs or group IDs) that should receive the warning. If null,
      the warning is broadcast to all players in the battlefield.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Send a general battlefield warning to all players
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(1234);\n\
      if (bf)\n{\n    bf->SendWarning(5001, nullptr); // Warning ID 5001 to all players\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Send a targeted warning to specific players
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(1234);\n\
      uint32 targetGuids[] = { 1001, 1002, 1003 };\nif (bf)\n{\n    bf->SendWarning(5002,\
      \ targetGuids); // Warning ID 5002 to specific players\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely uses internal messaging systems to ensure warnings are
    delivered efficiently. It may rely on localization files for message text and
    is expected to be thread-safe when used from within the game's main thread context.
  warnings: Ensure that the warning ID corresponds to a valid localized message; otherwise,
    no message will be displayed to players. Passing an invalid target array pointer
    or incorrect GUIDs can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
