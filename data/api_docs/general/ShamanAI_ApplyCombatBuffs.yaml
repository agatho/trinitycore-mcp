  signature: void ShamanAI::ApplyCombatBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Applies combat buffs to the shaman's target based on current combat state
    and spell availability.
  description: The ApplyCombatBuffs method is responsible for applying appropriate
    combat-related buffs to the shaman's current target or self, depending on the
    shaman's role in combat. This method typically evaluates the combat situation
    and selects suitable buff spells such as Strength of Earth, Windfury Weapon, or
    other applicable enhancements. It ensures that the shaman maintains optimal performance
    during combat by automatically applying beneficial effects. The method respects
    cooldowns and resource constraints, ensuring that buffs are only applied when
    viable. This functionality is part of the core AI behavior for shaman class in
    TrinityCore's AI system.

  - title: Basic usage within AI update loop
    code: "void ShamanAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        AttackStart(m_creature->getVictim());\n    \n    if (m_creature->IsInCombat())\n\
      \        ApplyCombatBuffs();\n    \n    // Other AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active combat situations. It relies
    on the shaman's current target and spell availability to determine which buffs
    to apply. The implementation may vary based on the specific shaman specialization
    (Elemental, Enhancement, or Restoration).
