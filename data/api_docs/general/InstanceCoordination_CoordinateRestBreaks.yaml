  signature: void InstanceCoordination::CoordinateRestBreaks(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates rest breaks for all members of a group within an instance.
  description: The CoordinateRestBreaks method manages and synchronizes rest break
    activities for players within a group during instance play. It ensures that group
    members can properly rest and recover resources while maintaining synchronization
    with the instance's internal state. This method is typically invoked when a player
    initiates a rest break or when the system needs to enforce rest timing across
    group members. The functionality helps maintain game balance by preventing players
    from exploiting rest mechanics for unfair advantages, particularly in raid environments
    where coordinated actions are crucial.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (playerGroup)\n{\n    instanceCoordination->CoordinateRestBreaks(playerGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the instance's internal timer and synchronization
    systems to ensure all group members follow consistent rest break protocols. It
    may be called automatically by the game engine upon certain events or manually
    by system logic.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method could lead to desynchronization between
    players in a group, potentially causing issues with instance completion or resource
    management. Ensure that the group parameter is valid before calling this method.
