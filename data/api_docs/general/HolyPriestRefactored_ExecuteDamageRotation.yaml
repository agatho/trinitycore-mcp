  method: ExecuteDamageRotation
  signature: void HolyPriestRefactored::ExecuteDamageRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the damage rotation logic for a Holy Priest AI, targeting the specified
    enemy.
  description: The ExecuteDamageRotation method is responsible for performing the
    core damage-dealing actions of a Holy Priest AI in TrinityCore. This method typically
    selects and applies appropriate spells or abilities based on the current combat
    state and target conditions. It may involve managing spell cooldowns, checking
    mana availability, and prioritizing damage-over-time effects or direct damage
    spells. The method operates within the context of an AI behavior system where
    it's called during the execution phase of the priest's combat routine. It assumes
    a valid target has been previously identified and passed as a parameter.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier (GUID)
      in the game world. This value should correspond to a valid enemy unit within
      the AI's awareness range.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int targetGuid = 12345;

      this->ExecuteDamageRotation(&targetGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Combat Loop
    code: "void HolyPriestAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        ExecuteDamageRotation(&target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger AI framework and relies on other internal
    state management functions such as spell selection, cooldown tracking, and mana
    calculations. It should only be called when the priest has an active target and
    sufficient resources to perform damage actions.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer points to a valid enemy unit before calling
    this method, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. The method does not validate
    the target's existence or combat status internally.
