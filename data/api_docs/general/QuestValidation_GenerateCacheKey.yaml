  class: QuestValidation
  method: GenerateCacheKey
  signature: uint64 QuestValidation::GenerateCacheKey(uint32 questId, uint32 botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a unique cache key for quest validation based on quest ID and bot
    GUID.
  description: The GenerateCacheKey method creates a deterministic 64-bit hash value
    used to uniquely identify a specific quest validation request within the TrinityCore
    framework. This cache key combines the provided quest identifier and bot GUID
    into a single uint64 value, which is typically used for caching or indexing purposes
    in quest-related systems. The method ensures that each unique combination of quest
    ID and bot GUID produces a distinct cache key, enabling efficient lookup and retrieval
    of cached quest validation results. This functionality is particularly useful
    in scenarios where multiple bots may be validating the same quest, allowing the
    system to avoid redundant computations while maintaining data integrity.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest being validated. Must be a positive
      integer representing a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: botGuid
    description: The global unique identifier of the bot performing the quest validation.
      This typically corresponds to the GUID of a player or NPC bot within the game
      world.
  returns: A 64-bit unsigned integer (uint64) that serves as a unique cache key for
    the specified quest and bot combination. The value is deterministic based on the
    input parameters and can be used for indexing, caching, or lookup operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint64 cacheKey = QuestValidation::GenerateCacheKey(12345, 67890);

      // Returns a deterministic uint64 value based on quest ID 12345 and bot GUID
      67890'
    language: cpp
  - title: Caching Implementation
    code: "uint64 key = QuestValidation::GenerateCacheKey(player->GetQuestId(), player->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      if (cache.find(key) != cache.end()) {\n    // Use cached result\n} else {\n\
      \    // Perform validation and store result in cache\n    cache[key] = ValidateQuest(player,\
      \ questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is designed to be deterministic, meaning the same inputs will
    always produce the same output. This ensures consistent caching behavior across
    different parts of the application. The implementation likely uses bit manipulation
    or hashing techniques to combine the two 32-bit values into a single 64-bit key.
    Performance-wise, this operation is very fast as it's a simple mathematical combination
    of two integers.
  warnings: Ensure that both questId and botGuid are valid and non-zero before calling
    this method, as invalid inputs may lead to unexpected cache key collisions or
    incorrect behavior in caching systems. Be aware that if the same quest ID is used
    with different bot GUIDs, they will generate different cache keys, which is expected
    behavior for proper isolation.
