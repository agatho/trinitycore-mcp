  class: HunterAI
  method: GetPetHealthPercent
  signature: float HunterAI::GetPetHealthPercent() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current health percentage of the hunter's pet.
  description: The GetPetHealthPercent method retrieves the health status of the hunter's
    summoned pet as a percentage value. This utility function is commonly used by
    AI logic to make decisions based on pet condition, such as when to cast healing
    spells or reposition the pet. The returned value is a floating-point number between
    0.0 and 100.0, where 0.0 indicates the pet is dead and 100.0 indicates full health.
    This method relies on the internal state of the pet managed by the HunterAI class
    and does not perform any direct database or network calls.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the pet's current health as a percentage. Returns
    0.0 if the pet is dead or invalid, and 100.0 if the pet has full health. Values
    between 0.0 and 100.0 indicate proportional health loss.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine pet health status
    code: "float petHealthPercent = hunterAI->GetPetHealthPercent();\nif (petHealthPercent\
      \ < 30.0f)\n{\n    // Pet is critically low on health, consider casting a heal\n\
      \    DoCastSpellIfCan(me->GetPet(), SPELL_PET_HEAL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using pet health percent for tactical AI decisions
    code: "float petHealth = hunterAI->GetPetHealthPercent();\nif (petHealth > 75.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Pet is healthy, continue with aggressive tactics\n    AttackStart(target);\n\
      }\nelse if (petHealth > 25.0f)\n{\n    // Pet is moderately injured, consider\
      \ retreat or healing\n    DoCastSpellIfCan(me->GetPet(), SPELL_PET_MEND);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Pet is nearly dead, prioritize survival over offense\n  \
      \  DoCastSpellIfCan(me, SPELL_ESCAPE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the hunter has an active pet and that the pet's
    health state is properly maintained by the AI system. The returned value reflects
    the last known health state and may not be updated in real-time during combat
    if the AI does not poll for changes frequently.
  warnings: Do not use this method if the hunter does not have a valid pet, as it
    may return unexpected values or cause undefined behavior. Always validate that
    the pet exists before calling this function to avoid potential crashes or incorrect
    logic flow.
