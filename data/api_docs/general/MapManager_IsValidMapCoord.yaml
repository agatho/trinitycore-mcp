  class: MapManager
  method: IsValidMapCoord
  signature: bool MapManager::IsValidMapCoord(const int & loc)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether the specified map coordinate is within valid bounds.
  description: The IsValidMapCoord method checks if a given map coordinate falls within
    the acceptable range for world maps in TrinityCore. This validation ensures that
    coordinates used for positioning, movement, or location-based operations are not
    outside the defined map boundaries. The method typically performs boundary checking
    against internal map limits to prevent invalid data from causing errors or unexpected
    behavior in the game world. It is commonly used before processing map-related
    operations to ensure data integrity.
  parameters:
  - name: loc
    description: The map coordinate value to validate, typically representing a position
      within a map's coordinate system.
  returns: Returns true if the specified map coordinate is within valid bounds; otherwise
    returns false if the coordinate is outside acceptable range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation of map coordinate
    code: "int coord = 500;\nif (MapManager::IsValidMapCoord(coord)) {\n    // Coordinate\
      \ is valid, proceed with map operations\n    printf(\"Valid coordinate: %d\\\
      n\", coord);\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid coordinate\n    printf(\"Invalid\
      \ coordinate: %d\\n\", coord);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in map-based game logic
    code: "class Player {\npublic:\n    bool SetPosition(int x, int y) {\n       \
      \ if (MapManager::IsValidMapCoord(x) && MapManager::IsValidMapCoord(y)) {\n\
      \            posX = x;\n            posY = y;\n            return true;\n  \
      \      }\n        return false;\n    }\nprivate:\n    int posX, posY;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs bounds checking against predefined map dimensions.
    It's important to note that the exact coordinate range may vary depending on the
    specific map implementation and game version. The validation is typically fast
    and lightweight, making it suitable for frequent checks during gameplay.
  warnings: Ensure that the input coordinate values are properly sanitized before
    calling this method, as invalid data types or unexpected ranges could lead to
    incorrect validation results. This method should not be used as a replacement
    for more comprehensive map boundary checking in complex scenarios.
