documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables debug logging for bot chat commands.
  description: The SetDebugLogging method controls whether detailed debug information
    is output when processing bot chat commands. When enabled, this feature logs internal
    operations and state changes to aid in troubleshooting and development. The setting
    is typically used during development or debugging sessions to gain insight into
    how bot commands are processed within the TrinityCore framework. This method does
    not require any specific preconditions but affects logging behavior immediately
    upon invocation.

  examples:
  - title: Enable Debug Logging
    code: 'BotChatCommandHandler handler;

      handler.SetDebugLogging(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Debug Logging
    code: 'BotChatCommandHandler handler;

      handler.SetDebugLogging(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies an internal flag within the BotChatCommandHandler
    class that determines whether debug messages are written to the log. It may be
    used in conjunction with other logging mechanisms or command processing functions.
