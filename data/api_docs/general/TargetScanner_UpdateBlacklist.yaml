documentation:
  brief: Updates the target blacklist with expired entries removed based on current
    time.
  description: The UpdateBlacklist method is responsible for maintaining the list
    of targets that are temporarily blacklisted from being selected by AI systems.
    It removes any entries from the blacklist whose expiration time has passed, ensuring
    that the system only considers validly blacklisted targets. This method is typically
    called periodically during AI update cycles to keep the blacklist in sync with
    current game state and target availability. The method operates on a time-based
    system where each blacklist entry contains a timestamp indicating when it should
    expire.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void AIUpdate()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    targetScanner.UpdateBlacklist(getCurrentTime());\n\
      \    // ... continue with target selection ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the internal blacklist storage maintains entries
    with valid expiration timestamps. It's important that the currentTime parameter
    accurately reflects the current game time to ensure proper expiration handling.
    The method is designed to be called frequently during AI update cycles for optimal
    performance.
