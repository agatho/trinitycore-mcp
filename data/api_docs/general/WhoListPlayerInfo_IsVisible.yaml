  class: WhoListPlayerInfo
  method: IsVisible
  signature: bool WhoListPlayerInfo::IsVisible() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player is visible in the who list.
  description: The IsVisible method checks if a player should be included in the who
    list response. This visibility check considers various game states such as invisibility
    effects, stealth status, gm-only visibility settings, and other player state conditions
    that might prevent a player from appearing in who lists. The method returns true
    if the player is visible to the querying client, and false otherwise. This functionality
    is crucial for maintaining proper privacy and game balance in World of Warcraft's
    who system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is visible in who lists, false if they are hidden
    due to invisibility, stealth, or other visibility restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Check Player Visibility
    code: "WhoListPlayerInfo* playerInfo = ...;\nif (playerInfo->IsVisible()) {\n\
      \    // Player is visible in who list\n    std::cout << \"Player is visible\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Player is hidden from who list\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Player is not visible\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against the player's current state flags
    and GM visibility settings. It may also consider the querying player's permissions
    to see hidden players.
