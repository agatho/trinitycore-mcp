documentation:
  brief: Reduces the memory footprint of the packet pool by releasing unused memory
    blocks.
  description: The Shrink method is designed to optimize memory usage within the PacketPoolManager
    by releasing memory blocks that are no longer needed. This method helps in reducing
    memory fragmentation and overall memory consumption, particularly useful during
    periods of low activity or when the server needs to free up resources. It operates
    on the internal memory pools used for packet allocation and deallocation, ensuring
    efficient resource management without affecting active connections or ongoing
    operations.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: PacketPoolManager::instance()->Shrink();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called sparingly as it may cause a brief pause in memory
    operations. It is typically invoked during server maintenance windows or low-traffic
    periods to maximize memory efficiency.
