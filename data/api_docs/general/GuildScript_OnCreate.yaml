documentation:
  brief: Called when a new guild is created in the game world
  description: The OnCreate method is a callback function that gets invoked whenever
    a new guild is successfully formed in TrinityCore. This method provides scripters
    with an opportunity to execute custom logic, such as logging, event triggering,
    or modifying guild properties immediately after creation. The method receives
    the newly created Guild object, the Player who became the leader, and the guild's
    name as parameters. It is typically used in custom scripts or addons to extend
    or modify default guild creation behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: guild
    description: Pointer to the newly created Guild object that was just formed in
      the game world
  - name: leader
    description: Pointer to the Player object who became the leader of the new guild
  - name: name
    description: String containing the name of the newly created guild
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Creation Logging
    code: "class MyGuildScript : public GuildScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnCreate(Guild*\
      \ guild, Player* leader, const std::string& name) override\n    {\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      New guild created: %s, led by %s\", name.c_str(), leader->GetName().c_str());\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Initial Guild Permissions
    code: "class MyGuildScript : public GuildScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnCreate(Guild*\
      \ guild, Player* leader, const std::string& name) override\n    {\n        //\
      \ Set default permissions for the new guild\n        guild->SetGuildMaster(leader);\n\
      \        guild->SetEmblemInfo(0, 0, 0, 0);\n        // Additional initialization\
      \ logic here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during the guild creation process, after all validation
    checks have passed but before the guild is fully initialized and available to
    players. Scripters should avoid modifying the guild's core data structures extensively
    in this callback as the guild may not be completely ready for interaction.
  warnings: Do not attempt to delete or modify the Guild object directly within this
    method unless you are certain of its lifecycle. Modifying the leader player object
    during this call could lead to unexpected behavior if other systems are also accessing
    it.
