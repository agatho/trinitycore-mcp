documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of available talent specializations for a specified
    class
  description: The GetAvailableSpecs method returns the count of talent specializations
    that are available for a given player class. This method is used in the context
    of bot AI behavior to determine how many different talent trees can be chosen
    for a specific class. The returned value represents the total number of specs
    that are valid and enabled for the specified class within the game's current configuration.
    This information is crucial for bot decision-making processes when selecting talent
    builds, particularly in scenarios where bots need to optimize their gameplay based
    on available specialization options.
  parameters:
  - name: cls
    description: The class identifier (uint8) for which to retrieve available specializations.
      Valid values correspond to standard World of Warcraft class IDs (e.g., 1 = Warrior,
      2 = Paladin, 3 = Hunter, etc.).
  returns: An integer representing the number of available talent specializations
    for the specified class. Returns 0 if the class is invalid or has no valid specs
    configured.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Determine Class Specs
    code: "uint8 playerClass = 3; // Hunter\nint specCount = botTalentManager->GetAvailableSpecs(playerClass);\n\
      if (specCount > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Hunter has %d available specializations\\\
      n\", specCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Spec Count for Bot Talent Selection Logic
    code: "uint8 botClass = player->getClass();\nint availableSpecs = botTalentManager->GetAvailableSpecs(botClass);\n\
      if (availableSpecs > 0)\n{\n    // Bot can proceed with spec-based talent allocation\n\
      \    uint8 selectedSpec = urand(0, availableSpecs - 1); // Random spec selection\n\
      \    // Apply selected spec to bot's talent build\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal game data structures that define class-specific
    talent trees. The implementation may cache results or access static configuration
    data, making repeated calls efficient. It should be noted that the returned value
    corresponds to the number of valid specs and not necessarily the total possible
    specs in the game, as some may be disabled via game rules or expansions.
  warnings: Ensure that the class parameter passed is a valid class ID; invalid IDs
    might return unexpected values or cause undefined behavior. This method should
    only be called during appropriate game states where class configurations are fully
    initialized and loaded.
