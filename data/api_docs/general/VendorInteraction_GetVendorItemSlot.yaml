api:
  class: VendorInteraction
  method: GetVendorItemSlot
  signature: int32 VendorInteraction::GetVendorItemSlot(Creature * vendor, uint32
    itemId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the slot index of a specific item in a vendor's inventory.
  description: The GetVendorItemSlot method searches through a vendor's item list
    to find the slot index where a specified item is located. This function is commonly
    used in vendor-related interactions, such as checking if an item is available
    for purchase or determining the position of an item within the vendor's inventory
    interface. The method returns -1 if the item is not found in the vendor's inventory.
    It is important to note that this method operates on the vendor's current item
    list and may not reflect dynamic changes made during runtime unless the vendor's
    inventory has been refreshed.
  parameters:
  - name: vendor
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the vendor whose inventory
      is being searched. Must be a valid creature with vendor data.
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier (entry ID) of the item to locate within the
      vendor's inventory. Must correspond to a valid item in the game database.
  returns: Returns an int32 representing the slot index of the item in the vendor's
    inventory. Returns -1 if the item is not found or if the vendor has no items.
  examples:
  - title: Find Item Slot in Vendor
    code: "Creature* vendor = ...; // Assume valid vendor pointer\nuint32 itemId =\
      \ 12345;\nint32 slot = vendorInteraction.GetVendorItemSlot(vendor, itemId);\n\
      if (slot >= 0)\n{\n    // Item found at slot 'slot'\n    printf(\"Item found\
      \ at slot %d\\n\", slot);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Item not available in vendor's\
      \ inventory\n    printf(\"Item not found in vendor's inventory\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the vendor's item list is already populated and
    up-to-date. If items are added or removed dynamically during runtime, the vendor
    should be refreshed before calling this method to ensure accurate results.
  warnings: Ensure that the vendor pointer is valid and points to a creature with
    vendor data; otherwise, behavior is undefined. Also, be aware that slot indices
    may change if the vendor's inventory is modified after this method is called.
