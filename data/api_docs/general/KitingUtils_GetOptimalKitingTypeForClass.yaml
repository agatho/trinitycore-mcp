  signature: KitingType KitingUtils::GetOptimalKitingTypeForClass(uint8 playerClass)
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the optimal kiting type for a given player class in
    World of Warcraft.
  description: The GetOptimalKitingTypeForClass method evaluates the specified player
    class and returns the most appropriate kiting type that aligns with gameplay mechanics
    and class capabilities. Kiting refers to the technique of maintaining distance
    from enemies while dealing damage, often used in PvP and PvE scenarios. This method
    is typically used by AI systems or game logic to determine how a character should
    engage enemies based on their class. The returned KitingType enum value indicates
    whether the class prefers aggressive kiting, defensive kiting, or another specialized
    kiting strategy. The method assumes valid class input and does not perform validation
    checks.
  parameters: []
  returns: A KitingType enumeration value representing the optimal kiting behavior
    for the specified player class. Possible values may include AGGRESSIVE_KITING,
    DEFENSIVE_KITING, or SPECIALIZED_KITING depending on class-specific mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'KitingType kitingType = KitingUtils::GetOptimalKitingTypeForClass(CLASS_WARRIOR);

      // Returns AGGRESSIVE_KITING for Warriors'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI Logic
    code: "uint8 playerClass = player->getClass();\nKitingType optimalKiting = KitingUtils::GetOptimalKitingTypeForClass(playerClass);\n\
      if (optimalKiting == AGGRESSIVE_KITING)\n{\n    // Set behavior for aggressive\
      \ kiting\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's AI and gameplay system. It should
    only be called with valid class identifiers from the game's class enumeration.
    The implementation relies on hardcoded mappings or lookup tables specific to each
    class, which may vary between different versions of the core.
  warnings: Ensure that the input parameter 'playerClass' is a valid class identifier
    (e.g., CLASS_WARRIOR, CLASS_MAGE) as invalid values might lead to undefined behavior.
    Do not call this method without proper initialization of the KitingUtils system.
