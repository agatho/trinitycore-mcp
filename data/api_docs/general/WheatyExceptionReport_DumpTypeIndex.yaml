  method: DumpTypeIndex
  signature: void WheatyExceptionReport::DumpTypeIndex(DWORD64 param0, DWORD param1,
    DWORD_PTR param2, bool & param3, const char * param4, const char * param5, bool
    param6, bool param7)
documentation:
  brief: Dumps type index information for exception reporting purposes.
  description: The DumpTypeIndex method is used within the WheatyExceptionReport class
    to output detailed type index information when an exception occurs. This functionality
    is typically employed for debugging and crash analysis in TrinityCore, allowing
    developers to inspect memory structures and object types at the time of an exception.
    The method takes various parameters related to memory addresses, flags, and string
    identifiers to provide comprehensive diagnostic data. It serves as part of the
    broader exception handling and reporting infrastructure that helps maintain server
    stability and aids in identifying root causes of runtime errors.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing a memory address or type identifier
      used for locating specific object types in memory.
  - name: param1
    description: A 32-bit unsigned integer that likely represents a size, count, or
      flag value associated with the type index being dumped.
  - name: param2
    description: A pointer-sized unsigned integer used for storing additional context
      information, potentially representing an offset or memory location.
  - name: param3
    description: A boolean reference parameter that may control whether the dump operation
      should proceed or be skipped based on certain conditions.
  - name: param4
    description: A null-terminated character string providing a descriptive label
      or name for the type being dumped, used in diagnostic output.
  - name: param5
    description: Another null-terminated character string that may contain additional
      metadata or context about the type index, such as a file path or module name.
  - name: param6
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether additional verbose output should
      be generated during the dumping process.
  - name: param7
    description: A boolean flag that likely controls whether the method should attempt
      to resolve symbol information or perform deeper analysis of the type index.
  returns: null

    code: 'WheatyExceptionReport reporter;

      bool shouldDump = true;

      reporter.DumpTypeIndex(0x123456789ABCDEF0, 1024, (DWORD_PTR)0xDEADBEEF, shouldDump,
      "PlayerObject", "WorldSession.cpp", true, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in debugging scenarios and crash dumps within
    TrinityCore. It's not intended for regular gameplay code execution. The parameters
    are designed to provide maximum flexibility for different types of memory diagnostics.
    Performance impact should be minimal unless verbose output is enabled.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid memory addresses can cause crashes or
    undefined behavior. Ensure that all pointers and addresses passed are valid before
    invoking this function. The boolean reference parameter 'param3' must be properly
    initialized to avoid unexpected control flow.
