  brief: Moves the contents of another CharacterCache instance to this instance
  description: The move assignment operator for CharacterCache transfers all resources
    and data from the source CharacterCache object to the current object, leaving
    the source in a valid but unspecified state. This operation is typically used
    to efficiently transfer ownership of cached character data without unnecessary
    copying. The method is part of the standard C++ move semantics implementation
    and allows for efficient resource management when working with temporary or scoped
    CharacterCache objects. In the context of TrinityCore's architecture, this operator
    supports efficient handling of character data caching during player login, logout,
    and world state transitions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current CharacterCache object after the move operation
    has completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'CharacterCache cache1;

      CharacterCache cache2 = std::move(cache1); // Uses move assignment

      // cache1 is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // cache2 contains all data previously in cache1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Function Context
    code: "CharacterCache CreateCache() {\n    CharacterCache cache;\n    // populate\
      \ cache with character data\n    return cache; // move semantics automatically\
      \ used\n}\n\nvoid ProcessCharacterData() {\n    CharacterCache mainCache = CreateCache();\n\
      \    // mainCache now owns the character data from CreateCache\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator implements move semantics which is crucial for performance
    optimization in TrinityCore's caching system. The move operation typically involves
    transferring pointers or handles rather than copying large data structures, making
    it much more efficient than copy operations. The source object after a move operation
    should not be used unless re-assigned or moved from again.
  warnings: After calling this operator, the source CharacterCache object should not
    be accessed as its state is undefined but valid. Attempting to use the moved-from
    object may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This is standard C++ move semantics
    behavior that developers must understand when working with resource management.
