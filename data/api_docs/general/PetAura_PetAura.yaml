  signature: void PetAura::PetAura(uint32 petEntry, uint32 aura, bool _removeOnChangePet,
    int _damage)
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes a specified aura on a pet based on the given entry and
    damage parameters.
  description: The PetAura method is used to manage auras applied to a player's pet
    within the TrinityCore framework. It allows for adding or removing specific auras
    based on the pet's entry ID, the aura ID to apply, and optional parameters that
    control removal behavior and damage application. This method is typically used
    in conjunction with pet management systems to dynamically alter pet abilities
    or status effects during gameplay. The method does not return any value but modifies
    the state of the pet's aura system directly.
  parameters:
  - name: petEntry
    description: The unique identifier (entry ID) of the pet for which the aura will
      be applied or removed. This corresponds to the creature_template entry in the
      database.
  - name: aura
    description: The aura ID to apply or remove from the pet. This represents a specific
      spell effect or buff/debuff that is defined in the game's spell database.
  - name: _removeOnChangePet
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the aura should be removed when the
      player changes pets. If true, the aura will be cleared upon pet switch; if false,
      it persists across pet changes.
  - name: _damage
    description: An integer value that determines how damage is applied or calculated
      for the aura. Negative values typically indicate damage application, while positive
      values may represent healing or other effects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Apply a Damage Aura to a Pet
    code: PetAura(12345, 67890, true, -50); // Applies aura ID 67890 to pet entry
      12345 with 50 damage, removes on pet change
    language: cpp
  - title: Apply Healing Aura Without Removal
    code: PetAura(98765, 54321, false, 100); // Applies aura ID 54321 to pet entry
      98765 with 100 healing, persists across pet changes
    language: cpp
  notes: This method interacts directly with the pet's aura system and should be called
    only when a valid pet is active. The method assumes that the provided petEntry
    and aura IDs are valid within the game database. It may trigger internal callbacks
    related to aura application or removal, affecting pet behavior.
  warnings: Incorrect pet entry IDs or invalid aura IDs can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure all parameters are validated before calling this method. The
    _removeOnChangePet flag should be carefully considered as it affects player experience
    during pet switching.
