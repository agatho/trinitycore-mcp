  class: WorldSession
  method: GetWarden
  signature: const Warden * WorldSession::GetWarden() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the Warden instance associated with this session for anti-cheat protection.
  description: The GetWarden method retrieves the Warden object that manages anti-cheat
    measures for the current WorldSession. Warden is TrinityCore's implementation
    of Blizzard's anti-cheat system, which monitors client behavior and detects cheating
    attempts. This method provides access to the Warden instance that handles security
    checks, data encryption, and client validation for the connected player. The returned
    pointer may be null if the session has not yet initialized Warden protection or
    if the player is not subject to anti-cheat monitoring.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the Warden object associated with this session, or nullptr
    if no Warden instance exists for the session.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Warden for Anti-Cheat Checks
    code: "if (Warden* warden = session->GetWarden())\n{\n    // Perform anti-cheat\
      \ related operations\n    warden->SendModule();\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case\
      \ where no Warden is active\n    sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"No Warden\
      \ active for session\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Warden pointer should not be modified or deleted by the caller.
    The lifetime of the Warden object is managed internally by the WorldSession and
    may change during the session's lifecycle. This method is typically used in security-related
    code paths where anti-cheat functionality needs to be accessed.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-null return value means the Warden is fully initialized
    or active for all checks. Always verify the Warden state before performing operations
    that depend on anti-cheat functionality.
