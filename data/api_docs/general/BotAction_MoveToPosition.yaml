api:
  class: BotAction
  method: MoveToPosition
  signature: BotAction BotAction::MoveToPosition(int bot, const int & pos, uint32
    timestamp)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a bot movement action to a specified position in the game world.
  description: The MoveToPosition method creates and returns a BotAction object that
    instructs a specific bot to move to a given location. This method is typically
    used within AI logic to control bot behavior, allowing developers to programmatically
    direct bots to navigate to particular coordinates or waypoints. The action is
    queued for execution by the bot's movement system and may involve pathfinding
    to reach the target position. The timestamp parameter likely indicates when the
    movement should begin or how long the action should remain valid.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: The unique identifier of the bot that will perform the movement action.
  - name: pos
    description: Reference to an integer array or structure representing the target
      coordinates (x, y, z) in the game world.
  - name: timestamp
    description: A time value used to determine when the movement action should be
      executed or how long it remains active.
  returns: Returns a BotAction object that encapsulates the movement command for the
    specified bot. This object can be queued or processed by the bot's AI system to
    execute the actual movement.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of MoveToPosition
    code: 'int botId = 12345;

      int position[3] = {100, 200, 300};

      uint32 time = getGameTime();

      BotAction action = BotAction::MoveToPosition(botId, position, time);

      // Queue the action for execution

      botAI->AddAction(action);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot is already initialized and active within
    the game world. The pos parameter must contain valid coordinate values that are
    within the bounds of the current map. Movement actions may be delayed or overridden
    by other higher-priority AI commands.
  warnings: Incorrectly formatted position data can cause movement failures or unexpected
    behavior. Ensure that the bot identifier is valid and that the timestamp reflects
    a reasonable future time to avoid immediate execution conflicts.
