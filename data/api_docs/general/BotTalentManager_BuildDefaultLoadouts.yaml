documentation:
  brief: Initializes and sets up default talent loadouts for all bot characters managed
    by the manager.
  description: The BuildDefaultLoadouts method is responsible for constructing and
    assigning predefined talent loadouts to all bot characters within the system.
    This method typically runs during initialization or when a new bot is added to
    ensure that each bot has a standardized set of talents based on their class, specialization,
    and role. It may also handle loading default configurations from database entries
    or hardcoded templates, depending on the implementation details of the BotTalentManager.
    The method does not return any value but modifies internal state to reflect the
    applied loadouts.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotTalentManager talentManager;

      talentManager.BuildDefaultLoadouts();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked once during system startup or when initializing
    a new bot instance. It assumes that the necessary data structures and templates
    for bot talents are already available in memory or loaded from persistent storage.
