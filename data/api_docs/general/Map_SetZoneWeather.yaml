api:
  class: Map
  method: SetZoneWeather
  signature: void Map::SetZoneWeather(uint32 zoneId, WeatherState weatherId, float
    intensity)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the weather conditions for a specific zone in the game world.
  description: The SetZoneWeather method allows developers to control the weather
    state of a particular zone within the game world. This method is used to set or
    modify the weather conditions, including intensity and type, for a specified zone
    ID. It is typically used in conjunction with other weather-related APIs to manage
    environmental effects in different zones. The method affects the zone's weather
    system and can be used to create dynamic weather changes that impact gameplay
    mechanics such as visibility, movement, and player experience.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the zone for which the weather is being
      set. This parameter defines the specific area in the game world where the weather
      conditions will be applied.
  - name: weatherId
    description: The type of weather condition to apply, such as rain, snow, or clear
      skies. This parameter determines the weather state that will be set for the
      zone.
  - name: intensity
    description: The intensity level of the weather condition, ranging from 0.0 to
      1.0. This parameter controls how strong or weak the weather effect is within
      the zone.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Weather Setting Example
    code: 'Map* map = World::GetMap();

      map->SetZoneWeather(1234, WEATHER_STATE_RAIN, 0.5f);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Weather Control Example
    code: 'Map* map = World::GetMap();

      map->SetZoneWeather(5678, WEATHER_STATE_SNOW, 1.0f);

      // This sets the zone to full snow intensity

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used by developers or scripters to dynamically modify
    weather conditions in specific zones. It should be used carefully as it can affect
    player experience and gameplay mechanics. The method may not immediately update
    the weather for all players, depending on how the game handles zone-based weather
    updates.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to inconsistent weather states or
    unexpected behavior in zones. Care must be taken when setting intensity values,
    as values outside the valid range (0.0 to 1.0) may cause undefined behavior or
    errors in the weather system.
