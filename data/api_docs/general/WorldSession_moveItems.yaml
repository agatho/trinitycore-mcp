  class: WorldSession
  method: moveItems
  signature: void WorldSession::moveItems(Item *[] myItems, Item *[] hisItems)
documentation:
  brief: Moves items between two arrays of items, typically used for handling item
    transactions or transfers in the game world.
  description: The moveItems method is responsible for transferring items from one
    collection to another, commonly utilized during inventory management operations
    such as item swapping, trading, or moving items between different containers.
    This method likely handles the necessary updates to item ownership, container
    references, and associated game state changes required for a successful item transfer.
    The method operates on arrays of Item pointers, suggesting it may be used in scenarios
    where multiple items are being moved simultaneously rather than individually.
    It is typically invoked during player interactions involving item manipulation
    within the World of Warcraft game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: myItems
    description: An array of Item pointers representing the source items to be moved
      from the current session's perspective
  - name: hisItems
    description: An array of Item pointers representing the destination items to be
      moved to another session or container
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Moving items between player inventories
    code: 'Item* sourceItems[2] = {player1->GetItemByPos(0, 0), player1->GetItemByPos(0,
      1)};

      Item* targetItems[2] = {player2->GetItemByPos(0, 0), player2->GetItemByPos(0,
      1)};

      worldSession->moveItems(sourceItems, targetItems);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal validation of item states and container
    references before moving items. It may also trigger game events or update client
    UI to reflect the item movement. The method assumes that both arrays contain valid
    Item pointers and that appropriate permissions are checked before execution.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method with items that have special
    properties or are bound to specific players, as improper handling could result
    in item loss or invalid game state. Ensure all item references are valid before
    calling to prevent undefined behavior.
