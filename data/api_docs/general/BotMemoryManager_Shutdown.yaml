  method: Shutdown
  signature: void BotMemoryManager::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the bot memory manager, releasing all allocated resources and
    cleaning up internal data structures.
  description: The Shutdown method is responsible for gracefully terminating the BotMemoryManager's
    operations. It releases all dynamically allocated memory, clears internal caches,
    and ensures that no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur. This method should
    be called before the application exits or when the bot system needs to be temporarily
    disabled. The shutdown process typically involves iterating through all managed
    bot entries, freeing their associated memory, and resetting internal state variables
    to ensure a clean restart is possible. This method is essential for maintaining
    stable performance and preventing resource exhaustion in long-running TrinityCore
    instances with active bot systems.

  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'BotMemoryManager* memoryManager = BotMemoryManager::Instance();

      memoryManager->Shutdown();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    server shutdown or when disabling bot functionality. It's important to ensure
    no active bot operations are running before calling Shutdown to avoid potential
    race conditions or data corruption.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown while bots are actively processing commands may lead
    to undefined behavior or memory corruption. Always ensure all bot threads are
    properly terminated before invoking this method.
