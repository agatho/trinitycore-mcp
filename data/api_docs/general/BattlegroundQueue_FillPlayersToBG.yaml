api:
  class: BattlegroundQueue
  method: FillPlayersToBG
  signature: void BattlegroundQueue::FillPlayersToBG(Battleground * bg, int bracket_id)
documentation:
  brief: Fills a battleground with queued players based on the specified bracket ID.
  description: The FillPlayersToBG method is responsible for populating a battleground
    instance with players who have been queued for that specific battleground type
    and bracket. It manages the process of moving players from the queue system into
    active battleground participation, ensuring proper team distribution and player
    assignment according to the game's balancing rules. This method is typically invoked
    during battleground matching and initialization phases when it's time to form
    actual battlegrounds from the waiting players in the queue.
  parameters:
  - name: bg
    description: Pointer to the Battleground object that will be filled with players.
      Must not be null.
  - name: bracket_id
    description: Identifier for the bracket level used to determine which queued players
      should be added to this battleground. This corresponds to specific battleground
      types and difficulty levels.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in battleground initialization
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->CreateBattleground(\"wsg\");\nif (bg)\n\
      {\n    sBattlegroundQueue->FillPlayersToBG(bg, 0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Filling a battleground with players from specific bracket
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattlegroundTemplate(123);\nif\
      \ (bg && bg->IsArena())\n{\n    sBattlegroundQueue->FillPlayersToBG(bg, 2);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the battleground instance has already been properly
    initialized and is ready to accept players. The bracket_id parameter determines
    which group of queued players will be selected for this battleground, typically
    corresponding to different player level ranges or arena team sizes.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or uninitialized battleground pointer
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the battleground object
    is valid and properly configured before invoking this method.
