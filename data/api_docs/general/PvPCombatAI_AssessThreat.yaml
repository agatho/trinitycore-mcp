  signature: ThreatAssessment PvPCombatAI::AssessThreat(int * player, int * target)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates the threat level of the player against a target in PvP combat.
  description: The AssessThreat method determines the current threat assessment between
    the AI-controlled unit and its target within a PvP context. It analyzes various
    factors such as damage dealt, aggro generation, and combat state to return a structured
    threat evaluation. This assessment is crucial for determining AI behavior decisions
    like switching targets, maintaining or reducing threat, or initiating specific
    combat actions. The method operates on the assumption that both player and target
    are valid entities within the same PvP encounter.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a ThreatAssessment enum value indicating the relative threat level.
    Possible values may include THREAT_LOW, THREAT_MEDIUM, THREAT_HIGH, or THREAT_CRITICAL,
    depending on how the AI evaluates the current combat situation and the player's
    threat contribution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Assessment Usage
    code: "ThreatAssessment assessment = ai->AssessThreat();\nif (assessment == THREAT_HIGH)\
      \ {\n    // Player is generating high threat, consider switching targets\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active PvP combat scenarios where
    both player and target are engaged. The assessment may vary dynamically based
    on real-time combat events such as damage dealt or healing received.
  warnings: Ensure that the AI unit and its target are properly initialized and in
    a valid PvP state before calling this method, otherwise the result may be undefined
    or misleading.
