  class: AreaTrigger
  method: GetTimeToTargetScale
  signature: uint32 AreaTrigger::GetTimeToTargetScale() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the time required for an area trigger to reach its
    target scale.
  description: The GetTimeToTargetScale method computes the duration in milliseconds
    that an area trigger will take to transition from its current scale to its target
    scale. This is commonly used in World of Warcraft's spell and effect systems where
    area triggers need to smoothly animate their size changes over time. The returned
    value represents the total time needed for the scaling animation, which can be
    used by the game engine to manage timing of associated effects or events. This
    method typically relies on internal state variables such as current scale, target
    scale, and scaling speed.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the time in milliseconds required for the area
    trigger to reach its target scale. Returns 0 if no scaling transition is active
    or if the current and target scales are identical.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 timeToScale = areaTrigger->GetTimeToTargetScale();\nif (timeToScale\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Schedule a callback or event to occur after the scaling completes\n\
      \    sWorld->ScheduleEvent([areaTrigger]() {\n        // Handle completion logic\
      \ here\n    }, timeToScale);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Effects
    code: "void ApplyAreaTriggerEffect(AreaTrigger* trigger)\n{\n    uint32 scaleTime\
      \ = trigger->GetTimeToTargetScale();\n    if (scaleTime > 0)\n    {\n      \
      \  // Delay spell effect until scaling is complete\n        trigger->SetSpellEffectDelay(scaleTime);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Execute immediately if no scaling is needed\n\
      \        trigger->ExecuteSpellEffects();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the area trigger's update cycle. The
    result may vary depending on the current scaling parameters and animation settings.
    It's important to note that this value represents only the scaling transition
    time, not the total duration of the entire area trigger effect.
  warnings: Calling this method on a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. Ensure
    proper validation before calling. Also, the returned value is in milliseconds,
    so be careful with integer overflow if dealing with very long durations.
