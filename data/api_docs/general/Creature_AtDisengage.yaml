documentation:
  brief: Disengages the creature from combat, ending any ongoing attacks.
  description: The AtDisengage method removes a creature from combat state by ending
    all current attacks and clearing the creature's threat list. This method is typically
    used when a creature needs to break off from combat or when a player wants to
    disengage from combat with a creature. It effectively stops any ongoing melee
    attacks and resets the creature's combat state, allowing it to return to its normal
    behavior or movement patterns.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->AtDisengage();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it may affect combat mechanics and
    threat management. The creature's behavior after disengagement depends on its
    AI script and current state.
