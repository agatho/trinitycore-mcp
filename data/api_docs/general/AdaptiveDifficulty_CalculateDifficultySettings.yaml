api:
  class: AdaptiveDifficulty
  method: CalculateDifficultySettings
  signature: DifficultySettings AdaptiveDifficulty::CalculateDifficultySettings(float
    playerSkill, float targetDifficulty)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates adaptive difficulty settings based on player skill and target
    difficulty for dynamic content adjustment.
  description: The CalculateDifficultySettings method computes adjusted difficulty
    parameters for game content based on the player's skill level and the intended
    target difficulty. This adaptive system ensures that challenges remain appropriately
    matched to player capabilities, enhancing engagement and progression. The method
    takes into account various factors such as player experience, gear level, and
    performance metrics to dynamically modify difficulty settings in real-time. It
    is typically used in scenarios where content scaling is required, such as dungeon
    encounters, battlegrounds, or raid instances.
  parameters:
  - name: playerSkill
    description: A floating-point value representing the player's skill level or capability,
      typically normalized between 0.0 (beginner) and 1.0 (expert). Higher values
      indicate more experienced players.
  - name: targetDifficulty
    description: A floating-point value indicating the intended difficulty level of
      the content, usually ranging from 0.0 (easy) to 1.0 (hard). This represents
      the base difficulty before adaptive adjustments are applied.
  returns: Returns a DifficultySettings object containing the calculated adjusted
    difficulty parameters including scaled health, damage, experience rewards, and
    other relevant game mechanics modifiers based on player skill and target difficulty.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for calculating adaptive difficulty
    code: 'DifficultySettings settings = difficultyCalculator.CalculateDifficultySettings(0.75f,
      0.9f);

      // Player has moderate skill (75%) and target is hard content (90%)

      // Returns adjusted settings suitable for this player''s capability'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using calculated difficulty in a dungeon encounter
    code: 'float playerSkill = GetPlayerSkillLevel(player);

      float targetDifficulty = GetDungeonDifficulty();

      DifficultySettings adaptiveSettings = AdaptiveDifficulty::CalculateDifficultySettings(playerSkill,
      targetDifficulty);

      ApplyDifficultyModifiers(adaptiveSettings);

      // Adjusts enemy stats and rewards dynamically based on player''s actual skill
      level'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently during gameplay to provide
    real-time difficulty adjustments. The implementation may cache intermediate calculations
    for performance optimization. The returned DifficultySettings object should not
    be modified directly but rather used as-is for applying game mechanics changes.
  warnings: Ensure that playerSkill and targetDifficulty values are properly normalized
    before calling this method, as unexpected ranges could lead to incorrect difficulty
    scaling. Avoid calling this method in high-frequency loops without proper caching
    mechanisms.
