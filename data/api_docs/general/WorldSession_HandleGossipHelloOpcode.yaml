  brief: Handles the player's interaction with an NPC to initiate a gossip dialog.
  description: The HandleGossipHelloOpcode method processes the client's request to
    open a gossip dialog with an NPC. When a player clicks on an NPC that has gossip
    options, this method is invoked to retrieve and send the appropriate gossip menu
    to the client. It validates the NPC's existence and ensures the player can interact
    with it before proceeding. The method typically triggers the display of quest
    information, vendor items, or other interactive options associated with the NPC.

    code: "void WorldSession::HandleGossipHelloOpcode(WorldPackets::NPC::Hello& packet)\n\
      {\n    if (Player* player = GetPlayer())\n    {\n        if (Creature* creature\
      \ = GetPlayer()->GetNPCIfCanInteractWith(packet.Guid, UNIT_NPC_FLAG_NONE))\n\
      \        {\n            // Send gossip menu\n            player->OnGossipHello(creature);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is part of the core NPC interaction system in TrinityCore. It
    relies on proper validation of the NPC GUID and ensures that only valid interactions
    are processed. The method should be called from within the network packet handling
    loop.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method may lead to clients not receiving gossip
    menus or causing disconnects. Ensure that all NPC interaction checks are performed
    before calling this method.
