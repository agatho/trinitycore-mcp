  signature: bool AdaptiveBehaviorManager::ShouldConserveMana() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the AI should conserve mana during spell casting.
  description: The ShouldConserveMana method evaluates the current state of the AI-controlled
    unit to decide if it should prioritize mana conservation over aggressive spell
    usage. This decision is typically based on factors such as available mana, current
    threat level, and the AI's configured behavior settings. When this method returns
    true, the AI will avoid casting spells that consume significant amounts of mana
    unless absolutely necessary for survival or combat effectiveness.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI should conserve mana, false otherwise. A return
    value of true indicates that the AI is in a state where it should prioritize mana
    efficiency over spell usage.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (ai->ShouldConserveMana())\n{\n    // Avoid casting high-mana spells\n\
      \    // Switch to lower-mana alternatives\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Selection Logic
    code: "class MyAI : public ScriptedAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override\n    {\n        if (me->GetAI()->ShouldConserveMana())\n        {\n\
      \            // Select mana-efficient spells only\n            DoCast(me, SPELL_MANA_CONSERVING_SPELL);\n\
      \        }\n        else\n        {\n            // Cast full-power spells\n\
      \            DoCastVictim(SPELL_POWERFUL_SPELL);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI decision-making cycles to influence
    spell selection logic. The implementation may consider unit's current mana percentage,
    target threat level, and configured behavior flags. It is important to note that
    this method does not directly control mana usage but rather provides a signal
    for the AI to adjust its behavior accordingly.
  warnings: Do not use this method as a direct indicator of low mana; instead, rely
    on it for strategic decision-making. Misusing this flag could lead to inefficient
    spell usage or unexpected AI behavior during combat.
