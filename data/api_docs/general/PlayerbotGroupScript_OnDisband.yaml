  class: PlayerbotGroupScript
  method: OnDisband
  signature: void PlayerbotGroupScript::OnDisband(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a player group is disbanded in the game.
  description: The OnDisband method is invoked when a player group (such as a raid
    or party) is disbanded, either manually by the group leader or automatically due
    to player logout or other conditions. This method allows scripts to perform cleanup
    operations, notify other systems, or modify player behavior upon group dissolution.
    It serves as a hook for custom bot logic that needs to respond to group disbanding
    events, particularly in playerbot scenarios where automated behavior must adapt
    to changing group dynamics.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object that is being disbanded. This parameter
      provides access to group members, leader information, and other group-related
      data at the time of disbanding.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a custom script
    code: "class MyPlayerbotScript : public PlayerbotGroupScript {\npublic:\n    void\
      \ OnDisband(Group* group) override {\n        // Log that the group was disbanded\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Group disbanded: %u\", group->GetId());\n       \
      \ \n        // Perform cleanup tasks for each member\n        for (uint8 i =\
      \ 0; i < group->GetMembersCount(); ++i) {\n            Group::MemberSlot* slot\
      \ = group->GetMemberSlot(i);\n            if (slot)\n                sLog->outString(\"\
      Cleaning up member: %s\", slot->name.c_str());\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the group destruction phase, so any
    access to group members or data should be done carefully as the group structure
    may already be partially invalidated. It's recommended to cache necessary information
    before performing operations that might rely on the group's integrity.
  warnings: Avoid modifying the group object directly within this method, as it may
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also, be cautious of potential race conditions
    if multiple threads are involved in group management.
