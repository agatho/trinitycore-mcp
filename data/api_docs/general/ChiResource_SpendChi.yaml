  class: ChiResource
  method: SpendChi
  signature: bool ChiResource::SpendChi(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Spends the specified amount of chi resources from the ChiResource object
    and returns true if successful.
  description: The SpendChi method attempts to deduct a given amount of chi resources
    from the current ChiResource object. This method is typically used in World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore framework for classes that utilize chi-based resource systems,
    such as Monks. The method performs validation to ensure sufficient chi is available
    before spending. If the requested amount exceeds the available chi, the operation
    will fail and return false without modifying the resource count. This method is
    essential for managing chi consumption during abilities, talents, or other game
    mechanics that require chi expenditure.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of chi resources to spend. Must be a non-negative integer
      value representing the amount of chi to deduct from the resource pool.
  returns: Returns true if the specified amount of chi was successfully deducted from
    the resource pool; returns false if there was insufficient chi available or if
    the operation failed for any other reason.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chi Spending
    code: "ChiResource chi;\nchi.SetChi(100); // Set initial chi\nbool success = chi.SpendChi(25);\
      \ // Spend 25 chi\nif (success)\n{\n    // Chi successfully spent\n    printf(\"\
      Spent 25 chi, remaining: %d\\n\", chi.GetChi());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Chi Spending
    code: "ChiResource chi;\nchi.SetChi(50);\nuint32 abilityCost = 75;\nif (chi.SpendChi(abilityCost))\n\
      {\n    // Ability can be cast\n    printf(\"Ability cast successfully\\n\");\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Not enough chi to cast ability\n    printf(\"Not enough chi\
      \ to cast ability\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ChiResource class which is commonly used in Monk
    class mechanics. The implementation likely includes checks for negative values
    and ensures resource integrity. It's recommended to always verify the return value
    before proceeding with actions that depend on successful chi spending.
  warnings: Do not call this method with a value greater than the current chi amount
    without checking first, as it may lead to inconsistent state or unexpected behavior
    in resource management systems.
