  class: MovementValidator
  method: IsIndoors
  signature: bool MovementValidator::IsIndoors(Map * map, const int & position) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given position is indoors within the specified map.
  description: The IsIndoors method evaluates whether a specific position, identified
    by its coordinates, is located indoors (such as inside a building or cave) rather
    than outdoors. This method is commonly used in movement validation logic to ensure
    that creatures or players are not moving into invalid or restricted indoor areas.
    It takes into account the map's terrain data and collision detection to make this
    determination. The method requires a valid Map object and a position identifier,
    which typically corresponds to a specific location within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: A pointer to the Map object representing the current game map where
      the position is located. This parameter must be non-null and valid for the method
      to function correctly.
  - name: position
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific position within the
      map. The exact meaning of this value depends on how positions are indexed or
      stored in the game's internal systems, but it typically corresponds to a unique
      coordinate or node identifier.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is indoors (e.g., inside a building
    or cave), and false if the position is outdoors. The method may also return false
    if the input parameters are invalid or if the position cannot be evaluated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a position is indoors
    code: "Map* myMap = ...; // Assume valid map object\nint positionId = 12345; //\
      \ Some position identifier\nbool isIndoor = MovementValidator::IsIndoors(myMap,\
      \ positionId);\nif (isIndoor) {\n    // Handle indoor movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal map data structures and collision detection
    systems. It may have performance implications when called frequently in tight
    loops or during high-frequency updates. Ensure that the Map object passed is valid
    and loaded before calling this method.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the 'map' parameter or an invalid 'position'
    identifier can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate inputs before
    invoking this method.
