  class: LootDistribution
  method: LootDistribution
  signature: void LootDistribution::LootDistribution()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new loot distribution instance for handling item drops in World
    of Warcraft.
  description: The LootDistribution constructor initializes a new loot distribution
    object used by TrinityCore's loot system to manage how items are distributed among
    players who have looted a specific object. This method sets up internal data structures
    required for tracking which players can receive loot, the items being distributed,
    and the distribution rules such as need-before-greed or free-for-all. The constructor
    typically gets called when a new loot event is created, often during creature
    death or game object interaction. It prepares the system to handle multiple players
    participating in the loot roll and ensures proper item assignment according to
    game rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new LootDistribution instance
    code: 'LootDistribution* lootDist = new LootDistribution();

      // This creates a new loot distribution object ready to manage item drops

      // for a specific looted entity such as a creature or game object.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically not called directly by developers but rather
    through the core loot system when a new loot event is initiated. The class likely
    manages internal state including player participation, item lists, and distribution
    methods. It may also initialize random number generators or other components needed
    for fair loot distribution.
  warnings: Developers should be aware that this constructor does not actually distribute
    items; it only initializes the object. Actual loot distribution occurs through
    separate methods like Distribute() or RollForItem(). Improper initialization can
    lead to undefined behavior during loot processing.
