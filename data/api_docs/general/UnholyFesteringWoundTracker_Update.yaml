  method: Update
  signature: void UnholyFesteringWoundTracker::Update(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the Unholy Festering Wound tracker state based on target data
  description: The Update method in UnholyFesteringWoundTracker is responsible for
    processing and maintaining the state of an unholy festering wound effect applied
    to a target. This method typically handles the logic for tracking damage over
    time, updating debuff stacks, and managing the duration of the effect. It interacts
    with the target parameter to determine current status and apply appropriate updates
    to the tracker's internal state. The method is commonly invoked during combat
    updates or when the affected unit takes damage.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's current state or
      health value. This parameter is used to determine how the festering wound effect
      should be updated based on the target's condition.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Usage
    code: 'int targetHealth = unit->GetHealth();

      unholyTracker->Update(&targetHealth);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Update Integration
    code: "void UnholyDeathKnight::OnCombatUpdate()\n{\n    if (festeringWoundTracker)\n\
      \    {\n        int targetHealth = GetVictim()->GetHealth();\n        festeringWoundTracker->Update(&targetHealth);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal tracker state variables such as damage
    ticks, stack counts, and remaining duration. It should be called regularly during
    combat updates to maintain accurate effect tracking. The target parameter may
    be modified by the method depending on implementation details.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method to
    prevent segmentation faults. The method assumes the target represents a valid
    unit in combat context.
