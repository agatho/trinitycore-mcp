documentation:
  brief: SendProficiency sends proficiency information to the player for a specific
    item class and subclass mask
  description: This method is used to inform the player about their proficiency in
    specific item classes and subclasses. It typically sends information related to
    weapon and armor proficiencies, allowing players to properly display their skill
    levels in various categories of items. The method is commonly used during character
    creation or when updating player's proficiency data after gaining new skills or
    equipment changes. This functionality is essential for maintaining accurate gameplay
    mechanics within World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: itemClass
    description: Represents the item class (e.g., Weapon, Armor) that the proficiency
      information relates to. Valid values include ItemClass::ITEM_CLASS_WEAPON, ItemClass::ITEM_CLASS_ARMOR,
      etc.
  - name: itemSubclassMask
    description: Represents a bitmask of item subclasses within the specified item
      class. Each bit corresponds to a specific subclass (e.g., 1 for Cloth, 2 for
      Leather, 4 for Mail, 8 for Plate). This allows players to receive detailed proficiency
      information for multiple subclasses simultaneously.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SendProficiency(ItemClass::ITEM_CLASS_WEAPON, 0x0F); // Send proficiency
      for weapons with subclasses 1,2,4,8'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      uint32 mask = 0x0F;

      player->SendProficiency(ItemClass::ITEM_CLASS_ARMOR, mask);

      // Send armor proficiency for subclasses 1,2,4,8 (Cloth, Leather, Mail, Plate)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore to manage player's
    proficiency data. It may be called during character creation or when updating
    skill levels. The implementation involves sending specific packets to the client
    that contain proficiency information for various item classes and subclasses.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect display of player's
    proficiency information, potentially causing confusion in gameplay mechanics.
    Care must be taken when setting itemSubclassMask values to ensure correct bitwise
    operations.
