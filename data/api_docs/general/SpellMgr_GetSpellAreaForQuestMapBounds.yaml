    quest_id) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell area requirements associated with a specific quest ID
    from the database.
  description: This method fetches all spell area records linked to a given quest
    identifier. It is used internally by the TrinityCore server to determine which
    spells are required or applicable for specific quests, particularly in relation
    to quest gating and area-based spell activation. The returned SpellAreaForQuestMapBounds
    object contains a collection of spell area entries that define conditions under
    which certain spells become available or active based on quest completion status
    and player location within defined areas.
  parameters: []
  returns: A SpellAreaForQuestMapBounds container holding all spell area records associated
    with the specified quest ID. This structure typically includes multiple SpellArea
    objects, each representing a unique combination of spell, area, and quest requirements.
    Returns an empty container if no spell area entries are found for the given quest.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve spell areas for a quest
    code: "uint32 questId = 12345;\nSpellAreaForQuestMapBounds bounds = sSpellMgr->GetSpellAreaForQuestMapBounds(questId);\n\
      for (auto& spellArea : bounds)\n{\n    // Process each spell area entry\n  \
      \  uint32 spellId = spellArea->spellId;\n    uint32 areaId = spellArea->areaId;\n\
      \    // ... perform logic based on spell and area requirements\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup in the SpellArea database table using the provided
    quest ID. The returned container is typically used during quest validation and
    spell activation checks. It's important to note that this returns a map-like structure
    which may contain multiple entries if a single quest has several related spell
    areas defined.
  warnings: The returned SpellAreaForQuestMapBounds object should not be modified
    directly as it represents data from the database cache. Modifications could lead
    to inconsistent behavior or unexpected results in quest and spell activation logic.
