  signature: float SpellCastTargets::GetSpeed() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the speed value associated with the spell cast targets.
  description: The GetSpeed method retrieves the movement speed factor applied to
    a spell's casting or projectile behavior. This value is typically used in spell
    calculations to determine how fast a spell travels from its source to its target,
    or how quickly the caster moves during the casting process. The returned float
    value represents a multiplier that modifies base spell speeds, where 1.0 indicates
    normal speed, values greater than 1.0 increase speed, and values less than 1.0
    decrease it. This method is commonly used in conjunction with spell effects that
    involve movement or projectile-based attacks.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the speed multiplier for spell casting or projectile
    movement. Typically ranges from 0.0 (no movement) to positive values indicating
    speed modifications. A return value of 0.0 may indicate an invalid or unset speed
    configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use spell cast speed
    code: "SpellCastTargets targets;\nfloat speed = targets.GetSpeed();\nif (speed\
      \ > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Apply speed to spell movement calculations\n    float adjustedDistance\
      \ = baseDistance * speed;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell execution or target validation
    phases in TrinityCore's spell system. The returned value may be influenced by
    caster state, spell modifiers, or environmental factors such as movement impairments
    or haste effects.
