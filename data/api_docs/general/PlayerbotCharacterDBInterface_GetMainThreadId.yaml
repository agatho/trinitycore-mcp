  method: GetMainThreadId
  signature: std::thread::id PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface::GetMainThreadId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the thread identifier of the main thread used for character database
    operations in playerbot functionality.
  description: The GetMainThreadId method retrieves the unique identifier of the main
    thread that handles character database interactions within the PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface
    class. This is typically used to ensure thread safety and proper synchronization
    when accessing shared database resources. The returned std::thread::id can be
    compared against other thread identifiers to verify execution context, particularly
    in multi-threaded environments where playerbot systems interact with the game's
    database. This method is essential for maintaining consistency in database access
    patterns and preventing race conditions in concurrent operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::thread::id object representing the unique identifier of the main
    thread responsible for character database operations. This identifier can be used
    for thread comparison and synchronization purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Thread Identification Check
    code: "#include <iostream>\n\nvoid CheckMainThread()\n{\n    PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface\
      \ dbInterface;\n    std::thread::id mainThreadId = dbInterface.GetMainThreadId();\n\
      \    \n    if (std::this_thread::get_id() == mainThreadId)\n    {\n        std::cout\
      \ << \"Currently executing on main thread\" << std::endl;\n    }\n    else\n\
      \    {\n        std::cout << \"Executing on a different thread\" << std::endl;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the playerbot system to maintain
    proper thread context when performing database operations. The returned thread
    identifier should be cached if frequently accessed, as retrieving it repeatedly
    may have minor performance implications. This interface is part of TrinityCore's
    playerbot framework and requires proper initialization before use.
  warnings: Do not rely on this method for determining thread safety in all contexts
    - always ensure proper locking mechanisms are in place when accessing shared resources.
    The returned thread ID should only be used for comparison purposes, not for direct
    manipulation or thread control.
